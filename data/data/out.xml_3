Shoot me! 
Shoot me! 
Here come old flat top, 
He come growing up slowly, 
He got jo jo eyeball, 
He one holy roller, 
He got hair down to his knee. 
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please. 
Shoot me!! 
Shoot me! 
Shoot me! 
Shoot me! 
He wear no shoeshine, 
He got monkey fingers, 
He got hairy arsehole, 
He one holy roller, 
He say, "i know you, you know me. 
One thing i can tell you is you got to be free." 
Come together, 
Right now, 
Over me. 
He bag production, 
He got walrus gumboot, 
He ono sideboard, 
He one spinal cracker 
He got feet down below his knees 
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease. 
Come together, 
Right now, 
Over you. 
(shoot!) 
(shoot!) 
(shoot!) 
Ow! 
(shoot!) 
He roller coaster, 
He got early warning, 
He got muddy water, 
He one mojo filter, 
He say, "one and one and one is three." 
Got to be good looking, he's so hard to see. 
Come together, 
Right now, 
Stop the war! 
(shoot) 
(shoot) 
Come together, 
Come together, 
Come together, right! 
Come together, hey! 
Come together.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You can shine your shoes and wear a suit 
You can comb your hair and look quite cute 
You can hide your face behind a smile 
One thing you can't hide 
Is when you're crippled inside 
You can wear a mask and paint your face 
You can call yourself the human race 
You can wear a collar and a tie 
One thing you can't hide 
Is when you're crippled inside 
Well now you know that your 
Cat has nine lives 
Nine lives to itself 
But you only got one 
And a dog's life ain't fun 
Mamma take a look outside 
You can go to church and sing a hymn 
You can judge me by the color of my skin 
You can live a lie until you die 
One thing you can't hide 
Is when you're crippled inside 
Well now you know that your 
Cat has nine lives 
Nine lives to itself 
But you only got one 
And a dog's life ain't fun 
Mamma take a look outside 
You can go to church and sing a hymn 
You can judge me by the color of my skin 
You can live a lie until you die

Even when I'm miles at sea 
And nowhere is the place to be 
Your spirit's watching over me dear Yoko 
Even when I watch T.V. 
There's a hole where you're supposed to be 
There's nobody lying next to me dear Yoko 
Oh Yoko 
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go

Without I'm a one track mind dear Yoko

The two of us are really one 
The goddess really smiled upon our love dear Yoko.</field>

Happy Xmas John 
So this is Christmas 
And what have you done 
Another year over 
And a new one just begun 
And so this is Christmas 
I hope you'll have fun 
The near and the dear one 
The old and the young 
A very Merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year 
Let's hope it's a good one 
Without any fear 
And, so this is Christmas 
For weak and for strong 
For rich and the poor ones 
The world is so wrong 
And so happy Christmas 
For black and for white 
For yellow and red ones 
Let's stop all the fight 
A very Merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year 
Let's hope it's a good one 
Without any fear 
And so this is Christmas 
And what have we done 
Another year over 
A new one just begun 
And, so happy Christmas 
We hope you have fun 
The near and the dear one 
The old and the young 
A very Merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year 
Let's hope it's a good one 
Without any fear 
War is over, if you want it 
War is over, now 
Happy Christmas</field>

But it's getting easier now 
Hard times are over, over for awhile 
The leaves are shining in the sun 
And I'm smiling inside 
You and I watching each other on a street corner 
Cars and buses and planes and people go by 
But we don't care 
We want to know 
We want to know in each other's eyes 
That hard times are over, over for some time 
Hard times are over 
Hard times are over 
Hard times are over, over for awhile 
It's been very rough 
It's getting easier now 
Hard times are over, over for awhile 
The streams are twinkling in the sun 
And I'm smiling inside 
You and I walking together 'round the street corner 
Hard times are over 
Hard times are over 
Hard times are over, over for awhile 
Hard times are over 
Hard times are over 
Hard times are over, over for awhile 
Hard times are over 
Hard times are over 
Hard times are over, over for awhile.</field>

I'm not so self assured 
Now I find I've changed my mind 
I've opened up the doors 
Help me if you can I'm feeling down 
And I do appreciate you being 'round 
Help me get my feet back on the ground 
Won't you please, please help me? 
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways 
My independence seems to vanish in the haze 
But every now and then I feel so insecure 
I know that I just need you 
Like I've never done before 
Help me if you can I'm feeling down 
And I do appreciate you being 'round 
Help me get my feet back on the ground 
Won't you please, please help me?

You better see right through that mother's eyes 
Those freaks was right 
When they said you was dead 
The one mistake you made was in your head 
Ah, how do you sleep? 
Ah, how do you sleep at night? 
You live with straights who tell you you was king 
Jump when your momma tell you anything 
The only thing you done was yesterday 
And since you're gone you're just another day 
Ah, how do you sleep? 
Ah, how do you sleep at night? 
Ah, how do you sleep? 
Ah, how do you sleep at night? 
A pretty face may last a year or two 
But pretty soon they'll see what you can do 
The sound you make is muzak to my ears 
You must have learned something in all those years 
Ah, how do you sleep? 
Ah, how do you sleep at night?</field>

No! 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
Now that I showed you what I been through 
Don't take nobody's word what you can do 
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky 
Now that I found out I know I can cry 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand 
Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man 
I heard something 'bout my Ma and my Pa 
They didn't want me so they made me a star 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you 
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do 
Keep you occupied with pie in the sky 
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
I seen through junkies, I been through it all 
I seen religion from Jesus to Paul 
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine 
No one can harm you, feel your own pain 
I, I found out! 
I, I found this out! 
I, I found out!.</field>

I am only learning 
To tell the trees from the wood

And I know where it's coming from 
And I know and I'm sorry (yes I am) 
But I never could speak my mind 
And I know just how you feel 
And I know now what I have done 
And I know and I'm guilty (yes I am) 
But I never could read your mind 
I know what I was missing 
But now my eyes can see 
I put myself in your place 
As you did for me 
Today I love you more than yesterday 
Right now I love you more right now 
And I know what's coming down 
I can feel where it's coming from 
And I know it's getting better (all the time)

Late in the afternoon 
What am I doing here at all? 
Ain't no doubt about it 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Somehow the wires got crossed 
Communication's lost 
Can't even get you on the telephone 
Just got to shout about it 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Well, here in the valley of indecision 
I don't know what to do 
I feel you slipping away 
I feel you slipping away 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Well now, you say you're not getting enough 
But I remind you of all that bad, bad, bad stuff 
So what the hell am I supposed to do? 
Just put a bandaid on it? 
And stop the bleeding now 
Stop the bleeding now 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Well, well, well 
I know I hurt you then 
But hell, that was way back when 
Well, do you still have to carry that cross? (drop it) 
Don't want to hear about it 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Don't want to lose you now

            <field name="lyrics">My intentions are good, I use my intuition 
It takes me for a ride 
But I never understood other people's superstitions 
It seemed like suicide 
As I play the game of life 
I try to make it better each and every day 
And when I struggle in the night 
The magic of the music seems to light the way 
Ah, intuition takes me there 
Intuition takes me everywhere 
Well my instincts are fine 
I had to learn to use them in order to survive 
And time after time confirmed an old suspition 
It's good to be alive 
And when I'm deep down and out and lose communication 
With nothing left to say 
It's then I realize it's only a condition 
Of seeing things that way 
Ah, Intuition takes me there 
Intuition takes me anywhere 
(Takes me anywhere, alright) 
Ah, Intuition takes me there 
Intuition takes me there 
Intuition takes me there 
Intuition takes me there 
Intuition takes me there 
Intuition takes me there</field>

            <field name="lyrics">People say we got it made 
Don't they know we're so afraid? 
Isolation 
We're afraid to be alone 
Everybody got to have a home 
Isolation 
Just a boy and a little girl 
Trying to change the whole wide world 
Isolation 
The world is just a little town 
Everybody trying to put us down 
Isolation 
I don't expect you to understand 
After you've caused so much pain 
But then again, you're not to blame 
You're just a human, a victim of the insane 
We're afraid of everyone 
Afraid of the sun 
Isolation 
The sun will never disappear 
But the world may not have many years 
Isolation.</field>

Shooting gooks in Vietnam 
If he was the CIA 
Selling dope and making hay

Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta...

They gave him ten for two 
They got Ali Otis too. 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta... 
Gotta set him free 
Was he jailed for what he done? 
Or representing everyone 
Free John now, if we can 
From the clutches of the man 
Let him be, lift the lid 
Bring him to his wife and kids 
They gave him ten for two

It's like that first summer I spent in Egypt 
It's like that warm evening you read to me 
Both knowing deeply 
That it's a good time, a good time for us 
Thank you, thank you, thank you 
Let me count the ways how I see you 
It's like that lake in the mountain you heard about 
It's like that autumn sky that stays so blue 
It's like that air around me that holds me gently 
Whispering strongly that you're always there, always for me 
Thank you, thank you, thank you.</field>

Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind 
Yeah we're playing those mind games forever 
Projecting our images in space and in time 
Yes is the answer and you know that for sure 
Yes is surrender, you got to let it, you got to let it go

Doing the ritual dance in the sun

Tried to shake our image 
Just a cycling through the Village 
But found that we had left it back in London 
Well nobody came to bug us 
Hustle us or shove us

Nobody sees you when you're on cloud nine 
Everybody's hustlin' for a buck and a dime 
I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine 
I've been across to the other side 
I've shown you everything, I got nothing to hide 
And still you ask me do I love you, what it is, what it is 
All I can tell you is it's all show biz 
All I can tell you is it's all show biz 
Nobody loves you when you're down and out 
Nobody knows you when you're on cloud nine 
Everybody's hustlin' for a buck and a dime 
I'll scratch your back and you knife mine 
I've been across the water now so many times 
I've seen the one eyed witchdoctor leading the blind 
And still you ask me do I love you, what you say, what you say 
Everytime I put my finger on it, it slips away 
Everytime I put my finger on it, it slips away 
Well I get up in the morning 
And I'm looking in the mirror to see, ooo wee! 
Then I'm lying in the darkness 
And I know I can't get to sleep, ooo wee! 
Nobody loves you when you're old and grey 
Nobody needs you when you're upside down 
Everybody's hollerin' 'bout their own birthday 
Everybody loves you when you're six foot in the ground</field>

Everybody's making love and no one really cares 
There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs 
Always something happening and nothing going on 
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot 
They're starving back in China so finish what you got 
Nobody told me there'd be days like these 
Nobody told me there'd be days like these 
Nobody told me there'd be days like these 
Strange days indeed -- strange days indeed 
Everybody's runnin' and no one makes a move 
Everyone's a winner and nothing left to lose 
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Katmandu 
Everybody's flying and no one leaves the ground 
Everybody's crying and no one makes a sound 
There's a place for us in the movies you just gotta lay around 
Nobody told me there'd be days like these 
Nobody told me there'd be days like these 
Nobody told me there'd be days like these 
Strange days indeed -- most peculiar, mama 
Everybody's smoking and no one's getting high 
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky 
There's a UFO over New York and I ain't too surprised 
Nobody told me there'd be days like these 
Nobody told me there'd be days like these 
Nobody told me there'd be days like these 
Strange days indeed -- most peculiar, mama</field>

One day at a time is good for you 
You are my woman, I am your man 
Nothing else matters at all, now I understand 
That I'm the door and you're the key 
Every morning I wake in your smile 
Feeling your breath on my face and the love in your eyes 
Cause you're the honey and I'm the bee

You know you’re living by another’s rule when you’re looking upon the shelf 
When they say jump we have to question how high, how fast, and where 
We make them feel better if we just look confused and stare 
Though it ain’t nothing feeling you over and over again 
We somewhere lost the feeling though I don’t remember when 
Though it ain’t nothing feeling you over and over again 
We somewhere lost the feeling though I can’t remember when 
Again 
In a world full of liars we have to play their silly games 
As lovers we stand there never knowing what to say 
My clothes are off, my hair is down, my voice has nothing to say 
I’m not being a bitch, I’m not playing the fool, I’m just playing it your way 
Again 
Though it ain’t nothing feeling you over and over again 
We somewhere lost the feeling thought I can’t remember when 
This baby is crying for the silence that you have taken 
It has to be something feeling you over and over and over and over 
In time I’ll take the spotlight and you’ll question how I’ll act 
In a sweet little voice I’ll say how do you want me to act 
Baby this is my spotlight and this is my choice and I’m taking a chance for me 
I’ll do what I want but take me now that’s the only light I can see 
Though it ain’t nothing feeling you over and over again 
We somewhere lost the feeling thought I can’t remember when 
This baby is crying for the silence that you have taken 
It has to be something feeling you over and over and over and over and….. 
Feeling you over and over and over and….</field>

How people seemed so tall 
Always had their way 
Do you remember your Ma and Pa 
Just wishing for movie stardom 
Always, always playing a part 
If you ever feel so sad 
And the whole world is driving you mad 
Remember, remember, today

Just couldn't change it if i'd choose 
Don't tell me where your head is, man

Don't play the virgin mary 
We all know she's been kissed 
Rock and roll people, born to be the news 
Yeah, we're rock and roll people 
Just couldn't change it if i'd choose 
My father was a mother 
My mother was a son 
Don't play the mona lisa 
We've all been twenty-one 
Rock and roll people, born to be the news 
Yeah, the rock and roll people 
Just couldn't change it if i choose 
Don't ask me 'bout the time of day 
Or how much space i need 
Don't feed me dog for dinner 
We all know you get green 
Rock and roll people, born to be the news 
Yes, the rock and roll people 
Just couldn't change it if i choose

As the years roll away 
And the price that I paid 
And the straws slips away 
You don't have to suffer 
It is what it is 
No bell book or candle 
Can get you out of this, oh no! 
I'm scarred, I'm scarred, I'm scarred 
I'm scarred, uh huh 
I'm scarred, I'm scarred, I'm scarred 
Every day of my life 
I just manage to survive 
I just wanna stay alive 
You don't have to worry 
In heaven or hell 
Just dance to the music 
You do it so well, well, well! 
Hatred and jealousy, gonna be the death of me 
I guess I knew it right from the start 
Sing out about love and peace 
Don't wanna see the red raw meat 
The green eyed goddamn straight from your heart 
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired 
Of being so alone 
No place to call my own 
Like a rollin' stone.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Intro: 
You say you found Jesus Christ 
He's the only one 
You say you've found Buddha 
Sittin' in the sun 
You say you found Mohammed 
Facin' to the East 
You say you found Krishna 
Dancin' in the streets 
Well there's somethin' missing in this God Almighty stew 
And it's your mother (your mother, don't forget your mother, lad) 
You got to serve yourself 
Ain't nobody gonna do it for you 
You got to serve yourself 
Ain't nobody gonna do it for you 
Well you may believe in devils and you may believe in lords 
But if you don't go out and serve yourself, lad, ain't no room service here 
It's still the same old story 
A bloody Holy War 
A fight for love and glory 
Ain't gonna study war no more 
A fight for God and country 
We're gonna set you free 
We'll put you back in the Stone Age 
If you won't be like me - get it? 
You got to serve yourself 
Ain't nobody gonna do for you 
You got to serve yourself 
Ain't nobody gonna do for you 
Well you may believe in devils and you may believe in lords 
'But Christ, you're gonna have to serve yourself and that's all there is to it. 
So get right back here it's in the bloody fridge 
God, when I was a kid. 
Didn't have stuff like this, TV-fuckin' dinners and all that crap. 
You fuckin' kids are all the fuckin' same! Want a fuckin' car now... 
Lucky to have a pair of shoes!' 
You tell me you found Jesus Christ 
Well that's great and he's the only one 
You say you just found Buddha 
Sittin' on his ass in the sun 
You say you found Mohammed 
Kneeling on a bloody carpet facin' the East 
You say you found Krishna 
With a bald head dancin' in the street ('Well, Christ, now you're 
being heard') 
You got to serve yourself 
Ain't nobody gonna do for you 
You got to serve yourself 
Ain't nobody gonna do for you ('that's right, lad, you better get that straight 
into your fuckin' head') 
You got to serve yourself ('you know that, who else is gonna do it for you, it 
ain't me I tell you that') 
Well, you may believe in Jesus, and you may believe in Marx 
And you may believe in Marks and Spencer's and you may believe in bloody 
Woolworths 
But there's something missing in this whole bloody stew 
And it's your mother, your poor bloody mother ('she worked for you in the 
back bedroom, full of piss and shit and fuckin' midwives 
God, you can't 
forget that awful moment, you know 
You should have been in the bloody 
war, lad, and you would know all about it 
Well, I'll tell you something.') 
It's still the same old story 
A Holy bloody War, you know, with the Pope and all that stuff 
A fight for love and glory 
Ain't gonna study no more war 
A fight for God and country, and the Queen and all that 
We're gonna set you free 
Bomb you back into the fuckin' Stone Age 
If you won't be like me, you know, get down on your knees and pray 
Well there's somethin' missing in this God Almighty stew 
And it's your goddamn mother you dirty little git, now 
get in there and wash yer ears! 
 
 
NOTE: "[This song] was right after Dylan's song [...] "You 
Gotta Serve Someone", you know - the lord, I suppose, you know. 
So then he was kind of upset about that and it was a dialogue, 
you know 
In that sense it's fun, I mean you can hear it was 
fun 
He wasn't seriously against it 
He showed his anger in 
a way but also [...] his sense of humour." (Yoko Ono, 1998).</field>

saving up your money for a rainy day 
giving all your clothes to the charity 
last night the wife said "oh,boy when you're dead, 
you don't take nothing with you, but your soul, 
think!" 
made a lightning trip to Vienna 
eating chocolate cake in a bag 
the newspaper said "she's gone to his head, 
they look just like 2 gurus in drag" 
* 
caught the early plane back to London 
fifty acorns tied in a sack 
the men from the press said " we wish you success, 
It's good to have the both of you back"</field>

            <field name="lyrics">If you had the luck of the Irish 
You'd be sorry and wish you were dead 
You should have the luck of the Irish 
And you'd wish you was English instead! 
 
A thousand years of torture and hunger 
Drove the people away from their land 
A land full of beauty and wonder 
Was raped by the British brigands! Goddamn! Goddamn! 
 
If you could keep voices like flowers 
There'd be shamrock all over the world 
If you could drink dreams like Irish streams 
Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn 
 
In the 'Pool they told us the story 
How the English divided the land 
Of the pain, the death and the glory 
And the poets of auld Eireland 
 
If we could make chains with the morning dew 
The world would be like Galway Bay 
Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns 
The world would be one big Blarney stone 
 
Why the hell are the English there anyway? 
As they kill with God on their side 
Blame it all on the kids the IRA 
As the bastards commit genocide! Aye! Aye! Genocide! 
 
If you had the luck of the Irish 
You'd be sorry and wish you was dead 
You should have the luck of the Irish 
And you'd wish you was English instead! 
Yes you'd wish you was English instead!.</field>

By giving you no time instead of it all 
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all 
A working class hero is something to be

They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool 
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years 
Then they expect you to pick a career 
When you can't really function you're so full of fear 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV 
And you think you're so clever and classless and free 
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
There's room at the top they are telling you still 
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill 
If you want to be like the folks on the hill 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
If you want to be a hero well just follow me 
If you want to be a hero well just follow me.</field>

Lonely, wanna die.

Black cloud crossed my mind, 
Blue mist round my soul, 
Feel so suicidal, 
Even hate my rock and roll.

Hey! Hey! 
Well, you walk! 
You walk! 
New Jersey turnpike in the wee wee hours, 
I was rollin' slowly 'cause of drizzlin showers 
Here come a flat-top, he was movin' up with me, 
Then come waving goodbye in a little old souped up jitney 
I put my foot in the tank, I began to roll, 
Moanin' siren, 'twas the state patrol 
I let out my wings, then I blew my horn, 
Bye-bye, New Jersey, I become airborn 
Now you can't catch me, 
Baby, you can't catch me 
'cause if you get too close, 
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze 
Hey! 
Well, you walk! 
Yeah, walk! 
I bought a brand new airmobile, 
'twas a custom made, 'twas a flightning deal 
With a powerful motor and a hide away wing, 
Push in on the button, you will hear her sing 
Now you can't catch me, 
Baby, you can't catch me 
'cause if you get too close, 
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze 
Hey! Hey! 
Well, you walk! 
You walk! 
Flying with my baby last Saturday night, 
Wasn't a grey cloud floatin' in sight 
Big, full moon, shinin' up above, 
Cuddle up, honey, be my love 
Sweetest little thing that I ever seen, 
I'm gonna name you Maybellene 
Flying on the beam, set on flight control, 
Radio tuned to rock and roll 
Two, three hours passed us by, 
Altitude dropped into five-o-five 
Fuel consumption, way too fast, 
Let's get on home before we run out of gas 
Now you can't catch me, 
Baby, you can't catch me 
'cause if you get too close, 
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze 
Git it on! 
Yeah, walk! 
Git it on, git it on, git it on, do it! 
Git it on, git it on! 
You know you can't catch me!.</field>

This place inside my mind, 
A place I like to hide 
You don't know the chances 
What if I should die?! 
A place inside my brain, 
Another kind of pain 
You don't know the chances 
I'm so blind! 
Another place I find 
to escape the pain inside 
You don't know the chances 
What if I should die?! 
A place inside my brain, 
Another kind of pain 
You don't know the chances 
I'm so blind! 
Deeper and deeper and deeper 
as I journey to 
live a life that seems to be 
a lost reality 
that can never find, 
a way to reach my inner 
Self-esteem is low 
How deep can I go 
in the ground that I lay? 
If I don't find a way to see 
through the gray that clouds my mind. 
This time I look to see what's between the lines 
I can't see, I can't see, I'm going blind..

All in vain..

Sometimes I cannot take this place 
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste 
Sometimes I cannot feel my face 
You'll never see me fall from grace 
Something takes a part of me. 
You and I were meant to be. 
A cheap fuck for me to lay. 
Something takes a part of me. 
Feeling like a freak on a leash.

Feeling like I have no release.

Gotta a weird thing to show you 
So tell all the boys and girls 
Tell your brother, your sister and your momma too 
We 're about to go down 
And you know just what to do 
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care 
Glide by the people as they 
start to look and stare 
Do your dance, Do your dance 
Do your dance quick, mom

C'mon baby tell me what's the word 
Now, word up

When you hear the call you got to get it under way 
Word up

It's the call, word 
No matter where you say it 
You know that you'll be heard 
Now all you sucker Djs 
Who think you're fly 
There's got to be a reason 
And we know the reason why 
You try to put on those airs 
And act real cool 
But you got to realize 
That you're acting like fools 
If there's music, we can use it 
Be free to dance 
We don't have the time for psychological romance 
No romance, no romance 
No romance for me, mom

Day, is here fading

Screaming some sound 
Beating me, beating me

Into the ground

It's spinning round and round

It's lost and can't be found

My back's up against a wall 
Your magic spell 
Doesn't work anymore 
Kill me, kill me, that's what 
You've got to face, my friend (my friend) 
This ain't the end (the end) 
Why can't I relax and let it be true? 
This world that I tried to hide 
It's kind of a mess 
Too reckless for you 
This place makes me feel alive 
I'd love to see a different world 
A place where you can't find me 
Feel me! Kill me! 
My back's up against a wall 
Your magic spell 
Doesn't work anymore 
Kill me, kill me, that's what 
You've got to face, my friend (my friend) 
This ain't the end (the end) 
[Corey Taylor:] 
The call of the purpose 
The changing behaviour 
Ends at us all 
We keep constrains on the strangers 
It gets on top of you and forces your perspective 
Then you know it, you feel it 
It's as dark as you can get, you want it 
Harder! Harder! Harder! 
Give it to you 
Harder! Harder! 
You might just want it 
Harder! Harder! Harder! 
Give it to you 
Harder! Harder! 
Ever think you'll ever get it 
Feel me! Kill me! 
My back's up against a wall 
Your magic spell 
Doesn't work anymore 
Kill me, kill me, that's what 
You've got to face, my friend (my friend) 
This ain't the end (the end)</field>

Report to your local therapist! 
Report to your local church! 
Report to your local police department! 
It's goin' down! 
Glaring into my sons eyes 
Reveals a void 
I felt her in the day 
Insanity! 
It was all about the pussy, if you can get it 
A little girl like me never fucking liked it 
We ain't takin' no mo'! 
Go! 
So sing me, I, I 
I'm not fucking around 
Stop fucking with me 
And the children are born 
Your feeling through me, I, I 
You're the children of the Korn 
Droppin' smoke in the alley 
Makin' noise with a double pump 
Bring your boys turn up at a party with you doubled up 
Double ridie, double party, hardcore 
Teenage fuckin' bitches major 
Catch me if you can 
Fuck the law with my dick in my hand 
We're comin' strong 
Generation triple X 
We're all about the weed smoke 
And the kinky sex nigga what 
So sing me, I, I 
I'm not fucking around 
Stop fucking with me 
And the children are born 
Your feeling through me, I, I 
We're the children of the Korn 
Cos a bag of my life 
Then I got it, so far 
It's open day like me (Insanity) 
Go figure, once a fag 
Now a player 
Baptised and born 
And the Children of the Korn 
Children of the Korn! 
I'm the first born! 
Fuck authority! 
Hit your ass in the head with my 40 
You girls see more of me, after school 
You better run to your car 
Class clown, I already know I'm a star 
Your Children of the Korn was born 
From your porn and twisted ass ways 
Now you look amazed 
I'm sitting in a daze, in a purple haze 
You better check my pulse 
'Cause nothin' seems to faze 
Bitch! 
Nothin' seems to faze 
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn 
Nothin' seems to faze 
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn 
Look and see, I feel the parents hating me 
Hurt me, you hurt me 
Why don't you step outside and feel me? 
Feel me! Feel me! Feel me! 
How you gonna tell me where to skate 
Who to date, how to fuck, how to kiss 
Who to love, who to diss 
How to live 
What it is, somethin' gotta give 
Parents or the kids, it won't be the kids 
What? It won't be the kids 
We're talking shit, 'cause life is a bitch 
You know it is 
Everybody tryin' to get rich 
God damn!

You think it's funny?

You take your turn lashing out at me 
I want you crying with your dirty ass in the front of me 
All of my hate cannot be found 
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming 
So you can try to tear me down 
Beat me to the ground 
I will see you screaming 
Come and fill the pages of my fantasies 
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown 
I wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me 
And I'll pull the trigger 
And you're down, down, down

All my friends are gone, they died (gonna take you down) 
They all screamed, and cried (gonna take you down) 
I got my monkey, got my monkey back against the wall (?)

Unlike nothing I have heard 
Sing along, mocking bird

Deliver it to my heart 
Please strike! 
Be deliberate 
Wait!

Too late! 
I'm coming undone 
What looks so strong, so delicate 
Wait! 
I'm starting to suffocate 
And soon I anticipate! 
I'm coming undone 
What looks so strong, so delicate 
Joke, joke again 
I thought my demons were my friends 
Pity me in the end 
They're out to get me 
Since I was young 
I tasted sorrow on my tongue 
And this sweet jerky gun does not protect me 
That's right! 
Trigger between my eyes 
Please strike!

Head is lighter than a feather 
Looks like I'm not getting better 
Not getting better

Things keep ending up this way 
(come and get off) 
Another notch is carved away 
In the thoughts of mass decay 
Funny how things end up this way 
Beaten down, dominated by its sound 
Growing deep within my head 
Softly dying, its soul is shed 
Eating me all up inside 
This cancer finds everything I hide 
Living my life horrified 
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life 
Life, just know that I'm insane 
Satisfaction is delayed (come and get off) 
Its motivation is displayed 
Finding its misogyny 
Funny how I die and go away (come and get off) 
Beaten down, dominated by its sound 
Growing deep within my head 
Softly dying, its soul is shed 
Eating me all up inside 
This cancer finds everything I hide 
Living my life horrified 
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life 
Life, just know that I'm insane 
I'm constantly beat up inside 
And I'm the one to blame 
No one can relate to me 
It's not like I'm insane 
Beaten down, dominated by its sound

Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

And then, the man kept kick'n me

He wasn't dead, and then they knocked him on the head

All the shit I seem to take 
All alone I seem to break 
I have lived the best I can 
Does this make me not a man?.</field>

Listening to your Twisted Transistor 
Hold it between your legs 
Turn it up, turn it up 
Low end is coming through 
Can't get enough 
A lonely life, where no one understands you 
But don't give up, because the music do 
Music do [x6] 
Because the music do 
And then it's reaching 
Inside you forever preaching 
Fuck you too 
Your scream's a whisper 
Hang on you 
Twisted Transistor 
Hey you, hey you, finally you get it 
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it 
And as your tears fall on 
Your breast, your dress 
Vibrations coming through 
You're in a mess 
A lonely life, where no one understands you 
But don't give up, because the music do 
Music do [x6] 
Because the music do 
And then it's reaching 
Inside you forever preaching 
Fuck you too 
Your scream's a whisper 
Hang on you 
Twisted Transistor 
Music do, Music do [x4] 
Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit 
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt 
Says who? Says who? 
Anesthetize this bitch 
Anesthetize this bitch, anesthetize! 
Just let me be 
Between you and me don't fit 
Because the music do 
And then it's reaching 
Inside you forever preaching 
Fuck you too 
Your scream's a whisper 
Hang on you 
Twisted Transistor

But don't give up your instincts 
Hang onto you know what 
They'll be gone fast as you blink 
They're trained to seduce you 
Suck you dry quick as they can 
They tried to reduce you 
Now you're barely a man 
Oh my God 
How can you deny the flood 
That's flowing through you 
(Chorus) 
Hey you 
You're saying that she's all that you desire 
Liar 
Hey you 
You think you can throw water on this fire 
Liar 
It's not wrong to let go 
And let the woman ride you 
For fuck sake, don't lose touch 
With the dog that's inside you 
She wanted what you had 
You bet she smelt the spore 
Don't give up, fuck her up 
One more time, slam that door 
Oh my God 
How can you deny the flood 
That's flowing through you 
(Chorus)

Oh my God 
How can you deny the flood 
That's flowing through you

Liar, liar, liar...

Not long ago 
Hiding behind the shadows 
Of your broken soul 
Why is it always you want something you can never have? 
Why did you you try to tell me? 
How could you be this way 
Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 
There you are my precious 
With your broken soul 
Rubbing my crotch, elated 
Taking control 
Why is it always 
You fuck up something you have always had 
Why'd you try to tell me 
How could you be so cold? 
Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 
Here I am, just a man 
Feeling the pain, gives me life 
Relieving us is my plan 
I'd do anything to see through your eyes 
Just to see through your lies 
I hate you, Can you feel the pain? 
Can't you feel the pain? 
I hate you, Can you feel the pain? 
Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain.</field>

The walls I have built inside 
The thoughts I can grasp 
Transparency through 
They constantly fight and collide 
I'd love to see a different world 
A place where you can't find me 
Feel me! Kill me! 
My back's up against a wall 
Your magic spell 
Doesn't work anymore 
Kill me, kill me, that's what 
You've got to face, my friend (my friend) 
This ain't the end (the end) 
Why can't I relax and let it be true? 
This world that I tried to hide 
It's kind of a mess 
Too reckless for you 
This place makes me feel alive 
I'd love to see a different world 
A place where you can't find me 
Feel me! Kill me! 
My back's up against a wall 
Your magic spell 
Doesn't work anymore 
Kill me, kill me, that's what 
You've got to face, my friend (my friend) 
This ain't the end (the end) 
[Corey Taylor:] 
The call of the purpose 
The changing behaviour 
Ends at us all 
We keep constrains on the strangers 
It gets on top of you and forces your perspective 
Then you know it, you feel it 
It's as dark as you can get, you want it 
Harder! Harder! Harder! 
Give it to you 
Harder! Harder! 
You might just want it 
Harder! Harder! Harder! 
Give it to you 
Harder! Harder! 
Ever think you'll ever get it 
Feel me! Kill me! 
My back's up against a wall 
Your magic spell 
Doesn't work anymore 
Kill me, kill me, that's what 
You've got to face, my friend (my friend)

So what? Let's

Screwin' may be the only way 
That I can truly be free 
From my fucked up reality 
So I dream and stroke it harder 
'Cause its so fun to see my face staring back at me 
I don't know your fucking name. 
So what? Let's fuck.

Contemplating's how I like to play

I'm gonna drop a little east side skill,

So watcha thinking Mr 
Raggedy man? 
Doin' all you can to look like Raggedy Ann. 
Jon: I'll Check you out punk,

You look like one of those dancers 
from the Hanson video,

Please give me some shit to work with, 
'cuz right now I'm all it kid,

Jon: Yeah, baby! 
Fred: I hear ya tweetin' on them fag-pipes clod, 
but you said it best, there's "No Place To Hide". 
Jon: What the fuck ya' sayin'? 
You're a pimp whateva', limp dick. 
Fred Durst needs to rehearse, 
needs to reverse what he's saying. 
Wannabe funk doobiest is what you're playin', 
rippin' up a bad "Counterfeit", 
fakin'! Plus your bills I'm paying, 
you can't eat that shit every day, Fred. 
Lay off the bacon.

Both: It's all in the family. 
Jon: I hate you! 
Fred: and you hate me! 
Jon: You know what, you know what? 
Both: It's all in the family. 
Jon: Look at you fool, 
I'm gonna fuck you up twice, 
throwin' rhymes at me like,

Ya better run, 
run while ya can, you'll never fuck me up, 
"Bisc Limpkit". 
At least I got a phat, 
original band. 
Fred: Who's hot, who's not? 
Jon: You. 
Fred: You best step back, "Korn" on the cob, 
you need a new job. 
Time to take them mic skills 
back to the dentist, 
and buy yourself a new grill. 
Jon: Fuck you. 
Fred: You pumpkin pie, 
I'll jack-off in your eye. 
Climbing Shoots and Ladders, 
while your ego shatters. 
But you just can't get away. 
Jon: Get a gay? 
Fred: 'Cuz it's doomsday kid, 
it's doomsday. 
Chorus 
Fred: You call yourself a singer? 
Jon: Yep. 
Fred: You're more like Jerry Springer. 
Jon: Oh cool! 
Fred: Your favorite band is winger, 
Jon: Winger? 
Fred: and all you eat is Zingers. 
You're like a Fruity Pebble, 
your favorite flag is rebel. 
Jon: Yeeeeeehaaaaaa!! 
Fred: It's just too bad that you're a fag, 
and on a lower level. 
Jon: So you're from Jacksonville, 
kickin' it like Buffalo Bill. 
Gettin' butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck, 
while your sister's on her knees 
waitin' for your little grape nut. 
Fred: Hey, where'd ya get that little dance? 
Jon: Over here. 
Fred: Like them idiots in Waco, 
you're burning up in Bako 
where your father had your mother, 
your mother had your brother, 
Jon: Nah! 
Fred: it's just too bad your father's mad, 
your mother's now your lover. 
Jon: Come on hillbilly, 
can your horse do a fuckin' wheely? 
You've been livin' down south, and boy, 
you sure got a purdy mouth. 
Chorus 
Jon: and I love you! 
Fred: and I want you! 
Jon: and I'll suck you! 
Fred: and I'll fuck you! 
Jon: and I'll butt-fuck you!

Goodbye, cruel world 
I'm leaving you today 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
Goodbye, all you people

To make me change my mind

What's outside? 
Sneaks inside 
How we contaminate 
This warzone of my soul 
I underestimate 
I've never really thought about it that much 
It's only ever violence that's in my touch 
Appears, appears, appears 
I am built this way 
Appears, appears, appears 
I am built this way 
The pills they, quit working 
They take more than they give 
Emotions on flat line 
It's all that I can give 
The rising 
The falling 
My mind keeps tricking me 
It throws me a life raft 
Then leaves me out at sea 
I've never really thought about it that much 
It's only ever violence that's in my touch 
Appears, appears, appears 
I am built this way 
Appears, appears, appears 
I am built this way 
I've never really thought about it that much 
It's only ever violence that's in my touch 
Appears, appears, appears 
I am built this way 
Appears, appears, appears 
I am built this way</field>

Please give me some place to hide. 
I'm not trying to go there, so take me away. 
Life sometimes pisses me off. 
It's never a good trip for me 
Every time I reach for love, it's taken away. 
Night! So I play. 
Give me a sign this is gay. 
Give me some patience, so I pray. 
It's time to die 
Is that what I want? 
There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved. 
Is there something wrong with me? 
For once in my life I'd like to be really set free. 
Let me be me. 
Night! So I play. 
Give me a sign this is gay. 
Give me some guidance, so I pray. 
It's time to die

Taken away.

Taken..

Something I get, I got to get home 
Run, run, run, run, run, run running home 
Where is my home...

Give me a sign this is day. 
Give me some patience, so I pray.

Take a look around, no-one can make me 
Deep inside, this face is where I hate me 
Sluck around, I'm so alive, just save me 
Hands on your head 
And you're just feeling tight 
You wanna look around and shake me 
You wanna fuck around and let me go this time 
What's even worse you try to break me 
You go and look around 
And see what you can find 
See what you can find 
You can find 
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
I know what you came here for; to tempt me 
Quiet down the thoughts to place to keep me 
Either way I know that you resent me 
Hands on your head 
And you're just feeling tight 
You wanna look around and shake me 
You wanna fuck around and let me go this time 
What's even worse you try to break me 
You go and look around 
And see what you can find 
See what you can find 
You can find 
Taking my time, taking my chances 
Take me away, sick of these dancers 
Taking my time, taking my chances 
Take me away, sick of these dancers 
Taking my time, taking my chances 
Take me away, sick of these dancers 
Taking my time, taking my chances 
Take me away, sick of these dancers

You got the dykes off, I think they'll mind me

The rag I'm on, we are justified 
Ball Tongue! 
Congrats you just fucked up my make-up and shit 
Ball Tongue! 
What have you done for me?! 
Why are you at home buried in your own self pity? 
Why do you insist on making a mockering out of me 
Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took time with me 
Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?! 
Ball Tongue! 
You have come to take from your buddy 
Ball Tongue! 
You have never been so funky 
Ball Tongue! 
The higgle got sick of me 
Ball Tongue! 
Ahh, the dick is fine for the day 
Ball Tongue! 
You're drug addicted from me [Your brother took it from me] 
Ball Tongue! 
Unidentified enemy [in my mind] 
Ball Tongue! 
Come fucking back to save us and gave up 
Ball Tongue! 
They've come to deliver me [come down, think to me] 
You were my brother 
Where does our friendship end? 
I'm not going to give in 
How can you fuck'n doubt me, but not again 
Ball Tongue! 
They've driven right by my friends 
Ball Tongue! 
They've taken the take above me 
Ball Tongue! 
They're a psychopath [psycho munky] 
Ball Tongue! 
They've come to enslave me 
Ball Tongue! 
They've jacken themselves onto me

Your fuck'n gangster signs 
Ball Tongue! 
They've come not to save them, but they take 
Ball Tongue! 
Fuck'n death to fuck'n me 
You're psychopaths {repeated}

Berome's dead at the tecnodrome 
Ball Tongue! 
You're right, he's dead, tear gas dropped, but who was it? 
Ball Tongue!

Ball Tongue! 
Can I die?! Can I die?! 
Ball Tongue! 
And then, the man kept kick'n me 
Ball Tongue! 
into the morgue they go 
Ball Tongue! 
He wasn't dead, and then they knocked him on the head 
Ball Tongue! 
No more, he's rid of you 
You're a Dyke!.</field>

I love you so much I'm never there 
I'm always with you but never cared 
And you move in a hostile way 
Like you're recently wounded 
I reach for your wrists to feel the pulse 
Your feeling yourself for both of us 
We got a problem, it's plain to see 
We got a problem 
Which one, which one of you is into me 
Which one, which one of me is into you 
We're both schizophrenic I fear 
Seeing how many voices you hear 
Which one, which one of you is into me 
Which one, which one of me is into you 
We are schizophrenic, don't stop 
No, not 'til I fuck this song up 
All the searching we do inside 
Is a futile attempt to 
Is this what we're meant to never know? 
It's all screwed up how the river flows 
And I know that you real hard 
To sing to yourself but 
Was I the beast that sucked into you? 
A real dark victim down inside of you 
We got a problem, it's plain to see 
 
Bitch we got a problem 
Which one, which one of you is into me 
Which one, which one of me is into you

The tears are cleansing bitterness 
I'm out of time 
I'm slowly dying, give me back my life! 
Just give me back my life!

            <field name="lyrics">Are you ready?! 
This place inside my mind, 
A place I like to hide 
You don't know the chances 
What if I should die?! 
A place inside my brain, 
Another kind of pain 
You don't know the chances 
I'm so blind! 
Another place I find 
to escape the pain inside 
You don't know the chances 
What if I should die?! 
A place inside my brain, 
Another kind of pain 
You don't know the chances 
I'm so blind! 
Deeper and deeper and deeper 
as I journey to 
live a life that seems to be 
a lost reality 
that can never find, 
a way to reach my inner 
Self-esteem is low 
How deep can I go 
in the ground that I lay? 
If I don't find a way to see 
through the gray that clouds my mind. 
This time I look to see what's between the lines 
I can't see, I can't see, I'm going blind.. 
(x12) 
I'm blind!</field>

Man I gotta let it out 
Am I crazy? 
Screaming nothing ever comes out 
I keep feeling lost 
I'll never find my way out 
I'm not thanking them 
Unless the truth can pour out 
Give me some courage 
Beating me down now for some time 
Are you laughing am i funny? 
I hate inside, 
I hate inside. 
I'll take this time 
To let out whats inside 
coz I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow 
You raped and stole my pride. 
And all this hate is bottled up inside 
My heart's breaking 
Man you really ripped it out 
You take pleasure watching as 
I claw my way out 
The hurt rising 
Soon it's gonna to tear my soul out 
Its not kosher feeling like Im on my way out 
Give me some courage 
Beating me down now for some time 
Are you laughing am i funny? 
I hate inside, 
I hate inside. 
I'll take this time 
To let out whats inside 
coz I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow 
You raped and stole my pride. 
And all this hate is bottled up inside 
[scat in background] 
Feeling the haze as they cut down my spine 
Pealing your flesh like the way you've cut mine 
Do you feel happy, you fucked up my mind 
Your going to pay this time 
[scat in background] 
I'll take this time 
To let out whats inside 
coz I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow 
You raped and stole my pride. 
And all this hate is bottled up inside 
[Slower] 
I'll take this time 
To let out whats inside 
coz I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow 
You raped and stole my pride. 
And all this hate is bottled up inside</field>

Holding on to sacred places 
Holding on to what is found 
I'm looking forward to see their faces 
Flat on the ground, the horror profound 
None of you people mean shit to me

Lying on the ground in your own debris 
While choking on your blood from the sodomy 
None of you people mean shit to me 
Sadistic little fucking fantasy 
Burn the Obedient, set yourself free 
Walk the path of secrecy 
Used to heartless mockery 
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes 
Your misery 
All the damage it just erases 
Mediocrity all around 
The grandlose disorder replaces 
Conditions of peace, is this my release? 
None of you people mean shit to me 
Sadistic little fucking fantasy 
Lying on the ground in your own debris 
While choking on your blood from the sodomy 
None of you people mean shit to me

A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes

Burn the Obedient 
Burn the Obedient 
Burn the Obedient 
Burn the Obedient 
Burn the Obedient 
Burn the Obedient

Walk the path of secrecy 
Used to heartless mockery 
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes 
Your misery

Hate for dialing 
You're so cheap but you can't stay 
Won't be easy 
'cause you please me 
Life will not get stopped to blame 
Don't make something 
Out of nothing 
Till your dreams just slip away 
Devil with me 
Doesn't fist me 
Doesn't temper one more day 
All along 
I thought I was wrong 
Also it's screamed across the room 
All along 
I feel it's strong 
I feel it calling 
Calling me too soon 
One more timing 
Hearing whining 
Die disgust away from me 
Playful sinner 
Want be inner 
Please just stay away from me 
It's good headache 
Little fumbling 
Like a message late for me 
Let me tinder 
One last binder 
Going down so great for me 
All along 
I thought I was wrong 
Also it's screamed across the room 
All along 
I feel it's strong 
I feel it calling 
Calling me too soon 
(calling me too soon) 
(I don't need you) 
(I don't need) 
I don't need you! 
What the fuck you're here for? 
Someone press against the door! 
Oh no don't go! 
Imma break it down! 
All of me is tied and bored! 
I don't need no! 
Is there vial more! 
Crush the day when I was born! 
I don't need you! 
What the fuck's it for? 
Someone press against the door! 
All along 
I thought I was wrong 
Also it's screamed across the room 
All along

I feel it calling me too soon

And things, no shame, two sparks turned into flames, 
Nimpho's in the park, just dancin' in the rain. 
Hook me with this fix, and look to drain my aim, 
Some never retain what wouldn't suck from your veins.

Rest us, rest us from the pain, if I ask. 
Ashamed cos a game keep playin' me wrong. 
Promise not to ever sing a damn 'nother song,

The sweeter the stroke, the deeper the pain given. 
There's an angel, angle sex-driven. 
Dangerous sex kitten, warm as a mitten.

Emotional masturbation, fuckin' with my love, 
Fuckin' with my life, fuckin' all the above.

Been stuck in a place I really hate

Got this thing attached to me, 
Throw it all away

Gonna break you

Sometimes I worry 
Sometimes I'm sorry 
Sometimes I just wanna kiss that frown

Somehow making me feel sane 
Waiting all this time 
I've got nothing to hold on 
But the phases of my life 
I can see before I'm gone 
Sometimes I feel it chasing me 
All the hate that's breaking me 
I realise I'm taking everything 
And the shit seems to follow 
This time I feel it taking me 
To a place I'm hate to be 
All along I seem to make believe 
And the shit seems to follow 
I'm thinking of 
Making all the fucked people 
Making the bitches I love 
Make them die and go away 
Pain from the start

Oh God, can I reclaim? 
Stop and help me

Stop fucking with me 
And the children are born 
Your feeling through me, I, I 
You're the children of the Korn 
Droppin' smoke in the alley 
Makin' noise with a double pump 
Bring your boys turn up at a party with you doubled up 
Double ridie, double party, hardcore 
Teenage fuckin' bitches major 
Catch me if you can 
Fuck the law with my dick in my hand 
We're comin' strong 
Generation triple X 
We're all about the weed smoke 
And the kinky sex nigga what 
So sing me, I, I 
I'm not fucking around 
Stop fucking with me

Cos a bag of my life 
Then I got it, so far 
It's open day like me (Insanity) 
Go figure, once a fag 
Now a player 
Baptised and born 
And the Children of the Korn 
Children of the Korn! 
I'm the first born! 
Fuck authority! 
Hit your ass in the head with my 40 
You girls see more of me, after school 
You better run to your car 
Class clown, I already know I'm a star 
Your Children of the Korn was born 
From your porn and twisted ass ways 
Now you look amazed 
I'm sitting in a daze, in a purple haze 
You better check my pulse 
'Cause nothin' seems to faze 
Bitch! 
Nothin' seems to faze 
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn 
Nothin' seems to faze 
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn 
Look and see, I feel the parents hating me 
Hurt me, you hurt me 
Why don't you step outside and feel me? 
Feel me! Feel me! Feel me! 
How you gonna tell me where to skate 
Who to date, how to fuck, how to kiss 
Who to love, who to diss 
How to live 
What it is, somethin' gotta give 
Parents or the kids, it won't be the kids 
What? It won't be the kids 
We're talking shit, 'cause life is a bitch 
You know it is

First, I let my shoulders lean, 
Then, I snap my neck back... 
Wait! (Then, I let my wrists pop)

Posted in the cut, and I'm lookin for a blockhead, 
Yup in my white tee! I break a bitch back, 
And I keep a big bank, oh I think they like that! 
(Wait!) 
Before I leave the house, I'm slizzard on a goose, 
And I'm higher than a plane, so a nigga really loose, 
And I can lean wit it, and I can rock wit it, 
And if you gotta friend, she gotta suck a cock wit

Lean wit it, rock wit it, freeze before yo fingers

Pimpin in the club, see them hoes tryin a act up 
'Cause they see my chain and a nigga throwin them

I keep a full clip and my pistol in my pants, 
I'm in the middle of the flo',

That's right!

Trigger between my eyes (Lean wit it)

Always it's coming 
And here starts the game 
Why can't this puzzle be solved? 
Each time it happens it's always the same 
I look down and it starts to fall 
And all I see, it burns my eyes 
Burning all inside 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over, taking all that's mine 
One more time 
Always this teasing 
Sometimes I lose faith 
Where is my strength to hold on? 
Facing existence, how can I relate? 
Do I stand here or move on? 
And all I see, it burns my eyes 
Burning all inside 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over, taking all that's mine 
One more time 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over, taking all that's mine 
One more time 
Falling through this space and time 
Buried in this hurt of mine 
Falling slowly like a dream 
Falling through a world unseen 
Why can I not break this spell? 
I'm in darkness, is this hell? 
Falling towards this hole I see 
This is how it has to be 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over, taking all that's mine 
One more time 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over, taking all that's mine 
One more time 
One more time.. 
One more time..</field>

Take advantage of what I feel

As I'm screaming all my pain 
You will be there counting 
You just see me as something you throw around 
You were there for me 
Beating down to the ground 
Yes it always seems 
You take more from me 
So I'm saying nothing 
Each day taking that much more 
As I'm screaming all my pain 
You will be there counting 
It's funny how we've just started 
They get the money for the things on you 
They give ya money, and the girls and the fame 
I only do it for the fun and the games

Why can't you just shut your face? 
Oh, God the feelings I feel 
Would get me thrown in a cage 
You're the one always screaming at me 
I'm the one that keeps your so life care free 
What the fuck more do you want me to be? 
Why must you do this to me? 
Run away, I can't stay 
Lead the away, make them pay 
Counting on me. 
Always hoping I'll be 
There for all of your problems 
And in turn you're never there for me 
You sucked the life out of me 
You hate everything you see 
I can't take this anymore 
But I always stay when I should leave 
You see the pain in my face 
While you keep putting me down 
Inside the rage starts to build 
You push me and I won't go down 
You're the one always screaming at me 
I'm the one that keeps your so life care free 
What the fuck more do you want me to be? 
Why must you do this to me? 
Run away, I can't stay 
Lead the away, make the pain

Always hoping I'll be 
There for all of your problems 
And in turn you're never there for me 
You sucked the life out of me 
You hate everything you see 
I can't take this anymore 
But I always stay when I should leave 
Can it really be the day, today 
Does this make the problems go away 
I'm going hurt just in time 
Right now! 
- I've taken all I can now 
Right Now! 
- You've told us all about 
Right Now! 
- There is nothing you can do to stop me 
Right now x 9 
Counting on me. 
Always hoping I'll be 
There for all of your problems 
And in turn you're never there for me 
You sucked the life out of me 
You hate everything you see 
I can't take this anymore 
But I always stay when I should leave 
Counting on me. 
Always hoping I'll be

Couldn't look you in the eye, 
You're just like an angel,

You float like a feather,

You're so very special 
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, 
What the hell am I doing here? 
I don't belong here. 
I don't care if it hurts, 
I want to have control, 
I want a perfect body, 
I want a perfect soul. 
I want you to notice, 
When I'm not around. 
You're so very special, 
I wish I was special 
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, 
What the hell am I doing here? 
I don't belong here. 
Uh-uh Uh-uh 
She's running out the door, 
She's running out the... 
Run, run, run, run, run.

Whatever you want.

Remember I will always love you

Little child, looking so pretty

Innocent child, looking so sweet 
A rape in my eyes and on your flesh I'll eat 
You raped 
I feel dirty 
It hurt 
As a child 
Tied down 
That's a good boy 
And fucked

Not thinking straight 
Inside my body troubled 
Full of hate 
I hate to let it out before it's too late 
Deep inside, It can hide! 
Feeling so lost and betrayed 
Why does this happen to me everytime 
Stuck in this place, where I can't escape 
Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
Why won't it fade? 
Outside I had to lie: "I'm OK", 
I hope someday, I'll stop 
Getting pain 
I guess this is a lie, I have made 
Deep inside, It can hide! 
Feeling so lost and betrayed 
Why does this happen to me everytime 
Stuck in this place, where I can't escape 
Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
What am I doing? 
I can't believe this 
I have been hiding 
Wanting to be less 
Giving to people, 
They take from me 
Always they bring drama to me 
Look, look at me now... 
NOW! 
Feeling so lost and betrayed 
Why does this happen to me everytime 
Stuck in this place where I can't escape 
Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
I can't stand all of this fucking pain 
Please God just go away 
Please God just make the pain...

No problem Ive got time to kill 
(nobody cares youre just a bad man 
Nobody wants youre a dead man) 
Slave everyone Ive got my fill 
(nobody cares youre just a bad man 
Nobody wants youre a dead man) 
Do what you say, do want you want to 
We rip upon the flesh and lift to see 
And looking on all the faces along the way 
The terror grips me closely and holds me tight 
And hope I get to 
Die yet another night 
Dont get close to me 
Safe for you 
All this suffering left to do 
Dont get close to me 
Safe for you 
All this suffering left to do 
All this suffering left to do 
All this suffering left to do 
We rip upon the flesh and lift to see 
And looking on all the faces along the way 
The terror grips me closely and holds me tight 
And hope I get to 
Die yet another night 
We rip upon the flesh and lift to see 
And looking on all the faces along the way 
The terror grips me closely and holds me tight 
And hope I get to 
Die yet another night</field>

No one's there 
Pouring down 
Near people 
My head 
By myself 
All alone 
Ripping my hair out 
I hurt so bad inside 
I wish you could see 
The world through my eyes 
It stays the same 
I just wanna live again 
Keep hoping 
Nothing to spare 
So my life 
Isn't quite there 
Feel like a whore 
A dirty whore 
Such a whore 
Dirty 
My head 
By myself 
All alone 
Ripping my hair out 
I hurt so bad inside 
I wish you could see 
The world through in my eyes 
It stays the same 
I just wanna live again 
Just wanna live again 
I'll die again 
I'll die again 
I'll will take it 
Into me 
You dirty little fuck 
Dirty little fuck 
You dirty little fuck 
Dirty little fuck 
You dirty little fuck 
I will take it 
Dirty little fuck 
I will take it 
You dirty little fuck 
I will take it 
Dirty little fuck 
I will take it 
You dirty little fuck 
I hurt so bad inside 
I wish you could see 
The world through my eyes 
It stays the same

I just wanna live again 
I just wanna live again 
Just wanna live again

Take away the only love inside you 
I see the face through everyone 
Inside I've just begun! 
You think I'm out to scare you 
I'm only out to prepare you for when you stop and turn around 
Your body's going down! 
You're gonna waste your time, 
Your life will soon be mine, 
You're definitely one of a kind, and 
You're suffering 'cause of me it's divine 
Tell me why you never liked me 
Tell me why it is you fight me 
Pull down and wait for the perfect time to take what's rightfully mine 
You think they're dumb to defy me 
You said your dumb will defy me 
You weigh your dumb on anyone 
Oh well  
. 
You're gonna waste your time, 
Your life will soon be mine, 
You're definitely one of a kind, and 
You're suffering 'cause of me it's divine 
You know what, Fuck you! 
I'm fed up with you! 
I'm not as good as you?! 
Fuck no! I'm better than you! 
(x8) 
You're gonna waste your time, 
Your life will soon be mine, 
You're definitely one of a kind, and 
You're suffering 'cause of me it's divine 
Did you really think you'd beat me at my own game?! 
You try to see what you got 
Me ripping at your brain!.</field>

Or they take it away 
I'd rather be dead than

Wait! 
But you live, dont be cursing! 
You mustn't take gods name in vain! 
Wait! 
Put your knife forward the curtain!

My daddy, he disowned me, 
'cos I wear my sisters clothes 
He caught me in the bathroom, 
with a pair of pantyhose 
My basketball coach, 
he just kick me off the team 
For wearing high heels sneakers, 
and acting like a queen 
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree to a tree 
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree to a tree 
Gonna tie his pecker to a tree 
Get your boogie off 
Go Head 
The world is coming to an end and I dont give a dam 
As long as I have my bitch 
Oh and my fly gear 
It don't bother me, if people think I'm funny 
'cos I'm a big rock star, and I make lots of money 
Money, money, money... 
Are you talking pesos? 
Money, ka ching 
Ha, ha, ha 
Lots of money 
I'm so bloody rich 
Lots of money

Cause I cannot find my way 
You've gotta come with me (I cannot stand this place) 
We're falling off the wall (And I'll give into this place) 
We had a chance to run (And now I can't replace) 
We're going all the way (And now we'll rest embrace) 
Violence, worry 
Lifeless story 
Can't stop beating 
I'll start bleeding

Nothing makes sense at all. 
Taking something for nothing 
Watch me as I fall.

Didn't I know it then, I knew it I knew it. 
You're basic but hard to define, simple yet somehow sublime. 
Knew you will strike again, I knew it I knew it. 
You're all that's wrong with your dumbass psalms. 
Ya that's all that you will ever be. 
Nothing you can do because that's all that you will ever be. 
Polished you shiver when shined. 
Forgotten and seething inside. 
Everyone falls for this, I knew it I knew it. 
You're all that's wrong with your dumbass psalms. 
Ya that's all that you will ever be. 
Nothing you can do because that's all that you will ever be. 
Ever be, never be, want to be mine. 
All to be, made to be, holding your side. 
Throwing it, breaking it, all by your fame 
Sending you back to the place you once came. 
Leaving behind you. 
No one around you. 
You will never be! 
You want to be god, 
It's all gone.</field>

Broken promises that you never keep! 
Drift away tonight! 
Just drift away tonight! 
We used to dream, we used to laugh! 
No one could tell us 
That this would never last! 
This ain't a love song! 
I would never give you one! 
No more secrets, no more lies! 
No more feelings or surprise! 
No more whispered words or lullabies! 
Go fuck your lies! 
Everything, everything falls with us! 
Everything, everything always does! 
Everything, everything falls all apart! 
I've given up, it's all I could take! 
My hands are shaking, my body could break! 
I will be lonely now! 
Come on and take me out! 
I used to care, I used to try! 
But what's the use 
It always ends with goodbye! 
This ain't a love song! 
I'd never give you one! 
No more secrets, no more lies! 
No more feelings or surprise! 
No more whispered words or lullabies! 
Go fuck your lies!

Today, Hoping in time 
We'll bury all this pain

Something inside 
We pushed our buttons far inside 
We tear our hearts out 
Then we fight 
Hey, I know 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
I cannot survive, Alone 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
Our lives, were good in every way 
Too late, time after time 
Our love just turned to hate 
But we stayed by, each others side 
We pushed our buttons far inside 
We tear our hearts out 
Then we fight 
Hey, I know 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
I cannot survive alone 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
I keep holding on, I feel I'm where I belong 
Everytime we fight it feels so wrong 
I feel so enslaved fuck my pride 
Then we meet again 
We pushed our buttons far inside 
We tear our hearts out 
Then we fight 
Hey, I know 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
I cannot survive alone 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known.</field>

Begging on something to work this time 
But why can't I relate? 
Feeling all like who is scared? 
What's mine 
Holding on to faith 
Never gave me nothing but despair 
So why do I create just to be swallowed? 
I can't take 
We have a star 
I can't take 
We got a fantasy 
Come what may 
We are the stars 
I can't wait 
I'll take what's mine 
been hating all this time, before a crowd could side 
been hatingall the basics of everything that I could find 
been hatingall this time, too far to cross the line 
been hating all the basics of everything that I could find 
I cannot leave this place 
Burning up inside this space of mine 
Why can't I replace feelings I find hard to really find? 
I try but I can't taste 
Memories they always #### with me 
So why do I create just to be swallowed? 
I can't take 
We have a star 
I can't take 
We got a fantasy 
Come what may 
We are the stars 
I can't wait 
I'll take what's mine 
Believing all this time, before a crowd could side 
Believing all the basics of everything that I could find 
Believing all this time, too far to cross the line 
Believing all the basics of everything that I could find 
All my feelings have been eating all of me 
Feed inside 
Is there something wrong with me? 
I can't take

Why you treat me this way?

Nothing, probably 
You'd just throw me away

I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it 
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it 
It keeps going on day after day, son 
You fake! And they don't want none 
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday 
Who gives a fuck? 
Right now I got something to say to all the people that think 
I'm strange and I should be out of here locked up in a cage 
You don't know what the hell's up now anyway 
You got this pretty-boy feeling like I'm enslaved 
To a world that never appreciated shit 
YOU CAN SUCK MY DICK AND FUCKING LIKE IT!!! 
He had my gun but he had to find the money 
[He might come, but he has a body mighty] 
any say, anyway, don't wanna say, anyway, any say, 
going away, don't wanna say, anyway 
I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl 
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world 
All my life, who am I?! (x 10)

I can't stand what you put me through 
Your life's a lie, that you will hide 
Is it that terrible being you inside? 
I can't stand all the thought of you 
I can't stand all the things you do 
What do you try to justify? 
You were just too scared to be you inside 
Let! 
It all go 
Look at you, all I see, is a man too afraid to really be 
I can't stand what you put me through 
I can't stand even the thought of you 
Your secret lies that you will hide 
Is it that terrible being you inside? 
You try so hard to be wanted 
False emotions tells you fronted 
I feel being a person relies on one thing: 
Be yourself, let you come through 
You're too afraid to really be

            <field name="lyrics">Hey, I'm feeling tired 
My time, is gone today 
You flirt with suicide 
Sometimes, that's ok 
Hear what others say 
I'm here, standing hollow 
Falling away from me 
Falling away from me 
Day, is here fading 
That's when, I would say 
I flirt with suicide 
Sometimes kill the pain 
I can always say 
'It's gonna be better tomorrow' 
Falling away from me 
Falling away from me 
Beating me down 
Beating me, beating me 
Down, down 
Into the ground 
Screaming some sound 
Beating me, beating me 
Down, down 
Into the ground 
(falling away from me) 
It's spinning round and round 
(falling away from me) 
It's lost and can't be found 
(falling away from me) 
It's spinning round and round 
(falling away from me) 
So down 
Beating me down 
Beating me, beating me 
Down, down 
Into the ground 
Screaming some sound 
Beating me, beating me 
Down, down 
Into the ground 
Pressing me, they won't go away 
So I pray, go away 
It's falling away from me 
Beating me down 
Beating me, beating me 
Down, down 
Into the ground 
Screaming some sound 
Beating me, beating me 
Down, down 
Into the ground</field>

Rip off the mask from your head

Keep staring, acting like you gotta say:

Fear is a place to live

Fake ass people surround me 
They're always nice to begin 
They dig in their claws 
Fake ass people surround me 
Digging their claws right in me 
They're always nice to begin but 
I always get fucked in the end

Rip off the mask from your head 
Show me the real face that you hide

we're gonna take what we want 
and then burn down the liquor store 
pick up our friends tell them 
"let's all get in" don't ask what it's for 
somemore for kickin in porn on the TV screen 
these spinnin rims don't go no faster 
we can ride all night 
and we're not gonna stomp on the breaks for no one 
just follow the light 
and we're not gonna stomp on the breaks for no one 
we're flippin off the people 
who just thought us that's just a game 
we're throwin bricks right thru their windows 
and then we drive away 
let's break this, spin around 
new things are better found 
we keep on changin our direction 
go past the school, the church 
the places that caused us hurt, we're done 
If we keep movin foward maybe 
we'll forget where we're from 
we're gonna shake things up 
we're gonna break you down 
we'll fuel this car with our ejection 
we can ride all night 
and we're not gonna stomp on the breaks for no one 
just follow the light 
and we're not gonna stomp on the breaks for no one 
you can never go back not even 
know where you're in deep now 
you've been fuckin up real good lately 
one minute you come from zero now 
we can ride all night

Must we hide from everyone

Why can't we be together 
Erase it 
Sleeping so long 
Taking off the mask

Something lost and never seen 
Everytime I start to believe 
Something's raped and taken from me.. 
from me 
Life's gotta always be messing with me. 
(You wanna see the light?) 
Can't they chill and let me be free? 
(So do I) 
Can't I take away all this pain. 
(You wanna see the light?) 
I try to every night 
All in vain.. 
in vain. 
Sometimes I cannot take this place 
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste 
Sometimes I cannot feel my face 
You'll never see me fall from grace 
Something takes a part of me. 
You and I were meant to be. 
A cheap fuck for me to lay. 
Something takes a part of me. 
Feeling like a freak on a leash. 
(You wanna see the light?) 
Feeling like I have no release. 
(So do I...) 
How many times have I felt diseased? 
(You wanna see the light?) 
Nothing in my life is free.. 
is free. 
Sometimes I cannot take this place. 
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste. 
Sometimes I cannot feel my face. 
You'll never see me fall from grace.

Man, I got to let it out 
Am I quitting? 
Screaming, nothing ever comes out 
I keep feeling lost 
I'll never find my way out 
I'm not thanking them 
Unless the truth can pour out 
Give me some courage 
Beating me down now for sometime 
Are you laughing? Am I funny? 
I hate inside 
I hate inside 
I take this time 
To let out what's inside 
Cause I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow 
You may bestow my pride 
And all this hate is bottled up inside 
My heart is breaking 
Man you really ripped it out 
You take pleasure watching as I claw my way out 
The hurt rising 
Soon it's going to tear my soul out 
It's not kosher feeling like I'm on my way out 
Give me some courage 
Beating me down now for sometime 
Are you laughing? Am I funny?

I hate inside 
I'll take this time

Sometimes I wish you'd die

You may bestow my pride 
And all this hate is bottled up inside 
Feeling the haze as they cut down my spine 
Peeling your flesh like the way you've cut mine 
Do you feel happy you fucked up my mind 
You're going to pay this time 
I'll take this time 
To let out what's inside 
Cause I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow 
You may bestow my pride. 
And all this hate is bottled up inside

I'm getting off 
Keep getting off 
Keep getting off 
I'm getting off 
I'm getting off to you 
It's not enough 
It's not enough 
It's more than will ever be enough 
I'm getting off 
I'm getting off to you 
Hold my knees 
Lick my treat ? 
Fuck I'm coming 
Fuck I'm coming on you 
I'm coming 
Fuck 
I'm coming on you 
Licking your own skin, so trippy 
Squeezing your own ass, so pretty 
Suck the ways it's used for chilling? 
When you finally come so pretty 
Bitch we have got a problem 
There's not enough to get in it 
Getting off 
I'm getting off 
Keep getting off 
Keep getting off 
I'm getting off 
I'm getting off to you 
It's not enough 
It's not enough 
It's more than will ever be enough 
I'm getting off 
I'm getting off to you</field>

I gave into your ways which left me with nothing 
I've given into smiles,I've dealt with all your games 
I wish you're happy now,I had to let you win 
Why don't you get the fuck out of my face,now 
Why don't you get the fuck out of my face,now 
In the sea of life,you're just a minnow 
You live your life insecure 
I feel the pain of your needles 
As they shit into my brain 
i scream without a sound 
How could you take away 
everything that I was? 
Left me a fuckin slave 
Your face that I despise 
Your heart inside that's grey 
I came today to say,you're fucked in every way 
Why don't you get the fuck out of my face,now 
Why don't you get the fuck out of my face,now 
in the sea of life,you're just a minnow 
You live your life insecure 
I feel the pain of your needles 
As they shit into my mind 
You stole my life without a sign 
you sucked me dry 
Why don't you get the fuck out of my face,now 
Why don't you get the fuck out of my face,now</field>

Begging for something to work this time 
But why can't I relate? 
Feeling all I do is get what’s mine 
Holding on to faith 
Never gave me nothing but despair 
So why do I create just to be swallowed? 
I can't take 
We have a star 
I can't take 
We got our promises 
Come what may 
We are the stars 
I can't wait 
I’ll take what’s mine 
Been hating all this time, before a crowd inside 
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
Been hating all this time, too far to cross the line 
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
I cannot take this place 
Burning up inside this space of mine 
But why can't I replace feelings I find hard to really find? 
I try but I can't taste 
Memories, they always fuck with me 
So why do I create just to be swallowed? 
I can't take 
We have a star 
I can't take 
We got our promises 
Come what may 
We are the stars 
I can't wait 
I’ll take what’s mine 
Been hating all this time, before a crowd inside 
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
Been hating all this time, too far to cross the line 
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
All my feelings have been eating all of me 
feeling tired 
Is there something wrong with me? 
I can't take 
We have a star 
I can't take 
We got our promises 
Come what may 
We are the stars 
I can't wait 
I’ll take what’s mine 
Been hating all this time, before a crowd inside 
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
Been hating all this time, too far to cross the line 
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find

Tortured my soul as black as pitch

It is disturbing 
This isn't mine 
Why 
Days keep passing 
A lot at a time

I don't feel right 
Please God let me sleep tonight 
Everyday confronted circumvents giving in 
[...sick of friends giving in] 
I just wanna know why! 
Don't give it up [Don't get it up] 
Don't hit my stick [Don't get my stiff] [I can't escape] 
I keep asking 
Well, again, please try [...can we please try] 
It is haunting 
This takes my mind 
Why 
Days keep passing 
Line after line 
me? 
I don't feel right 
Please God don't let me die tonight, 
die tonight, die tonight, die tonight 
Please God help me 
Please God save me 
Please God help me from my painful situation 
Please God don't let me slip in tonight, please God 
Oh, please God don't let me chip in tonight, please God 
Oh, please God don't let me slip in tonight, don't let me die

I've got a problem, with me getting in the way, 
Not by design 
So I take my face and bash it into a mirror. 
I won't have to see the pain (bleed, bleed) 
This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating. 
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again. 
The hurt inside is fading 
This shit's gone way too far. 
All this time I've been waiting 
No I can not grieve anymore. 
For once inside awaking. 
I'm done, I'm not a whore. 
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore. 
My mind is done with this, 
Okay, I've got a question. 
"Can I throw it all away?" 
Take back what's mine 
So I take my time, guiding the blade down the line 
Each cut closer to the vein (vein, vein) 
This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating. 
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again. 
The hurt inside is fading 
This shit's gone way too far. 
All this time I've been waiting 
No I can not grieve anymore. 
For once inside awaking. 
I'm done, I'm not a whore. 
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore. 
I'm here to stay (bring it down) [x4] 
Bring it down [x4] 
Gonna break it down [x7] 
GONNA BREAK IT! 
This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating. 
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again. 
The hurt inside is fading 
This shit's gone way too far. 
All this time I've been waiting 
No I can not grieve anymore. 
For once inside awaking. 
I'm done, I'm not a whore. 
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore. 
Give anymore [X4]</field>

I can't help but desire of falling down this time 
Deep in this hole of my making I can't escape 
Falling all this time 
We come to this place 
Falling through time 
Living a hollow life 
Always we're taking 
Waiting for signs 
Hollow life...(life [x7]) 
Fearing to fall 
And still the ground below me calls 
Falling down this time 
Ripping apart all these things 
I have tried to stop 
Falling all this time 
We come to this place 
Falling through time 
Living a hollow life 
Always we're taking 
Waiting for signs 
Hollow life... 
Is there ever any wonder 
Why we look to the sky? 
Search in vain? 
Asking why? 
All alone 
Where is God? 
Looking down 
We don't know 
We fall in space, 
We can't look down, 
Death may come 
Peace I have found 
What to say 
Am I alive? 
Am I asleep? 
Or have I died? 
(Hauting me...) 
We fall in space 
(Hauting me...) 
We can't look down, 
Death may come, 
Peace I have found 
(Something takes a part of me...) 
What to say 
Am I alive? 
Am I asleep? 
We fall down 
We come to this place 
Falling through time, 
Living a hollow life, 
Always we're taking 
Waiting for signs, 
Hollow life... 
Is there ever any wonder

Is a good day to go 
Guess you want me to stay 
Well let me know 
And I hate to say 
It's been a waste of time 
I hate to interrupt the flow 
Why, Why, Why 
Hushabye 
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go? 
Why, Why, Why 
Hushabye 
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show? 
You say you'd love to 
But you've lost what's left to do 
Almost decided to stay 'cause of you 
And I'm here today to exchange your dreams 
For one more ticking of your time 
Why, Why, Why 
Hushabye 
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go? 
Why, Why, Why 
Hushabye 
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show? 
Why, why 
What you hanging up for? 
What you doing that for? 
What you breakin' up for? 
Why, hushabye 
I hate to interrupt the flow 
For one more ticking of your time 
Soothing Sunday is a good day to go! 
Why, Why, Why 
Hushabye 
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go? 
Why, Why, Why 
Hushabye 
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show? 
Hushabye 
Why, why, why I 
What you breaking up for?

Weeping rose of Jeremiah 
Drops of blood drip off your petals 
Representing all our tears 
In a ring of burning metal 
How You Gonna Be, What You Gonna Say It 
Doesn'T Bother Me, Who You Gonna Pay? 
Sorcerers and sadists come 
To define the what and why 
People travel across this Earth 
Over water, land, and sky 
How You Gonna Be, What You Gonna Say It 
Doesn'T Bother Me, Who You Gonna Pay? 
Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver 
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars 
Pay the bitches they're touching on their dates, stand by 
I'm not gonna pay, it's already mine

I'm gonna do it blind!

Purity unlike no other 
Offers hope to those who need it 
Don't forget care to thy brother

Little old lady at home 
Writing out a check to send 
It's all the money that she owns 
She believes the world might end

How you gonna touch

Everything we make 
The cells we generate 
Out both of us 
Please be aware that I am you! 
Nothing could be more certain! 
This ain't the time the place for us 
To understand this life! 
Hold you in my arms 
Hold you in my gaze 
Singing with my dying breath 
Underneath this earth 
A resurrected soul 
And nothing else 
Sorry for this space 
If I could feel a void 
An ocean wouldn't hold my love 
And everything I have 
And all I ever was 
Is not enough 
Please be aware that I am you! 
Nothing could be more certain! 
This ain't the time the place for us 
To understand this life!

It has been lead astray 
I'm Looking around, I drop to the ground 
Why does this have to end this way 
Feeling numb, so long 
Oh God it's just everyday 
It's everything 
Now I pray for all of them to go away!

Where is your self control 
Why can't you just be honest 
The corruption takes its toll 
You rape our hope 
Too proud to cope 
You built this house of shame 
You smile, you gloat 
This disease you promote 
An infection is what we are now 
I can't believe this happened 
The fear starts to grab hold 
Then anger starts to take over 
I will not be controlled 
You rape our hope 
Too proud to cope 
You built this house of shame 
You smile, you gloat 
This disease you promote 
An infection is what we are now 
They're taking over now 
Eating up our souls somehow 
Taking over now 
Parasites, they run around 
The culprits won't be found 
They lie behind this mask of wealth 
They're taking over now 
Illuminati they hide 
You rape our hope 
Too proud to cope 
You built this house of shame 
You smile, you gloat 
This disease you promote 
An infection is what we are now 
You rape our hope 
Too proud to cope 
You built this house of shame 
You smile, you gloat 
This disease you promote

Sleep is boring 
Don't stop running 
I'm here counting 
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate 
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate 
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate 
Really can't fuck with me 
There's no where else to go 
So I walk but seem to crawl 
For I'm giving in today 
Now I run into a wall 
Cause I cannot find my way 
You've got to come with me 
I can not stand this place 
We are crawling up the wall 
And I'll give in this way 
We had our chance to run 
And now I can't believe 
We're going all the way 
And now the in place 
My life, worry, lifeless story 
Give up beating 
I'll start bleeding 
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate

Nothing makes sense at all 
Taking something for nothing 
Watch me as I fall 
I'm bringing me down 
You've got to come with me

Things keep ending up this way 
(come and get off) 
Another notch is carved away 
In the thoughts of mass decay 
Funny how things end up this way 
Beaten down, dominated by its sound 
Growing deep within my head 
Softly dying, its soul is shed 
Eating me all up inside 
This cancer finds everything I hide 
Living my life horrified 
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life 
Life, just know that I'm insane 
Satisfaction is delayed (come and get off) 
Its motivation is displayed 
Finding its misogyny 
Funny how I die and go away (come and get off) 
Beaten down, dominated by its sound 
Growing deep within my head 
Softly dying, its soul is shed 
Eating me all up inside 
This cancer finds everything I hide 
Living my life horrified 
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life 
Life, just know that I'm insane 
I'm constantly beat up inside 
And I'm the one to blame 
No one can relate to me 
It's not like I'm insane 
Beaten down, dominated by its sound 
Living my life horrified 
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life 
Beaten down, dominated by its sound 
Growing deep within my head

Naked and wearing no makeup 
I watch your pulse beneath your skin

I couldn't care less 
I don't need conversation 
I've got nothing to say

Bitch so untamed but outside it, a work of art 
But underneath it you're beautiful when you're torn apart 
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you 
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard 
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you 
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard 
I drink the milk that's in your breast 
I wouldn't even mind your shit 
I put my tounge inside your ear 
I'm gonna eat you up right here

I'm the voice that's in your hair 
I've seen it all 
Still can't taste it 
Smash to the wall 
Brought me to my knees 
I've done it all 
Fucked up, wasted 
Stealing the blood 
Now inside i'm seen 
I'm the hunted 
I'm the predator 
I'm the answer to the real 
I'm the up-beat 
I'm the head-fuck? 
I'm the window smashed in the middle

I'm the logic

I'm the broken one who fixed it

Brought me to my knees 
I've done it all 
Fucked up, wasted 
Stealing the blood 
Now inside i'm seen 
I'm just a child with the tears in it's eyes 
I am holding this gift that is broken 
why do i have 
left now 
I've seen it all 
Still can't taste it 
Smash to the wall 
Brought me to my knees 
I've done it all 
Fucked up, wasted 
Stealing the blood 
Now inside i'm seen 
I've seen it all 
Still can't taste it 
Smash to the wall 
Brought me to my knees

Keep chipping at my soul

Looking all around to find a way 
It's all wrong 
Knowing that my demon won 
I'm done! 
Have I been lead astray? 
Blaming the righteous 
What do you think they'd say? 
Attacking the altar 
How many times a day must I die? 
Nothing's gonna work today 
I'm killing time 
Looking all around to find a way 
It's all wrong 
Knowing that my demon won 
I'm done! 
I'm done 
I'm done with faceless feelings 
I'm done with anything 
I'm done trying to support you 
and sacrificing everything 
Everything, everything! 
How many times a day must I die? 
Nothing's gonna work today 
I'm killing time 
Looking all around to find a way 
It's all wrong 
Knowing that my demon won 
I'm done!</field>

Yes, it's me again 
I wreck your positivity 
Yes, it's me again

To some stray life I'm not saying 
You see beauty, I see pain

I rip your throat out on a whim 
Yes, it's me again 
I only ask for everything 
Yes, it's me again 
I squeeze it to feel it breathe 
I smash it to fuel this need 
I am the antidote for 
Whatever sickness you feed 
You see beauty, I see pain 
You see sky, and I see acid rain 
It's me again 
It's me again...

Little miss fucker don't move an inch 
Y'all punk suckers can't take the heat 
Your blood rushing from head to feet 
This is what I stand for 
All unjustice that's done to man 
All you fuckers know who I am 
I'm living proof that you can 
Turn around and say it's me again 
It's me again 
Fuck! 
Fuck! 
Fuck!

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight 
Throw away the key and then 
Turn off all the lights 
First, we're going to set some bait 
Inside a nasty trap and wait 
When he comes a-sniffing we will 
Snap the trap and close the gate 
Wait! I've got a better plan 
To catch this big red lobster man 
Let's pop him in a boiling pot 
And when he's done we'll butter him up 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
Throw him in a box 
Bury him for ninety years 
Then see if he talks 
Then Mr 
Oogie Boogie Man 
Can take the whole thing over then 
He'll be so pleased, I do declare 
That he will cook him rare 
I say that we take a cannon 
Aim it at his door 
And then knock three times 
And when he answers 
Sandy Claws will be no more 
You're so stupid, think now 
lf we blow him up to smithereens 
We may lose some pieces 
And then Jack will beat us black and green 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
Tie him in a bag 
Throw him in the ocean 
Then, see if he is sad 
Because Mr 
Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around 
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town 
He'll be so pleased by our success 
That he'll reward us too, I bet 
Perhaps he'll make his special brew 
Of snake and spider stew 
Ummm! 
We're his little henchmen and 
We take our job with pride 
We do our best to please him 
And stay on his good side 
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb 
I'm not the dumb one 
You're no fun 
Shut up 
Make me 
I've got something, listen now 
This one is real good, you'll see 
We'll send a present to his door 
Upon there'll be a note to read 
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide 
Until his curiosity entices him to look inside 
And then we'll have him 
One, two, three 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick 
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits 
Mr 
Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see 
Lock him in a cage and then, throw away the key</field>

My life -- pain is God. 
Many nights, painful thoughts occur 
Love me -- again I'm wrong. 
In denial I tried to be your friend 
I tried to be a good boy. 
All I see, a hate deep inside 
Startle me, someone save me. 
All these memories 
Fill my heart 
They bury me 
All I want to do... 
(you are not my real mother) X4 
Is kill you... 
(so I beat and stab and fuck her) X4 
Looking back I was never ever right. 
You were my step mom you always wanted me out of your sight. 
I would come walkin' in and I'd say, "Hello," 
but you'd slap me and make some fucked-up comment about my clothes. 
But I tried to let it pass, but the visions in my head were with you with a knife up your ass laying dead. 
So I popped some more caps in your ass. 
Now your son is such a fuck -- motherfucking bitch 
never try to play me! 
You make my life -- not so.... 
All I want to do.... 
Is kill you.... 
All I want to do... 
(you are not my real mother) 
Is kill you... 
(so I beat and stab and fuck her) 
Wish! You! Were dead! Now! 
How... 
I know 
How can I cry over someone I never loved? 
How can I cry over someone I never loved? 
Never loved... 
Never loved</field>

They've come back to a waiting level 
Why don't they fly away? 
Surely they have gangs by now 
There is no gun to shoot them down 
And still they stay 
For what they say 
I'll be killing them with lies 
I'll be fighting for my life 
Killing them with thoughts 
They can never get enough 
Killing them all because we're killing every single thing 
It's a trained response 
Birds are circling above 
They've come back to a waiting level 
Sold the game 
It bears my name 
I have worshiped some false Gods 
And run to them like I have not thought to 
Cry my shame 
It burned a flame 
I'll be killing them with lies 
I'll be fighting for my life 
Killing them with thoughts 
They can never get enough 
Killing them all because we're killing every single thing 
It's a trained response 
We are present to raise them to die 
To die 
We are present to raise them to die 
We are present to raise them to die 
Somebody told me once 
Beat them 'til there's nothing 
Get used to it 
Next thing the line is gone 
Are we going down? 
Are we going down? 
Are we going down? 
Are we going down? 
Are we going down? 
Are we going down? 
Are we going?</field>

Do I feel like a fool? 
The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared 
And I owe this all to you. 
I'm feeling like I'm sinking 
And nothing's there to catch me, keep me breathing. 
What do I have to do? 
Why can't this hurt be through? 
I'm going head onto 
something I know I will fail. 
Why can't this kiss be true? 
Why won't you please let me through. 
I don't understand why you always push me away. 
Last thing I will like to do before it go away 
is cry there next to you 
(Next to you) 
Cry and talk about the good all days and where they've gone 
and now how much I hate you. 
What do I have to do? 
Why can't this could be through? 
I'm going head onto 
something I know I will fail. 
Why can't this kiss be true? 
Why won't you, please, let me through. 
I don't understand why you always push me away. 
I feel the blood drip of my body as it goes right there. 
I'm not, now. 
What am I now? 
What am I now? 
What am I now? 
What do I have to do? 
Why can't this hurt be through? 
I'm going head onto

Why can't this kiss be true?

Mercy, mercy for you and me

Soon our lives they'll be erased 
Do you think they will remember 
Or will we just be replaced? 
Oh I wish that I could see 
How I wish that I could fly 
For all the things that hang above me 
To a place where I can cry 
So what can it be? No one hears me call 
Echoes back at me, no one's there 
To all these nameless feelings 
I can't deal with in my life 
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine 
You've got to fill your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind 
I know it's time to leave these places far behind 
You and me, we have no faces 
They don't see us anymore 
Without love as they had promised 
And no faith for what's in store 
Oh I wish that I could see 
How I wish that I could fly

Dancing in and out my mind 
Burning up all that I long for 
Feeding me till my decline 
Where are you? My soul is bleeding 
I am searching! Am I blind? 
All alone and bound forever 
Trapped inside me for all time 
To all these nameless feelings 
I can't deal with in my life 
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine 
You've got to fill your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind 
I know it's time to leave these places far behind 
To all these nameless feelings 
I can't deal with in my life 
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine 
You've got to fill your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind 
I know it's time to leave these places far behind</field>

Dishonesty takes you apart and will eat you 
All the anger and pain and the suffering 
And the shame and the voices in your brain 
Will surely haunt you 
Let the guilt go 
Let the guilt go 
Let the guilt go 
Let the guilt go 
I tell you one thing, which leads to another thing 
Then I back-track which leads to hurt feelings 
Then my brain spends time to fuck in everything 
When this happens I can't break through 
All the anger and pain and the suffering 
And the shame and the voices in your brain 
Will really haunt you 
Let the guilt go 
Let the guilt go 
Let the guilt go 
Let the guilt go 
I tell you one thing, which leads to another thing 
Then I back-track which leads to hurt feelings 
Then my brain spends time to fuck in everything 
When this happens I can't break through 
Now we waste our lives away 
Letting guilt lead the way 
I'm such a stupid fuck 
Listening to my head and not my gut 
Constantly thinking... 
Thinking... 
Thinking... 
And thinking... 
(Constantly thinking)

I'm dreaming! 
Now we waste our lives away

Then I back-track which leads to hurt feelings 
Then my brain spends time to fuck in everything 
When this happens I can't break through 
I tell you one thing, which leads to another thing 
Then I back-track which leads to hurt feelings 
Then my brain spends time to fuck in everything 
When this happens I can't break through

Take me on second place 
Which you don't often find 
I see a family walking 
Always thinking of 
Being somewhere else in time 
So I fall face down 
In a rut 
I can't seem to get out of 
Please wake me 
Please give me some of it back 
The feelings I had 
Sometimes I wish 
I could be strong like you 
It doesn't matter 
Each time I wake 
I'm somehow feeling the truth 
I can't handle 
Let's get this party started 
I'm sick of begging you 
You make me feel insane 
Which I did to you 
Let's get this party started 
You make me feel insane 
I want to be the one 
To make myself sane 
Time is ticking 
It makes me feel content 
With what I have inside 
Constant paranoia 
Surrounds me 
Everyone I see 
Is out to get me 
So I fall face down 
In a rut 
I can't seem to get out of 
Please wake me 
Please give me some of it back

But the question is how can you really be real? 
Life is scary, and hate is pain 
God, I need you and that is the shame

But don't give up your instincts 
Hang onto you know what 
They'll be gone fast as you blink 
They're trained to seduce you 
Suck you dry quick as they can 
They tried to reduce you 
Now you're barely a man 
Oh my God 
How can you deny the flood 
That's flowing through you 
(Chorus) 
Hey you 
You're saying that she's all that you desire 
Liar 
Hey you 
You think you can throw water on this fire 
Liar 
It's not wrong to let go 
And let the woman ride you 
For fuck sake, don't lose touch 
With the dog that's inside you 
She wanted what you had 
You bet she smelt the spore 
Don't give up, fuck her up 
One more time, slam that door 
Oh my God 
How can you deny the flood 
That's flowing through you

Can't you seem to open your body and let me touch you 
I want you to see the life you have disguised 
The world of things that hurt you 
Kept all these useless lies 
I want you to fear the you wound up inside 
Once I took you in, I'll throw you out next time 
I tried, you win 
My life is ripping your heart out and destroying my pain!

In the back of my mind 
That thorn in my spine 
Wait to see it before my eyes 
Why?Don't I turn grey? 
Looking all the time 
at your face so blind 
Feeling uptight 
always the same fight 
Hey man,now decide 
go ahead take your time 
Kissing all the time 
That thorn in my spine 
Wait You can't even see my side 
Why?Do you play yourself out 'dat way? 
Why?You and me always hang 
Wait weren't you were my friend? 
The pain in which I feel,I feel 
Hey man look inside 
know your need to your own life 
Remember me,guy? 
That thorn in your spine 
Waiting all the time 
I'm doing mighty fine 
Remember me guy? 
That thorn in your spine

Feeling complacent I cannot be contained 
I'm so lost and lonely now 
We've been deceived 
It's so easy for me 
Cause' the loathing I've had from the start 
Evil disease all the hatred it breathes 
As I'm down on my knees torn apart 
Take me away! 
Set me on fire! 
There's no other way!

You need a reason to believe 
A reason to deceive 
A reason for the song you're singing 
And everything you do 
Makes perfect sense to you 
So why is your alarm bell ringing 
You say you know how it feels inside of me 
Lost and alone and no love or luxury 
Come on inside 
And hear the song that's constantly judging me 
Don't you think you should move on? 
I know that your so fucking lonely 
You need a way to get along 
A way to carry on 
A symptom for the pain you're making 
And surely you should know 
That everywhere you go 
There's hazard in the world you're making 
You say you know how it feels inside of me 
Lost and alone and no love or luxury 
Come on inside 
And hear the song that's constantly judging me 
Don't you think you should move on? 
You've run it, so you've best believe it 
You've sold it, now your soul perceives it 
You wave a book but now agree with this 
The damage of betrayal 
To hell with that 
A reason to believe 
A reason to deceive 
A reason for the song you're singing 
And everything you do 
Makes perfect sense to you 
So why is your alarm bell ringing 
You say you know how it feels inside of me 
Lost and alone and no love or luxury 
Come on inside 
And hear the song that's constantly judging me 
Don't you think you should move on? 
Don't you think you should move on? 
Don't you think you should move on?</field>

In a room without a door a 
Kiss is not enough in 
Love my way it’s a new road 
I follow where my mind goes 
They’d put us on a railroad 
They’d dearly make us pay 
For laughing in their faces and 
Making it our way there’s 
Emptiness behind their eyes 
There’s dust want to steal us all and 
Take us all apart 
But not in 
So swallow all your tears my love 
And put on your new face 
You can never win or lose if 
You don’t run the race

You're holding my heart, screaming 
Motherfucker! 
They left me broken, bleeding 
Son of! 
The man you loved and left for 
The son of a bitch! 
Who tried to show me death's door 
Everything's eliminated 
Everything is dedicated 
My belief destroyed my hated? 
Never get what's over-rated 
Love song for the dear departed 
Head stone for the broken hearted 
Arms to kill 
More flowers to steal 
Head trip for the mortal earthbound 
One sip of the blood that I found 
Lying here 
I'm dying here 
As in! 
Obituaries rain down 
And some of them! 
Were lying naked face down 
Wasn't it decapitated? 
Can you see me fascinated? 
Your the only thing I've damaged 
What you get to be mis-managed 
Love song for the dear departed 
Head stone for the broken hearted 
Arms to kill 
More flowers to steal 
Head trip for the mortal earthbound 
One sip of the blood that I found 
Lying here 
I'm dying here 
Dying here.. 
Don't bring me daffodils 
Bring a Boquet of Pills 
See some geranium 
Cracked to the crainum 
Protect me when you can 
Respect me when I am 
Dying 
Love song for the dear departed 
Head stone for the broken hearted 
Arms to kill 
More flowers to steal 
Head trip for the mortal earthbound 
One sip of the blood that I found 
Lying here 
I'm dying here 
Love song for the dear departed 
Head stone for the broken hearted 
Arms to kill 
More flowers to steal

I walk the circle 
I come down long ago 
But somehow I get lost each time 
Feeding this song that deepens inside that never ends 
The voice within eats me up inside 
1, I love hurting you 
2, I love your pain 
3, Lets get together and play this endless game 
4, is for the torture and 
5, is for the shame 
Cause ever time you want it I get off on this game 
You wanted to play the coldness follows 
This isn't a game your life full swallow 
And I can't help to smile at your pain 
You wanted to play but I already won 
Gholding 
I plant the seed inside your head 
right away watch it grow destroying your insides 
pleading to comfort you with my sadistic ways 
I watch the tears fall 
I crack a smile 
1, I love hurting you 
2, I love your pain 
3, Lets get together and play this endless game 
4, is for the torture and 
5, is for the shame 
Cause ever time you want it I get off on this game 
You wanted to play the coldness follows 
This isn't a game your life full swallow 
And I can't help to smile at your pain 
You wanted to play but I already won 
I look at you and start to crack 
Start to crack 
I give it too you take it back 
Take it back 
this lullaby is all you have 
All you have 
sadistic pleasure I attack 
I attack 
I attack 
I attack 
I attack 
I attack 
You wanted to play the coldness follows 
This isn't a game your life full swallow 
And I can't help to smile at your pain 
You wanted to play but I already won 
I already won

Thanking all the fucked people 
Thanking all the shit I love 
They are all the things I've made

Begging all the same people 
Burning is the same evil 
Somehow making me feel sane 
Waiting all this time 
I've got nothing to hold on 
But the faces of my life 
I can see before I'm gone 
Sometimes I feel it chasing me 
All the hate that's breaking free 
I realise I'm taking everything 
And the kids seem to follow 
This time I feel it taking me 
To a place I'm hate to be 
All along I seem to make believe 
And the shit seems to follow 
I'm thinking of 
Making all the fucked people 
Making the bitches I love 
Make them die and go away 
Pain from the start 
All my dreams are ripped apart 
Thanking all the fucked people

Stop and help me 
Sometimes I feel it chasing me 
All the hate that's breaking free 
I realise I'm taking everything 
And the shit seems to follow 
This time I feel it taking me 
To a place I'm meant to be 
All along I seem to make believe 
And the shit seems to follow 
The shit seems to follow.</field>

Been bleeding too long 
Right here, right now 
I'll stop it somehow 
I will make it go away 
Can't be here no more 
Seems this is the only way 
I will soon be gone 
These feelings will be gone 
These feelings will be gone 
Now I see the times they change 
Leaving us, it seems so strange 
I am hoping I can find 
Where to leave my hurt behind 
All the shit I seem to take 
All alone I seem to break 
I have lived the best I can 
Does this make me not a man? 
Shut me off 
I'm ready 
Heart stops 
I stand alone 
Can't be my own 
I will make it go away 
Can't be here no more 
Seems this is the only way 
I will soon be gone 
These feelings will be gone 
These feelings will be gone

Does this make me not a man? 
Am I going to leave this place? 
What is it I'm hanging from? 
Is there nothing more to come? 
(Am I gonna leave this place?) 
Is it always black in space? 
Am I going take its place? 
Am I going to leave this race? 
(Am I going to leave this race?) 
I guess God's up in this place? 
What is it that I've become? 
Is there something more to come? 
(More to come) 
Now I see the times they change 
Leaving us, it seems so strange 
I am hoping I can find 
Where to leave my hurt behind 
All the shit I seem to take 
All alone I seem to break

Yesterday i got so old 
I felt like i could die 
Yesterday i got so old 
It made me want to cry 
Go on go on 
Just walk away 
Go on go on 
Your choice is made 
Go on go on 
And disappear 
Go on go on 
Away from here 
And know i was wrong 
When i said it was true 
That couldn't be me and be her 
In between without you 
Without you 
Yesterday i got so scared 
I shivered like a child 
Yesterday away from you 
It froze me deep inside 
Come back come back 
Don't walk away 
Come back come back 
Come back today 
Come back come back 
Why can't you see? 
Come back come back 
Come back to me 
And i know i was wrong 
When i said it was true 
That it couldn't be me and be her

Bring it on, it wont phase me 
Everytime it makes me stronger

Everytime I'm up it kills me 
Somewhere deep, responding change 
Manipulation rapid all around 
Dark all these days 
Calling on something to follow

My childhood’s gone - because I loved you

Not long ago 
Hiding behind the shadows 
Of your broken soul 
Why is it always you want something you can never have? 
Why did you you try to tell me? 
How could you be this way 
Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 
There you are my precious 
With your broken soul 
Rubbing my crotch, elated 
Taking control 
Why is it always 
You fuck up something you have always had 
Why'd you try to tell me 
How could you be so cold? 
Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 
Here I am, just a man 
Feeling the pain, gives me life 
Relieving us is my plan 
I'd do anything to see through your eyes 
Just to see through your lies 
I hate you, Can you feel the pain? 
Can't you feel the pain? 
I hate you, Can you feel the pain? 
Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain.</field>

I hide in my space

And one of these days, I'll come unbound 
The feelings I hate, will finally drown 
Falling awake in a nightmare 
Images of horror abound 
Thought I stumbbled apon salvation 
Hell I found 
I put my wall up each day 
You tear it down 
I hide in my space 
The space you found 
And one of these days, I'll come unbound 
The feelings I hate, will finally drown 
Well, I'll never be the same 
It's the greatest lie ever told 
No, I'll never be the same 
I sold my soul 
I put my wall up each day 
You tear it down 
I hide in my space 
The space you found 
And one of these days, I'll come unbound 
The feelings I hate, will finally drown

We have no faces 
Soon our lives they'll be erased 
Do you think they will remember? 
Or will we just be replaced 
Oh I wish that I could see 
How I wish that I could fly 
All the things that hang above me 
To a place where I can cry 
So why can it be? 
No one hears me call 
Echoes back at me 
No one's there 
To all these meaningless feelings 
I can't deal with in my life 
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine 
You got to feel your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind 
I know it's time to leave these places far behind 
You and me 
We have no faces 
They don't see us anymore 
Without love as they had promised 
And no faith for what's in store 
Oh I wish that I could see 
How I wish that I could fly 
All the things that hang above me 
To a place where I can cry 
So why can it be? 
No one hears me call 
Echoes back at me 
No one's there 
To all these meaningless feelings 
I can't deal with in my life 
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine 
YouæŠ³e got to feel your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind 
I know it's time to leave these places far behind 
Where are all these feelings hiding? 
Dancing in and out my mind 
Burning up all that I long for 
Feeding me till my decline 
Where are you? 
My soul is bleeding 
I am searching 
Am I blind? 
All alone and bound forever 
Trapped inside me all the time 
To all these meaningless feelings 
I can't deal with in my life 
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine 
You've got to feel your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind 
I know it's time to leave these places far behind 
To all these meaningless feelings 
I can't deal with in my life 
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine 
You've got to feel your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind 
I know it's time to leave these places far behind</field>

I see your faces and I do not understand why 
Each time I dream you're standing there right by my side. 
Why do you make me? You take my pride 
And in my eyes you kinda rape me.. 
inside 
I have no place to run and hide 
I have no place to hide, which I like 
Some will look at the time I looked back into my life. 
You wanna touch me to see what's in my eyes. 
Why do you make me, remember my hate, all this shame? 
Don't you hate me? .. 
sometimes? 
I have no place to run and hide. 
I have no place to hide, which I like. 
I have no place to run so come on follow me 
I have no place to run so come on follow me 
I have no place to run so come on follow me 
I have no place to run so come on follow me 
I have no place to run so come on follow me

I have no place to run so come on follow me

So I'm angry for today 
Anger's the only thing I've made

No it's.

To live this way 
Hating, feeling, falling 
To the place where people haunt me 
I can't help but keep from falling 
To the place where people call me 
I can't wait to give them these feelings of hating 
Keeping inside me for all to take 
Picking at me 
They're ripping at me 
Ripping at me 
So I came to find 
To end up this way 
Feeling like I'm god

To the place where people haunt me 
I can't help but keep from falling

Can't tell if this is true or dream 
Deep down inside I feel to scream 
This terrible silence stops me 
Now that the war is through with me 
I'm waking up, I cannot see 
That there's not much left of me 
Nothing is real but pain now 
Hold my breath as I wish for death 
Oh please God, wake me 
Back in the womb it's much too real 
In pumps life that I must feel 
But can't look forward to reveal 
Look to the time when I'll live 
Fed through the tube that sticks in me 
Just like a wartime novelty 
Tied to machines that make me be 
Cut this life off from me 
Hold my breath as I wish for death 
Oh please God, wake me 
Now the world is gone I'm just one 
Oh please help me 
Hold my breath as I wish for death 
Oh please God, help me 
Darkness 
Imprisoning me 
All that I see 
Absolute horror 
I cannot live 
I cannot die 
Trapped in myself 
Body my holding cell 
Come on, Get 'em up 
Landmine 
Has taken my sight 
Taken my speech 
Taken my hearing 
Taken my arms 
Taken my legs 
Taken my soul 
Left me with life in Hell</field>

And here starts the game 
Why can't this puzzle be solved? 
Each time it happens it's always the same 
I look down and it starts to fall 
And all I see 
It burns my eyes 
Burning all inside 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over 
Taking all that's mine 
One more time 
Always this teasing 
Sometimes I lose faith 
Where is my strength to hold on? 
Facing existence 
How can I relate? 
Do I stand still or move on? 
And all I see 
It burns my eyes 
Burning all inside 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over 
Taking all that's mine 
One more time 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over 
Taking all that's mine 
One more time 
Falling through this space and time 
Buried in this hurt of mine 
Falling slowly like a dream 
Falling through a world unseen 
Why can I not break this spell? 
I'm in darkness 
Is this hell? 
Falling towards this hole I see 
This is how it has to be 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over 
Taking all that's mine 
One more time 
One more time 
buried in this hurt of mine 
Falling slowly like a dream 
Falling through a world unseen 
Why can I not break this spell? 
I'm in darkness 
Is this hell? 
Falling towards this hole I see 
This is how it has to be 
Caught in the corners of my mind

I'm quiet certain 
say it ain't so 
your corrupted by 
some sick fuck 
oh no 
open up now 
head in the sky 
here's the turn back 
keeps tellin lies 
build it in my mouth 
you breath in but cant breath out 
what you been taking, it makes you talk real slow 
hope, c'mon thinking, you'd be the last to know 
choking you gently 
gaining control 
hand you the shovel 
to dig your own hole 
open up now 
let it all go 
I'm quiet certain

oh no

open up now 
let it all go 
open up now

That is in slow-motion 
If I were you I'd trade away 
That every guilty motion 
If this is true 
Would you lie? would you keep? 
Would you try to remind me? 
A something really new 
Still a diving, grasping any motion 
Is it love for? 
I've never faced the truth 
I'm lost in out of you 
I should have known 
You're so cold 
How could I've been so clueless 
A touching ground 
But only? sick and still mess 
I buck away but the? is high 
And I guess I menage 
I've done? or two 
And if you lay down will I still feel sadness 
Is it love for? 
I've never faced the truth 
I'm lost in out of you 
I can't escape you 
Wish I can break this chain 
I can't relate to 
These little fucking games 
Fucking games 
This little fucking games 
Is it love for? 
I've never faced the truth 
I'm lost in out of you 
Out of you 
Out of you 
I can't escape you 
Wish I can break this chain 
I can't relate to

Constantly beating others down

Damn right I can't live this life

Can't take this shit 
Feeling like a lunatic 
Holding your problems 
Inside my head 
Holding motherfucking shit 
Feeling like a lunatic 
A place for your bullshit to hide 
A place for your bullshit to hide 
A place for your bullshit to hide 
A place for your bullshit to hide 
A place for your bullshit to hide 
Can someone please just tell me

Just dead inside 
Just dead inside 
Just dead inside 
I'm just dead inside

Everybody's an Enemy 
telling me lies and it's killing me 
why they all want to get rid of me 
Everybody's my enemy 
Several try to disguise the devil in them 
Wanting to get into my cerebellum but I'm 
Ready and willing to tell them that I can't f with them 
Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling 
like my dick does when watching nikkid women 
do sick stuff on my porn collection on television 
[Nas:] 
Trust nobody 
I don't know who to call a friend 
they all just pretend to be 
Fuck Everybody this is to all of ya'll 
cuz everybody is an enemy [x2]

Watching my own back 
strapped in chrome, to my homies 
where the tombstones at, where the hoes at? 
Cuz to many didn't act like dikes, hermaphrodites 
with benzene, amen 
Look at the trash they biting 
The life in times is kinda weaker 
like the time and life of the sandman 
on Apollo theater 
imagine that another black with a hook 
who pulls the wack talent off the stage 
I'm in raged 
[Nas:] 
Trust nobody 
I don't know who to call a friend 
they all just pretend to be 
Fuck Everybody this is to all of ya'll 
cuz everybody is an enemy [x2]

You fill your lies around me 
and you think you won 
You feel you can control me 
with the things you've done 
[JD:] 
You think you can take me 
you think you can play me 
you're going to start to hate me 
I feel that you disgraced me [x5]

Don't preach or talk about politics 
Don't let me talk about politics 
Don't give a shit about politics 
You want to sleep with him to get to who 
You need to know 
Think thats the way to go don't you? 
Its in religion, sex, and everything we do and say 
I look the other way won't you? 
Everybody's raped 
Lying to your face 
Kick's you in the gut 
Slayed you here on the stop 
Don't wanna talk about politics 
Don't preach or talk about politics 
Don't let me talk about politics 
Don't give a shit about politics 
You want to sleep with him to get to who 
You need to know 
Think thats the way to go don't you? 
Its in religion, sex, and everything we do and say 
I look the other way won't you? 
Tiniest dream living in your soul 
And they remain there 
Darkest life in the deepest hole 
You sit and pray there 
All the guilt from the things you've told 
You wonder what for 
What you thought was so much fun 
You'll have to pay for 
Don't wanna talk about politics 
Don't preach or talk about politics 
Don't let me talk about politics 
Don't give a shit about politics 
You want to sleep with him to get to who 
You need to know 
Think thats the way to go don't you? 
Its in religion, sex, and everything we do and say 
I look the other way won't you? 
Don't wanna talk about politics 
Don't preach or talk about politics 
Don't let me talk about politics 
Don't give a shit about politics 
Don't wanna talk about politics 
Don't preach or talk about politics 
Don't let me talk about politics 
Don't give a shit about politics!</field>

Look at this! 
Are you feeling now? 
Happiness...

Pop a pill! 
I'm so damn happy now

I need my fix today 
This is way beyond me 
I can't live without you today 
Well look at this! 
I see colors now 
Look at this! 
People ugly now 
Happiness...

Pop my pill!

This is way beyond me 
I can't live without you today 
You today... 
You today... 
I don't care about anything around me 
Even all the love that surrounds me 
Break me 
Be me 
I don't care about anything 
I do this to shut off the voice

I can, in every way 
Mistake the pain I feel inside 
It comes to me 
Evil thoughts just creeping through my mind 
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind? 
It runs away 
It's so predictable 
I can, in every way 
Illustrate this thing called love inside 
[...this thing that's left inside] 
Too blind to see, emptiness and sorrow of their lifes 
You run away to the cover of their pointless ties 
You ask me? 
It's so predictable 
I'm gonna try 
[should I? [fuck]] 
I'm gonna die 
I'm gonna try 
another day 
Silence overwhelms my mind 
who is to say 
If I have the time, or why 
should I pray 
for all the hate to go away 
another day 
I can never break free 
You wait for me 
I call out to you 
Another day 
I'll live forever!.</field>

Darling faces are some we found 
Let's do what devils do 
Hiding in shadows, no-ones around 
Why can't I torture you 
Giving pain you take it away 
The little things you do 
Simply I love your evil ways 
Your ways 
Your ways 
Your ways 
Prey for me 
I think I owe you an apology 
Somehow you bring the violence out in me 
I'm just a shell of what I used to be 
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me 
This time it follows you 
Nothings left, your dead on the ground 
How can I covet you 
Give you hell and you can't be found 
My soul infested you 
Blackened thoughts they run through your head 
The little things you do 
Simply I wish you were dead 
Were dead 
Were dead 
Were dead 
Prey for me 
I think I owe you an apology 
Somehow you bring the violence out in me

Goodbye, So long! 
Wish I could stay but everything is all wrong 
Goodbye, So long! 
Wish I could stay but everything is all wrong 
Everything is all 
WRONG!

I'm so dumb, there is nothing to hate. 
Really is it me, or is it fate? 
Give me peace, or at least for fuck's sake. 
Give him something to say. 
Something super fly, never play. 
All I hear is disgrace. 
Erase them all and reclaim my place. 
In the past I was known as a freak. 
Had no friends, picked on 'cause I was weak. 
Save my ass, I got into this band, 
Never thought the band would pick on the man. 
Give him something to say. 
Something super fly, never play. 
All I hear is disgrace. 
Erase them all and reclaim my place. 
Reclaim my place... 
Say it to my face. 
So I look around at all these stupid little faces. 
Something I can never slap, but I embrace. 
You'll never ever see, you'll never ever be, 
You want to fuck around? Then come on, fuck with me. 
You think you can't relate? 
You'll never ever find. 
You think you feel my hate? 
Look at me and you will find 
My fate you always raped? 
I will always be the son. 
You want to fuck with me? 
Come on, fucking play! 
You can feel it now or be stoned! 
Yes, you feel it come, right now! 
You can feel it now or be stoned 
Yes, you feel it come, right now! 
You can feel it now or be stoned 
Yes, you feel it come, bow down! 
Bow down! 
Give him something to say. 
Something super fly, never play.

Erase them all and reclaim my place.

Always it is calling me, for the blood of man

I can't bare, I cannot tame the hunger in me 
Oh, I say I did and always searching, you can't fuck with me. 
So instead you'll taste my pain. 
The hunger inside given to me, makes me feel alive. 
Always out stalking prey, in the dark I hide. 
Feeling, falling, hating, feel like I am fading, 
hating life!!! 
They say I cannot be this, I am jaded, hiding from the day. 
I can't bare, I cannot tame the hunger in me... 
Oh, I say I did and always searching, you can't fuck with fate.

Nothing seems exciting, always the same hiding, 
hiding 
It's haunting me...</field>

In plan with a sedative

Fuck you! 
Warm lips, a big smile 
Has made your mind runs wild 
This game you play I like the way 
You expect to grab a child 
You think I'm innocent, not wild 
Take me and look see how much I'm tame 
Never gotta a little, but I think he'll never know 
how to live with sure body wild until the pressure so 
I'll show you feelings that you pain is nothing, 
so let your body hang in there. 
What a frustrating fear 
Warm lips, a big smile 
Hatred runs through your insides 
This game you play it turns my attention each day 
You think it's all a lie 
They want you to stray outta line 
Anger twisted your life, but you pay 
I wish I could take control 
I wish I could let go 
I wish I could break this mold 
Inside I'm so fucking cold 
I'm come'n, I'm come'n, I'm come'n on you 
I wish I could lose control 
I wish I could let go 
I wish I could break this mold 
Inside I'm so fucking cold 
Wet fits inside so the truth unfolds 
I learned to lybra suffering 
This was real, I'm dead for you with heroin 
What's come'n, what's come'n, what's come'n on you?! 
I'm come'n, I'm come'n, I'm come'n on you!!!.</field>

Can't seem to get away. 
I remember there's a certain place, 
A place I wish I'd stay. 
I feel so lost within - pressured, 
I'm headed for that day. 
Just one thought in my head, really. 
Do I need this fame? 
Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), 
I see something I can't be. 
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be. 
Like some god damn fucking freak, 
I'm so pressured, I'm so weak, 
Something takes a hold of me, 
Something I can't believe. 
I lay in bed at night and wonder, 
Should I go on this way? 
It's the only thing I really got for now, 
And it's called fame. 
Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), 
I see something I can't be. 
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be. 
Like some god damn fucking freak, 
I'm so pressured, I'm so weak, 
Something takes a hold of me, 
Something I can't believe. 
So I see this face so innocent and fine... 
and so fine. 
So I see this face and I realize it's mine. 
I feel the rattle... 
So I see this face so innocent and fine... 
and so fine. 
So I see this face and I realize it's mine. 
I feel the rattle... 
Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see 
something I can't be. 
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.

Pocket full of posies. 
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down. 
Nursery rhymes are said, verses in my head. 
Into my childhood, they're spoon fed. 
Hidden violence revealed, darkness that seems real. 
Look at the pages that cause all this evil. 
One, two - buckle my shoe. 
Three, four - shut the door. 
Five, six - pick up sticks. 
Seven, eight - lay them straight 
( london bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down 
london bridge is falling down, my fair lady ) 
 
Nursery rhymes are said, verses in my head. 
Into my childhood, they're spoon fed. 
Hidden violence revealed, darkness that seems real. 
Look at the pages that cause all this evil. 
Knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone. 
This old man came rolling home. 
Mary had a little lamb, it's fleece was white as snow. 
Baa Baa Black have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full. 
Ring-a-round-the-rosies. 
Pocket full of posies.

            <field name="lyrics">I start to search all the dark places that I have found, 
All the deep creases in my mind that are torn up somehow. 
I want to keep the pace, 
I want to figure it out, 
I've got to do it this way, 
If I don't, everything's lost. 
Have you ever really noticed the blanket of shame, 
From the torment and pain? 
That you realise that no one's ever been there. 
Have you ever looked at the violence you hide, 
All the running inside, 
You can't escape, it's always been there. 
A tear is holding inside my head to let the deamons go 
I come a crash to pull the hatred puzzle under gold 
I want to keep the pace, 
I want to figure it out, 
I've got to do it this way 
If I don't, everything's lost. 
Have you ever really noticed the blanket of shame, 
From the torment and pain? 
That you realise that no one's ever been there. 
Have you ever looked at the violence you hide, 
Always running inside, 
You can't escape, it's always been there. 
Close my eyes, I go to sleep, 
He's always there, I start to weep 
[X8] (Come along) (burning me) (All alone) 
Have you ever really noticed the blanket of shame, 
From the torment and pain? 
That you realise that no one's ever been there, 
Have you ever looked at the violence you hide, 
Always running inside, 
You can't escape, it's always been there.</field>

Like an unkown enemy 
I was never meant to fight 
Little seed of purity 
And you don't belong to me 
Still I'm blinded by it's light 
Don't try to make it right 
Does anybody know 'bout love? 
Does anybody care 'bout God? 
If you're with me 
Sing sorrow 
Pity for your thoughts I fear 
We need a little help around here 
If you're with me 
Sing sorrow 
When the scars don't ever heal 
Do you fear you'll never feel 
What it is to be at peace 
You're craving a release 
Does anybody know 'bout love? 
Does anybody care 'bout God? 
If you're with me 
Sing sorrow 
Pity for your thoughts I fear 
We need a little help around here 
If you're with me 
Sing sorrow 
I don't understand here 
Why God would do me this way? 
I lived the life, was always good 
The one thing I need to take away 
It take away! 
(The one thing) 
It take away! 
(The one thing) 
It take away! 
(The one thing) 
It take away! 
(The one thing) 
It take away! 
(Just it take away) 
(The one thing) 
It take away! 
(Just it take away) 
(The one thing) 
It take away! 
(Just it take away!) 
Away. 
away... 
It took away my world 
And all it left was pain 
And all this time was for nothing... 
Does anybody know 'bout love? 
Does anybody care 'bout God?

Bring me not far enough.

Basis all for me, 
Can you leave my mind. 
Bracing my fall, 
My every single place. 
Your love travelled far, 
Some laying with my fates. 
Place some never far, 
You're everything away. 
You say I'm a love, 
And be mine every way. 
(Inside) 
Under the sand, 
Through the land, 
Find all I can, 
And form a clan, 
That teaches to laugh. 
Tears the past. 
Laughs at the rest. 
Teach the best. 
Defeats the rest. 
Forms the test, 
We passed all the tests.

Walking, waiting 
Alone without a care 
Hoping, and hating 
Things that I can't bear 
Did you think it's cool to walk right up 
To take my life and fuck it up 
Well did you 
Well did you 
I see hell in your eyes 
Taken in by surprise 
Touching you makes me feel alive 
Touching you makes me die inside 
Alone without a care 
Hoping, and hating 
Things that I can't bear 
Did you think its cool to walk right up 
To take my life and fuck it up 
Well did you 
I hate you 
I see hell in your eyes 
Taken in by surprise 
Touching you makes me feel alive 
Touching you makes me die inside 
I've slept so long without you 
It's tearing me apart, too 
How to get this far 
Playing games with this old heart 
I've killed a million petty souls 
But I couldn't kill you 
I've slept so long without you 
I see Hell in your eyes 
Taken in by surprise 
Touching you makes me feel alive 
Touching you makes me die inside 
I see Hell in your eyes 
Taken in by surprise 
Touching you makes me feel alive 
Touching you makes me die inside

For the gift, I will never recieve.</field>

Falling on our faces 
They don't care anyway 
Anyway, now 
You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive 
You're the one that pushes me all the time 
All the time, now 
We are hard and grey 
Always fate, to do what they say 
Calling me deranged 
Feeling power, I must take its place some way 
Never gonna run away 
Seeking out the path 
But the pain always gets in the way 
Slowly watch me die 
I'm insane, so dangerous 
Don't if you dare get in my way 
Throwing in the towel 
Got me strained, so betrayed 
Get the fuck out of my way 
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time 
Pounding all these spikes in my veins 
We are the ones reaching out in vain 
Trying to solve our problems 
They won' t go away, go away now 
You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive 
You're the one that pushes me all the time 
All the time, now 
We are hard and grey 
Always fate to do what they say 
Calling me deranged 
Feeling power, I must take its place some way 
Never gonna run away 
Seeking out my path 
But the pain always gets in the way 
Slowly watch me die 
I'm insane, so dangerous 
Don't you dare get in my way

lying on the floor 
Step into nothing, what the hell am I here for? 
So come on and play 
Stab me in my heart 
So long this time was wasted ripping me apart 
We are the hurt inside your head 
Lost in the void of what is dead 
Constantly twisting things I said 
Happiness is boring, need pain instead 
It's starting over, starting over 
Can't stand it's over, God is gonna take me out 
My time is over, this time is over 
Why is this over? God is gonna take me out 
(God is gonna take me out) 
Crawling on the floor 
All around this space 
Talking to myself 
What is this thing I've got to face? 
Walking through a door 
Has it been a waste? 
Going on and on thinking I could find my place 
We are the hurt inside your head 
Lost in the void of what is dead 
Constantly twisting things I said 
Happiness is boring, need pain instead 
It's starting over, starting over 
Can't stand it's over, God is gonna take me out 
My time is over, this time is over 
Why is this over? God is gonna take me out 
God is gonna take me out (God is gonna take me out) 
God is gonna take me out 
You can't see 
I'm torn away from you and everything that's 
close to me 
I cannot face the truth, it's nothing that 
I believe 
Just run away from me and thank me when you're 
free from me 
Come take me 
Come take me 
Come take me 
Come take me 
Come take me 
Come take me (We are the hurt inside your head) 
(Lost in the void of what is dead) 
Come take me (Constantly twisting things I said)

I was down and you took me up past the ceiling 
You are the disease

Bring you down to your knees

Only you can truly see 
All the hell you put me through when the fish is feeding 
Can't really be free

I can't ever be me

It's calling me 
Go! Away, away 
Go! Away, away

To love me 
When I used to be someone 
And I knew there was someone 
That loved me 
As I sit here frozen alone 
Even ghosts get tired and go home 
As they crawl back under the stars 
And I wish there was something 
Please tell me theres something better 
And I wish there was something more than this 
Saturated loneliness 
And I wish I could feel it 
And I wish I could steal it 
Abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can 
it's just saturated loneliness 
Does the silence get lonely? 
Does the silence get lonely? 
Who knows? 
I've been hearing it tell me 
I've been hearing it tell me 
Go home 
Cause the freaks are playing tonight 
They packed up and turned out the lights 
And I wish there was something 
Please tell me theres something better 
And I wish there was something more than this 
Saturated loneliness 
And I wish I could feel it 
And I wish I could steal it 
Abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can 
It's just saturated loneliness 
And the bath waters cold 
And this lifes getting old 
And I wish I could feel it 
And I wish I could feel it 
And I wish I could steal it 
Abduct it, corrupt it 
And I wish I could feel it 
And I wish I could steal it 
And I wish I could feel it 
Abduct it, corrupt it 
But I never can 
I never can 
Never Can 
Never Can 
Never Can

I'm lying down in a pool of sin now 
So why does it feel so good within? 
Letting go, giving in!

Fuck you go away! 
Tell me what you want? 
Tell me what you want? 
Fuck you go away! 
Tell me what you want? 
Tell me what you want? 
Fuck you go away! 
Go away and never come back! 
I'm gonna cry to dive right in 
I'm gonna fight until I win now 
I'm running down in a pool of sin 
Letting go, giving in! 
Tell me what you want? 
Tell me what you want? 
Fuck you go away!

Sometimes it's better to eat their scars 
These are the times of the waking liar 
Hold him close or you will expire 
Holding on to the place you're thinking 
Total deceit 
I like to lose hope 
Receive and cope 
Like a beautiful rape 
These things, aren't they great? 
I'm terrified by emotionless faces 
They're all around me I want to die 
I'm fucking trippin' out seeing faces 
Of murderers covered in lye 
These are the times of the waking liar 
Hold him close or you will expire 
Holding on to the place you're thinking 
Total deceit 
I like to lose hope 
Receive and cope 
Like a beautiful rape 
These things, aren't they great? 
I love the things that make you upset 
The more you hurt, the stronger I get 
I love the things that make you upset 
The more you hurt, the stronger I get! 
I like to lose hope 
Receive and cope 
Like a beautiful rape 
These things, aren't they great? 
Aren't they great?

A wasted time to let it get to me 
An angry mouth with a broken heart 
Searching, for something that is safe 
Hurting, my pride that is the test 
Turning, my anger towards your flesh 
Rotting, we hold the end the bag 
Spurting, the blood that's on the bed 
Scolding, the hand that keeps me fed

Nowhere to run, no one to hold me

How you smiled as I cried 
You laughed, I bled everyday 
I could never get away

Nowhere to run, no one to hold me

No one to hold me 
I can't remember when 
You and I we walk as friends 
Never seen, a foolish idea 
How can these lies be a good bye now 
I, I will find 
You in my way 
A different pain 
Took inside of me 
I will find x4 
You in my way, a different pain 
Took the pride of me, one I'll never hold

You think it's funny? 
What the fuck you think it's doing to me? 
You take your turn lashing out at me 
I want you crying with your dirty ass in the front of me 
All of my hate cannot be found 
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming 
So you can try to tear me down 
Beat me to the ground 
I will see you screaming 
Come and fill the pages of my fantasies 
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown 
I wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me 
And I'll pull the trigger 
And you're down, down, down

All my friends are gone, they died (gonna take you down) 
They all screamed, and cried (gonna take you down) 
I got my monkey, got my monkey back against the wall (?)

Keep the pieces in the drawer 
Keep them there for ever more 
May come in use for someday 
Recycle this shit in someway

            <field name="lyrics">Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister 
Listening to your Twisted Transistor 
Hold it between your legs 
Turn it up, turn it up 
Low end is coming through 
Can't get enough 
A lonely life, where no one understands you 
But don't give up, because the music do 
Music do [x6] 
Because the music do 
And then it's reaching 
Inside you forever preaching 
Fuck you too 
Your scream's a whisper 
Hang on you 
Twisted Transistor 
Hey you, hey you, finally you get it 
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it 
And as your tears fall on 
Your breast, your dress 
Vibrations coming through 
You're in a mess 
A lonely life, where no one understands you 
But don't give up, because the music do 
Music do [x6] 
Because the music do 
And then it's reaching 
Inside you forever preaching 
Fuck you too 
Your scream's a whisper 
Hang on you 
Twisted Transistor 
Music do, Music do [x4] 
Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit 
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt 
Says who? Says who? 
Anesthetize this bitch 
Anesthetize this bitch, anesthetize! 
Just let me be 
Between you and me don't fit 
Because the music do 
And then it's reaching 
Inside you forever preaching 
Fuck you too 
Your scream's a whisper 
Hang on you 
Twisted Transistor

They mean nothing, you see 
Our dreams are lost 
Just a fantasy 
How many times have you been misguided? 
How many times have your hopes been smited? 
This life means nothing to me 
Victimized, deceived 
A black veil of insanity's crushing 
Like fire beating all of our disease 
The black veil of insanity misleads 
Our hearts are free 
Does that mean anything? 
Do what we're told 
Self-seeking hypocrisy 
How many times have you been misguided? 
How many times have your hopes been smited? 
This life means fuck to me 
Victimized, deceived 
A black veil of insanity's crushing 
Like fire beating all of our disease 
The black veil of insanity misleads 
Black veil, it's coming for me 
It's coming for me, it's coming for me 
It's coming for me, it's the black veil 
Of insanity, it's coming for me 
Set free, set free, set free, set free 
Set free, set free, set free, set free 
Set free 
Victimized, deceived 
A black veil of insanity's crushing 
Like fire beating all of our disease 
The black veil of insanity misleads</field>

You are my brothers 
Each one I would die for 
Please just let it go 
All our heads are blown 
Let's just take the stage 
And remember why we play for 
No more fighting! 
I swear I'm gonna leave

Once again 
Irrational 
I give in 
Paranoia 
Expands within 
Little voices start to begin: 
Everyone's out to take your joy away 
Constantly scheming to keep us at bay 
Everyone's plotting and they are just taking 
You must make it stop 
Make them pay 
Sometimes I just take things 
Way too far 
Irrational feeling 
I just try too hard 'cause 
What goes up, must come down 
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause 
Sometimes I just take things way too far 
Reality is surreal 
Wretchedness is all I feel 
Now its really just a way 
God, I hear the voices say:

Constantly scheming to keep us at bay

I can't take this 
All my life is wreckless 
All our lives our dangerous

That's what we do 
Sometimes things don't go away 
In turn you just run away 
It's all coming back for you 
Betrayed, life is in decay 
Your thoughts you cannot obey 
Right now, what cha gonna do?

I hear the calling of the helpless stranger 
He's all alone and no one hears his anger 
I feel his pain every time I'm here with you 
With you 
All the heartache and the fucked up insults 
I find you begging on your knees 
I figured 
This is how it's supposed to be with you 
With you 
I can't wait for your life to be broken down 
I gave you hate 
Ahh! 
I can't take this

Something inside of me has been taken away 
Feeling my heart breaking in vain 
It won't get better now

With my head 
There's nothing I can say 
I keep feeling like I'm to blame

Hopeless inside alone as I wait 
Brewing inside of me is your endless hate 
Feeling my heart breaking in vain

You're always trying and the lying always shines right through 
My God I hate this 
Always take shit 
And I let this go on 
Why can't I break this? 
I just take this 
As this goes on and on 
End 
When will this end? (x7)

There's nothing I can say

My love is dark and twisted 
And I scream when you're not there 
It's the interesting way, it fills my brain 
It's been beneath my eyes 
It's been never the same 
I love it when you're heavy and crack a smile 
The best is when you make it last a while 
Last it a while 
I love the way you hurt me 
I love that you don't care 
My love is dark and twisted 
And I scream when you're not there 
Can't seem to get away 
This ghost I'll never find

Ah ha ha ha ha! 
Wicked! 
Ha Ha! 1 2 3 and I come with the wicked 
style, and you know that I'm from the wicked crew, 
you act like you knew, 
but I got everybody jumping to the voodoo. 
You kickin' wicked rhymes, picket signs, 
me and my mob got a truck full of 9's. 
Play ya and I'll slay ya, 
I got thug-made dough by the hey-a. 
Ready to BUCK, BUCK, BUCK, 
but it's a must to DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, 
before I bust ya, looking for the one that did it, 
but like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it, 
cause I'm the one with the phat mad skills, 
and I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills. 
Sittin' at the pad just chillin' 
cos Larry Parker just got 2 million, 
oh what a fucking feeling! 
That nigger done pass me the pill, 
and I slam dunk it like Shaquille O'Neal. 
Wicked, wreckin' baby 
I'll rock that test tube baby, take it... 
'Cause I get Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire 
Yes I Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire 
Yes I Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire 
But now I'm in your face, so you'll keep on your fire 
Don't say nothing just listen, 
got me a plan to break Tyson out of prison. 
You going my way you get served, 
still got a deuce that'll bunny hop the curb. 
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin, 
never seen with a happy grin, 
show the phat frown cause I'm down, 
so take a look around, 
all you see is big black boots steppin', 
use my steel toe as a weapon. 
Kick ya and flip ya, 
now they want to label this nigger, 
tape with the sticker. 
Kickin out girls that's nasty, 
'cause I got a body count like Ice-T. 
From in New York 
I get them skins, and I ain't talking about pork. 
Your sly, you pig, dig, 
listen from the flow from a soul fro'ed caucasian, 
oh, your picket signs, you know all 
this funky ass wisdom picket budget talking. 
'Cause I get Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire 
Yes I Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire 
Yes I Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire 
But now I'm in your face, so you'll keep on your fire 
People wanna know how come I got a Gat 
and I'm sitting at the window like Malcolm, 
ready to bring that noise 
and going to get heavy like the Ghetto Boyz. 
April 29th was power to the people, 
and you might just see a sequel, 
'cause police got equal pay, 
a horse is a pig that don't fly straight. 
I'm doin' Daryl Gates but it's Willie Willams, 
I'm down with the pilgrims, 
I'm through with the pig, 
so I think the job is dead, get out... 
'Cause I get Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire 
Yes I Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire 
Yes I Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire 
But now I'm in your face, so you'll keep on your fire.</field>

Who think you're fly 
There's got to be a reason 
And we know the reason why 
You try to put on those airs 
And act real cool 
But you got to realize 
That you're acting like fools

Be free to dance

No romance, no romance 
No romance for me, mom

when all through the house 
Everybody was stoned 
even the mouse 
Man from the courthouse 
and me from jail 
I just settled down 
to get a piece of her tail 
When all of a sudden 
I heard such a clatter 
I tripped on my dick 
and busted my bladder!! 
I went downstairs 
and what did i see?! 
A fat little red fagget 
hangin from a tree 
He stuffed the stockings 
with reefers and beer 
And a big fat hairy dick 
for the family queer 
That's the end of my story 
Funny wasn't it, ya see? 
She didn't even... 
She didn't see my thing behind ya 
leave ya for this private eye 
I was there to give'em near to my 
zima zima mommy fah 
I'm gonna say this 
hope it don't offend ya 
came to the grizma 
give'em a taste of me 
give'em a little excitement to the damn monkey 
your monkey can stay with me 
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ahhhh ahhhhhhhh 
Chevy took my brain 
same old motherfucker sucked my dick that day 
he will never zima zima 
never never not that day 
I'm really sick of all this excitement 
yeah, but he thinks he's better than me 
uma zooma nooga dunga 
you can suck my dick all day 
one, two, three, four 
Santa can suck my dick all day!</field>

Saw my AK, it was broke up 
Put it together like a jigsaw 
Got my 9 and my rambo knife off the floor 
Went to the bathroom and beat the rush 
"Yo who the fuck used my toothbrush?" 
Went to my sisters room, "Yo bitch wake up" 
"You stupid ass, dirty ass nasty ass slut." 
Shot her in the leg, shot her in the thigh, 
kicked her in the pussy, and punched her in the eye 
Slapped her in the head, stepped on her cord, 
don't fuck around bitch word is bond. 
Went downstairs to eat with my folks 
"Ma...you broke the fuckin egg yolk" 
Punched her in the chest, got on her cheek 
Then I made her scream like the bitch was a thief 
Knee to the pussy, kick to the skull 
AK yo I shot the bitch in the temple 
Pops' got mad cuz Mom got licked 
I didn't give a fuck so I shot 'em in the dick 
Hungry ass fuck, said my grace 
Pop kept screamin' so I shot him in the face 
Ate my food found my coat 
Mail man came so I cut his mutha-fuckin' throat 
Waiting for the mutha-fuckin' school bus... 
I had a dream that I was hard...</field>

I just had to get out all my pain and suffering 
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you 
I'm your son 
 
Little child, looking so pretty 
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy 
Innocent child, looking so sweet 
A rape in my eyes and on your flesh I'll eat 
 
You've raped! 
I feel dirty 
It hurt! 
As a child 
Tied down! 
That's a good boy 
And fucked! 
Your own child 
I scream! 
No one hears me 
It hurt! 
I'm not a liar 
My God! 
Saw you watching 
Mommy why?! 
Your own child 
 
It's alright 
 
I didn't touch you there 
Mama said she didn't care 
I didn't touch you there 
That's why mama stopped and stared 
 
I fucking hate you! Motherfucker! 
Motherfucker! I fucking hate you! Fuck you! 
You son of a bitch, you fucking ruined my life! 
I wanted to die! 
I'm sick of it, mother fucker, oh oh 
Why'd you fuck'n do it to me? 
I hate you! 
I fuck'n hate you!

Throw your hate at me with all your might. 
Hit me 'cause I'm strange hit me. 
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me. 
What's with you boy? 
Think hard. 
A tattooed body to hide who you are. 
Scared to be honest, be yourself. 
A cowardly man. 
 
I don't run around, trying to be what's not within me. 
Look into my eyes. 
I am free. 
You're just a want to-be. 
 
Try and hit me again if you like. 
Throw your hate at me with all your might. 
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me. 
Tell me I'm a pussy and your harder than me.

A tattooed body to hide who you are. 
Scared to be honest, be yourself. 
A cowardly man. To come out. 
 
Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown 
Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown 
Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown

You're gonna waste your time, 
Your life will soon be mine, 
You're definitely one of a kind, and 
You're suffering 'cause of me - it's divine 
 
Tell me why you never liked me 
Tell me why it's that you fight me 
Pulled out and wait for the perfect time to take what's rightfully mine 
You think they're dumb to defy me 
You said you don't want to defy me 
You wait to dumb run anyone

Fuck you! 
I'm fed up with you!

Live your life insecure 
Feel the pain of your needles 
As they shit into my mind 
I scream without a sound 
How could you take away 
Everything that I was 
Made me a fuckin' slave 
Your face that I despise 
Your heart inside that's gray 
I came today to say 
You're fucked in every way 
 
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!

Many nights, painful thoughts occur

In denial, I tried to be your friend  
I tried to be a good boy  
All I see, a hate deep inside  
Startle me, someone save me  
Now these memories fill my heart  
They bury me  
All I want to do is kill you  
(You are not my real mother, I'll beat and stab and fuck her)  
(You are not my real mother, I'll beat and stab and fuck her)  
(You are not my real mother, I'll beat and stab and fuck her)

Looking back, I was never ever right, you were my step mom  
who always wanted me out of your sight  
I would come walkin' in and I'd say hello but you'd slap me  
And you'd make some fucked up comment about my clothes, but I tried to let it pass  
But the pictures in my head were with you with a knife up your ass  
Laying dead, so I popped some more caps in your ass now your son is not so fun  
Mother fucking bitch  don't you ever try to play me!  
You make me lie, it hurt so  
All I want to do is kill you  
All I want to do is kill you 
All I want to do is kill you 
All I want to do is kill you

Wish you were dead now  
Now, right now  
How can I cry over someone I never loved?

Why can't I decide, why my feelings I hide?  
Always screwing with my mind, a thorn in my spine  
Oh Sure, it feels fine, wasting all our time  
In the back of my mind, a thorn in my spine  
Wait!  
See it before my eyes  
Why!  
Go out that way  
 
Looking all the time, at your face so blind  
Feeling uptight, always the same fight  
Hey man, now decide, go ahead take your time  
Kissing all the time, that thorn in my spine  
Wait!  
You cannot see my side  
Why!  
Play yourself out that way  
Why!  
You and me always hate  
Wait!  
Weren't you my friend?  
 
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
 
Hey man, look inside, know you'll need your own life  
Remember me, guy? That thorn in your spine  
Waiting all the time, I'm doing mighty fine  
Remember me, guy? The thorn in your spine  
Wait!  
You can't even see my side  
Why!  
Play yourself out that way  
Why!  
You and me always hate  
Wait!  
Weren't you my friend?  
Wait! You were my friend 
Wait! You were my friend 
Wait! You were my friend 
Wait! You were my friend</field>

I see your faces and I do not understand why 
Each time I dream you're standing there right by my side 
Why do you make me? You take my pride and in my eyes 
 
You come and rape me, inside 
I have no place to run and hide 
I have no place to hide, which I like 
Some who look at the time I looked back into my life 
You want to touch me to see what's in my eyes 
Why do you make me? Remember my hate, all this shame 
 
Don't you hate me sometimes? 
I have no place to run and hide 
I have no place to hide, which I like 
I have no place to run, so don't make fun of me 
I have no place to run

Maximum respect to de man dem call Ice Cube (bo! bo!) 
And a bust a deuce-deuce or trey-eight bout to get WICKED! 
 
One, two, three and I come with the wicked 
style and you know that I'm from, the wicked 
crew, act like you knew 
Cause I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo, kick it 
Wicked, rhymes, picket, signs 
While me and the Mob gotta trunk fulla 9's 
Play ya and I'll slay ya 
I got thug-made dough by the ha-ir 
Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and it's a must 
to DUCK DUCK DUCK before I bust 
Lookin for the one that did it 
but like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it 
Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills 
and I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills 
Sittin at the pad just chillin 
cause Larry Wilkins just got two million, oh what a feelin 
So shake that nigga and pass me the pill 
and I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal 
Like it, dig it, maybe and watch that ass get ??? 
Kick it cause I get wicked 
 
Won't say nuttin, just listen 
Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison 
Come my way and get served 
Still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb 
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin 
Never seen with a happy grin 
Show the fat foul cause I'm down 
Take a look around 
and all you see is big black boots steppin 
Use my steel toe as a weapon 
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to 
label this nigga, tape with the sticker 
Kickin out girls that's nicety 
Yo, I gotta body count like Ice-T 
From here to New York 
I get skins and ain't talkin bout pork 
Swine, pig, dick 
Listen to the flow of a so-called negro 
who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett 
Dig it cause I get wicked 
 
People wanna know how come 
I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm 
Ready to bring that noise 
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys 
April 29th was power to the people 
and we might just see a sequel 
cos police got equal pay 
A horse is a pig that don't fly straight 
Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams 
down with the pilgrims 
Just a super slave 
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave 
I'm wicked enough to board this 
Cos now it's on to the fullest 
Gorilla straight from the mist 
But I don't miss when it comes to this 
Bring the yellow tape 
The white cape, cause I'm so straight 
Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it 
Bigot, cause I get wicked

Please just go away 
I can see inside you fine

Why you treat me this way? 
Make the hate stay 
A cell locked, I can never see no escape 
All the laughing, all the pain 
If you were me, what would you do? 
Nothing, probably. 
You'd just go on your way 
Fagot! 
 
I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it 
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it 
It keeps going on day after day, son 
You fake, if you don't want none 
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday 
Who gives a fuck right now I got something to say to all the people 
That think 
 
I'm strange and I should be out of here locked up in a cage 
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway 
You got this pretty-boy feeling like I'm enslaved to a world that 
Never appreciated shit 
You can suck my dick and fucking like it! 
Hear my gun, but he has a body mighty 
 
Any say, anyway, going to say, anyway, any say, 
Going away, going to say, anyway 
I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl 
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world

At least I got a phat, original band.  
 
Who's hot, who's not?  
You.  
You best step back, Korn on the cob, you need a new job.  
Time to  
Take them mic skills back to the dentist, and buy yourself a new grill.  
Fuck you.  
You pumpkin pie, I'll jack-off in your eye.  
Climbing shoots and ladders,  
While your ego shatters.  
But you just can't get away.  
Get a gay?  
'cause it's doomsday kid, it's doomsday.  
 
[Chorus] 
 
You call yourself a singer?  
Yep.  
You're more like Jerry Springer.  
Oh cool!  
Your favorite band is winger,  
Winger?  
And all you eat is Zingers.  
You're like a Fruity Pebble, your  
Favorite flag is rebel.  
Yea!  
It's just too bad that you're a fagot on a lower level.  
So you're from Jacksonville, kickin' it like Buffalo Bill.  
Gettin' butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck,  
While your sister's on her knees waitin' for your  
Little peanut.  
Wait, where'd ya get that little dance?  
Over here.  
Like them idiots in Waco, you're burning up in Bako where your father  
Had your mother, your mother had your brother, it's just too bad your  
Father's mad, your mother's now your lover.  
Come on hillbilly, can your horse do a fuckin' wheelie?  
You love it down  
South in the fall, you sure do got a purdy mouth.  
 
[Chorus] 
 
And I love you!  
And I want you!  
And I'll suck you!  
And I'll fuck you!  
And I'll butt-fuck you!  
And I'll eat you!  
And I'll lick your little dick, motherfucker.

ain't playin' games, my game, retain the tempo.

Nimpho's in the park, just dancin' in the rain. 
Hook me with this fix, and look to drain my aim, 
Some never retain what wouldn't suck from your veins. 
 
So baby I ask you... 
What do you want from me? 
 
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt 
You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked.

Rest us, rest us from the pain, if I ask. 
Ashamed cos a game keep playin' me wrong. 
Promise not to ever sing a damn 'nother song, 
Until I realize who the fuck I am.

trying to find some kind of inner link.

She's the epitomy of sweet misery, 
The sweeter the stroke, the deeper the pain given. 
There's an angel, angle sex-driven. 
Dangerous sex kitten, warm as a mitten. 
Fittin' like a glove, with abstract relations, 
Testin' all my patience, push comes to shove. 
Emotional masturbation, fuckin' with my love, 
Fuckin' with my life, fuckin' all the above. 
 
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt

Children of the Korn!  
I'm the first born!  
Fuck authority!  
Hit your ass in the head with my 40.  
You girls see more of me, after school, you better run to your 'pa.  
Class clown, I already know I'm a star.  
Your Children of the Korn was born,  
from your porn and twisted ass ways,  
now you look amazed.  
I'm sitting in a daze, in a purple haze.  
You better check my pulse, 'cause nothin' seems to faze.  
Bitch!  
Nothin' seems to faze.  
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn.  
Nothin' seems to faze.  
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn.  
 
Look and see, I feel the parents hating me.  
 
Hurt me. You hurt me.  
 
Why don't you step outside and feel me?  
 
Feel me! Feel me! Feel me!  
How you gonna tell me where to skate, who to date,  
how to fuck, how to kiss, who to love, who to diss,  
how to live. What it is, somethin' gotta give.  
Parents or the kids, it won't be the kids.  
What? It won't be the kids.  
We're talking shit, 'cause life is a 'biz.  
You know it is. Everybody tryin' to get rich. God damn!  
All I want to do is live. All I want to do is live.  
 
All I want to do is live!  
 
All I want to do is live.  
 
All, I, want, to, do, 
All, I, want, to, do, 
All, I, want, to, do, is live.  
 
Insanity.  
Stop fuckin' with me.  
Insanity.  
 
Stop, fuckin', with, me.  
Bitch!</field>

Something lost and never seen 
Every time I start to believe 
Something's raped and taken from me from me 
Life's gotta always be messing with me (You wanna see the light) 
Can't they chill and let me be free (So do I) 
Can't I take away all this pain (You wanna see the light) 
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain 
 
Sometimes I cannot take this place 
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste 
Sometimes I cannot feel my face 
You'll never see me fall from grace 
 
Something takes a part of me 
You and I were meant to be 
A cheap fuck for me to lay 
Something takes a part of me 
 
Feeling like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light) 
Feeling like I have no release (So do I) 
How many times have I felt diseased (You wanna see the light) 
Nothing in my life is free, is free 
 
Sometimes I cannot take this place 
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste 
Sometimes I cannot feel my face 
You'll never see me fall from grace

Not long ago  
Hiding behind the shadows  
Of your broken soul  
Why is it always you and something you can never have?  
Why did you you try to tell me?  
How could you be this way  
Your throat, I take grasp  
Can you feel the pain?  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain?  
Your racing through my veins  
Can't you feel the pain?  
Your heart stops beating  
Can't you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
 
Can't you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Can't you feel the pain  
There you are my precious  
With your broken soul  
 
Forever my crotch take control  
Why is it  
You fuck up something you have always had  
Why'd you try to tell me  
How could you be so cold?  
Your throat, I take grasp  
Can you feel the pain?  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain?  
 
Your racing through my veins  
Can't you feel the pain?  
Your heart stops beating  
Can't you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
Can't you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Can't you feel the pain  
Here I am, just a man  
Feeling the pain, gives me life  
Relieving us is my plan  
 
I'd anything to see through your eyes  
Just to see through your lies  
I hate you, Can you feel the pain?  
Can't you feel the pain?  
I hate you, Can you feel the pain?  
Your throat, I take grasp  
 
Can you feel the pain?  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain?  
Your racing through my veins  
Can't you feel the pain?  
Your heart stops beating  
Can't you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
Can't you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Can't you feel the pain</field>

I'm so dumb, there is nothing to hate.  
Really is it me, or is it fate?  
Give me peace, or release for fuck's sake.  
Give him something to say.  
Something super fly, never play.  
All I hear is disgrace.  
Erase them all and reclaim my place.  
In the past I was known as a freak.  
Had no friends, picked on 'cause I was weak.  
Save my ass, I got into this band,  
Never thought the band would pick on the man.  
Give him something to say.  
Something super fly, never play.  
All I hear is disgrace.  
Erase them all and reclaim my place.  
Reclaim my place 
 
Say it to my face.  
So I look around at all these stupid little faces.  
Something I can never slap, but I embrace.  
You'll never ever see, you'll never ever be,  
You wanna fuck around, then come fuck with me.  
You think you can't relate?  
You'll never ever find.  
You think you feel my hate?  
Look at me and you will find  
My fate you always raped?  
I will always be the son.  
You want to fuck with me?  
Come on, fucking play!  
 
Now! 
 
You can feel it now or be stoned!  
Yes, you feel it come, right now!  
You can feel it now or be stoned

I remember there's a certain place, a place I wish I'd stay.  
I feel so lost within, pressured, I'm headed for that day.  
Just one thought in my head, really.  
Do I need this fame?  
 
Every time, god damn, I look at my son, I see something I can't be.  
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.  
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,  
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  
I lay in bed at night and wonder, should I go on this way?  
 
It's the only thing I really got for now, and it's called fame.  
Every time, god damn, I look at my son, I see something I can't be.  
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.  
 
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,  
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  
So I see this face so innocent and fine, and so fine.  
So I see this face and I realize it's mine.  
I feel the rattle 
 
So I see this face so innocent and fine, and so fine.  
So I see this face and I realize it's mine.  
I feel the rattle 
 
Every time, god damn, I look at my son, I see something I can't be.  
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.

You're the crowd  come on give it back to me. 
You won't beg for me  beg for me  beg for me. 
 
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me. 
You're the crowd  come on give it back to me. 
You won't beg for me  be there for me  beg for me. 
 
Tell me, how could this fade? 
I am going in shame. 
And I could not have my pain. 
Everyone please let me be. 
'Cause we're on stage. 
And it's gone and I am free. 
 
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me. 
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me. 
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me. 
 
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me. 
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me. 
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me. 
 
I feel the shame. 
I'm not insane. 
The things I feel now. 
Aren't the same. 
Who gives a fuck. 
 
If my life sucks? 
I just know one day. 
I won't give up. 
 
Everyone just let me be. 
 
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me. 
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me. 
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me. 
 
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me. 
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me. 
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me. 
 
Be there, for me.</field>

My time  is gone today 
You flirt with suicide 
Sometimes  that's ok 
Hear what others say

Falling away from me 
Falling away from me 
Day  is here fading 
That's when  I would say 
I flirt with suicide 
Sometimes kill the pain 
I can always say 
'It's gonna be better tomorrow' 
Falling away from me 
Falling away from me 
 
Beating me down 
Beating me  beating me 
Down, down 
Into the ground 
Screaming so sound 
Beating me, beating me 
Down, down 
Into the ground 
 
(Falling away from me) 
It's spinning round and round 
(Falling away from me) 
It's lost and can't be found 
(Falling away from me) 
It's spinning round and round

So down 
 
Beating me down

Take me to a different place 
Which you don't often find 
I see a family walking, always thinking of being somewhere else in time 
So I fall face down in a rut I can't seem to get out of 
Please wake me 
Please give me some of it back 
The feelings I had 
Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you, it doesn't matter 
Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth, I can't handle! 
 
[Chorus] 
Lets get this party started! 
I'm sick of begging you! 
You make me feel insane 
Which I did to you! 
Lets get this party started! 
You make me feel insane! 
I want to be the one! 
To make my self sane! 
 
Time is ticking 
It makes me feel content 
With what I have inside 
Constant paranoia 
Surrounds me 
Everyone I see 
Is out to get me 
So I fall face down in a rut I can't seem to get out of 
Please wake me 
Please give me some of it back 
The feelings I had 
Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you 
It doesn't matter 
Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth 
I can't handle!

You make me feel insane 
You make me feel insane 
You make me feel insane 
You make me fell insane 
You make me fell insaaaaaannnnnneeee

Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth 
I Can't handle

To the place where people haunt me 
I can't help but give up 
Falling to the place where people know me 
I can't wait

Keeping inside me 
For all to take 
Picking at me 
They're ripping at me 
Ripping at me

So what the fuck is with you. 
 
Your feelings I can't help but rape them. 
I'm sorry I don't feel the same. 
My heart inside is constantly hating. 
I'm sorry I just throw you away. 
 
I don't know why I'm so fucking cold? 
I don't know why it hurts me. 
All I want to do is get with you. 
And make the pain go away. 
Why do I have a conscience? 
All it does is fuck with me. 
Why do I have this torment? 
All I want to do is fuck it away.

When all through the house 
Everybody was stoned 
Even the mouse 
 
Man from the whore house 
And me from jail 
I just settled down 
To get a piece of her tail 
 
When all of a sudden 
I heard such a clatter 
I tripped on my dick 
And busted my bladder 
 
I went downstairs 
And what did I see? 
A fat little red fagget 
Hangin' from a tree 
 
He stuffed the stockings 
With reefers and beer 
And a big fat hairy dick 
For the family queer 
 
That's the end of my story 
Funny wasn't it, ya see? 
 
She didn't even 
She didn't see my thing behind ya 
Leave ya for this private eye 
I was there to give 'em near to my 
Zima zima mommy fah 
 
I'm gonna say this 
Hope it don't offend ya 
Came to the grizma 
Give 'em a taste of me 
Give 'em a little excitement to the damn monkey 
Your monkey can stay with me 
Ahh, ahh, ahh 
 
Chevy took my brain 
Same old motherfucker, sucked my dick that day 
He will never zima zima 
Never, never not that day 
 
I'm really sick of all this excitement 
Yeah, but he thinks he's better than me 
Uma zooma nooga dunga 
You can suck my dick all day 
One, two, three, four 
Santa can suck my dick all day

We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace) 
 
My life, worry, life is story 
Give up, beating 
I'll start, needing 
 
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate 
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate 
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate 
Will he keep fuckin' with me? There's nowhere else to go! 
 
So I walk but seem to crawl 
For, I'm giving in today 
Now I run into a wall 
Cause I cannot fight my way 
 
You've gotta come with me (I cannot stand this place) 
We're falling off the world (and I'll give in this way) 
We had a chance to run (and now I can't believe) 
We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace) (Embrace Embrace [x4]) 
 
Oh 
Uh, uh, uh uh. 
Uh, uh, uh uh. 
Uh, uh, uh uh. 
Uh, uh, uh uh. 
 
What really do I have to follow? 
Nothing makes sense at all. 
Taking something for nothing 
Watch me as I fall. 
 
I'm bringing me down [x3] 
I'm bringing me...down 
 
You've gotta come with me (I cannot stand this place) 
We're falling off the world (and I'll give in this way) 
We had a chance to run (and now I can't believe) 
We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace) [x2]</field>

Pushing all the mercy down, down, down 
I want to see you try to take a swing at me 
Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground 
 
Why are you trying to make fun of me? 
You think it's funny? 
What the fuck you think it's doing to me? 
You take your turn lashing out at me 
I want you crying when you're dirty in the front of me 
 
All of my hate cannot be found 
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming 
So you can try to tear me down 
Beat me to the ground 
I will see you screaming 
 
Come and fill the pages of my fantasies 
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown 
I want to kill and rape you the way you raped me 
And I'll pull the trigger 
And you're down, down, down 
 
Why are you trying to make fun of me? 
You think it's funny? 
What the fuck you think it's doing to me? 
You take your turn lashing out at me 
I want you crying when you're dirty in the front of me 
 
All of my hate cannot be found 
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming 
So you can try to tear me down 
Beat me to the ground 
I will see you screaming 
 
All my friends are gone, they died (gonna take you down) 
They all screamed, and cried (gonna take you down) 
 
I got my monkey, got my monkey back against the wall 
Gonna take you down 
 
All of my hate cannot be found 
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming 
So you can try to tear me down 
Beat me to the ground

Why can't you just shut your face? 
Oh god the feelings I feel 
Would get me thrown in a cage 
You're the one who's always screaming at me 
I'm the one that keeps your lives so care free 
What the fuck more do you want me to be? 
Why must you do this to me? 
 
Run away, I can't see 
Lead the way, make them pay 
 
Counting, on me.  
Always hoping I'll be 
There for all of your problems 
and in turn you're never there for me 
You sucked the life out of me 
You hate everything you see 
I can't take this anymore 
I always stay when I should leave 
 
You see the pain in my face 
While you keep putting me down 
Inside the rage starts to build 
You push me I won't go down 
You're the one who's always screaming at me 
I'm the one that keeps your so lives care free 
What the fuck more do you want me to be?

Could it really be the day, today? 
Could this really make the problems go away? 
I'm going to hurt just not in time

I feel like I'm dead 
Not thinking straight 
Inside my body, troubled, full of hate 
I had to let it out before it's too late 
 
Deep inside, it can hide! 
Feeling so lost and betrayed 
Why does this happen to me every time 
Stuck in this place, where I can't escape 
Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
 
Why won't it fade 
Outside I had to lie; "I'm OK", 
I hope someday, I'll stop getting pain 
I guess this is a lie, I have made 
 
Deep inside, it can hide! 
Feeling so lost and betrayed 
Why does this happen to me every time 
Stuck in this place, where I can't escape 
Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
 
What am I doing? 
I can't believe this 
I have been hiding 
Wanting to be less 
Giving to people, 
They take from me 
Always they bring drama to me 
 
Look, look at me now 
Now 
 
Feeling so lost and betrayed 
Why does this happen to me every time 
Stuck in this place, where I can't escape 
Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
 
I can't stand all this fucking pain

Please God just make the pain...</field>

We'll bury all this pain

Hey, I know 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
I cannot survive, Alone 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
 
Our lives, were good in every way 
Too late, time after time 
Our love just turned to hate 
But we stayed by, each others side 
 
We pushed our buttons far inside  
We tear our hearts out 
Then we fight 
 
Hey, I know 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
I cannot survive alone 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
 
I keep holding on, I feel I'm where I belong 
Every time we fight it feels so wrong 
I feel so enslaved fuck my pride 
Then we meet again 
 
We pushed our buttons far inside 
We tear our hearts out 
Then we fight 
 
Hey, I know 
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
I cannot survive alone

Telling me lies and it's killing me 
Why they all want to get rid of me

Several try to disguise the devil in them 
Wanting to get into my cerebellum but I'm 
Ready and willing to tell them that I can't f with them 
Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling 
Like my dick does when watching naked women 
Do sick stuff on my porn collection on television 
 
Trust nobody 
I don't know who to call a friend 
They all just pretend to be 
Fuck Everybody this is to all of y'all 
'cause everybody is an enemy 
'cause everybody is an enemy 
 
Watching my own back 
Strapped in chrome, to my homies 
Where the tombstones at, where the hoes at? 
'cause to many didn't act like dikes, hermaphrodites 
With benzene, amen 
Look at the trash they biting 
The life in times is kinda weaker 
Like the time and life of the sandman 
On Apollo theater 
Imagine that another black with a hook 
Who pulls the wack talent off the stage 
I'm in raged 
 
Trust nobody 
I don't know who to call a friend 
They all just pretend to be 
Fuck Everybody this is to all of y'all 
'cause everybody is an enemy

You fill your lies around me 
And you think you've won 
You feel you can control me 
With the things you've done 
 
You think that you can take me 
You think that you can play me 
You're going to start to hate me 
I feel that you disgraced me 
I feel that you disgraced me 
I feel that you disgraced me 
I feel that you disgraced me

Not hurt just fucked away 
I'm devastated and frustrated 
God I feel so bound

I think it's time to bleed 
I'm gonna cut myself and 
Watch the blood hit the ground

Got a weird thing to show you so tell all the boys and girls 
Tell your brother, your sister and your mamma too 
We're about to go down and you know just what to do 
 
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care 
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare 
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick mamma 
Come on baby tell me what's the word 
 
Word up, everybody say 
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway 
Word up, it's the code word 
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard 
 
Now all you sucker DJ's who think you're fly 
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why 
You try to put on those airs and act real cool 
But you got to realize that you're acting like fools 
 
If there's music we can use it be free to dance 
We don't have the time for psychological romance 
No romance, no romance, no romance for me mamma 
Come on baby tell me what's the word 
 
Word up, everybody say 
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway 
Word up, it's the code word

            <field name="lyrics">Yo pretty ladies around the world 
Got a weird thing to show you so tell all the boys and girls 
Tell your brother, your sister and your mamma too 
We're about to go down and you know just what to do 
 
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care 
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare 
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick mamma 
Come on baby tell me what's the word 
 
Word up, everybody say 
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway 
Word up, it's the code word 
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard 
 
Now all you sucker DJ's who think you're fly 
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why 
You try to put on those airs and act real cool 
But you got to realize that you're acting like fools 
 
If there's music we can use it be free to dance 
We don't have the time for psychological romance 
No romance, no romance, no romance for me mamma 
Come on baby tell me what's the word 
 
Word up, everybody say 
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway 
Word up, it's the code word 
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard 
 
Word up, everybody say 
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway 
Word up, it's the code word 
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard 
 
Word up, everybody say

Lick it dip it and for no particular reason 
She crawls on the floor 
Slides against the door 
Precious fingers shows her blossom in this season 
 
Doesn't matter she'll be doing it her way 
Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2 way 
Doesn't matter she'll be doing it her way 
Every night, every day 
 
I! 
Never meant to show up here anyway 
I'm! 
Only fucking you till the seasons change 
 
Treasure deep between the places that you hold dear 
Came to her to act as if we are in love here 
Lying across this chair 
Fingers everywhere 
To the follies of the angels up above, yea 
 
Doesn't matter she'll be doing it her way 
Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2 way 
Doesn't matter she'll be doing it her way 
Every night, every day 
 
I! 
Never meant to show up here anyway 
I'm! 
Only fucking you till the seasons change 
 
When you come (be a good girl) 
Hold your breath (make it last long) 
It is called (death) 
The little death (death girl) 
 
I! 
Never meant to show up here anyway 
I'm! 
Only fucking you till the seasons change

When my brains tickin' like a bomb 
Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me 
Sweet bitter words 
Unlike nothing I have heard 
Sing along Mocking bird 
You don't affect me 
 
That's right! 
Deliver it to my heart! 
Please strike! 
Be deliberate 
 
Wait

Too late 
I'm coming undone 
What looks so strong, so delicate 
 
Wait 
I'm starting to suffocate 
And soon I anticipate 
I'm coming undone 
What looks so strong, so delicate 
 
Choke, choke again 
I thought my demons were my friends 
Pity me in the end 
They're out to get me 
Since I was young 
I tasted sorrow on my tongue 
And this sweet chocolate gun does not protect me 
 
That's right! 
Trigger between my eyes 
Please strike! 
Make it quick now! 
 
Wait 
I'm coming undone 
I'm irate 
I'm coming undone 
Too late 
I'm coming undone 
What looks so strong, so delicate 
 
Wait 
I'm starting to suffocate 
And soon I anticipate 
I'm coming undone 
What looks so strong, so delicate 
 
I'm trying to hold it together 
Head is lighter than a feather 
Looks like I'm not getting better 
Not getting better 
 
Wait 
I'm coming undone irate 
I'm coming undone too late 
I'm coming undone

Drops of blood drip off your medals 
Representing all our tears

To define the what and why 
People travel across this earth 
Over water, land, and sky 
 
How you wanna be, what you gonna say

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver 
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars

Weeping rows of Jeremiah 
Purity unlike no other 
Offers help to those who need it 
Don't forget care to the brother 
 
How you wanna be, what you gonna say it 
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay 
Little lady at home 
Writing out a check to send 
It's all the money that she owns 
She believes the world might end

But don't give up your instincts 
Hang onto you know what 
They'll be gone fast as you blink 
They're trained to seduce you 
Suck you dry quick as they can 
They tried to reduce you 
Now you're barely a man 
 
Oh my God 
How can you deny the blood 
That's flowing through you 
 
Hey you 
You're saying that she's all that you desire 
Liar 
Hey you 
You think you can throw water on this fire 
Liar 
 
It's not wrong to let go 
And let the woman ride you 
For fuck sake, don't lose touch 
With the dog that's inside you 
She wanted what you had 
You bet she smelt the spore 
Don't give up, fuck her up 
One more time, slam that door

How can you deny the blood

You're holding my heart, screaming 
Motherfucker 
That left me broken, bleeding 
Son of 
The man you loved and left for 
The son of a bitch 
Who tried to show me death's door 
 
Oh 
 
Everything's eliminated 
Everything is dedicated 
To the meaningless stuff i've hated 
Everything was overrated 
 
Love song for the dear departed 
Head stone for the broken hearted 
I'm used to kill, for flowers to steal 
Head trip for the mortal earth bound 
One sip of the blood that i've found 
Lying here 
I'm dying here 
 
Ascend 
Obituary's rain down 
It's our fate 
We're lying naked face down 
 
Oh 
 
All together decapitated 
Can you see me grab ? 
Living with the dead god dammit 
All together being dismantled 
 
Love song for the dear departed 
Head stone for the broken hearted 
I'm used to kill, for flowers to steal 
Head trip for the mortal earth bound 
One sip of the blood that i've found 
Lying here 
I'm dying here (dying here) 
 
Don't bring me daffodil's 
Bring a boquet of pills 
Straight through like radium 
Cracked through the cranium 
Protect me when you can 
Respect me when i am DYING 
 
A song for the dear departed 
Head stone for the broken hearted 
I was to kill, for flowers to steal 
Head trip for the mortal earth bound

I'm quite certain 
Say it ain't so 
You're corrupted by some sick fuck 
Oh no 
Open up now 
Head in the sky 
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies, 
Still, it's in my mouth, 
You breathe in but can't breathe out. 
 
What you been taking 
It makes you talk real slow 
How come I'm thinking you'd be the last to know (you'd be the last to know) 
 
Choking you gently 
Gaining control 
Hand you the shovel 
To dig your own hole 
 
Open up now

As they crawl back under the stars

And I wish there was something more than this 
Saturated loneliness 
 
And I wish I could feel it 
And I wish I could steal it 
Abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can 
It's just saturated loneliness 
 
Does the silence get lonely? 
Does the silence get lonely? 
Who knows? 
I've been hearing it tell me 
I've been hearing it tell me 
Go home 
 
Cause the freaks are playing tonight 
They packed up and turned out the lights 
 
And I wish there was something 
Please tell me theres something better 
And I wish there was something more than this

And this life's getting old

I'm really weak 
Missing parts 
Incomplete

Hold me up into the light 
Fix the cracks and fix them right 
Keep the pieces in the drawer 
Keep them there for ever more

My mama's talkin' to me 
Try to tell me how to live 
But I don't listen to her 
'Cause my head is like a sieve 
 
My daddy, he disowned me 
'Cause I wear my sisters clothes 
He caught me in the bathroom 
With a pair of pantyhose 
 
My basketball coach, 
He done kick me off the team 
For wearing high heel sneakers 
And acting like a queen 
 
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree, to a tree 
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree 
 
Gonna tie his pecker to a tree 
 
Get your boogie on 
Go head 
 
The earth is coming to an end 
And I don't give a damn 
As long as I have my bitch 
Oh and my fly gear 
 
It don't bother me 
If people think I'm funny 
'Cause I'm a big rock star 
And I'm makin' lots of money 
 
Money! money! money! money 
 
Are you talking pesos? 
 
Money, ka-ching! ka-ching 
 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha 
Lots of money(x3) 
I'm so bloody rich 
Lots of money 
Lots of muthafuckin' money 
I get rich 
 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha 
I own shopping centers, and parking lots 
And stars, and all that shit 
 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha 
I own you! ha! you too! you three 
For me, hee hee, hoh hoh 
 
Get your groove on 
Let's bring it back one more time, Jonathan 
Jonathan on them drums, getting ever slower 
More groovin', slow that shit down crazy slow 
Come on, death, right here, slow, ah 
Don't give a fuck, break it out 
You even know boy George is on heroin 
We don't give a fuck 
Rick James is in the crack house 
I'm f****n' paying, that's all that matters 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ahh, ha, ha, ha! 
 
The bomb is a fuckin in the house 
Loco! ooooh ahhh oooo 
Gimme some

Man I got to let it out 
Am I quitting? 
Screaming nothing ever comes out 
I keep feeling lost 
I'll never find my way out 
I'm not thanking them 
Unless the truth can pour out 
 
Give me some courage 
Beating me down the (?) sometime 
Are you laughing at my body? 
I hate and slide 
I hate and slide 
 
I take this time 
To let out what's inside 
Cause I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow 
You may bestow my pride 
And all this hate is bottled up inside 
 
My heart is breaking 
Man you really ripped it out 
You take pleasure watching as I claw my way out 
 
The hurt rising 
Soon it's going to tear my soul out 
It's not kosher feeling like I'm on my way out 
 
Give me some courage 
Beating me down the (?) sometime 
Are you laughing at my body? 
I hate and slide 
I hate and slide 
 
I'll take this time 
To let out what's inside 
Cause I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow 
You may bestow my pride 
And all this hate is bottled up inside 
 
Feeling the haze as they cut down my spine 
Peeling your flesh like the way you've cut mine 
Do you feel happy you fucked up my mind 
You're going to pay this time 
 
I'll take this time 
To let out what's inside 
Cause I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow 
You may bestow my pride. 
And all this hate is bottled up inside

Cause I will panic 
Sometimes I wish you'd die 
Full of sorrow

Some how making me feel sane 
 
Waiting all this time 
I've got nothing to hold on 
But the faces of my life 
I can see before I'm gone 
 
Sometimes I feel it chasing me 
All the hate that's breaking free 
I realize I'm taking everything 
And the shit seems to follow 
 
This time I feel it taking me 
To a place I hate to be 
All along I sing to make believe 
And the shit seems to follow 
 
I'm thinking of, 
Making all the fucked people 
Making the bitches I love 
Make them die and go away 
 
Pain from the start 
All my dreams are ripped apart 
Thanking all the fucked people

To a place where I can cry 
So what can it be? 
No one hears me call, 
Echoes back at me 
No ones there. 
 
To all these nameless feelings 
I can't deal with in my life 
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine 
You've got to fill your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind 
I know its time to leave these places far behind 
You and me 
We have no faces 
They don't see us anymore 
 
Without love as they had promised

Where are all these feelings hiding? 
 
Dancing in and out my mind 
Burning up all that I long for 
Feeding me till my decline 
Where are you? My soul is bleeding 
I am searching am I blind? 
All alone and bound forever 
Trapped inside me for all time 
To all these nameless feelings 
I can't deal with in my life

Trying to feed on what is mine

Starts the game 
Why can't this puzzle be solved 
Each time it happens it's 
 
Always the same 
I look down and then start to bawl 
And all I see it burned my eyes 
Burning all inside 
 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over (taking all that's mine) 
One more time. 
 
Always this teasing 
Sometimes I lose faith 
Where is my strength to hold on? 
Facing existence how can I relate? 
 
Do I stand clear or move on? 
And all I see it burned my eyes 
Burning all inside 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over (taking all that's mine) 
One more time.  
One more time.  
 
Falling through this space in time 
Buried in this hurt of mine 
Falling slowly like a dream 
Falling through a world unseen 
 
Why can I not break this spell? 
I'm in darkness, is this hell? 
Falling towards this hole I see 
This is how it has to be. 
 
Caught in the corners of my mind 
Beginning over one more time 
Taking me over (taking all that's mine) 
One more time.  
 
One more time.  
One more time.

I reach for your wrists to feel the pulse 
Your feeling yourself for both of us

We got a problem

Which one, which one of you is into me 
Which one, which one of me is into you 
We're both schizophrenic I fear

Which one, which one of you is into me 
Which one, which one of me is into you 
We are schizophrenic, don't stop 
No, not 'til I f**k this song up 
 
All the searching we do inside 
Is a futile attempt to 
Is this what we're meant to never know? 
It's all screwed up how the river flows 
 
And I know that you try real hard 
To sing to yourself but 
Was I the beast that sucked into you? 
A real dark victim down inside of you 
 
We got a problem, it's plain to see 
 
B**** we got a problem

Nice to f**king meet you 
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you

In the gene pool 
Show no mercy, people here say 
Kill the damned fool 
This illness is like a monster that is 
Eating us alive 
 
Hold on, be strong 
So right, so wrong 
With all of our senses 
All of our defenses 
Hold on, be strong 
 
My 
Soul 
Blood 
Run 
 
Don't ever let me go, no 
Don't ever let me go, no 
Never never let you go, no 
I'll never let you go, no 
 
Hold on, be strong 
So right, so wrong 
With all of our senses 
All of our defenses 
Hold on, be strong</field>

Is a good day to go 
Guess you want me to stay 
Well let me know 
And I hate to say 
It's been a waste of time 
I hate to interrupt the flow 
 
[Chorus] 
Why, Why, Why 
Hushabye 
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go? 
Why, Why, Why 
Hushabye 
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show? 
 
You say you'd love to 
But you've lost what's left to do 
Almost decided to stay because of you 
And I'm here today to exchange your dreams 
For one more ticking of your time 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Why, why 
What you hanging up for? 
What you doing that for? 
What you breakin' up for? 
Why, hushabye 
 
I hate to interrupt the flow 
For one more ticking of your time 
 
Soothing Sunday is a good day to go 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Hushabye 
Why, why, why I 
What you breaking up for?

Almost am a ghost of who I use to be, yesterday  
How you going to touch and how will you collect the beauty when it turns to dust?  
Everything we make, the cells we generate are both of us 
 
[Chorus]  
Please be aware that I am you 
Nothing could be more certain  
This ain't the time, the place, for us to understand this life 
 
Hold you in my arms, I'll hold you in my gaze, singing with my dying breath 
Underneath this earth I'd resurrect your soul and nothing less 
Sorry for the space, if I could fill the void an ocean wouldn't hold the love 
And everything I have and all I ever was is not enough 
 
[Chorus]  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain

So why is your alarm bell ringing

You need a way to get along 
A way to carry on 
A symptom for the pain you're making 
And surely you should know 
That everywhere you go 
There's hazard in the world you're making 
 
[Chorus] 
 
You run it, so you best believe it 
You sold it, now your soul perceives it 
You wave a book but now agree with this 
The damage of betrayal 
To hell with that

A reason to deceive 
A reason for the song you're singing

Spinning to nothing

So come on and play 
Stab me in the heart 
So long this time was wasted ripping me apart 
 
We are the hurt inside your head 
Lost in the boil waters dead 
Constantly twisting things I've said 
Happiness is boiling pain instead 
 
Its starting over (x2) 
Can't stand it's over 
God is gonna to take me out 
My time is over 
This time is over 
Why is this over God is gonna take me out 
 
God is gonna take me out (x4) 
 
Crawling on the floor 
All around this space 
Talking to myself why is this thing I got to face 
Walking through a door 
Has it been a waste 
Going on and on 
Thinking I could find my place 
 
We are the hurt inside your head 
Lost in the boil waters dead 
Constantly twisting things I've said 
Happiness is boiling pain instead 
 
It's starting over (x2)

God is gonna to take me out 
My time is over 
This time is over 
Why is this over 
God is gonna take me out 
 
God is gonna take me out(x6) 
 
You can see 
I'm torn away from you 
And everything that's close to me 
I can't not face the truth 
It's nothing that I believe 
Just ran away from me 
And thank me when your free from me 
Come take me 
 
Come take me(x4) 
 
We are the hurt inside your head 
Lost in the boil waters dead 
Constantly twisting things I've said

They're called back to a waiting glove 
Oh, why don't they fly away? 
 
Surely they have gangs by now 
There is no gun to shoot them down 
And still they stay for what they say 
 
Are we killing them with lies? 
Are we fighting for the life? 
Killing them with thoughts 
Can we never get enough? 
 
Killing them, are we killing 
Killing every single feeling? 
It's a trained response 
 
Birds are circling above 
They're called back to a waiting glove 
This sordid game, it fears my name 
 
I have worshiped some false gods 
I run to them like Pavlov?s dogs 
To hide my shame, it fanned the flame 
 
Are we killing them with lies? 
Are we fighting for the life? 
Killing them with thoughts 
Can we never get enough?

Killing every single feeling?

We're all preset to reset to die 
We're all preset to reset to die 
 
Somebody told me once 
Beat them 'til they start to get used to it 
Next thing, they're lining up 
 
Are we killing it? 
Are we killing it? 
Are we killing it? 
Are we killing it? 
 
Are we killing it? 
Are we killing it? 
Are we killing it?

Constantly its silent and loud 
 
I am who I am 
There's nothing I can do

Remember who you are

Why I'm always playing 
Walking around with my head down 
I don't want to be like anyone 
What the fuck could I have done 
To deserve this terror somehow 
Trapped underneath the stairs 
Dealing with the fears 
Constantly its silent and loud

I am the problem 
Inside I have nowhere to go 
 
Inside I have nowhere to go 
Inside I have nowhere to go 
Inside I have nowhere to go 
No where to fucking go

Where is your self control 
Why can't you just be honest 
The corruption takes its toll 
 
You rape our hope 
Too proud to cope 
You built this house of shame 
You smile, you gloat 
This disease you promote 
An infection is what we are now 
 
I can't believe this happened 
The fear starts to grab hold 
Then anger starts to take over 
I will not be controlled 
 
You rape our hope 
Too proud to cope 
You built this house of shame 
You smile, you gloat 
This disease you promote 
An infection is what we are now 
 
They're taking over now 
Eating up our souls somehow 
Taking over now 
Parasites, they run around 
The culprits won't be found 
They lie behind this mask of wealth 
They're taking over now 
Illuminati they hide 
 
You rape our hope 
Too proud to cope 
You built this house of shame 
You smile, you gloat

What's the problem 
Why can't you relax? 
Inside hating on everything, that makes me mad 
Love is scary and love is to blame 
Guess I'll lose you and that is a shame

I gotta get away

But the question is how can you really be healed? 
Hate is scary and hate is to blame 
God, I need you and that is a shame 
Because I need you

Thought I stumbled upon salvation 
Hell I found

Well, I'll never be the same 
It's the greatest lie ever told 
No, I'll never be the same 
I sold my soul

1 I love hurting you

3 Lets get together and play this sin ours game 
4 is for the torture and 
5 is for the shame 
Cause ever time you want it I get off on this game 
 
You wanted to play the coldness follows 
This isn't a game your life full swallow 
And I can't help to smile at your pain 
You wanted to play but I already won 
 
Golding I plant the seed inside your head right away 
Watch it grow, destroying your insides 
Pleading to comfort you with my sadistic ways 
I watch the tears fall, I crack a smile

I give it to you take it back, take it back 
This lullaby is all you have, all you have 
Sadistic pleasure I attack, I attack

I'm gonna cry to dive right in 
I'm gonna fight until I win now 
I'm running down in a pool of sin 
Letting go, giving in! 
 
Tell me what you want? 
Tell me what you want? 
Fuck you go away! 
Tell me what you want? 
Tell me what you want? 
Fuck you go away! 
Tell me what you want? 
Tell me what you want? 
Fuck you go away! 
Go away and never come back! 
 
Never come back 
Never come back! 
Go away and never come back! 
Go away! 
Go away! 
 
Tell me what you want? 
Tell me what you want? 
Fuck you go away! 
Tell me what you want?

Go away and never come back! 
 
Never come back! 
Never come back!</field>

My thoughts I cannot convey 
It's all pointing straight at you 
We hate loving everyday 
Our lives twirled in every way 
I give it all back to you 
 
I can't help this going down 
 
I can't take this 
All my life is wreckless 
All our lives our dangerous 
But we fake our way through 
That's what we do 
 
Sometimes things don't go away 
In turn you just run away 
It's all coming back for you 
Betrayed, life is in decay 
Your thoughts you cannot obey 
Right now, what cha gonna do? 
 
I can't help this going down 
 
I can't take this 
All my life is wreckless 
All our lives our dangerous 
But we fake our way through 
That's what we do 
 
We do, we do, we do, we do, 
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do 
 
I hear the calling of the helpless stranger 
He's all alone and no one hears his anger 
I feel his pain every time I'm here with you 
With you 
All the heartache and the fucked up insults 
I find you begging on your knees, I figured 
This is how it's supposed to be with you 
With you 
 
I can't wait for your life to be broken down 
I gave you hate 
 
Ah! 
 
I can't take this 
All my life is wreckless 
All our lives our dangerous 
But we fake our way through 
That's what we do 
I can't take this 
All my life is wreckless 
All our lives our dangerous 
But we fake our way through 
 
That's what we do</field>

I really don't care anyway 
Happiness I'm looking to borrow 
Even four last seconds okay 
I'm starting to feel so so hollow 
Fill me up then go on your way 
I doubt I'll be leasing tomorrow 
So I'll just do my best anyway. 
 
Hold me now 
I've been knocking down 
Killing all these waves of shame 
Hold me down 
Feeling not so sound 
Wish I wasn't born today. 
 
I'm starting to break my devotion 
What does that mean anyway? 
Running into signs interwoven 
So much that it gets in my way 
I'm starting to feel so so hollow 
Fill me up then go on your way 
I doubt I'll be leasing tomorrow 
So I'll just do my best anyway. 
 
Hold me now 
I've been knocking down 
Killing all these waves of shame 
Hold me down 
Feeling not so sound 
Wish I wasn't born today 
 
Hold me now 
I've been knocking down 
Killing all these waves of shame. 
Hold me down 
Feeling not so sound 
Wish I wasn't born today.</field>

Or do I stand my ground and accept my faith? 
 
And there's the faceless cries, that twist my every dream 
And almost every night I hear the demon sing 
 
Why are we going on this way? 
Why do we play these games in vain? 
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again 
So why do go back that could leave this way? 
Black is the soul that's led astray 
You're leading me to places I can never follow 
 
Happiness is found in the darkest ways 
And as I searched around, I've made nothing but mistakes 
 
And there's the faceless cries, that twist my every dream 
And almost every night I hear the demon sing 
 
Why are we going on this way? 
Why do we play these games in vain? 
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again 
So why do go back that could leave this way? 
Black is the soul that's led astray 
You're leading me to places I can never follow 
 
And when you scream you push me so much further and 
And when I leave, I always would walk back again 
And when you cry the tears are cleansing bitterness 
I'm out of time, I'm slowly dying give me back my life 
 
Just give me back my life 
Just give me back my life 
Just give me back my life 
 
Why are we going on this way? 
Why do we play this game 
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again 
So why do go back that could leave this way? 
Black is the soul that's led astray 
You're leading me to places I can never follow

The walls I have built inside 
The thoughts I can't grasp 
Transparency through 
They're constantly fight and collide 
 
I'd love to see a different world 
A place where you can't find me 
 
Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall 
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore 
Kill me, kill me, that's what 
You've got to face, my friend (my friend) 
This ain't the end (the end) 
 
Why can't I relax and let it be true? 
This world that I try to hide 
It's kind of a mess 
Too reckless for you 
This place makes me feel alive 
 
I'd love to see a different world 
A place where you can't find me 
 
Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall 
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore 
Kill me, kill me, that's what 
You've got to face, my friend (my friend) 
This ain't the end (the end) 
 
The call of the purpose is the change in behavior 
And that is all we keep constraints on the soldiers 
It gets on top of you and forces your perspective 
Then you know it, you feel it, it's as dark as you can get, you want it 
 
Harder harder harder 
Give it to you 
Harder harder 
You just want it 
Harder harder harder 
Give it to you 
Harder harder 
I don't think you'll ever get it 
 
Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall 
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore 
Kill me, kill me, that's what 
You've got to face, my friend (my friend) 
This ain't the end (the end)</field>

Broken promises, you never keep 
Drift away tonight, just drift away alright 
We used to dream, we used to laugh 
No one could tell us that this would never last 
This ain't a love song, I would never give you one 
 
No more secrets, no more lies 
No more feelings or surprise 
No more whispered words or lullabies 
Go fuck your life 
 
Everything, everything falls apart 
Everything, everything, all we've had 
Everything, everything falls all apart 
 
I've given up, it's all I could take 
My hands are shaking, my body could break 
 now, come on and take me out 
I used to care, I used to try 
But what's the use, it always end with goodbye 
This ain't a love song, I would never give you one 
 
No more secrets, no more lies

Controlling my mind that is disease 
Holding, my hate that is released 
Scolding the hand that keeps me fed

Searching for something that is safe 
Hurting my pride that is detest 
Turning my anger towards your flesh 
Rotting, we're hoping ain't that bad 
Spilling the blood that's on the bed 
Scolding the hand that keeps me fed

Things keep ending up this way (come and get off) 
Another notch is carved away 
In the thoughts of mass decay 
Funny how things end up this way 
 
Beaten down, dominated by its sound 
Growing deep within my head 
Softly dying, its soul is shed 
Eating me all up inside 
This cancer finds everything I hide 
Living my life horrified 
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life 
(Lies) does nobody know I'm insane? 
 
Satisfaction is delayed (come and get off) 
Its motivation is displayed 
Finding its misogyny 
Funny how I die and go away (come and get off)

that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven 
And when she gets there she knows 
if the stores are all close 
With a word she can get what she came for 
Oh 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven 
There's a sign on the wall 
but she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes 
words have two meanings 
In a tree by the brook 
there's a songbird who sings 
Sometimes all of our 
thoughts are misgiving 
Oh it makes me wonder 
Oh it makes me wonder 
There's a feeling I get 
when I look to the west 
And my spirit is crying for leaving 
In my thoughts I have seen 
rings of smoke through the trees 
And the voices of those who stand looking 
Oh it makes me wonder 
Oh and it makes me wonder 
And it's whispered that soon 
if we all called the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason 
And a new day will dawn 
for those who stand long 
And the forest will echo with laughter 
Woe oh 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow 
Don't be alarmed now 
It's just a spring clean 
for the May Queen 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change 
the road you're on 
And it makes me wonder 
Oh 
Your head is humming 
and it won't go 
in case you don't know 
The piper's calling you to join him 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? 
And did you know? 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our souls 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How everything still turns to gold 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last 
When all are one and one is all, yeah 
To be a rock and not to roll 
Oh 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven</field>

On we sweep with threshing oar 
Our only goal will be the western shore 
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins 
For peace and trust can win the day 
Despite of all your losing</field>

I can't count the tears 
of a life with no love 
Carry me back 
carry me back 
Carry me back

It's been a long time

Been a long lonely 
lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time 
Seems so long 
since we walked in the moonlight 
Making vows that just can't work right 
Open your arms 
Open your arms 
Open your arms 
Baby 
Let my love come running in 
It's been a long time

Been a long lonely

my fire in the light 
To chase a feather in the wind 
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight 
There moves a thread that has no end

The tides have caused the flame to dim 
At last the arm is straight 
the hand to the loom 
Is this to end or just begin? 
All of my love, all of my love oh 
All of my love to you now 
All of my love, all of my love

Proud aryan one word

For me the cloth once more to spin

stars to fill my dream 
I am a traveler of both time and space, 
to be where I have been 
To sit with elders of the gentle race, 
this world has seldom seen 
They talk of days for which they sit and wait 
and all will be revealed 
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, 
whose sounds caress my ear 
But not a word I heard could I relate, 
the story was quite clear 
Oh, oh. 
Oh, I been flying.. 
mama, there ain't no denyin' 
I've been flying, ain't no denyin', no denyin' 
All I see turns to brown, 
as the sun burns the ground 
And my eyes fill with sand, 
as I scan this wasted land 
Trying to find, trying to find where I've been. 
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace, 
like thoughts inside a dream 
Heed the path that led me to that place, 
yellow desert stream 
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again 
Sure as the dust that floats high in June, 
when movin' through Kashmir. 
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, 
across the sea of years 
With no provision but an open face, 
along the straits of fear 
Ohh. 
When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah 
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah 
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down... 
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, well I'm down, so down 
Ooh, my baby, oooh, my baby, let me take you there 
Let me take you there

Watch your honey drip, can't keep away

Got a flame in my heart, can't get my fill 
Eyes that shine burning red 
Dreams of you all through my head 
Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby 
Tell me what you do me now 
Didn't take too long 'fore I found out 
What people mean my down and out 
Spent my money, took my car 
Started telling' her friends she wants to be a star 
I don't know but I been told

Need a woman gonna hold my hand

Now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can. 
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam. 
Good Times, Bad Times, you know I had my share; 
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man, 
Well, I still don't seem to care. 
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be, 
Only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me. 
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end, 
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oooh. 
Good Times, Bad Times, you know I had my share; 
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man, 
Well, I still don't seem to care. 
I know what it means to be alone, I sure do wish I was at home. 
I don't care what the neighbors say, I'm gonna love you each and every day. 
You can feel the beat within my heart. 
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part.</field>

Made up my mind to make a new start 
Going to california 
With an aching in my heart 
Someone told me there's a girl out there 
With love in her eyes 
And flowers in her hair 
Took my chances on a big jet plane 
Never let them tell you 
That they're all the same 
The sea was red and the sky was grey 
Wondered how tomorrow 
Could ever follow today 
The mountains and the canyons 
Started to tremble and shake 
As the children of the sun begin to awake 
Seems that the wrath of the gods 
Got a punch on the nose 
And it started to flow 
I think I might be sinking 
Throw me a line if I reach it in time 
I'll meet you up there where the path 
Runs straight and high 
To find a queen without a king 
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings 
La la la 
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn 
Tryin' to find a woman 
Who's never, never, never been born 
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams 
Telling myself it's not 
As hard, hard, hard as it seems</field>

It won't take long just watch and see how the fellas lay their money down. 
Her style is new but the face is the same as it was so long ago, 
But from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows. 
Well, it's been ten years and maybe more since I first set eyes on you. 
The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue. 
Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love; 
But I'll just keep on rollin' along with the grace of the Lord above. 
People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat, 
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at. 
One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do, 
It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you. 
I try to make love but it ain't no use. 
Work so hard I couldn't unwind, get some money saved; 
Abuse my love a thousand times, however hard I tried. 
Heartbreaker, your time has come, can't take your evil way; 
Go away, Heartbreaker.

Gonna love you baby, here I come again. 
Every day I work so hard,

Try to love you baby, but you push me away. 
Don't know where you're goin', 
only know just where you've been, 
Sweet little baby, I want you again.

and then they went: One, two, three, four" 
Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain 
Hitting on the moonshine, rolling in the grain 
Got no time to pack my bag, my foots outside the door 
Got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball. 
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar 
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more! 
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day 
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost it's way. 
Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day 
Used to sing on the mountains but the mountains washed away 
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart 
She's only three years old, and its a real fine way to start</field>

Thanks to you 
I'm much obliged

But now it's time for me to go 
The autumn moon lights my way 
For now I smell the rain 
and with it pain

one thing I got to do 
Ramble On 
And now's the time 
the time is now 
to sing my song 
I'm goin' 'round the world 
I got to find my girl 
on my way 
I've been this way ten years to the day 
Ramble On 
Got no time to for spreadin' roots 
The time has come to be gone 
And though our health we drank a thousand times 
it's time to Ramble On 
Ramble On 
And now's the time 
the time is now 
to sing my song 
I'm goin' 'round the world 
I got to find my girl 
on my way 
I've been this way ten years to the day 
Ramble On 
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams 
Mine's a tale that can't be told 
my freedom I hold dear 
How years ago 
in days of old 
when magic filled the air 
T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor 
I met a girl so fair 
But Gollum 
and the evil one 
crept up and slipped away with 
her, her 
her, her 
yeah 
Gonna ramble on 
sing my song 
Gotta keep-a-searchin' for my baby 
Gonna work my way 
round the world 
I can't stop this feelin' 
in my heart 
Gotta keep searchin' for my baby 
I can't find my bluebird</field>

A mountain man leave his home, 
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well. 
Don't it make you feel bad 
When you're tryin' 
To find your way home, 
You don't know which way to go?

If you don't know about Chicago. 
Cryin' won't help you, 
Prayin' won't do you no good, 
Now, cryin' won't help you, 
prayin' won't do you no good,

It was an April morning 
When they told us we should go 
An' as I turn to you, you smiled at me 
How could they say no 
Whoa, the fun to have 
To live the dreams we always had 
Whoa, the songs to sing 
When we at last return again 
Swept New York a glancing kiss 
To those who claim they know 
To know the shrieks the seaman hears 
The devil is in his home 
Oh, to sail away 
To sandy lands and other days 
Oh, to touch the dream 
That hides inside and is never seen, yeah 
Into the sun, the south the north 
Flys the birds of gold 
The shackles of commitments fell 
In pieces on the ground 
Oh, to ride the wind 
To tread the air above the din 
Whoa, to laugh aloud 
Dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah 
To seek the man whose pointing hand 
The giant step unfolds 
With guidance from the curving path 
That churns up into stone 
If one bell should ring 
In celebration for a king 
So fast the heart should beat 
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah 
(Guitar Solo) 
Days went by when you and I 
Made an eternal summers glow 
As far away and distant 
Our mutual time to grow 
Oh the sweet refrain 
Soothes the soul and calms the pain 
Oh Albion remains Sleeping now to rise again 
Wandering upon the rings 
What place to rest the search 
With the mighty arms of Atlas 
Hold the heavens from the earth 
The mighty arms of Atlas 
Hold the heavens from the earth 
From the earth 
Whoaaaaaaaaaaa 
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way 
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

Who's gonna feel all of my..

I'll be singing a song, 
Hear me calling your name. 
Hear the wind within the trees, 
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me. 
Well if the sunshines so bright, 
Or on our way it's darkest night 
The road we choose is always right, so fine. 
Ah can your love be so strong 
When so many loves go wrong 
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?

So of one thing I am sure, 
It's a friendship so pure, 
Angels singing all around 
My dog is so fine. 
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do 
Spend my nat'ral life with you, 
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine.

Well.. 
Oh baby baby 
Don't you want a man like me? 
Oh baby baby, I'm just as sweet as anybody could be 
Oh baby baby, I want to look to your eyes, of blue 
Oh baby baby, It's more than anybody else could do 
Well.. 
Oh baby baby 
You know when I see you walkin down the street 
Oh baby baby, Well you lookin good enough to eat 
Oh baby baby, I dont believe I've tasted this before 
Oh baby baby, I want it now 
And every mouthfull more of you. 
Talk about you, Yeah. 
Oh baby baby, You know that I wanted it more 
Oh baby baby, I'm about to kiss goodbye to this store 
Oh baby baby, It ain't the wrapping that sells the goods 
Oh baby baby, I got a sweet tooth when my mouth is full of you. 
Ooh baby oh baby its alright, its alright 
Ohh baby its alright...its alright 
Well, oh baby, baby, oh you sting like a bee 
Oh baby, baby, I like your honey and it sure likes me 
Oh baby, baby, I got my spoon inside your jar 
Oh baby, baby, don't give me too much, don't make me starve 
Oh baby, baby, sugar sister on a silver plate 
Oh baby, baby, I need a mouthful and I just can't wait 
Oh baby, baby, see the shaking in my hand 
Oh baby, baby, don't mean to fumble but it tastes so grand 
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand, baby it's alright 
Oh baby it's alright, oh it's alright.</field>

Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace, 
Await their place within the ring of calm; 
Still stand to turn in seconds of release, 
Await the call they know may never come. 
In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
To jeopardize the course, upset the run; 
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
As love in the halls of plenty overrun. 
Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast, 
Unending dances shadowed on the day. 
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep, 
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay. 
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep, 
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray; 
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed, 
But no one seemed to question in anyway. 
How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak; 
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep. 
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
Where was your word, where did you go? 
Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow. 
Dull is the armour, cold is the day. 
Hard was the journey, dark was the way 
Way. 
I heard the word; I couldn't stay 
Oh. 
I couldn't stand it another day, another day, 
Another day, another day. 
Touched by the timely coming, 
Roused from the keeper's sleep, 
Release the grip, throw down the key. 
Held now within the knowing, 
Rest now within the peace. 
Take of the fruit, but guard the seed. 
They had to stay! 
Held now within the knowing, 
Rest now within the beat.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Celebration Day 
(Jones/Page/Plant) 
Her face is cracked from smiling, all the fears that she's been hiding, 
And it seems pretty soon everybody's gonna know. 
And her voice is sore from shouting, cheering winners who are losing, 
And she worries if their days are few and soon they'll have to go. 
*My, my, my, I'm so happy, I'm gonna join the band, 
We are gonna sing and dance in celebration, We are in the promised land. 
She hears them talk of new ways to protect the home she lives in, 
Then she wonders what it's all about when they break down the door. 
Her name is Brown or White or Black, you know her very well, 
You hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell. 
* Chorus 
There is a train that leaves the station heading for your destination, 
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more. 
Yes, it has! 
And if you walk you're gonna get there though it takes a little longer, 
And when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan. 
OOhhh yeah 
My, My, My 
And if you walk you're gonna get there though it takes a little longer, 
And when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan.</field>

In the way that you're wearing your clothes 
Sippin'' booze is precedent

You know it's all in my heart 
You'll be my only, my one and only 
Is that the way it should start? 
You told your mamma I'd get you home 
But you didn't say I had no car 
I saw a lion he was standing alone 
With a tadpole in a jar. 
You know it's alright, I said it's alright 
I guess it's all in my heart

Gonna love you baby, here I come again. 
Every day I work so hard,

Try to love you baby, but you push me away. 
Don't know where you're goin', 
only know just where you've been, 
Sweet little baby, I want you again.

Down by the seaside 
See the boats go sailin' 
Can the people hear, What the little fish are sayin' 
Oh, oh, the people turned away 
Oh, the people turned away 
Down in the city streets, see all the folk go racin', racin' 
No time left, to pass the time of day 
The people turned away 
The people turned away 
So far away, so far away 
See how they run, see how they run, see how they run, see how they run. 
Do you still do the twist 
Do you find you remember things that well 
I wanna tell you.. 
Some go twistin' every day 
though sometimes it's awful hard to tell 
Out in the country, hear the people singin' 
Singin' 'bout their progress, knowin' where they're goin' 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the people turned away 
Yes, the people turned away 
Sing loud for the sunshine, pray hard for the rain 
And show your love for Lady Nature 
And she will come back again The people turned away.</field>

Oh, baby 
Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining 
Like a star that can't wait for a night 
I hate to think I've been blinded baby 
Why can't I see you tonight 
And the warmth of your smile starts a-burnin' 
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright 
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning 
Why don't you show up, make it all right, yeah, it's all right, all right 
And if you promised you'd love so completely 
And you said you would always be true 
You swore that you would never leave me, baby 
What ever happened to you 
And you thought it was only in movies 
As you wish all your dreams would come true, hey 
It ain't the first time believe me, baby 
I'm standin' here feeling blue, blue 
Ha, yeah, I'm blue, hoh, baby 
Now I will stand in the rain on the corner 
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown 
Another ten minutes no longer 
And then I'm turning around, 'round 
The clock on the wall's moving slower 
Oh, my heart it sinks to the ground 
And the storm that I thought would blow over 
Clouds the light of the love that I found, found 
Light of the love that I found 
Light of the love that I found 
Ohhhh, that I found 
Hey babe 
Oooh, hand that ticks on the clock 
Just don't seem to stop 
When I'm thinking it over 
Oooh, tired of the light 
I just don't seem to find 
Have you wait, get away 
Whoa oooh, I see it in my dreams 
But I just don't seem to be with you 
You I gotta get it all 
Gotta get it all, gotta get it all 
I've got to get all 
(Guitar Solo) 
Ooh, now my body is starting to quiver 
And the palms of my hands getting wet, ohh 
I've got no reason to doubt you baby 
It's all a terrible mess 
An' I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless 
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey 
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless 
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, ohhhhhh yeah 
Hey now, ohhhhhh-hoh 
Light of the love that I found 
Light of the love that I found 
Light of the love that I 
Light of the love that I found 
Light of the love, hey now

Met a man on the roadside crying, without a friend, there's no denying, 
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding looking for what you knew. 
So anytime somebody needs you, don't let them down, although it grieves you, 
Some day you'll need someone like they do, looking for what you knew.

Please take him, save me from the wrath of this man, man. 
Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile, 
Pray tell me that I'm free to ride, 
Ride for many mile, mile, mile.

Brought my blood to boiling hot To keep you from the Gallows Pole,

And drank all my wine 
Made up my mind to make a new start 
Going to california 
With an aching in my heart 
Someone told me there's a girl out there 
With love in her eyes 
And flowers in her hair 
Took my chances on a big jet plane 
Never let them tell you 
That they're all the same 
The sea was red and the sky was grey 
Wondered how tomorrow 
Could ever follow today 
The mountains and the canyons 
Started to tremble and shake 
As the children of the sun begin to awake 
Seems that the wrath of the gods 
Got a punch on the nose 
And it started to flow 
I think I might be sinking 
Throw me a line if I reach it in time 
I'll meet you up there where the path 
Runs straight and high 
To find a queen without a king 
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings 
La la la 
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn 
Tryin' to find a woman 
Who's never, never, never been born 
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams 
Telling myself it's not 
As hard, hard, hard as it seems</field>

Now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can. 
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam. 
Good Times, Bad Times, you know I had my share; 
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man, 
Well, I still don't seem to care. 
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be, 
Only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me. 
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end, 
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oooh. 
Good Times, Bad Times, you know I had my share; 
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man, 
Well, I still don't seem to care. 
I know what it means to be alone, I sure do wish I was at home. 
I don't care what the neighbors say, I'm gonna love you each and every day. 
You can feel the beat within my heart. 
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part.</field>

It won't take long just watch and see how the fellas lay their money down. 
Her style is new but the face is the same as it was so long ago, 
But from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows. 
Well, it's been ten years and maybe more since I first set eyes on you. 
The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue. 
Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love; 
But I'll just keep on rollin' along with the grace of the Lord above. 
People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat, 
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at. 
One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do, 
It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you. 
I try to make love but it ain't no use. 
Work so hard I couldn't unwind, get some money saved; 
Abuse my love a thousand times, however hard I tried. 
Heartbreaker, your time has come, can't take your evil way; 
Go away, Heartbreaker.

My she looks so fine 
She's the only one that I been dreamin' of 
Maybe someday she will be all mine 
I wanna tell her that I love her so 
I thrill with her every touch 
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love 
I got a woman, wanna ball all day 
I got a woman, she won't be true, no 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time 
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true 
Sunday morning when we go down to church 
See the menfolk standin' in line 
I said they come to pray to the Lord 
With my little girl, looks so fine 
In the evening when the sun is sinkin' low 
Everybody's with the one they love 
I walk the town, Keep a-searchin' all around 
Lookin' for my street corner girl 
I got a woman, wanna ball all day 
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time 
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true 
In the bars, with the men who play guitars 
Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times 
My little lover does a midnight shift 
She followed around all the time 
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do 
Gonna pack my bags and move on my way 
Cause I got a worried mind 
Sharin' what I thought was mine 
Gonna leave her where the guitars play 
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no 
I got a woman, wanna ball all day 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time 
I got a little woman and she won't be true 
(Hey hey what can I do) 
I said she won't be true 
(Hey Hey, What can I say?) 
Hey hey, what can I do 
I got a woman, she won't be true 
Lord, hear what I say 
I got a woman, wanna ball all day

            <field name="lyrics">Well I just got into town today 
To find my girl who's gone away 
She took the Greyhound at the General Store 
I searched myself I searched the town 
When I finally did sit down 
I find myself no wiser than before 
She said we couldn't do no wrong 
No other love could be so strong 
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer 
Now she took my heart she took my keys 
From in my old blue dungarees 
And I'll never go to Texas anymore 
* Chorus: Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 
I took her love at seventeen 
A little late these days it seems 
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for 
I took her word I took it all 
Beneath the sign that said "U-haul" 
She left angels hangin round for more 
Chorus 
I thought I had it all sewn up 
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
But folks said she was after something more 
I never did quite understand 
All that talk about rockin' bands 
But they just rolled my doll right out the door</field>

Though it couldn't have been the heat of the day 
When I learned how my time had been wasted, 
(And a) tear fell as I turned away 
Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder, 
Event I should happen to fall 
Time and his bride growing older 
I've got friends who will give me fuck all 
(On the) corner of Bleeker and nowhere 
In the land of not quite day 
A shiver runs down my backbone 
Face in the mirror turns grey 
So (I) looked round to hitch up the reindeer 
Searching hard trying to brighten the day 
I turned around to look for the snowman 
To my surprise he'd melted away. 
As the moon and the stars call the order 
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway 
The sun in my soul's sinking lower 
While the hope in my hands turns to clay 
I don't ask that my field's full of clover 
I don't moan at opportunity's door 
And if you ask my advice, take it slower 
Then your story'd be your finest reward. 
Lost on the path to attainment 
Search in the eyes of the wise 
When I bled from the heart of the matter 
I started bleeding without a disguise 
Now everything's fine under heaven 
Now and then you've got to take time to pause 
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around 
Or you'll land in a boat without oars 
Hey babe, Hey babe, Hey babe, 
I lost my way. 
Hey babe, Hey babe, 
I don't know where I'm gonna find it. 
Hey babe, Hey babe, 
Do you wanna know, 
Do you really, really, wanna help me, yeah? 
Let me tell you now, babe 
Let me tell you 
That it feels so good that it must be right 
Now my babe,

I got another child on the way that makes eleven. 
But I'm in constant heaven. 
I know it's all right in my mind

I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit 
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give.

So don't let her, Play you for a fool 
She don't show no pity baby, she don't make no rules 
*Chorus: Oh, oh, I need your love, I need your love 
Oh, I need your love, I just got to have 
So don't you let her, Oh, get under your skin 
It's only bad luck and trouble, From the day that you begin 
I hear you crying in the darkness, Don't ask nobody's help 
Ain't no pockets full of mercy baby, Cause you can only blame yourself 
Chorus 
Oh it's simple, All the pain that you go through 
You can turn away from fortune, fortune, Cause that's all that's left to you 
It's lonely at the bottom, Man, it's dizzy at the top 
But if you're standing in the middle, Ain't no way you're gonna stop 
Chorus 
Oh whatever that your days may bring 
No use hiding in a corner, Cause that won't change a thing 
If you're dancing in the doldrums, One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop 
When you're the master of the off-chance, When you don't expect a lot.</field>

And if you feel that you can't go on. 
And your will's sinkin' low 
Just believe and you can't go wrong. 
In the light you will find the road 
You will find the road 
Oh, did you ever believe that I could leave you, standing out in the cold 
I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through to the very depths of my soul. 
I just wanna show what I'd give you it is from every bend in the road 
Now listen to me 
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was and really would be for you, too, honey 
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load. 
Let me share your load 
Ooh, let me share, share your load 
And if you feel that you can't go on 
In the light you will find the road 
Though the winds of change may blow around you, but that will always be so 
When love is pain it can devour you, if you are never alone 
I would share your load 
I would share your load 
Baby, let me, oh, let me 
In the light 
Everybody needs the light. 
In the light, in the light, in the light 
Light, light, light, in the light 
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh, yeah</field>

stars to fill my dream 
I am a traveler of both time and space, 
to be where I have been 
To sit with elders of the gentle race, 
this world has seldom seen 
They talk of days for which they sit and wait 
and all will be revealed 
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, 
whose sounds caress my ear 
But not a word I heard could I relate, 
the story was quite clear 
Oh, oh. 
Oh, I been flying.. 
mama, there ain't no denyin' 
I've been flying, ain't no denyin', no denyin' 
All I see turns to brown, 
as the sun burns the ground 
And my eyes fill with sand, 
as I scan this wasted land 
Trying to find, trying to find where I've been. 
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace, 
like thoughts inside a dream 
Heed the path that led me to that place, 
yellow desert stream 
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again 
Sure as the dust that floats high in June, 
when movin' through Kashmir. 
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, 
across the sea of years 
With no provision but an open face, 
along the straits of fear 
Ohh. 
When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah 
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah 
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down... 
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, well I'm down, so down 
Ooh, my baby, oooh, my baby, let me take you there 
Let me take you there 
Let me take you there</field>

What do you, what do you think I saw? 
Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said, 
"Hey, Boy, do you wanna score?" 
And you know how it is; 
I really don't know what time it was, woh, oh, 
So I asked them if I could stay awhile. 
I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really, 
Really out of my mind. 
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said, 
"Please, hey, would we care to all get in line, 
Get in line." 
Well you know, They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, 
Oh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, ooh. 
Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see, 
And Baby, Baby, Baby, do you like it? 
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin' 
Ah, not trying to fight it. 
You really don't care if they're coming, oh, oh, 
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh. 
If you go down in the streets today, Baby, you better, 
You better open your eyes. 
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't 
Which, which way the pressure lies, 
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now. 
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains 
Where the spirits go now, 
Over the hills where the spirits fly, ooh.

I received a message from my brother across the water 
He sat laughin' as he wrote the end's in sight 
So I said goodbye to all my friends 
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox 
'Cause I know it's time to fly 
Come on, meet me in the morning, Meet me in the middle of the night 
The morning light is comin', don't it make you wanna go and feel alright 
I just jumped a train that never stops, 
So now somehow I'll know I never finished payin' for my ride 
Just n' someone pushed a gun into my hand 
Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight that I'll require 
Come on, meet me in the morning, Meet me in the middle of the night 
The morning light is comin', don't it make you wanna go and feel alright 
Oh, mama, well I think it's time I'm leavin' 
Nothin' here to make me stay 
Whoa, mama, well it must be time I'm goin' 
They're knockin' down them doors 
They're tryin' to take me away 
Please Mr 
Brakeman, won't you ring your bell 
And ring loud and clear 
Please Mr 
Fireman, won't you ring your bell 
Tell the people they got to fly away from here 
I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby 
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile 
We are in the middle of a change in destination 
When the train stops, all together we will smile 
Oh, meet me in the morning 
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night 
Everybody know the mornin' time is comin' 
Don't it make you wanna feel alright 
Ah, ah, yeah 
Make me feel alright 
Fly now, baby</field>

I'm just a simple guy, I live from day to day. 
A ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues away, 
There's nothing more that I can say but on a day like today 
I pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with you. 
*All I need from you is all your love, 
All you got to give to me is all your love,

One thing that I know for sure gonna give her all the loving 
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can.

People go and people come, see my rider right by my side,

Many times I've gazed along the open road. 
Many times I've lied - Many times I've listened 
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know. 
Many dreams come true and some have silver linings 
I live for my dream and a pocket full of gold. 
Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing 
Many many men can't see the open road. 
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing 
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ooh!</field>

His wife would cook his meal 
As he would change the wheel

There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom 
Worked for thirty years 
Sharing hopes and fears 
Dreamin' of the day 
He could turn and say 
Poor Tom, work's done 
been lazin' out in the noonday sun 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
His wife was Annie Mae 
With any man a game she'd play 
When Tom was out of town 
She couldn't keep her dress down 
Poor Tom, Seventh Son, always knew what's goin on 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
And so it was one day 
People got to Annie Mae (?) 
Tom stood, a gun in his hand 
And stopped her runnin' around 
Poor Tom, Seventh Son, gotta die for what you've done 
All those years of work are thrown away 
To ease your mind 
is that all you can say? 
But what about that grandson on your knee? 
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

Speak to me only with your eyes 
It is to you I give this tune. 
Ain't so hard to recognize - These things are clear to all from 
time to time. 
Talk Talk - I've felt the coldness of my winter 
I never thought it would ever go 
I cursed the gloom that set upon us... 
But I know that I love you so 
These are the seasons of emotion and like the winds they rise and fall 
This is the wonder of devotion - I see the torch we all must hold. 
This is the mystery of the quotient - Upon us all a little rain must fall.</field>

One time love, take care how you use it 
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick 
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite 
Feel it bite. 
A man I know, went down to Louisiana, 
had himself a bad, bad fight 
And when the sun peeked through 
John Cameron with Suzanna, 
He kissed the whiskers, left and right 
Whiskers! 
Now, now, now, fright subsides 
Out at a hotel in the quarter, our friends check in to pass the night 
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water 
Poor whiskers set the room alight. 
Whiskers! 
Down on Bourbon street, You know it's right 
You can see my friend, they run around all through the night 
Most everywhere, Until the closet's bare 
Run for the razor, Doin' up my hair 
New Orleans queens, Sure know how to schmooze it 
Maybe for some that seems alright 
When I step out, strut down with my sugar 
She'd best not talk like Barry White! 
One time love, take care how you use it 
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick 
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite.</field>

Baby, since I've been loving you, yeah 
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah 
Everybody trying to tell me 
That you didn't mean me no good 
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you 
Let me tell you I really did the best I could 
I've been working from seven to eleven every night 
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag, 
Lord, that ain't right 
Since I've been loving you 
I'm about to lose my worried mind 
Said I've been crying, my tears they fell like rain 
Don't you hear, don't you hear them falling 
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door? 
I said you had the nerve to tell me 
you didn't want me no more, yeah 
I open my front door,

You must have one of them new fangled back door man 
I've been working from seven, seven, seven,

Shes sure fine lookin man, shes something else. 
Hey, look over there 
Across the street 
Theres a car just right for me 
Took on a quality of luxery 
But right now I cant afford the gas 
I guessthe cars right out of my class 
But that cant stop me from thinkin to myself 
That cars fine lookin man, it something else. 
Hey, look-a here 
Just wait and see 
Im gonna work hard and save my dough 
Gonna buy the car 
Get me that girl and go ridin around 
Well go to the shop a right block down 
Ill keep on right on dreamin and thinkin to myself 
If it all comes true man, wow, thats something else. 
Look a-here 
Whats all this 
Never thought Id do this before 
But here I am a-knockin on a door 
My cars out front 
And its all mine 
Justa 41 ford not a 59 
Ive got that girl and Im a thinkin to myself 
Shes sure fine lookin man, wow, shes something else.

Baby, when you walk that sweet walk 
Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good 
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk 
Oh, it sounds so good, oh so good 
With a little bit of concentration 
And a little bit of helpin' hands, yeah 
And a little bit of raving madness 
You know it makes me feel, baby 
Both my feet are back on the ground 
And when the rhythm takes me 
It feels so good, oh so good 
Baby if it keeps a-shaking 
It will do you good, oh so much good 
With a little bit of stop-a-shakin' shakin' 
And a little bit of ?fly right down? 
And a little bit of sweet con-carne 
It makes me feel, makes me feel 
I got my feet on the ground 
Ooh now baby, when you move it makes me 
Really feel so good, oh so good 
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad 
And I'm good, oh, so good 
With a little bit of concentration 
And a little bit of helping hand 
And a little bit of ?saving madness? 
You know it makes me feel, baby 
I'm back on the ground oh yes, sure does 
It makes me feel back on the ground. 
I'm feelin' good child! 
Down on the ground..</field>

            <field name="lyrics">There's a lady who's sure all 
that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven 
And when she gets there she knows 
if the stores are all close 
With a word she can get what she came for 
Oh 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven 
There's a sign on the wall 
but she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes 
words have two meanings 
In a tree by the brook 
there's a songbird who sings 
Sometimes all of our 
thoughts are misgiving 
Oh it makes me wonder 
Oh it makes me wonder 
There's a feeling I get 
when I look to the west 
And my spirit is crying for leaving 
In my thoughts I have seen 
rings of smoke through the trees 
And the voices of those who stand looking 
Oh it makes me wonder 
Oh and it makes me wonder 
And it's whispered that soon 
if we all called the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason 
And a new day will dawn 
for those who stand long 
And the forest will echo with laughter 
Woe oh 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow 
Don't be alarmed now 
It's just a spring clean 
for the May Queen 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change 
the road you're on 
And it makes me wonder 
Oh 
Your head is humming 
and it won't go 
in case you don't know 
The piper's calling you to join him 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? 
And did you know? 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our souls 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How everything still turns to gold 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last 
When all are one and one is all, yeah 
To be a rock and not to roll 
Oh

How come twenty four hours, Baby sometimes seem to 
slip into days? 
Oh twenty-four hours, Baby sometimes seem to slip into 
days 
A minute seems like a lifetime, baby when I feel this 
way 
Sittin, lookin at the clock, time moves so slow 
I've been watchin for the hands to move 
Until I just can't look no more 
How come twenty four hours, Baby sometimes seems to 
slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime, Baby when I feel this 
way. 
To sing a song for you, I recall you used to say 
"Oh baby this one's for we two", Which in 
the end is you anyway 
How come twenty four hours, Baby sometimes slip into 
days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime, baby when I feel this 
way. 
There was a time that I stood tall, In the eyes of 
other men 
But by my own choice I left you woman, And now I can't 
get back again 
How come twenty-four hours, sometimes slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime, Baby when I feel this 
way

But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go 
Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me 
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be 
Did you ever really need somebody, And really need 'em bad 
Did you ever really want somebody, The best love you ever had 
Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good 
'Cause it was just the first time, And you knew you would 
Through the eyes an' I sparkle, Senses growing keen 
Taste your love along the way, See your feathers preen 
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, Didn't have to grow 
We are eagles of one nest, The nest is in our soul 
Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me 
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be 
Oh darlin', oh darlin'

I can't believe what people saying, 
You're gonna let your hair hang down, 
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long, 
You're in the darker side of town. 
And when I'm out I see you walking, 
Why don't your eyes see me, 
Could it be you've found another game to play, 
What did mama say to me. 
*That's The Way, Oh, That's The Way it ought to be, 
Yeah, yeah, mama say That's The Way it ought to stay. 
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river, 
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes, 
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying, 
Had they got you hypnotized? 
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers, 
But all that lives is born to die. 
And so I say to you that nothing really matters, 
And all you do is stand and cry. 
I don't know what to say about it, 
When all you ears have turned away, 
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see, 
Is that the way it ought to stay?

The Battle Of Evermore 
Queen of Light took her bow, And then she turned to go, 
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom, And walked the night alone. 
Oh, dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light. 
The dark Lord rides in force tonight, And time will tell us all. 
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, Rest not to lock your homes. 
Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all. 
I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below, 
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow. 
The apples of the valley hold, The seeds of happiness, 
The ground is rich from tender care, Repay, do not forget, no, no. 
Dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light. 
The apples turn to brown and black, The tyrant's face is red. 
Oh the war is common cry, Pick up you swords and fly. 
The sky is filled with good and bad that mortals never know. 
Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow, 
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow. 
The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath, 
The drums will shake the castle wall, the ring wraiths ride in black, Ride on. 
Sing as you raise your bow, shoot straighter than before. 
No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold. 
Oh dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light. 
The magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back 
Bring it back. 
At last the sun is shining, The clouds of blue roll by, 
With flames from the dragon of darkness, the sunlight blinds his eyes.</field>

Got no time to pack my bag, my foots outside the door 
Got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball. 
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar 
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more! 
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day 
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost it's way. 
Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day 
Used to sing on the mountains but the mountains washed away 
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart

            <field name="lyrics">This is the springtime of my loving 
The second season I am to know 
You are the sunlight in my growing 
So little warmth I've felt before 
It isn't hard to feel me glowing 
I watched the fire that grew so low(...)ly 
It is the summer of my smiles 
Flee from me Keepers of the Gloom 
Speak to me only with your eyes 
It is to you I give this tune 
Ain't so hard to recognize 
These things are clear to all from time to time 
Talk (x4) -hey! 
I've felt the coldness of my winter 
I never thought it would ever go 
I cursed the gloom that set upon us 
upon us, upon us 
But I know that I love you so 
Aw ooh 
But I know that I love you so 
These are the seasons of emotion 
and like the winds they rise and fall 
This is the wonder of devotion 
I see the torch we all must hold 
This is the mystery of the quotient 
Upon us all a little rain must fall 
Just a little rain 
Aw oh oh ye ye yeah</field>

I know to trip is just to fall 
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it 
I always knew what it was for. 
There can be no denyin' that the wind 'll shake 'em down 
And the flat world's flyin' 
There's a new plague on the land 
If we could just join hands (X3) 
Traversed the planet when heaven sent me 
I saw the kings who rule them all 
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight 
I hear the rested rivers call 
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold 
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe 
If we could just join hands (X3) 
You got me rockin' when I ought to be a-rollin' 
Darlin', tell me, darlin', which way to go 
You keep me rockin', baby, then you keep me stolen 
Won't you tell me, darlin', which way to go.. 
that's right 
Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry and I would dearly like to know 
If all this wonder of earthly plunder will it leave us anything to show 
And our time is flyin' see the candle burnin' low 
Is the new world rising, from the shambles of the old 
If we could just join hands.</field>

Anything I wanted to know, any place I needed to go 
Hear my song 
People won't listen now ? Sing along 
You don't know what you're missing now. 
Any little song that you know 
Everything that's small has to grow 
And it has to grow ! 
California sunlight, sweet Calcutta rain 
Honolulu starbright - the song remains the same. 
Sing out Hare Hare, dance the Hoochie Koo 
City lights are so bright, as we go sliding..

Took my seed from my shaking frame. 
Same old fire, another flame, 
And the wheel rolls on. 
Silent woman through the flames, you come, 
From the deep behind the sun 
Seems my nightmares, have just begun 
Left me barely holding on. 
With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand. 
When we know the time has come 
Lose my senses, lose command 
Feel your healing rivers run 
Is it every time I fall, 
That I think this is the one 
In the darkness can you hear me call 
Another day has just begun. 
Silent woman, my face is changed 
Some know in ways to come. 
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame 
And the wheel rolls on</field>

Dig that heavy metal underneath your hood 
Baby, I could work all night, believe I've got the perfect tools 
Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 
A model built for comfort, really built with style 
Specialist tradition, mama, let me feast my eyes 
Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 
Factory air-conditioned, heat begins to rise 
Guaranteed to run for hours, mama it's a perfect size 
Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 
Groovin' on the freeway, gauge is on the red 
Gun down on my gasoline, I believe I'm gonna crack a head. 
Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 
I can't stop talkin' about... 
Come to me for service every hundred miles 
Baby, let me check your points, fix your overdrive 
Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 
Fully automatic, comes in any size 
Makes me wonder what I did, before we synchronized 
Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 
Feather-light suspension, coils just couldn't hold 
I'm so glad I took a look inside your showroom doors 
Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 
Oh, I can't stop talkin' about love.</field>

Asked sweet mama, Let me be her kid 
She said, "You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid" 
Well I know my baby, If I see her in the dark 
I said I know my rider, If I see her in the dark 
Now, I goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by my side 
Still barrelhouse, If it's on the riverside, yeah 
I know my baby, Lord, I said, "is really sloppy drunk" 
I know my mama, Lord, a brownskin, but she ain't no plum 
See my baby, tell her, Tell her hurry home 
Had no lovin', since my baby been gone 
See my baby, Tell hurry on home 
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind, Since my rider's been gone 
Hey, she promises, She's my rider 
I wanna tell you, She's my rider 
I know you're mine, She's my rider 
She ain't but sixteen, But she's my rider 
I'm goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by side 
Anybody argue with me man, I'll keep them satisfied 
Well, see my baby, tell her, Tell her the shape I'm in 
Ain't had no lovin', Lord, since you know when 
Spoken: Why don't you come into my kitchen 
She's a kindhearted lady 
She studies evil all the time 
She's a kindhearted woman 
She studies evil all the time 
Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg 
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed 
Squeeze my lemon, 'til the juice runs down my leg 
Spoken: I wonder if you know what I'm talkin' about 
Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl 
I swear I'm gonna fall right out of bed 
She's a good rider 
She's my kindhearted lady 
I'm gonna take my rider by my side 
I said her front teeth are lined with gold 
She's gotta mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul 
She's my brownskin sugar plum....</field>

When you hear the call can you count the cost 
As you stand alone do you wonder how 
Can you step aside, does it matter now 
Every love that's changed -- 
In the eye of the night -- 
In the day everything -- 
She was smilin' a tear at her waters fall 
you know it's true 
You know it's true now 
I'm walkin the floor over you 
I'm walkin' the floor 
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost

It starts out like a murmur 
Then it grows like thunder 
Until it bursts inside of you 
Try to hold it steady 
Wait until you're ready 
Any second now will do 
Throw the door wide open 
Not a word is spoken 
Anything that you want to do 
Ya know, ya know, ya know... 
Don't you feel the same way? 
Don't you feel the same way? 
But you don't know what to do 
No time for hesitatin' 
Ain't no time for hesitatin' 
All you got to do is move 
They say you're feeling blue, well 
I just found a cure 
It's a thing you gotta do, yeah 
Ya know, ya know, ya know... 
Now listen: You say your body's aching? 
I know that it's aching 
Chill bumps come up on you 
Yeah, the funny fool 
I love the funny fool 
?Just like foolin' after school? 
And then you ask for medication 
Who cares for medication 
When you've worn away the cure 
Ya know, ya know, ya know... 
Go back to the country 
Yeah, go back to the country 
Feel a change is good for you 
When you keep convincin' 
Ah, don't keep convincin' 
What's that creeping up behind a you? 
It's just an old friend 
It's just an old friend 
And what's that he's got for you?

We are one 
So much time wasted 
Playing games with love 
So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
But baby it ain't over 'til it's over 
So many years we've tried 
To keep our love alive 
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over 
How many times 
Did we give up 
But we always worked things out 
And all my doubts and fear 
Kept me wondering 
If I'd always be in love 
So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over 
So many years we've tried 
To keep our love alive 
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over 
So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over 
So many years we've tried 
To keep our love alive 
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over</field>

I heard a cry within my soul 
I've never had a yearning quite like this before 
Now here you are walking right through my door 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
A sacred gift of heaven 
For better, worse, wherever 
And I would never let somebody break you down 
Or take your crown never 
All my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I've searched through time, I've always known 
That you were there upon your throne 
A lonely queen without her king 
I've longed for you, my love forever 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I' ll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I' ll ever see you again 
All of my life... 
repeat two times 
All of my life where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I´m out here on the open road 
I´m old enough to see behind me 
but young enough to feel my soul 
I don´t wanna lose you baby 
and I don´t wanna be alone 
don´t wanna live my days without you 
but for now, I´ve got to be without you 
I´ve got a pocket full of money 
and a pocket full of keys 
that have no bounds 
but then I think of loving 
and I just can´t get you off of my mind 
Babe can´t you see 
Hear, this is killing me 
I don´t wanna push you baby 
I don´t want you to be told 
is just that I can´t breath without you 
feels like I´m gonna lose control 
I´ve got a pocket full of money 
and a pocket full of keys 
that have no bounds 
but when it comes to loving 
I just can´t get you off of my mind 
Am I a fool to think that there´s a little hope? 
Tell me baby 
What are the rules, the reasons and the does 'n' don´ts? 
Tell me baby 
Tell me baby 
What do you feel inside? 
I´ve got a pocket full of money 
and a pocket full of keys 
that have no bounds 
but when it comes down to loving 
I just can´t get you off of my mind 
I just can´t get you off of my mind</field>

The things that were so sweet 
No longer move my feet 
But I keep trying 
I keep on trying 
All that I want is 
Stillness of heart 
So I can start 
To find my way 
Out of the dark 
And into your heart 
I got more than I can eat 
A life that can't be beat 
Yet still I feel this heat 
I'm feeling incomplete 
What am I buying? 
My soul is crying 
2x 
All that I want is 
Stillness of heart 
So I can start 
To find my way 
Out of the dark 
And into your heart 
Where's the love? 
What is this world we live in? 
Where's the love ? 
We've got to keep on giving 
Where's the love ? 
What happened to forgiving ? 
Anyone ? 
(3x) 
All that I want is 
Stillness of heart 
So I can start 
To find my way

But what I really want to know is 
Are you gonna go my way? 
And I got to got to know 
I don't know why we always cry 
This we must leave and get undone 
We must engage and rearrange 
And turn this planet back to one 
So tell me why we got to die 
And kill each other one by one 
we've got to love and rub-a-dub 
We've got to dance and be in love 
But what I really want to know is 
Are you gonna go my way?

As he teach us 
Do it like the Lord 
Just how Martin 
Got it startin' 
And without a sword 
Just as Gandhi 
Went to war 
And never used a gun 
We can join together 
And through love we'll get it done

We've got to raise vibration

From the day I'd gotten there 
I met a girl who took me on a ride 
I was young I had no cares 
When I moved to California 
California 
She played me records I had never heard 
While we toked on purple hairs 
Who, Zeppelin, Beatles 
Kiss, The Rolling Stones 
While we played guitars in air 
When I moved to California 
California 
California 
California love! 
Venice Beach and P.O.P. 
Station 26 was free 
Jeff Ho and Horizons west 
Dogtown Skates they were the best 
Hang Ten, O.P 
were the brands 
Don't forget the two-tone Vans 
I miss the Apple and my schoolyard boys 
Nothing ever will compare 
But now I skateboard 
With my surfer girl 
And we really are a pair 
When I moved to California 
California

With no regret to what you did wrong 
Should I stay and fight? 
Can we make this right? 
You looked through me like an open door 
Do I exist to you anymore? 
Cause when I'm talking to you 
There's someone else that you're hearing 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
You played your game, used me like a pawn 
Check mate you're done and then you were gone 
Did I move too fast? 
I thought we would last 
Now that you're through I can feel your soul 
Where there was love lies an empty hole 
Cause when I make love to you 
It's someone else that you're feeling 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
So many nights 
I've been standing at the wall 
Blind folded with cigarette 
Waiting for the fall 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance

You light my way in the dark 
You are the ultimate star 
You lift me up from above 
Your unconditional love takes me to paradise 
I belong to you 
And you 
You belong to me too 
You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet 
You make me feel so divine 
Your soul and mind are entwined 
Before you I was blind 
But since I’ve opened my eyes 
And with you there’s no disguise 
So I could open up my mind 
I always loved you from the start 
But I could not figure out 
That I had to do it everyday 
So I put away the fight 
Now I’m gonna live my life 
Giving you the most in every way 
I belong to you 
And you 
You belong to me too 
You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet.</field>

Really talks to me 
I'm going out of my mind 
'Cause the way that she winds 
Is truly divine 
She takes her time 
As she approaches me 
Then she gives me the sign 
As she moves her behind 
That only God would design 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The DJ makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancin' til dawn 
The lights are low 
She likes to dance for me 
It's making me high 
'Cause the look in her eye 
Is hot as July 
Hey 
The night is young 
Gold bar's the place to be 
The music is right 
Cause the dj is tight 
Zappa into Barry White, yeah 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The DJ makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancin' til dawn 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The DJ makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancin' til dawn 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The dj makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancin' til dawn 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The dj makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancing til dawn 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The DJ makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancing til dawn 
She keeps me dancing 
Like a bullet from a gun

I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancing til dawn</field>

Take me down to where the peaceful waters flow 
So I can be at peace of my mind

I saw you walk down the street 
With some other girl 
Always thought that I was the only one in your world 
Baby can you tell me so 
Out of sight of of mind ain't what love ought to be 
And I hoped all the time that you'd be faithful to me 
faithful to me 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
I just want to be sure 
That forever and more 
You would be my baby 
Love is just like a flower baby it has to grow 
And when you are away I'm even loving you more 
I just have to let you know 
One on one is the way and that's the way it should be 
So if you're not gonna stay 
Then don't be playing with me 
You can set me free 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
'Cause all this lovev is for you 
And you know that I'm true 
And I'll be your baby 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
'Cause I knew from the start 
That you were working my heart 
Won't you be my baby 
I remember our walk other Saturday night 
Sweet harmonies filled and floated through our minds 
Never felt this way before 
We were riding so high on love and understanding 
So why go wasting your time when you have got such a find 
That is everlasting 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
I just want to be sure 
That forever and more 
You would be my baby 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
'Cause all this lovev is for you 
And you know that I'm true 
And I'll be your baby.</field>

Talking 'bout a woman 
Talking 'bout a man 
I just can't seem to get it together 
Joining hands in hands 
The clock it ticks and it tocks 
But my heart is on the rocks 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I got to tell you something's wrong with the news 
Yeah 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I got to tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
Baby baby baby baby baby 
Let me feel you no good inside 
All I wanna do is love you, love you, love you 
Instead of making you cry 
But when I come about 
I just met another woman the other side of town 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
You ask me if I love you baby 
And I tell you that I do 
But don't you ask me if you're the only woman 
'Cause I can't say that it's thru 
Talking 'bout a woman 
Talking 'bout a man 
I just can't seem to get it together 
Joining with a man, hand in hand 
The clock it ticks and it tocks 
But my heart is on the rocks 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
I'm confused 
Yes I am darling, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
I'm confused, have mercey, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I just can't, I just can't choose.</field>

Why did you stay on track 
Why did you leave

Why did you abandon me

And sad goodbye

With all that shit 
In your head 
Your gonna go insane

Cause on the day 
That you left 
You said

Let's take this love

Close your eyes

Just ask for what you need 
In Jesus name 
Don't be ashamed

That your life is a gift 
And my mama said 
There's much weight you will lift 
And my mama said 
Leave those bad boys alone 
And my mama said 
Be home before the dawn 
And my mama said 
You can be rich or poor 
But my mama said 
You can be big or small 
But I'm always on the run 
My mama said 
That it's good to be truthful 
But my mama said 
Don't take more than a mouthful 
And my mama said 
That it's good to be natural 
And my mama said 
That it's good to be factual 
But I'm always on the run 
My mama said 
Baby don't ride that crazy horse 
And my mama said 
You must push with much force 
And my mama said 
Go get all that your after 
And my mama said 
That love's all that matters 
But I'm always on the run</field>

Now woman, stay away 
American woman, listen what I say 
American woman, get away from me 
American woman, mama let me be 
Don't come knocking around my door, I don't want to see your shadow no more 
Colored lights can hypnotize, sparkle someone else's eyes 
Now woman, get away 
American woman, listen what I say 
American woman, I said get way 
American woman, listen what I say 
Don't come hanging around my door, don't want to see your face no more 
I don't need your war machines, I don't need your ghetto scenes 
Colored lights can hypnotize, sparkle someone else's eyes 
Now woman, get away

Just leave all your things and come and celebrate life 
This time is for love, not for heartache and strife 
There's no time for games and there's no time to fight 
Just feel all the love that is in the air, 
The feeling so good and it's everywhere, 
So come on along if you heart's feeling right, 
Just open your wings it's a natural flight 
You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool, 
And I'll see you in another life 
See you in another life 
He walked on this earth so we can party tonight, 
He taught us of faith 'cause it's not about sight 
He taught us of peace and unconditional love 
He led us from wrong and forave us there of 
He did all the things 'cause he wanted you 
He died on that cross so you wouldn't have to, 
And now all the worlds such a beautiful light, 
Just open your eyes it's a beautiful sight 
You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool, 
And I'll see you in another life 
Another life, come on ! 
You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool, 
And I'll see you in another life 
See you in another life, oh yeah 
Another life 
See you in another life, another life 
See you in another life, oh yeah, 
Another life, see you in another life

No I don't want love you, 
'Cos I know who you are, 
That's why I've been staying away from you, 
That is why I ever call, 
Huummm, I know that you could possess my body, 
And I know you could make me crawl 
I know you'd have me shaken, 
Have me climbing the wall 
That's why I don't wanna' love you 
(Lenny Kravitz) 
'Cos I know how you are 
Sure you say you're right on and your righteous, girl 
Come with me, I know you'd be right off 
'Cos I know you could possess my body, 
I know you could make me crawl, 
And just as hard as I fall for you girl, 
Well you know you would fall for me harder 
That's why I don't want to love you 
(Skin) 
'Cos I know what you would do to my heart 
You scourge me like a hot iron, 
Leave me whining all alone in the dark, 
'Cos I know that you would make me suffer 
I know that you would drive me wild (that's right) wild 
You would take me in a circle 
And when it gather you, I know you'd disappear 
That's why I don't wanna' love you 
(Lenny Kravitz) 
'Cos I know you like to be in charge, 
And with me you know you can't control me, baby, 
'Cos you know you drive your car 
I have you eating your ego (I don't think so !!) 
I'd make it pocket your pride, Oh no 
And just as hard as I've been loving you, oh girl, 
Well you know you'd be loving me harder

It's an inner beauty thing baby, 
That shines and shines 
It ain't about your appearance 
But the soul, look inside

I saw you walk down the street 
With some other girl 
Always thought that I was the only one in your world 
Baby can you tell me so 
Out of sight of of mind ain't what love ought to be 
And I hoped all the time that you'd be faithful to me 
faithful to me 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
I just want to be sure 
That forever and more 
You would be my baby 
Love is just like a flower baby it has to grow 
And when you are away I'm even loving you more 
I just have to let you know 
One on one is the way and that's the way it should be 
So if you're not gonna stay 
Then don't be playing with me 
You can set me free 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
'Cause all this lovev is for you 
And you know that I'm true 
And I'll be your baby 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
'Cause I knew from the start 
That you were working my heart 
Won't you be my baby 
I remember our walk other Saturday night 
Sweet harmonies filled and floated through our minds 
Never felt this way before 
We were riding so high on love and understanding 
So why go wasting your time when you have got such a find 
That is everlasting 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
I just want to be sure 
That forever and more 
You would be my baby 
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door 
Is to me my baby, baby 
'Cause all this lovev is for you 
And you know that I'm true 
And I'll be your baby.</field>

When do it go bad? 
Or am I just insecure? 
I give all I can 
Baby I'm your man 
Tell me what were in this for 
Remind me 
Chorus: 
I can't go on 
I know not what to do 
My heart is worn 
I feel as if I'm through 
Please believe in me 
'Cause what I need is for you 
To believe in me 
Countless sleepless nights 
Never ending fights 
I'm trying to make your dreams come true 
I will sacrifice 
To find paradise 
But I need to know that you're 
Behind me 
Chorus: 
I can't go on 
I know not what to do 
My heart is worn 
I feel as if I'm through

There's a room where we are with God 
Beyond the sun and moon 
Where the angels will be our guard 
Where the weather doesn't change 
Everday is summer 
As the sands are numbered 
Instead of cannonball grey 
Do you think it's kinda strange? 
Or can we be lovers? 
As the spirit covers our electrified rage 
Hold me mama 
And we'll fly across the sea 
Way beyond the moon and stars and sky 
I'm talkin' bout you and God and I 
Now that the time is near 
I'm ready I have no fear 
I know you're the one my dear 
The stars will come out tonight 
In time for our sacred flight 
Together we'll be for life 
And I will burn in your flame 
Kiss me baby 
Take my hand and come with me 
I'm talkin' bout the moon and stars and sky 
I'm talkin' bout you and God and I 
Let's take it to the place where life was formed</field>

And that's a fact 
He died so we could see that was his mission 
So don't look back 
There is no division, don't you understand 
The future looks as though it has come around 
And maybe we have finally found our common ground 
We're the children of one father 
If you're looking back don't bother 
We're black and white America 
In nineteen sixty three my father married 
A black woman 
And when they walked the streets they were in danger 
Look what you've done 
But they just kept on walking forward hand in hand 
The future looks as though it has come around 
And maybe we have finally found our common ground 
We're the children of one father 
If you're looking back don't bother

Nice piece of kit 
Electronic clit 
Just sit down for a fit 
Ready to trip 
A guaranteed hit 
She’s all you ever wished 
Black Velveteen don’t give a damn she’ll do dishes 
Black Velveteen knows all the night spots in France 
Black Velveteen’s cat smells like strawberry kittens 
Black Velveteen always is ready to dance

You'd have to be insane

The one that's always engaged 
She sleeps and eats with the plague 
She's got a baby in her belly 
But she just don't care

Bare feet on the dirt floor

Living in lies by the railway line 
Pushing the hair from my eyes 
Elvis is English and climbs the hills 
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies 
Screaming along in South London 
Vicious but ready to learn 
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer 
Sometimes but always in vain 
So I'll wait until we're sane 
Wait until we're blessed and all the same 
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give 
Englishman going insane 
Down on my knees in suburbia 
Down on myself in every way 
With great expectations I change all my clothes 
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold 
Screaming above Central London 
Never bored, so I'll never get old 
So I'll wait until we're sane 
Wait until we're blessed and all the same 
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give 
Englishman going insane 
Down on my knees in suburbia 
Down on myself in every way

Barnes and J 
Barnes 
Call yourself a family man 
Talking 'bout the families plan 
To bring the sweet talk deep and down 
Works better than an average pick up line 
You put your woman out to pasture 
On the promises you gave her last year 
Peace and love is on your head 
And the grass is greener playing 'round 
Your family seed is what you spread 
Chorus: 
Buddy my friend 
Who you think you fooling 
Buddy my friend 
And what about your woman 
Buddy my friend 
Who you think you fooling 
Buddy my friend 
I don't care what you do 
But there's a hypocrite that lives in you 
Cause if your woman gave her love 
In the same way that you do 
You'd feel a-way 
You know you would 
Chorus 
Buddy my friend 
Treat her that way 
And you'll be X-D soon.</field>

From the day I'd gotten there 
I met a girl who took me on a ride 
I was young I had no cares 
When I moved to California 
California 
She played me records I had never heard 
While we toked on purple hairs 
Who, Zeppelin, Beatles 
Kiss, The Rolling Stones 
While we played guitars in air 
When I moved to California 
California 
California 
California love! 
Venice Beach and P.O.P. 
Station 26 was free 
Jeff Ho and Horizons west 
Dogtown Skates they were the best 
Hang Ten, O.P 
were the brands 
Don't forget the two-tone Vans 
I miss the Apple and my schoolyard boys 
Nothing ever will compare 
But now I skateboard 
With my surfer girl 
And we really are a pair 
When I moved to California 
California 
California

What can I do to set me free?

Talking 'bout a woman 
Talking 'bout a man 
I just can't seem to get it together 
Joining hands in hands 
The clock it ticks and it tocks 
But my heart is on the rocks 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I got to tell you something's wrong with the news 
Yeah 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I got to tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
Baby baby baby baby baby 
Let me feel you no good inside 
All I wanna do is love you, love you, love you 
Instead of making you cry 
But when I come about 
I just met another woman the other side of town 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
You ask me if I love you baby 
And I tell you that I do 
But don't you ask me if you're the only woman 
'Cause I can't say that it's thru 
Talking 'bout a woman 
Talking 'bout a man 
I just can't seem to get it together 
Joining with a man, hand in hand 
The clock it ticks and it tocks 
But my heart is on the rocks 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
I'm confused, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
I'm confused 
Yes I am darling, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I can't choose 
I'm confused, have mercey, so confused 
And I gotta tell you something's wrong with the news 
I just can't, I just can't choose.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">The way she moves 
Really talks to me 
I'm going out of my mind 
'Cause the way that she winds 
Is truly divine 
She takes her time 
As she approaches me 
Then she gives me the sign 
As she moves her behind 
That only God would design 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The DJ makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancin' til dawn 
The lights are low 
She likes to dance for me 
It's making me high 
'Cause the look in her eye 
Is hot as July 
Hey 
The night is young 
Gold bar's the place to be 
The music is right 
Cause the dj is tight 
Zappa into Barry White, yeah 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The DJ makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancin' til dawn 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The DJ makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancin' til dawn 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The dj makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancin' til dawn 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The dj makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancing til dawn 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The DJ makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancing til dawn 
She keeps me dancing 
Like a bullet from a gun 
The dj makes a run 
When she feels a beat my baby 
I can't get her off the floor 
She keeps me dancing til dawn</field>

I thought I left my past behind 
I live my life and all I know is 
Follow your dream and don't let go 
No one can live for me 
No one can see the things I see 
I walk this road 
No one can tell me how to be 
It's my destiny 
There is no right, there is no wrong 
There is no place where I belong 
I've done my time 
I've held it strong and 
My life is all about this song 
No one can live for me 
No one can see the things I see 
I walk this road 
No one can tell me how to be 
It's my destiny 
If I threw them all away 
Would it change? 
No 
I would live my life again, rearranged 
There's a magic in my heart 
That I feel 
Don't you know that God is love 
And it's real 
No one can live for me 
No one can see the things I see 
I walk this road 
No one can tell me how to be

There's so much lovin for you to share ! 
There is nowhere to run

Don't let it beat you 
Say 'nice to meet you' and 'bye'

Wake up and shake it, you didn't make your

There ain't no time for you to spare 
If you ain't part of the game then how can you find a solution 
Nobody said that it would be fair 
When the mountain is high 
Just look up to the sky 
Ask God to teach you 
Then persevere with a smile

Does anybody out there even care 
Riots in the streets, men dressed in white sheets 
Is that what we want 
A little boy hanging from a tree and a burning cross 
If we can learn that we're one we can overcome 
Before this takes us all 
We'd better catch ourselves before we fall

With no guns or money 
But with his empty hands 
With his empty hands 
They said hey boy what you lookin' at 
As they eyed his dreaded mane 
He said my father has sent me 
I've come back to reclaim 
The children whose hearts 
Were so whole and pure 
Now it's you who'll die in pain 
So they lynched the man 
Who fooled the word

In his empty hands 
In his empty hands.</field>

The thought of children who must oblige 
To tainted dreams and polluted seas 
The missing moon and melting trees 
A mist of doom and clouds of pain 
Toxic waste and acid rain 
The passing of our ignorance 
A lifetime spent in abstinence 
Living in fear 
Living in fear 
I can't tell you no lies 
Living in fear 
Living in fear 
Conditioning to hate and them to blame 
Their search for God is just the same 
Machines for hearts, how warped a view 
Forgetting that they're human too 
Waiting like a branded steer 
Who first will launch the burning spear 
When every day may be your last 
You think we'd learn from our past 
Living in fear 
Living in fear 
I can't tell you no lies 
Living in fear 
Living in fear 
I smell the fear that rains inside 
The thought of so many lives denied 
More wounded soldiers, another burning flag 
And rows and rows of body bags 
No time for tears as the night falls cold 
The days survivors crawl back in their holes 
As for the rest they're shipped back home 
Home to the rows of white tomb stones 
Living in fear 
Living in fear 
I can't tell you no lies 
Living in fear 
Living in fear.</field>

With a flower in her hair 
Feel her gentle spirit 
As the champa fills the air 
She wears rubys on her fingers 
Tiny bells upon her toes 
She's the finest thing 
I've ever seen 
Love that ring inside her nose 
Flower Child yeah 
Flower Child yeah 
She's a psychedelic princess 
On a magic carpet ride 
And where her trip will carry you 
Is somewhere you can't find 
She's on a plane of higher consciousness 
Meditation is the key 
She's got her shit together 
Cause her soul and mind are free 
Flower Child yeah 
Flower Child yeah 
She's a child of Martin Luther 
As a freedom fighter she 
Speaks of liberation on the land 
And on the sea 
Her eyes are made of sunshine 
And her lips are jelly sweet 
Flower Child yeah 
Flower Child yeah.</field>

I want to fall in love again 
For the first time 
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine 
I want to press your lips on mine 
For the first time 
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine 
Love is something 
You can't get in a five and dime 
And love is the question of more time 
And love is something 
That's really hard to find 
Love makes a strong man 
Get down on his knees in the crowd 
Just lay your hand 
On mine 
Yeah, for the first time 
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine.</field>

God is love 
Through all your trials and tribulations 
God is love 
He'll get you through all situations 
God is love 
And if your are ready He always is ready for you God loves everyone 
That's why He gave His Son (oh yeah) 
And you should feel His pain 
Yet He gave us everything

He'll get you through your pain and sorrow

And though much time has passed 
His words and promises always last 
And I am here to say 
That He loves each one of us in every way 
God is love 
He makes the rain that makes the flowers 
God is love 
And so amazing are His powers 
God is love 
And if you are ready He's gonna be ready for us God loves everyone

We need a teacher 
We must learn to see the light

There's too much poverty, sickness 
There's pain and strife 
Why aren't we trying

Nice to see you 
How you’ve been 
The beginning of another lovely day 
Oh oh oh oh oh

Get up put your feet on the ground 
Wake up to an ice cold shower 
The coffee's hot but the cream is sour 
So get up 
Top of the morning to you 
Good morning to you 
Hey 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Good morning 
Good morning 
Can I walk you to the train 
Would you like to get a bagel on the way 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Good morning 
Get on and we go downtown 
Get off and go in the tower 
The boss is old but he has the power 
So we're up 
Top of the morning to you 
Good morning to you 
Hey 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
It's another day in the world in which we live 
I've got to find a way 
To get past what I can't forgive 
And no matter what we've got to try to move along 
So sing a song 
You can't go wrong 
Good morning 
Nice to see you 
How you been 
The beginning of another, lovely day

You take my heart and drink it for tea 
You mix me up and walk out the door 
you take my love and hutr me for more 
But I gotta have it 
Watch out for the damage 
From New York straight to Paris 
I'm talking Lenny Kravitz 
Whenever he is around 
He puts me six feet under the ground 
And when you call he can never be found 
'Cause he is always out on the town 
But I gotta have it 
Watch out for the damage 
From New York straight to Paris 
I'm talking Lenny Kravitz 
He's so funky and he's looking good 
And he does it like a good man should 
And I would love him if only I could 
But his heart is like a piece of wood 
But I gotta have it 
Watch out for the damage 
From New York straight to Paris.</field>

I build a temple of love 
Walk with the Father 
Won't be a bother 
To touch the Earth as it was 
We'll farm the land each day 
And in the sunshine we will play 
Glory glory for the day He came 
Our tears had gone away 
We'll make love in the shade 
And in the ocean we will bathe 
Little fishies in the sea 
Say hooray 
I build this garden for us 
In this garden 
Our children will grow 
Darling this is a must 
We'll be so happy 
Our little family 
So full of love and trust 
And darling when we're old 
We'll close the gates and lock the door 
Our love will never fade away 
When it's pure it's forever last 
And darling when you're cold 
I'll hold you tight and keep you warm 
Little darlin' gonna make it through the storm 
You'll never be alone 
I build this garden for us 
In this garden 
They'll be no war 
No racial prejudice 
You'll be my brother 
Of any color 
You'll just be okay with us 
We'll love each day in peace 
In hope that we will one day reach 
The rest of the world 
When they are ready to be teached 
The kingdom will come 
Thy will be done 
On Earth as it is in heaven 
I build this garden 
I build this garden for us 
I build this garden for us.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I don't want to be a star 
Just want my chevy and an old guitar 
I don't want to be a star 
I don't need the fat cigar 
My friends wonder what is wrong with me 
'Cause I don't get off on my fame 
I got so much confusion now 
Sometimes I don't even know my name 
I don't want to be a star 
Just want my chevy and an old guitar 
I don't want to be a star 
I don't need the fat cigar 
Too many distractions run through my brain 
So many girls they start to look the same 
Too many options no time to choose 
Too many clothes, too many shoes 
I've had the world I've done it upside down 
I played the part and I've been the clown 
Now it's my time, it's a brand new day 
To be myself in a different way 
I don't want to be a star 
Just want my chevy and an old guitar 
I don't want to be a star 
I don't need the fat cigar 
I got to meet all the wonderful people 
I drank with Dylan boy did we act a fool 
I got to meet all the fabulous people 
I got high with Jagger, it was really cool 
I don't want to be a star 
Just want my chevy and an old guitar 
I don't want to be a star 
I don't need the fat cigar 
Never, never, never 
Never, never, never 
Never, never, never 
Never, never, never, hey 
I say never no no 
I say never no no no 
I say never no no 
I say never no no 
I say never no no 
I say never no no no no 
Never, never 
I don't want to be a star 
Just want my chevy and an old guitar 
I don't want to be a star 
I don't need no fat cigar</field>

She comes again 
I'll go and walk with her 
Along the Seine 
Soon she'll be storming 
Here comes the wind 
But that don't bother me 
'Cause she's my friend 
I love the rain 
I love the rain 
I've held our memories 
All of these years 
So many good times 
And many tears 
I share my dreams with her 
I share my fears 
So I just walk with her 
Until she veers 
Off in the distance 
I love the rain (2x) 
I love (2x) 
I love 
I love the rain 
Oh 
Just as she always does 
She has to leave 
With her she takes my heart 
Into her breeze 
Sometimes I think that she 
Just likes to tease 
Still I'll be waiting 
For her reprise 
I love the rain (5x) 
I love (3x) 
I love the rain 
Oh, yeah 
I love (3x) 
I love the rain 
Oh, yeah</field>

Into a pearl I would 
I pray in time 
I'll come to find 
Away to break through 
And save this heart of mine 
You've waited long 
If you can't hold on 
I wouldn't blame you 
I don't think I'd be that strong 
What am I to do 
If I can't have you

When my memory starts to wander 
I sit back and I ponder 
How the whole world's gone asunder 
I feel the rain and I hear the thunder 
I was bare and I was lost 
But you were there and now I'm born 
You are the force and strength 
In my life today 
And oh how I thank you father 
For giving us all over and under 
You're a mystery you're a wonder 
I always knew since I was younger 
I think about the way that you make it right 
So full of love and sacrifice 
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
But you were right and I was wrong 
'Cause I was weak but you were strong 
You are the force and strength 
In my life today 
And now that the darkness has faded 
I'm no longer blinded I can see 
And I don't have to wait no longer 
`Cause it's all about being free 
Every day every way 
I'm gonna get myself together 
Every day every way 
You are the force and strength 
In my life today 
You are the force and strength 
In my life today 
You are the force 
And you are the force and strength 
In my life today 
You are the force 
And your are the reign 
You make me try to do right 
And throw away my evil ways</field>

When I wake up, you're in my eyes 
Everyday is a new surprise 
With you I don't wear a disguise 
With you I feel the perfect high 
You are the one, the only 
I saw so sad and lonely

Is it me is it you ? 
Is it me is it you ? 
I'm lost in your love 
Don't think I ever stopped 
I got the feeling that's the reason why 
And the question's loud and clear 
Should we stay or should we bend 
It just gets deeper in the end 
I know you want to know it too 
Is it me is it you ?.</field>

We are one 
So much time wasted 
Playing games with love 
So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
But baby it ain't over 'til it's over 
So many years we've tried 
To keep our love alive 
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over 
How many times 
Did we give up 
But we always worked things out 
And all my doubts and fear 
Kept me wondering 
If I'd always be in love 
So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over 
So many years we've tried 
To keep our love alive 
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over 
So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over

            <field name="lyrics">45 caliber 
Shot him in the head because of his race 
Now that he is dead, will we plead his case? 
While the executioner's out on grace 
I just thought somehow 
That things would get better 
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough 
In the system, you cannot trust 
It's enough, it's enough 
When the whole wide world is corrupt 
It's enough, it's enough 
And we all are just getting fucked 
It's enough, it's enough 
What's that going down in the Middle East? 
Do you really think it's to keep the peace 
How we love to control a foreign land 
Taking what we can is always the plan 
And they know, they know 
That Africa is the centre 
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough 
In the system, you cannot trust 
It's enough, it's enough 
When the whole wide world is corrupt 
It's enough, it's enough 
And we all are just getting fucked 
It's enough, it's enough 
When will the desire for love 
Outweigh the desire for power? 
When will we face the truth 
And allow our hearts to flower? 
For the planet, for the planet 
For every living thing upon this world, yeah 
For destruction and the hatred (oh, the hatred) 
Is about to take us down for good 
What's the in all those trails up there in the sky? 
Why has all the food become modified? 
Pushing all your drugs just to keep us high 
While the media propagates the lie 
And I know, oh yes, I know (I know) 
The all-seeing eye is the Devil 
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough 
In the system, you cannot trust 
It's enough, it's enough 
When the whole wide world is corrupt 
It's enough, it's enough 
And we all are just getting fucked 
It's enough, it's enough 
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough 
In the system, you cannot trust 
It's enough, it's enough 
When the whole wide world is corrupt 
It's enough, it's enough 
And we all are just getting fucked 
It's enough, it's enough 
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough 
In the system, you cannot trust 
It's enough, it's enough 
When the whole wide world is corrupt 
It's enough, it's enough 
And we all are just getting fucked 
It's enough, it's enough 
Hoo 
We are living in these times 
Where the evil one has come to rob us blind 
Oh yeah yeah yeah 
People we must understand 
That it's time to wake up and do what we can 
Oh yeah yeah yeah

And if you call me I'll be there 
And we'll leave all our troubles behind 
As I walk through life I see that life 
Has taken me through so many changes 
But as long as we can learn to love 
I know everything's gonna be alright 
So take hold of my hand baby 
Just as long as you are there my love

And you know that I'll be there 
And you don't have to beg or plead

I wanna kiss you in Paris 
I wanna hold your hand in Rome 
I wanna run naked in a rainstorm 
Make love in a train cross-country 
You put this in me 
So now what, so now what? 
Wanting, needing, waiting 
For you to justify my love 
Hoping, praying 
For you to justify my love 
I want to know you 
Not like that 
I don't wanna be your mother 
I don't wanna be your sister either 
I just wanna be your lover 
I wanna be your baby 
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me 
Yearning, burning 
For you to justify my love 
What are you gonna do? 
What are you gonna do? 
Talk to me -- tell me your dreams 
Am I in them? 
Tell me your fears 
Are you scared? 
Tell me your stories 
I'm not afraid of who you are 
We can fly! 
Poor is the man 
Whose pleasures depend 
On the permission of another 
Love me, that's right, love me 
I wanna be your baby 
I'm open and ready 
For you to justify my love 
To justify my love 
Wanting, to justify 
Waiting, to justify my love 
Praying, to justify 
To justify my love.</field>

Some say I know, others say I don't 
That's alright now 
What I'm saying every day is that love will find a way 
That's no lie now 
When the road's getting tough and you think you've had enough 
Don't give up now 
Show the world how you feel, gonna let them know you're real 
Don't be shy now 
Let your love come down 
Let it flow now 
Just let it flow now, baby, yeah 
Let your love come down 
Come on and show me now 
Don't hold it back now 
Oh girl, you got to 
Let your love come down 
Let your love come down 
Let it all go now 
Let your love come down, baby 
Let your love come down 
Make sure that you're true in everything you do 
Don't you fake it 
And when you're caught in the heat and you think it's got you beat 
You can take it 
You got time on your side and this door is open wide 
You can make it (oh yes we can) 
It was there from the start, got the power in your heart 
Don't forsake it 
Give your heart, darling, every day 
Wear your love now, baby, don't hide away 
Roll it over, don't delay.</field>

Thankful and grateful 
So I got a little something that I want to say 
You know like a little prayer 
Thank you 
Thank you God that I am able 
Got my shelter and food on the table 
Got my health, don't need no pride 
'Cause everything I need you gave me inside 
Life ain't ever been better than it is now 
I ain't lonely, I'm by myself 
'Cause when you got the lord you got all the wealth 
Check me out I am sailing 
It's my time and there's no way than I'm failing 
Life ain't ever been better than it is now 
I know the world is really crazy 
But that's the time we got to stop being lazy 
We got to stand, stand up for what's right 
We got to separate the darkness from the light 
Life ain't ever been better than it is now 
Life ain't ever been better than it is now 
Rob from Always on the run is bad bad bad 
Blow Shorty ! 
I've seen the world, I've seen it all 
We're headed for the wall and we're gonna fall 
Like the days way back in Rome 
We're stepping right inside of the danger zone 
But life ain't ever been better than it is now 
Life ain't ever been better than it is now 
You see people come and people go 
And people always get just what they saw 
But I believe in this thing called love 
And our ability to rise above 
Life ain't ever been better than it is now 
Life ain't ever been better than it is now 
Life ain't ever been better 
Life ain't ever been better 
Life ain't ever been better than it is now 
Oh alright now 
It's warfare out there 
So we got to suit up and put on our armour 
Headed for the frontline 
It's gonna be alright 
It's gonna be alright 
Just stay thankful and grateful

Like father, like son 
Like father, like son 
Like father, like son 
Don't come on so cocksure boy, you can't escape your genes 
No point in feeling purer boy, your background intervenes 
Listen good and listen straight, you're not the master of your fate 
To this you must be reconciled, you'll always be your father's child 
At times acclaimed, at times reviled 
You wind up doing just what I've done 
Like father, like son 
Like father, like son 
Don't assume your vices get handed down the line 
That a parent's blood suffices to condemn the child's design 
I've done wrong, I can't deny, but at least I know that I 
Shouldn't blame that on my stock, this may come as quite a shock 
But I'm no chip off any block, I wouldn't wish those words on anyone 
Like father, like son 
Like father, like son 
Son, you're nervous, take my hand 
All is settled, all is planned 
You've got the world at your command 
I don't think you understand 
Just have the slave if you must, and be done with her 
Don't ever speak of her like that again 
I appreciate too well, the squalor at which you excel 
It isn't very hard to tell, evil's a distinctive smell 
From this day on I choose my own way 
If I choose to be with Aida, then I will be 
And no one, not you, not even the gods can stop me 
He's lost all sense of reason, and why some foreign slut 
Not only is that treason, some doors are slamming shut 
Just like me, he's found that flesh can excite but will it mesh 
Watch me rid him of this blight, once the harlot's out of sight 
Then I think he will see the light 
He won't walk back to daddy, he will run 
Like father, like son 
Like father, like son 
Like father, like son.</field>

Come on and line up 
So don't be surprised 
When they pull the wool over your eyes 
Yeah, don't get funked up 
If you got all the stuff 
And you can't get enough then line up 
If you're out on a limb 
And you wanna come in then line up 
Your heads down, sittin' round 
Pick yo face up off the ground 
And get yourself together baby 
And learn to stand tough 
Come on and line up 
We better get to it instead 
Of just standing around 
Its time to get down 
If you're playing to win 
Then your only way in is line up

Cannot compare to the love of you 
You make me feel alive 
You are my highest high 
All I can do is smile 
When I look in my little girl’s eyes 
You’re my star and when I’m far 
You’re not alone cause your heart’s my home 
You are my biggest prize 
So beautiful and so wise 
All I want to do when I come into the room is see her smile 
When I look in my little girl’s eyes 
You make me feel alive 
You are my highest high 
All I can do is smile 
When I look in my little girl’s eyes.</field>

Tired of all the talk they're talkin' all over this town 
I'm tired of all the negativity that's goin' 'round

Tonight, I'm yours 
And you are mine 
I know a place we can hide 
I know a place 
Where we can finally see the rainbow 
And we can fly fly fly fly fly 
I know a place 
Over the lonely lonely rainbow 
Were we can make things right 
I know a place where we can 
Always be together 
And we can go tonight 
I know a place where we can live our lives 
And I know a place 
Where we can see the light 
I know a place 
Over the lonely rainbow 
Where we can make things right.</field>

Looking back on love but it's kind of hard to see 
I'm just trying to find the place where I should be 
Looking back on love, oh yeah 
Looking back on love though the players have all changed 
Looking back on love even though we're all estranged 
Now what can we do with the feelings we've exchanged 
Oh, oh yeah, looking back on love 
Looking back on love in the paintings on the wall 
Looking back on love it is cracked and about to fall 
I should be running like a baby I still crawl, oh yeah 
Looking back on love, oh 
Looking back on love like a rerun in my mind 
Looking back on love but it seems as if I'm blind 
Holding memories like the sun that always shine 
Now I need to find a love I can call mine 
Oh, oh, looking back on love 
Yeah 
Looking back 
Looking back on love 
Looking back on love, wonder if I will survive 
Looking back on love, it is time for me to dive 
Once I go beneath will I finally be alive 
Looking back on love 
Looking back on love</field>

Naw, Put that down, you ain't going nowhere 
Just reflecting on the way it was - it is irrelevant 
The fact we're still together baby doll - is so 
significant 
I love you child I always will this will never change 
I sign myself to you baby every time I speak your name 
Back in the days when I was young and blind 
Hanging with the sista's we was fine as wine 
Checking you out on a regular basis 
I even let you touch me in all my secret places 
And I gave in when you held me 
And we move and we groove and you wanted me 
And you loved me and you wanted me 
And you moaned and you groaned so don't you be 
Crazy I'm your baby hold me tighter baby ahh 
I'm your main squeeze - come on and squeeze me baby 
Don't erase me I'm your baby 
Kiss me one time and it's over 
I'm your main squeeze - squeeze me - tease me 
Round and round we go 
In and out and up and over 
Give me your love - ooh I need your love - I want your 
love 
I couldn't see the forest for the trees 
And every guy that tried to turn my head 
Could not obstruct my view 
You love me child you always will 
In this you have no choice 
You sign yourself to me every time you hear my voice 
Back in the day when you was leading the pack 
Honey you're my man - young gifted and black 
Riding around in an old '64 
I even let you touch me, even let you score 
And I gave in when you held me 
And we moved and we grooved and you wanted me 
And you loved me and you wanted me 
And you moaned and you groaned so don't be crazy 
Couldn't see the forest baby, through the trees 
All I saw was you - ooh baby 
And we moved, and we grooved 
And we moved and we grooved and you wanted me</field>

How could the clouds tease us into thinking it might rain ? 
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change ? 
 
I had a mean, mean sleep over you 
And it hurts, hurts coming back to life 
You could burn a thousand days 
And I would need no other light 
You could die a thousand ways 
And I'd still love you back to life 
But my needs rising angry 
And my loneliness like quicksand 
Who will find me under this mean sleep ? 
How could the clouds tease us into thinking it might rain ? 
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change ? 
I had a mean, mean sleep over you 
And it hurts, hurts coming back to life 
I am lost to the longing 
I am moulded by the memory 
Had to shut down half my mind 
Just to still the space you left behind 
'Cos I am pushin' cobwebs 
And I'm folding into myself 
 
Who will find me under this mean sleep 
 
How could the clouds tease us into thinking it might rain ? 
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change ? 
 
I had a mean, mean sleep over you

McVey/Lenny Kravitz 
Into a world I plunge thru my headphones 
Escape into the streetlight 
I begin to believe in destiny 
When my surroundings in rhythm with me 
I'm just a grain of sand walking in a sea of people 
I look around me and my name is just someone 
For a moment in time I belong 
Where my heart beats the fear is gone 
Like destiny 
So move with me I'm strong enough 
To be weak in your arms 
Move with me I'm strong enough 
To be real in your arms 
Whispering as I was driving 
Quietly the car was rolling 
Like a bullet 
I was feeling the speed moving 
Me faster 
Addicted to the rhythm 
On my ghetto blaster 
That's me supposing 
That the clarity of thought 
Is clear enough to think 
It's real enough to touch 
The wind on me got me tripping 
Can I keep you next to me 
Till the end of the world 
Like the joker on the pile 
Never coming or going 
The colour of my true cards was showing 
Keeping in touch with an idea 
That I been growing 
Trust trust I must trust 
With my head on my chest.</field>

I don't need you take care of me, 
Let me long, let me long, let me long, won't you let me be, 
'Cause all I want in this world is to say I'm a man as we, 
People talk about the way i look, 
I think that all the things they say have got enough to write a book, 
But don't they know, don't they know, don't they know, it's a waste of breath 
'Cause I don't want to be like them I just want to be myself 
Woke up ! 
Don't try and push your ??? trust my way, 
'Cause baby I lose my soul and that's where is gonna stay 
You try to put them down on the ground, anywhere, that you choose 
Get your kids from your fist 'cause baby this time, you gonna lose.</field>

But now I know a better way

Now you're a woman 
You've got a child 
And those days of being wild 
Are gone with the past 
But now baby you still ain't got no home

Push to make a better way 
Gonna push 'cause I got to carry on 
I'm gonna push the clouds away 
Push so I can see the way 
Gonna push until I find my way home 
The jungle's swarming 
Beasts are crawling 
They're all along my path 
But god's adoring, love is pouring 
I'm gonna take a bath 
I am swimming in a violent sea 
Trying to find out who I'm gonna be

Her parents left her, she was out in the cold 
Alone to live and find her way 
In this great world of heartache and pain 
Eyes of brown, matted locks of gold 
Her flowered dress is tattered and soiled 
Tear stained cheeks, her feet cold and bare 
Who could have left a child so rare 
Rosemary your day will come 
He loved you so He gave His only son 
Keep the faith in your soul 
Stay down on your knees 
I'm beggin you please 
Hold onto the beads at your heart 
A burning heart and tired eyes 
Howling winds for lullabys 
No one there to soothe her fright 
Nowhere to turn but the inward light 
Because life is for believing 
That your heart can turn to gold 
All you need is Christ to receive it 
There's eternal life for every soul 
Rosemary your day will come 
He loved you so He gave His only son 
Keep the faith in your soul 
Stay down on your knees 
I'm begging you please 
Hold onto the beads at your heart 
He loves you He needs you He wants you 
So don't let Him down.</field>

You touch me deep down inside 
Oh can't you see that I'm fallin' 
And I can no longer hide 
You are my everything 
My sistamamalover 
You give me everything 
I have no need to borrow 
And when I think of you 
You take away my sorrow 
I'll always love you baby 
Like there's no tomorrow 
When I get up in the morning ( When I get up in the morning ) 
I feel like I'm so alive (Feel so alive) 
With you it never gets boring (Hmm hmm that's right) 
'Cause you always get me high (Get me high) 
High 
You are my everything 
My sistamamalover 
You give me everything 
I have no need to borrow 
And when I think of you 
You take away my sorrow 
I'll always love you baby 
Like there's no tomorrow 
I'll never go with another 
'Cause baby you are so fly (You know you're fly) 
Don't have to live undercover (That's right) 
Because I don't have to lie (I don't have to lie baby) 
You are my everything 
My sistamamalover 
You give me everything 
I have no need to borrow 
And when I think of you 
You take away my sorrow 
I'll always love you baby 
Like there's no tomorrow 
You are my everything (My everything!) 
My sistamamalover (Sistermama...lover!) 
You give me everything 
I have no need to borrow

You give me everything 
I have no need to borrow (Waouh !) 
And when I think of you 
You take away my sorrow (You take away my sorrow)

Did you have to fall in love 
With a man that was up to no good 
He took your soul an he stole your only heart 
Flipped your wig and left a permanent scar 
Sister 
Did you have to go away 
You left your home 
And the things you had to say 
It didn't feel good to let you slide 
I never got to say goodbye 
I miss you girl I think I'm gonna cry 
If they knock on your door you already gave 
You don't need no more of what's ailing you 
Just lean on your soul with all that it takes 
May God bring back home to America 
America 
Sister 
It's just a test of faith 
Your heart is pure so the devil's in your face 
I'll see you soon 'cause thy haven't got a case 
You'll be free in a beautiful place 
If the knock on your door you already gave.</field>

What you must do 
And all I do is sing the blues 
But I would never lie, let things go by 
Leave you in a road to die 
I would never ever say good bye 
Never gonna say good bye 
Never gonna say good bye 
Remember the times that we 
Used to share 
You got to remember the times 
That we used to share 
That we used to share 
But the only way for you to survive 
Is to open your heart it will guide 
You wanna stay in this world of music and life 
You got to turn around 
And spread a little love and get high.</field>

Waiting impatiently for you to come 
Wondering if you will always be the one 
Is this good for you 
Is it wonderful for you too 
'Cause baby I told you I'm ready for love 
I'm anticipating and waiting for some 
Tell me what to do 
Tell me baby 'cause I love you 
It's been so lovely 
Now that I got you 
I've been looking for someone like you 
Someone like you 
What do you like to do 
What do you got to say 
Just tell me baby what's on your brain 
'Cause I just want to sit down and talk for awhile 
Do you want to make babies ? 
Do you want a career 
Well whatever it is darling, I just want you near 
And we'll be together just you and me dear 
It's been so lovely (It's been so lovely) 
Since I find you 
I was praying for someone like you 
Someone like you 
Ain't been lonely 
Now that I got you 
I was waiting for someone like you 
Come on come on come on yeah 
Been so lovely 
Now that I got you

Stand, you're gonna run again 
Your faith and patience will be your soldiers 
To guide you through your troubled times 
Just put one foot in front of the other 
The battles are inside your mind 
You have the power to face your demons 
No matter how big or what kind 
And rid yourself of your fear and weakness 
So you can start to live your life 
Come on, stand up again 
Come on, stand 
Stand, you're gonna run again 
Come on, baby, stand, up again (stand again) 
Come on, stand (come on you can make it) 
Stand, you're gonna run again 
Pick up your will and put on your face 
If you need to, just take my hand 
It's time to demonstrate, don't hesitate 
Just get up and say: Yes, I can 
Stand up again 
Come on, stand 
Stand, you're gonna run again 
Stand (oh stand) up again (stand up again) 
Come on, stand (oh come on baby) 
Stand, you're gonna run again (stand)

Stillness of heart 
So I can start 
To find my way 
Out of the dark 
And into your heart 
I got more than I can eat 
A life that can't be beat 
Yet still I feel this heat 
I'm feeling incomplete 
What am I buying? 
My soul is crying 
2x 
All that I want is 
Stillness of heart 
So I can start 
To find my way 
Out of the dark 
And into your heart 
Where's the love? 
What is this world we live in? 
Where's the love ? 
We've got to keep on giving 
Where's the love ? 
What happened to forgiving ? 
Anyone ? 
(3x) 
All that I want is 
Stillness of heart

My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars 
And you're the only one that could take me this far 
I'll be forever searching for your love 
[Chorus] 
I walked away but I was wrong 
You're the one that keeps me strong 
You're the fire that keeps me warm 
How will I get through this storm? 
[Lenny Kravitz] 
At night 
I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you 
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through 
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love 
[Chorus] 
Oh, I walked away but I was wrong 
You're the one that keeps me strong 
You're the fire that keeps me warm 
How will I get through this storm? 
[Jay Z:] 
I got the bounce Lenny 
Check me out 
Brooklyn's bad boy back again 
Feet hit the ground runnin' and my back's to the wind 
Angels on my shoulders, head in the clouds 
No, I'm not rappin', I'm just thinkin' real loud 
My karma's my armor, my charm and wit 
Is like a lethal bomb, I'm warm and shit 
And I did bad for good 
But when you're trapped in the 'hood 
You do worse for less, homie earth's a test 
Only God can judge me 
My heart ain't ugly 
But the thoughts that I drop is heavy 
Try budge me 
Mama loved me, pop left me 
Still the homies call me lucky lefty 
I'm flashy and bentley 
Deceptively smart 
I make hustlin' heaven and pimpin' an art 
Long as I know that I'm blessed 
'Cause I'm loved in depth 
I can walk through the water and not get wet 
I'm that fresh 
[Chorus] 
I walked away but I was wrong 
(I was wrong) 
You're the one that keeps me strong 
(Keeps me strong) 
You're the fire that keeps me warm 
(You're the fire that keeps me warm) 
How will I get through this storm? 
[Jay Z:] 
There you have it 
Young hov 
Lenny Kravitz 
Not your average 
Get your umbrella 
It's raining macs and broads 
All grace to God 
[Chorus] 
I walked away but I was wrong 
(I walked away but I was wrong) 
You're the one that keeps me strong 
(You're the one that keeps me strong) 
You're the fire that keeps me warm 
(Keeps me warm) 
How will I get through this storm?

The clouds are slowly going

Put on you hat and clothing

Let's go walking through the park today 
I love sunday mondays any day 
When the skies are blue and it's not grey 
I'll take sunday mondays any every day 
Sometimes it's fun 
To just escape and run 
And leave the troubled world behind 
So let's get lost 
And get our juices flowing 
And let's go see what we can find 
Let's go walking through the park today 
I love sunday mondays any day

You're making it feel that everything is alright 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
In a world that's crumbling, all around us everyday 
You are, all the inspiration that I need to find my way 
How long I've been yearning, for the day I find my one true love 
Now that you are here my darling, I want you to stay 
(I want you to stay) 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
Whenever you call me, I'll be there with no delay, my love 
Even when I'm miles away girl, my heart will be there 
(I'll be right there) 
Any conversation that you want to have, you'll have my ear 
You can tell me all your secrets, they'll be safe my dear 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower

I'm not that good with words, but I'ma try my best 
Look, I don't ever wanna make you mad girl 
I just wanna have you 
See, you know the things young men are hesitant to have girl 
A little you a little me and someone else 
Good lord that's a winner right there 
But we really got a story to tell, it can't finish right there 
I used to wonder what my old girl doing right now 
Ever since you came into my life 
Everytime I think it'd be good to call her 
I just think about you and it'd make me think twice, ah yeah 
I know we've been through a couple things 
You know a couple things, what are we to do 
But you make me feel good 
You love me for me and you love me for you 
Come on 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright (it's gon be alright) 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright

All they do is stare 
She has a good trench

Right there I have my share 
Sweet gitchey rose

I had a plan to steal her heart 
And be her only man 
I buy her things, find her a home 
Where she can rest her wings 
But all he wants to do is fly 
She doesn't stop to ask a question, why? 
One day she leaves 
With no goodbye

Don?t you hate the way it?s all so fake? 
All I wanna do is just be real 
And get off of the spinning wheel 
All they sell us is a pack of lies 
And we?re buying one in every size 
Can?t you see it in the children?s eyes? 
It?s about to get wild

With no regret to what you did wrong 
Should I stay and fight? 
Can we make this right? 
You looked through me like an open door 
Do I exist to you anymore? 
Cause when I'm talking to you 
There's someone else that you're hearing 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
You played your game, used me like a pawn 
Check mate you're done and then you were gone 
Did I move too fast? 
I thought we would last 
Now that you're through I can feel your soul 
Where there was love lies an empty hole 
Cause when I make love to you 
It's someone else that you're feeling 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
So many nights 
I've been standing at the wall 
Blind folded with cigarette 
Waiting for the fall 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber

you say you don't love me

there are so many so many rainbows

but baby baby why can't we survive ? 
we've got to get our heads untangled

Have the faith of a child 
We're facing problems at a catastrophic rate 
Folks are desperate 
So many wars are on our plate 
We're using religion 
And with it we're pushing hate 
Wonder if there'll be time to change our fate

Is not gonna wither and die 
The future of our space and time 
Is not gonna say goodbye 
We can't control all our situations 
And we can't console underpriviledged 
Nations 
So why don't we try 
To make more smiling faces 
We're so full of disregards 
We feel pain within our hearts 
I can't take it 
The future of our space and time 
Is not gonna wither and die 
The future of our space and time 
Is not gonna say goodbye 
So I'm calling out 
Out to all he races 
We can't gain control 
Without communication 
And we need to learn for future generations 
There is a future in our stars 
There is beauty that is ours 
We're gonna make it

What's been goin' on 
I've been tryin' to get through to you 
Has it really been that long? 
I've been thinkin' about you baby 
And the way it used to be 
There's so many things I want to say 
But will the words come out all wrong? 
After all that's said and done 
You're still the only one 
You're the only one for me 
I'm the only one for you 
Baby can't you see 
You're still the only one 
Each and every night I pray 
Hopin' there'll come a day 
Baby you believe 
You're still the only one 
Got to find a way 
To get back inside your heart again 
If I let you walk away 
I'd be dyin' without you baby 
So I just keep holdin' on 
Don't you know we were meant to be 
But then I knew it all along 
After all that we've been through 
You're still the only one 
You're the only one for me 
I'm the only one for you 
Baby can't you see 
You're still the only one 
Each and every night I pray 
Hopin' there'll come a day 
Baby you believe 
You're still the only one 
And the fire of our love 
Keeps me runnin' back to you 
And no matter where you are 
I will never be that far 
Away 
You're the only one for me 
I'm the only one for you 
Baby can't you see 
You're still the only one 
Each and every night I pray 
Hopin' there'll come a day 
Baby you believe 
You're still the only one 
Ain't no need to wonder why 
I'll love you 'till the day I die 
Baby I believe 
You're still the only one 
You're the only one 
You're the only one 
You're the only one for me sweet baby 
You're the only one 
You're the only one 
You're the only one for me sweet darlin'

When times are rough and hard 
With you is where I want to be, yeah

With you is where I'll be 
Oh yeah

I missed you so, you know you broke me down 
Are we ready to, give it one more try? 
Play on 
While you were gone, I tried to mend my heart 
But I didn't know, even where to start 
I'd rather be with you even when we fight 
I'll take all you offer 
Because it's all the same 
The thorn with the flower 
The pleasure and the pain 
I'll climb up that mountain 
Because it's you I gain 
I can't live without it 
The pleasure and the pain 
I love the way, that you keep it real 
You're not afraid, to tell me the deal 
And, you tell me when I'm wrong, when I'm tripping out 
Cause a man like me needs a woman who 
Will walk the walk, and is a warrior too 
But, with that comes a truth, and there is no doubt 
I'll take all you offer 
Because it's all the same 
The thorn with the flower 
The pleasure and the pain 
I'll climb up that mountain 
Because it's you I gain 
I can't live without it

I still be me, and you still be you 
The only difference, will be within our minds 
I'll take all you offer

And he's coming back again

To reclaim all his souls and set us free 
The resurrection is here to stay

Look waht he's done to me 
Now I am living in another space and time 
He walked on the righteous path 
To keep us from Satan's wrath 
We are not alone

You must be walking 
On shaky ground 
You're always jumping 
At every sound 
You've been a hustler for all your days 
A real motherfucker in every day 
When you're a loser you're all alone 
So you made up for everything 
That you thought you'd lost 
But you paid a cost 
Hey... 
You can live your life for so long 
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall 
You can live your life for so long 
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall 
You're always running 
With every game 
First you're pushin' coke and then you're hoin' dames 
You say you can't give nothing better back 
Than you got back at home 
Well I tell you that's bullshit brother 
And that's heavy load 
It's an illusion when you think you're the boss 
Oh no no no 
'Cause you really ain't got a thing 
But the crumbs you're tossed 
But don't you feel the frost 
Hey.. 
You can live your life for so long

And all the things that you wanted me to be 
And I?m trying now 
Oh I?m thinking of you 
And all the things that you wanted me to be 
Tell me mama 
Are the colors deeper shades? 
And tell me mama are there great big brass parades? 
Does the sun shine night and day? 
Tell me mama no more sleeping 
Tell me mama no more weeping 
Oh I?m thinking of you 
And all the things that you wanted me to be 
And I?m trying now 
Oh I?m thinking of you 
And all the things that you wanted me to be 
Tell me mama is it just the way they say? 
And tell me mama are you missing me the way 
That I?m missing you today? 
Tell me mama can you hear me? 
Oh I?m thinking of you 
And all the things that you wanted me to be 
And I?m trying now 
Oh I?m thinking of you</field>

Tell me, how can you be sure 
There ain't always next season 
There ain't always an open door 
Life is dear, don't you waste it 
The future no one can see 
So step aside and let it be 
Tomorrow may wash away 
Don't put off what you do today 
Take advantage while you are here 
'Cause this moment is all there is 
Do you smell the flowers 
While they are still here in bloom 
Does there have to be a reason 
If you don't think 
We'll be gone real soon 
Life is here can you taste it 
The future no one can see 
So step aside and let it be 
Tomorrow may wash away 
Don't put off what you do today 
Take advantage while you are here 
'Cause this moment is all there is 
Don't live in fear and weakness 
Don't live and hide it all 
Does your your ability to taste 
The sweetness, sweetness 
And that is 
What we are here for 
Life is real 
Don't you fake it, oh 
The future no one can see 
So step aside and let it be 
Tomorrow may wash away 
Don't put off 
What you do today 
Take advantage 
While you are here 
Cause this moment 
Is all there is, there is 
This moment 
The future no one can see 
So step aside and just let it be 
Don't wait for tomorrow</field>

All I want 
Is all you got 
Make me happy baby 
And I'll make it hot 
I don't need no doctor 
To tell me what to do 
'Cause I know I'm goin' 
Straight ahead for you 
I got that tunnel vision goin' through my head 
I can't helf myself all I see is red 
Tunnel vision goin' through my head 
Lay me down inside your flying bed 
All that's yours 
And all that's mine 
We'll put together baby 
And we can combine 
We don't need no lawyer 
Let's not make this long 
We just need a love thing 
That's beautiful and strong 
I got that tunnel vision 
Goin' through my head 
I can't helf myself all I see is red 
Tunnel vision goin' through my head 
Lay me down inside your flying bed 
Tunnel vision goin' through my head 
I can't helf myself all I see is red

My daddy said come walk with me 
He said beeing a man 
Comes with responsibility 
And all is keep your word

My friends feel it's their appointed duty 
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me 
Uh huh but my answer about all that use me stuff 
I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used 
You can keep on using me 
Until you use me up 
Until you use me up 
My brother sit me right down and he talked to me 
He told me that I ought to not let you just walk on me 
Well I'm sure that he meant well, yeah but when our talk was throught 
I said brother if you only knew you'd wish you were in my shoes 
You can keep on using me 
Until you use me up 
Until you use me up 
Sometimes it's true you really do abuse me 
Oh you get me in a crowd of high class people 
And you act real rude to me 
I said, oh baby, baby, baby, baby, when you love me I can't get enough 
I wanna spread the news that if it feels this good getting used 
You can keep on using me 
Until you use me up.</field>

Politicians think that war is the way 
But we know that love has the power

You can live any way you wanna 
All you have to do is dance 
Achieve anything you thought of 
You just have to take the chance 
You can fall in love with your life 
'Cause that truly is romance 
What did I do with my life? 
Did I learn what I came to learn? 
Did I listen with my heart?

All mute no light no sun only night 
As far away as neverland 
As the sky comes tumbling down to the head 
And the valleys are all filed up with dirt 
As many people as there are sands in the sea 
Will die the morning after 
So little girl with your heroin so blue 
I guess our future is all up to you 
Through the battle sequence you must fight 
'Til the morning turns to night 
So imagine our world with no air 
Just follow the son, he'll take you where 
The night and the seas are all full of light

You're feeling alone and sad 
This is what you must understand 
Chorus: 
There is way 
Yesterday is gone 
It's a new day 
Yesterday is gone 
Yesterday is gone 
Yesterday is gone 
My dear kay 
You can't get nowhere 
Staying at home and crying 
You can't go on 
Living in the past 
The one thing constant 
Is that there is always change 
Not everything in life 
Is meant to last

Lord knows that I'm trying 
I want to keep the master's plan 
But sometimes things get wild 
Demons sleep with me in bed 
I can feel their fire 
When darkness gets around my head 
Sometimes I go blind 
But you were in my heart 
While the evil eye was searching out and staring at me 
But you were in my heart 
While the maids of doom, were reaching out and tempting me 
The world can give you everything 
Anything you want 
Money, fame 
And all it brings 
Whatever turns you on 
But your blood's running through my veins 
And I am standing tall 
But even though you took my place 
You are somehow bound to fall 
But you were in my heart 
While the evil eye was searching out and staring at me 
But you were in my heart 
While the maids of doom, were reaching out and tempting me 
But you were in my heart 
While the evil eye was searching out and staring at me 
But you were in my heart 
While the maids of doom, were reaching out and tempting me 
But you were in my heart 
While the evil eye was searching out and staring at me

Hey baby 
There's something on my mind 
Got to tell you 
I never thought I'd find 
Love that is simple and so kind 
Love that is caring so divine 
Your love has got a handle on my mind 
Sweet as cherry 
Fine like wine 
Gonna love you 'till the end of time 
Hey baby come put your arms in mine 
Let's make love 
'cause I need to take that ride 
I'm on top of the world 
'Cause you're my baby and I'm your girl. 
Your love has got a handle on my mind 
Sweet as cherry 
Fine like wine 
Gonna love you 'till the end of time 
Put you sweet lips over mine 
And open wide 
When we're together I just can't hide 
'Cause we've got a beautiful vibration 
And we've got a beautiful situation 
Your love has got a handle on my mind 
Sweet as cherry 
Fine like wine.</field>

Would you like to get a bagel on the way

Good morning 
Get on and we go downtown 
Get off and go in the tower 
The boss is old but he has the power 
 
So we're up 
Top of the morning to you 
Good morning to you 
Hey 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
It's another day in the world in which we live 
 
I've got to find a way 
To get past what I can't forgive 
And no matter what we've got to try to move along 
So sing a song 
You can't go wrong 
Good morning 
Nice to see you 
How you been 
The beginning of another, lovely day

The clouds are forming 
She comes again 
I'll go and walk with her 
Along the Seine 
Soon she'll be storming 
Here comes the wind 
But that don't bother me 
'Cause she's my friend 
 
I love the rain 
I love the rain 
 
[Verse 2] 
I've held our memories 
All of these years 
So many good times 
And many tears 
I share my dreams with her 
I share my fears 
So I just walk with her until she veers 
Off in the distance 
 
I love the rain 
I love the rain 
I love 
I love 
I love the rain 
 
[Verse 3] 
Oh 
Just as she always does 
She has to leave 
With her she takes my heart 
Into her breeze 
Sometimes I think that she 
Just likes to tease 
Still I'll be waiting 
For her reprise 
 
I love the rain 
I love the rain 
I love the rain 
I love the rain

Just believe and you will see that God

For you to explore 
Why you're here 
What do you say 
And the beauty is that you're the one 
Who controls just how you play 
There's a choice that you need to make 
One is ore and one is clay 
So drop your chains and take up your cross 
And let Jesus make your way 
If you want it

Your world today

            <field name="lyrics">Martin Luther King, he had a vision 
(And that's a fact) 
He died so we could see, that was his mission  
(So don't look back) 
 
There is no division, don't you understand 
The future looks as though it has come around 
And maybe we have finally found our common ground 
We're the children of our father 
If you're looking back don't bother 
We're black and white America 
 
In 1963 my father married  
(A black woman) 
And when they walked the streets, they were in danger 
(Look what you've done) 
 
But they just kept on walking forward hand in hand 
The future looks as though it has come around 
And maybe we have finally found our common ground 
We're the children of our father 
If you're looking back don't bother 
We're black and white America 
 
The future looks as though it has come around 
And maybe we have finally found our common ground 
We're the children of our father 
If you're looking back don't bother 
We're black and white America 
 
We've waited so long 
We've waited so long 
 
Black and white America 
There is no division, don't you understand 
The future looks as though it has come around 
And maybe we have finally found our common ground 
We're the children of our father 
If you're looking back don't bother 
We're black and white America 
 
The future looks as though it has come around 
And maybe we have finally found our common ground 
We're the children of our father 
If you're looking back don't bother 
We're black and white America 
 
The future looks as though it has come around 
And maybe we have finally found our common ground 
We're the children of our father 
If you're looking back don't bother 
We're black and white America 
 
Oh, yeah 
Black and white America  
Gonna keep on moving forward  
Oh blow it out</field>

Late night the speaker's pumpin' 
Flesh-to-flesh, grind-n-bumpin' 
Hot pants, green and yellow 
Round thighs, feeling mellow 
The beat of the ghetto 
Corn rows, bees and Afros  
the deed buzz from Nassau 
I'd love to show the night 
 
Go sister, roll on it 
Don't let the music stop 
Girl gon' make that Boongie drop

Black heat fills the dance hall 
Lovebirds got the back wall 
Junglers boot like labels 
High heels on the tables 
Bare feet on the dirt floor 
No one cares if you're poor 
every lock in the door 
ain't coming home tonight

Like Petra, remember hah? 
Remember me from the basement parties? 
i remember you tight tight no pantie

Brother rubbing so close stepping on my Nikes 
At the red light, never give me red light 
Only give me green light, you know what I mean right? 
After my Red Stripe, hop up on my motorbike 
Show me what the motor like

All of my Guyanese, girl, they're Bohemians 
All of my Jamaicans, shake it for me, shake it then

Why can't we work it on out 
I know we can make it, ooh yeah

Thank you 
 
Uh, thank you God that I am able 
Got my shelter and food on the table 
I got my health, don't need no pride 
'Cause everything I need you gave me inside 
 
Life ain't never been better than it is now 
I ain't lonely, I'm by myself 
'Cause when you got the Lord you got all the wealth 
Check me out I am sailing 
It's my time and there's no way than I'm failing 
 
Uh, life ain't never been better than it is now 
I know the world is really crazy 
But that's the time we got to stop being lazy 
 
We got to stand, stand up for what's right 
We got to separate the darkness from the light 
Uh,life ain't never been better than it is now 
Life ain't never been better than it is now 
Go shorty, 
 
I've seen the world, I've seen it all 
We're headed for the wall and we're gonna fall 
Like the days way back in Rome 
We're stepping right inside of the danger zone 
 
But life ain't never been better than it is now 
Life ain't never been better than it is now 
You see people come and people go 
And people always get just what they sow 
 
But I believe in this thing called love 
And our ability to rise above 
Uh, life ain't never been better than it is now 
Life ain't never been better than it is now 
 
Uh, life ain't ever been better 
Life ain't ever been better 
Life ain't never been better than it is now 
Oh alright now 
 
It's warfare out there 
So we got to suit up and put on our armor 
Headed for the front line, uh  
It's gonna be alright 
It's gonna be alright 
 
Just stay thankful and grateful, mmm

Oh yeah yeah, looking back on love  
Oh, uh  
 
Looking back on love 
Like a rerun in my mind 
Looking back on love  
But it seems as if I am blind 
 
Holding memories  
Like a sun that always shine  
Now I need to find a love I can call mine 
Oh oh, looking back on love 
 
Oh, yeah 
 
Looking back  
Looking back on love 
 
Looking back on love

Once I go beneath  
Will I finally be alive? 
Yeah, looking back on love

She knows that she's got the hook

A real bollita 
She loves the stage 
La senorita 
Inside a cage 
You'll find a cheetah 
 
She's all the rage,  
A double feature 
She got that thing take  
The bible from the preacher 
You'll need a sage,  
To find that creature 
 
She knows that she's got the look 
And she's gonna play 
She knows that she's got the hook 
And ya gonna pay

You're gonna see tomorrow 
That you'll be on your feet again 
Sometimes the world's gonna knock you over 
But you will see who are your friends 
 
Come on, stand, up again 
Come on, stand, 
Stand, you're gonna run again 
 
Your faith and patience will be your soldiers 
To guide you through your troubled times 
Just put one foot in front of the other 
The battles are inside your mind 
You have the power to face your demons 
No matter how big or what kind 
And rid yourself of your fear and weakness 
So you can start to live your life 
 
Come on, stand, up again 
Come on, stand, 
Stand, you're gonna run again 
 
Come on baby, stand, up again 
Stand yeah, come on, stand 
Come on you can make it 
Stand, you're gonna run again 
 
Pick up your will and put on your face 
If you need to, just take my hand 
It's time to demonstrate, don't hesitate 
Just get up and say "Yes, I can" 
 
Stand, up again 
Come on, stand, 
Stand, you're gonna run again 
 
Stand, oh stand, up again 
Stand up again, come on, stand, 
Oh come on baby 
Stand, you're gonna run again

You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
 
In a world that's crumbling, all around us everyday 
You are, all the inspiration that I need to find my way 
How long have I been yearning, for the day I find my one true love 
Now that you are here my darling, I want you to stay (I want you to stay) 
 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright (alright) 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
 
Whenever you call me, I'll be there with no delay, my love 
Even when I'm miles away girl, my heart will be there (I'll be right there) 
Any conversation that you want to have, you'll have my ear 
You can tell me all your secrets, they'll be safe my dear 
 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
You're (you're), making it feel that everything is alright (alright) 
You're my sunflower, (ooh)you're my sunflower 
 
I'm not that good with words, but I'ma, I'm gon' try my best 
Look, I won't ever wanna make you mad girl 
I just wanna have a seed you know the things young men are hesitant to have, girl 
A little you a little me and someone else, good Lord that's a winner right there 
But we really got a story to tell, it can't finish right there 
I used to wonder what my old girl doing right now 
Ever since you came into my life 
Every time I think it'd be good to call her 
I just think about you and it'd make me think twice, ah yeah 
Yeah, I know we've been through a couple things 
You know a couple things, what are we to do 
But you make me feel good, you love me for me and you love me for you 
Come on 
 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright (it's gon' be alright) 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower, hey 
You're, making it feel that everything is alright (alright) 
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower 
 
You're (you're), making it feel that everything is alright (alright) 
You're my sunflower, (ooh)you're my sunflower 
Hey, you're, making it feel that everything is alright (it's gon' be alright)

With no regret to what you did wrong 
Should I stay and fight? Can we make this right? 
You looked through me like an open door 
Do I exist to you anymore? 
'Cause when I'm talking to you 
There's someone else that you're hearing 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
 
You've played your game, used me like a pawn 
Check mate, you're done and then you were gone 
Did I moved too fast? I thought we would last 
Now that you're through, I can't feel your soul 
Where there was love lies an empty hole 
'Cause when I make love to you 
It's someone else that you're feeling 
 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
 
For so many nights 
I've been standing at the wall 
Blind folded with cigarette 
Waiting for the fall 
 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last 
 
I gave you all the love I had 
And I almost gave you one more chance 
Then you put one in the chamber 
And shot my heart of glass 
This time will be the last

In your dirty white boots, come on 
We're gonna get it on 
In your dirty white boots, come on, come on 
 
You know these games we play 
They give me such pleasure 
The girls in magazines 
Cannot even measure 
There's nothing you won't do 
I don't have the pressure 
Take your knickers down 
And give me that treasure, come on

You're the one that brings me ecstasy 
Girl I need your lovin' every day 
You're the only one who could make me stay (? Play them guitar)

I missed you so. You know you broke me down, why 
I was ready to give it one more try 
Play on 
 
While you were gone I tried to mend my heart 
But I didn't know even where to start, I 
Rather be with you even when we fight 
 
I'll take all you offer, 
Because it's all the same 
The thorn with the flower 
The pleasure and the pain 
I'll climb up that mountain 
Because it's you again 
I can't live without it 
The pleasure and the pain 
 
I love the way that you keep it real 
You're not afraid to tell me the deal and 
You tell me when I'm wrong, when I'm tripping out 
'Cause a man like me, needs a woman who 
Who walk the wall and is a warrior too, but 
With that comes the truth and there is no doubt 
 
That I'll take all you offer, 
Because it's all the same 
The thorn with the flower 
The pleasure and the pain 
I'll climb all the mountains 
Because it's you again 
I can't live without it 
The pleasure and the pain 
 
I think this time we can make it trough 
I'm still the me and you're still the you, the 
Only difference will be within our minds 
 
I'll take all you offer, 
Because it's all the same

Her parents left her, she was out in the cold  
Alone to live and find her way  
In this great world of heartache and pain  
 
Eyes of brown, matted locks of gold  
Her flowered dress is tattered and soiled  
Tear stained cheeks, her feet cold and bare  
Who could have left a child so rare  
 
Rosemary your day will come  
He loved you so He gave His only son  
Keep the faith in your soul  
Stay down on your knees  
I'm begging you please  
Hold onto the beads at your heart  
 
A burning heart and tired eyes  
Howling winds for lullabys  
No one there to soothe her fright  
Nowhere to turn but the inward light  
Because life is for believing  
That your heart can turn to gold  
All you need is Christ to receive it  
There's eternal life for every soul  
 
Rosemary your day will come  
He loved you so He gave His only son  
Keep the faith in your soul  
Stay down on your knees

He needs you

So don't let him down

Leave you in road to die

To tainted dreams and polluted seas  
The missing moon and melting trees  
A mist of doom and clouds of pain  
A toxic waste and an acid rain  
The passing of our ignorance  
A lifetime spent in abstinence  
 
I living in fear, I living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
I living in fear, I living in fear  
 
Conditioned to hate and them to blame  
Their search for God is just the same  
Machines for hearts, how warped a view  
Forgeting that they're human too  
Waiting like a branded steer  
Who first will launch the burning spear  
When every day may be your last  
You think we'd learn from our past  
 
I living in fear, I living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
I living in fear, I living in fear

More wounded soldiers, another burning flag  
And rows and rows of body bags  
No time for tears as the night falls cold  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
The day survivors crawl back in their holes  
As for the rest they're shipped back home  
Home to the rows of white tomb stones

Walk with the Father  
Won't be a bother  
To touch the Earth as it was  
We'll farm the land each day  
And in the sunshine we will play  
Glory glory for the day He came  
Our tears had gone away  
We'll make love in the shade  
And in the ocean we will bathe  
Little fishies in the sea  
Say hooray

Our children will grow  
Darling this is a must  
We'll be so happy  
Our little family  
So full of love and trust  
And darling when we're old  
We'll close the gates and lock the door  
Our love will never fade away  
When it's pure it forever last  
And darling when you're cold  
I'll hold you tight and keep you warm  
Little darlin' gonna make it through the storm  
You'll never be alone  
 
I build this garden for us, I build this garden for us  
I build this garden for us, I build this garden for us  
 
In this garden  
They'll be no war  
No racial prejudice  
You'll be my brother  
Of any color  
You'll just be okay with us  
We'll live each day in peace  
In hope that we will one day reach  
The rest of the world  
When they are ready to be teached  
The kingdom will come  
Thy will will be done  
On Earth as it is in heaven

She sleeps and eats with the plague 
She's got a baby in her belly

I just want you to be my woman 
More than anything in this world 
I want to be your man 
 
I'd walk through fire 
Stand in the rain 
I'll go to hell and back 
On a plane 
 
I'd scale the mountains 
Swim the seas 
I beg for mercy 
Down on my knees 
 
More than anything in this world 
I just want you to be my woman 
More than anything in this world 
I want to be your man 
 
I caused you sorrow 
I've caused you pain 
But love is all we will have to gain 
I searched to whole world, oh I 
And I want you to be my baby 
 
More than anything in this world 
I just want you to be my woman 
More than anything in this world 
I want to be your man</field>

We've ruined what's pure down from nature below 
You'd better look back it'll all be gone 
 
It's gonna come around 
What goes around comes around 
It's gonna come around 
What goes around comes around 
 
So children please listen this world is yours 
This message is too deep to ignore 
Your forefathers said but they did not do 
The things that would show that they cared for you 
 
It's gonna come around 
What goes around comes around 
It's gonna come around 
What goes around comes around 
Comes around comes around comes around 
Comes around comes around comes around 
Comes around comes around comes around 
Comes around yeah

You've got to find the future in you 
Your scepters and needles will put you away 
Forever and a day 
 
Your future will haunt you before you get there 
Imagine the planet with no air 
All mute no light no sun only light 
As far away as neverland 
 
As the sky comes tumbling down to the head 
And the valleys are all filed up with dirt 
As many people as there are sands in the sea 
Will die the morning after 
 
So little girl with your heroin so blue 
I guess our future is all up to you 
Through the battle sequence you must fight 
'Til the morning turns to night 
 
So imagine our world with no air 
Just follow the son, he'll take you where 
The night and the seas are all full of light 
'Til the morning turns to night 
 
'Til the morning turns to night</field>

'Cause it's been such a long long time 
It's time for ascension 
To be free, to be wild 
 
Rise up, rise up 
Get up, get up 
Come on, come on 
 
Come with me baby, 
'Cause it's been such a long long time 
It's time for ascension 
To be free, to be wild 
Come with me baby, 
'Cause it's been such a long long time 
It's time for ascension 
To be free, to be wild 
To be wild, to be wild, 
To be free to be wide

Because I accept it as it is  
The sunshine is shining  
Because it is what it is  
 
What a beautiful feeling it's bringing  
All the birds in the sky are singing  
 
Eleutheria the fire is burning  
Eleutheria the tables are turning  
 
A new day is dawning  
Because it is time for a change  
With new consciousness forming  
There comes a new day  
 
Oh we got to got to keep on trying  
When the children are cold and alone  
And are crying  
You got to understand  
 
Eleutheria the bells are ringing  
Eleutheria the people are singing  
Eleutheria the people are yearning  
Eleutheria this world keeps on turning  
Turning 
 
What a beutiful feeling  
It's bringing  
All the birds in the sky are singing  
You got to understand 
 
Eleutheria the fire is burning  
Eleutheria the tables are turning  
Eleutheria the bells are ringing  
The people keep singing

Did you have to fall in love  
With a man  
That never was  
 
Up to no good  
He took your soul  
And he stole your only heart  
Flipped your wig and left a permanent scar  
 
Sister  
Did you have to go away  
You left your home  
And the things you had to say  
 
It didn't feel good to let you slide  
I never got to say goodbye  
I miss you girl I think I'm gonna cry  
 
If they knock on your door  
You already gave  
You don't need no more of what's ailing you  
Just lean on your soul with all that it takes  
 
May god bring you back home to America  
America, America, America, America.  
 
Sister, sister, sister, sister, sister  
It's just a test of faith  
Your heart is pure so the devil's in your face  
I'll see you soon  
 
'Cause they haven't got a case  
And you'll be free  
In a beautiful place, in a beautiful place

And I won't stop until I'm done 
 
But what I really want to know is 
Are you gonna go my way? 
And I got to got to know 
 
I don't know why we always cry 
This we must leave and get undone 
We must engage and rearrange 
And turn this planet back to one 
 
So tell me why we got to die 
And kill each other one by one 
We've got to love and rub-a-dub 
We've got to dance and be in love 
 
But what I really want to know is 
Are you gonna go my way?

There's a room where we are with God  
Beyond the sun and moon  
Where the angels will be our guard  
 
Where the weather doesn't change  
Everyday is summer  
As the sands are numbered  
Instead of cannonball grey  
 
Do you think it's kinda strange ?  
Or can we be lovers ?  
As the spirit covers our electrified rage  
 
Hold me mama  
And we'll fly across the sea  
Way beyond the moon and stars and sky  
I'm talkin' bout you and God and I  
 
Now that the time is near  
I'm ready I have no fear  
I know you're the one my dear  
The stars will come out tonight  
 
In time for our sacred flight  
Together we'll be for life  
And I will burn in your flame  
Kiss me baby  
Take my hand and come with me  
 
I'm talkin'bout the moon and stars and sky  
I'm talkin'bout you and God and I  
Let's take it to the place where life was formed  
And to the place where Jesus Christ was born</field>

For what I'll never find  
She walked into my story  
Said she could change my mind  
 
This is the final offer  
She said to make it quick  
Don't lose out on this wonder  
So I had to place my bet  
 
Welcome to the picture show  
Watching your life  
Never know which way to go  
It might not be right  
So you better be strong  
 
What kind of circus is this ?  
What kind of fools are we ?  
When is the final curtain ?  
What can I do to set me free ?  
 
Welcome to the real world  
You better be strong  
Never know which way to go  
It might end up wrong  
So you better be strong  
 
Too many games we have to play  
They always change the rules  
You and me just trying to get along  
What can I do ?  
Got to be strong  
 
She walked into my daydream  
She told me how it had to be  
 
Welcome to the picture show  
Watching your life  
Never know which way to go  
It might not be right  
Yeah yeah  
 
Welcome to the real world  
You got to be strong

Then she took off all her clothes

American woman, mama let me be 
Don't come hanging around my door 
I don't want to see your face no more 
 
I got more important things to do 
Than spend my time growin' old with you 
Now woman, stay away 
American woman, listen what I say 
 
American woman, get away from me 
American woman, mama let me be 
Don't come knocking around my door 
I don't want to see your shadow no more 
 
Colored lights can hypnotize 
Sparkle someone else's eyes 
Now woman, get away 
American woman, listen what I say 
 
American woman, I said get way 
American woman, listen what I say 
Don't come hanging around my door 
Don't want to see your face no more 
 
I don't need your war machines 
I don't need your ghetto scenes 
Colored lights can hypnotize 
Sparkle someone else's eyes 
 
Now woman, get away 
American woman, listen what I say 
American woman, stay away from me 
American woman, mama let me be 
 
I gotta go 
I gotta getta away 
Think I gotta go 
I want to fly away 
 
I'm gonna leave you woman 
I'm gonna leave you woman

Bye bye, bye bye 
Bye bye, bye bye

You're no good for me 
 
And I'm no good for you

I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

But since I've opened my eyes 
And with you there's no disguise 
So I could open up my mind 
 
I always loved you from the start 
But I could not figure out 
That I had to do it everyday 
 
So I put away the fight 
Now I'm gonna live my life 
Giving you the most in every way

Without you 
 
I live life in luxury 
But I believe it's a crime 
When you can't enjoy it 
And all the time cry 
Or maybe some kind of spell 
'Cause it feels like a curse 
When there's so much water 
But all the time thirst 
 
I don't think I can make it 
Without you 
I don't think I can make it 
Without you 
 
My mind is a courthouse 
My soul is a jail 
My life is on death row 
'Cause you are not there 
I need a pardon 
I can't stand the pain 
What I'd do for your love now, 
If there's love to regain 
 
I don't think I can make it 
Without you 
I don't think I can make it

I heard a cry within my soul 
I never had a yearning quite like this before 
Now that you are walking right through my door 
 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
 
A sacred gift of heaven 
For better worse, wherever 
And I would never let somebody break you down 
Until you cried, never 
 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
 
At every time I've always known 
That you where there, upon your throne 
A lonely queen without her king 
I longed for you, my love forever 
 
All of my life 
Where have you been 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again 
And if that day comes 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Can't buy you from the place you're going to

You can't even sing or play an instrument 
So you just scream instead 
You're living for an image 
So you got five hundred women in your bed

But it's real hard to be yourself 
When you're living with those demons 
In your head

You're going in the can 
You look like the bank robber man 
I think you misunderstand 
Do you think that I am the one that did it 
Just because I'm tan? 
Just then the officer at hand said 
I don't give a damn that you are in a rock and roll band 
 
All units we've got our man 
We've got the bank robber man 
We don't need no reason 
You're going in the can

Just tell me what's going on ? 
Can you tell me what I did wrong ? 
Does busting me make you feel strong ?

I only hope someday you'll find  
That you can believe in me  
 
Those other loves that came before  
Mean nothing to me anymore  
But you can never be quite sure  
And will not believe in me  
 
Too many hearts have been broken  
Failing to trust what they feel  
But trust isn't something that's spoken  
And love's never wrong when it's real  
 
If I could only do one thing  
Then I would try to write and sing  
A song that ends your questioning  
And makes you believe in me  
 
And makes you believe in me  
Oh, you can believe in me</field>

Everybody's going down 
They end up all alone 
Far too many words unspoken 
I know I gotta be there, I'm ready to be shown 
The path of righteousness unbroken 
 
I need a love that takes me higher 
So high I'm never coming down 
 
I don't want to know emptiness 
Take me down to the water 
want to be baptized in your love 
Far away from the loneliness 
Take my heart and wash away the fear 
Let me be baptized in your love 
 
I would be a fool to let you go 
With you I'm reborn 
I'm no longer torn 
Yeah 
I refuse to lose my heart and soul 
I have to be strong 
 
I don't want to know emptiness 
Take me down to the water 
want to be baptized in your love 
Far away from the loneliness 
Take my heart and wash away the fear 
Let me be baptized in your love</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I was converted to the other side 
From the day I'd gotten there 
I met a girl who took me on a ride 
I was young I had no cares 
When I moved to California 
California 
 
She played me records I had never heard 
While we toked on purple hairs 
Who, Zeppelin, Beatles 
Kiss, The Rolling Stones 
While we played guitars in air 
 
When I moved to California 
California California 
California love 
 
Venice Beach and P.O.P. 
Station 26 was free 
Jeff Ho and Horizons west 
Dogtown Skates they were the best 
Hang Ten, O.P. were the brands 
Don't forget the two-tone Vans 
 
I miss the Apple and my schoolyard boys 
Nothing ever will compare 
But now I skateboard 
With my surfer girl 
And we really are a pair 
 
When I moved to California 
California 
California 
California love</field>

I thought I left my past behind 
I live my life and all I know is 
Follow your dream and don't let go 
 
No one can live for me 
No one can see the things I see 
I walk this road 
No one can tell me how to be 
It's my destiny 
 
There is no right, there is no wrong 
There is no place where I belong 
 
I've done my time 
I've held it strong and 
My life is all about this song 
 
No one can live for me 
No one can see the things I see 
I walk this road 
No one can tell me how to be 
It's my destiny 
 
If I threw them all away would it change? 
No 
I would live my life again, rearranged 
There's a magic in my heart 
That I feel 
Don't you know that god is love 
And it's real 
 
No one can live for me 
No one can see the things I see 
I walk this road 
No one can tell me how to be 
It's my destiny

'Cause soon I'll be the past 
But anyway I came here to tell you 'bout my plans

I don't want to be a star 
I don't need the fat cigar 
 
Too many distractions run through my brain 
So many girls they start to look the same 
Too many options no time to choose 
Too many clothes, too many shoes 
 
I've had the world I've done it upside down 
I played the part and I've been the clown 
Now it's my time, it's a brand new day 
To be myself in a different way 
I don't want to be a star 
Just want my chevy and an old guitar 
I don't want to be a star 
Just want my chevy and an old guitar 
I don't want to be a star 
I don't need the fat cigar 
 
I got to meet all the wonderful people 
I drank with Dylan boy did we act a fool 
I got to meet all the fabulous people 
I got high with Jagger, it was really cool 
 
I don't want to be a star 
Just want my chevy and an old guitar 
I don't want to be a star 
I don't need the fat cigar

Where are my kids having their fights? 
Calling my name so I can kiss their sores

Father can you tell me again that I'm livin' 
'Til I meet you on that day on the other side 
 
I'm internationally known 
With platinum and gold 
I've got millions sold 
But after the party, I'm left standing in the cold 
I would like to be a simple man 
I'd buy me a farm and live off the land 
Could a wife and some children be better than being in band?

At night, I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you 
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through

Jay-z: I got the bounce Lenny 
Check me out 
Brooklyn's bad boy back again 
Feet hit the ground runnin' and my back's to the wind 
Angels on my shoulders, head in the clouds 
No, I'm not rappin', I'm just thinkin' real loud 
My karma's my armor, my charm and wit 
Is like a lethal bomb, I'm warm and s*** 
And I did bad for good but when you're trapped in the 'hood 
You do worse for less, homie earth's a test 
Only god can judge me 
My heart ain't ugly 
But the thoughts that I drop is heavy 
Try budge me 
Mama loved me, pop left me 
Still the homies call me lucky lefty 
I'm flashy and bentley 
Deceptively smart 
I make hustlin' heaven and pimpin' an art 
Long as I know that I'm blessed 
'Cause I'm loved in depth 
I can walk through the water and not get wet 
I'm that fresh 
 
I walked away but I was wrong 
You're the one that keeps me strong 
You're the fire that keeps me warm 
How will I get through this storm? 
 
Jay-Z: There you have it 
Young hov, Lenny Kravitz 
Not your average 
Get your umbrella 
It's raining macs and broads 
all grace to god 
 
I walked away but I was wrong 
You're the one that keeps me strong 
You're the fire that keeps me warm 
How will I get through this storm?</field>

So you got five hundred women in your bed

When you're living with those demons

Just one more fight and I'll be history 
Yes I will straight up 
Leave your shit 
And you'll be the one who's left 
Missing me 
Yeah! 
This time I'm 'a let it all come out 
This time I'm 'a stand up and shout 
I'm 'a do things my way 
It's my way 
My way, or the highway 
This time I'm 'a let it all come out 
This time I'm 'a stand up and shout 
I'm 'a do things my way 
It's my way 
My way, or the highway 
Some day you'll see things my way 
Cause you never know 
Where, you never know 
Where you're gonna go 
Some day you'll see things my way 
Cause you never know 
Where, you never know 
Where you're gonna go 
Check out, check check..

            <field name="lyrics">All the tension in the world today 
All the little girls fillin up the world today 
With the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good 
But I'm gonna live my life like I should 
Now all the critics wanna hit it 
To shit-can how we did it, 
just because they don't get it 
But I'll stay fitted, new era commited 
Now this red cap gets a wrap from his critics 
Do we always gotta cry 
Do we always gotta live inside a lie 
Life's just a blast, 
it's movin' really fast 
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass 
Follow me into a solo 
Remember that kid so what you wanna do 
And where you gonna run 
when your starin' down the cable of my mic 
Pointed at your grill like a gun 
Limp Bizkit's rockin' the set 
It's like russian roulette when you're placin' your bet 
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done 
'cause I'm gonna be the one till I jet 
I know why you wanna hate me (3x) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
I know you wanna hate me (3x) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
Does anybody really know the secret 
Or the combination for this life and where to keep it 
It's kind a sad when you don't know the meaning 
But everything happens for a reason 
I don't even know what I should say 
'cause I'm an idiot, a loser 
A microphone abuser 
I analyze every second I exist 
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fist 
And everybody wanna run 
Everybody wanna hide from the gun 
You can take that ride through this life, 
if you want 
But you can't take the edge off a knife 
(no sir) 
And now you want your money back 
But you're denied, 'cause your brain's fried from the sack 
And there aint nothin' I could do 
'cause life is a lesson, 
you'll learn it when you're through 
I know why you wanna hate me (3x) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
I now you wanna hate me (3x) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
Now.. 
I.. 
know.. 
why 
(now I know why you wanna hate me) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately (3x)</field>

when it takes a strong man baby but I'm

I know you are asking me to stay 
say please please please don't go away 
cause you are giving me the blues 
baby 
you might mean all the words you say 
can't help but think of yesterday 
and another who tied me down to the loverboy blues 
before this river becomes an ocean

your hideous behavior hate what God gave ya,

you're bitin on my new style filed as a counterfeit, 
going down in history as nothin but a copy cat (copy cat) 
so if your fakin that you're phat 
you need a ballbat right where your head is at 
all your desperation causes separation

all these phonies you disregarded your life (disregarded your life) 
you disrespected your friends (you disrespected your friends) 
you've even stolen your appearance (stolen) from hangin out with my family 
but I should have never dropped my guard (shoulda never dropped my guard) 
so you could stab me in the back (stab me in the back) 
but you were faking me out (you were faking me out) 
just faking me out you wear a mask (you wear a mask) 
freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit, 
you're freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit - 6x 
now you're steadily startin to change 
you wanna rearrange 
your lifestyle with live like the wild child 
with the vibe alive you could lie to try and be so fly 
a lie but you deny you're a fake

Fucked up in the head, not! 
And maybe she just made a mistake 
And I should give her a break 
My heart will ache either way 
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say? 
I won't lie, that I can't deny

Why, did I wait so long, huh? 
To figure it out, but I did it 
And I'm the only one 
Underneath the sun who didn't get it 
I can't believe that I could be deceived 
By my so-called girl, but in reality 
Had a hidden agenda 
She put my tender, heart in a blender

I'm only human 
It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice 
They'll tell you, just let it go 
It's easier said than done 
I appreciate it, I do, but 
Just leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Just leave me alone 
And nothing gonna change 
You can go away 
I'm just gonna stay here

We don't need 
Need anymore pain 
We just need to remain on the very same page

No more losing a friend

way too soon. 
I feel disgusted and you should too. 
It's no good when all that's left 
is the sex. 
The sex. 
[Pre chorus] 
sex has become all I know about you. 
Memories of those filthy things that we do. 
There's not one single thought that is left 
after sex with you 
[chorus] 
should've left my pants on this time, 
but instead you had to let me dive right in. 
should've left my pants on this time. 
You let me dive right, 
you let me dive right in... 
wait... 
its my ass, 
your perfume 
that make my temptation hard to refuse. 
So I guess 
we undressed to have sex... 
dirty sex.

you couldn't respect yourself cuz 
I didn't respect myself.

We the band with the brand and we blowin up. 
This's goin out to the people who don't give a fuck. 
Time to throw a little party, who's showin up? 
Draggin swifties from the house to the front lawn. 
Start it up at dusk, wrap it up about dawn. 
All you ladys feelin crazy, time to get it on! 
Ain't invitin any fellas, they can stay at home! 
Lethal rockin on the tables, droppin all the funk. 
Sammy got the quarter, pourin drinks from his trunk. 
Otto got the fire goin woman up the buns. 
Wes is dressed up like an alien, we havin fun! 
Looks like the ratio is 90.2.10. 
90 percent filled up with women again! 
The block is full so let the party get hot! 
It's how we do it, if you like it or not!

We got this party goin harder than a motherfucker! 
All these naked ladies makin out with one another. 
Playboy Bunnies on the roof in the mini-skirts. 
I'm lookin up and what I'm seein then, it really hurts. 
My brother Corey D 
is paintin up a couple bodies. 
You ain't never seen a party with this many hotties! 
I just hear to Paul Wall and he's comin now. 
Reakwon is on the mic and he's buggin out! 
Corey Taylor got a harem chasin him around. 
We ain't slippin with his knot, then we goin down. 
But it doesn't got this lovin comin at me. 
Ain't nothin new caus I'm rollin with the LB!

Lately I've been skeptical 
Silent when I would used to speak 
Distant from all around me 
who witness me fail and become weak 
Life is overwhelming 
Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you 
when I don't fall down 
but you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain 
because you know it all 
and I guess things will never change 
but you might need my hand 
when falling in your whole 
Your disposition I'll remember when I'm letting go of... 
you and me we're through and rearranged 
It seems that your not satisfied 
there's too much on your mind 
So you leave and I can't believe 
all the bullshit that I find 
Life is overwhelming 
Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you 
when I don't fall down 
but you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain 
because you know it all 
and I guess things will never change 
but you might need my hand 
when falling in your whole 
Your disposition I'll remember when I'm letting go of... 
you and me we're through and rearranged 
you and me we're through and rearranged 
. 
you're no good for me 
Thank God it's over. 
You make believe 
that nothing is wrong until you're cryin' 
You make believe 
life is so long until you're dyin' 
You make believe 
that nothing is wrong until you're cryin', 
cryin' on me 
You make believe 
that life is so long until you're dyin', 
dyin' on me!! 
you think everybody is the same 
I don't think that anybody is like you 
You ruin everything 
and you kept fuckin' with me 
until it's over 
and I won't be the same

All the little girls fillin up the world today 
When the good comes to bad the bad comes to good 
But im gonna live a life like I should 
Now all the critics wanna hit it 
Shit can ever did it 
Just because they don’t get 
But I’ll stay fitted 
Knew there committed 
Unless this red cap 
Gets a bad rap from his critics 
Do we always gotta cry? (gotta cry) 
Do we always gotta be inside a lie (a lie) 
Life is just a blast 
Movin really fast 
Better stay on top 
or life will kick you in the ass 
Follow me into a solo 
Remember that, kid 
So what you wanna do? 
The way you wanna run 
When your starin down a cable 
of a mic put it that you grill like a gun 
Limp Bizkit is rockin the set 
Its like Russian Roulette 
When your placin your bet 
So don’t be upset 
when your broke 
And your done 
Cuz im gonna be the one

I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me

Now you wanna hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
Does anybody really know the secret? 
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it 
Its kinda sad when you don’t know the meaning 
But everything happens for a reason 
I don’t even know what I should say 
'Cause I'm an idiot a loser and a microphone abuser 
I analyze every second I exist 
Beaten on my mind every second with my fist 
And everybody wanna run (run) 
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (gun) 
You can take that ride through this life if you want 
You cant take that edge off that knife (no sir) 
And now you want your money back (money back) 
But your denied cuz your brains fried from the sac 
And there aint nothing I can do 
Cuz life is a lesson you’ll learn it when your through 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
Now I know why you want to hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
why you want to hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
Now you wanna hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
(Now I know why..Now I know why..Now I know why) 
Now I know why you wanna hate me 
Now I know why you wanna hate me

There goes another one that kept me breathing

I still adore you, you never need me 
Hold on 
I found another way to let you go away

You found another way to bleed my soul away 
Fred: 
The things you told me to hear you speak 
I'm burning slowly I'm growing weak 
You bring me closer to yesterday 
Yesterday's a million miles away 
Why can't you hear me? 
Why can't I see you? 
And I don't understand what keeps me breathing

Introducing 
the Choclate starfish 
and the hotdog flavored water! 
Bring it on! 
Get the fuck up! Yeah! Check! one, two! 
listen up, *Listen up* Listen up *listen up* 
Here we go *here we go* Here we go 
It's a Fucked up world; What a Fucked up place 
Everybodys judged by their Fucked up face 
Fucked up dreams; F'ed up life 
A F'ed up kid with a F'ed up knife 
F'ed up moms and f'ed up dads 
and a f'ed up cop with a f'ed badge 
Wtih a f'ed up job with f'ed up pay 
and a f'ed up boss who's a f'ed up gay 
f'ed up brests, f'ed up lives 
While lethal's in the back with the f'ed of the five 
*Hey, piss off* Everybody knows this song 
*Hey, piss off* Everybody knows this song 
Ain't it a shame that you can't say F? 
F's just a word and it's all F'ed up 
And a F'ed up punk with a F'ed up mouth 
And Nine inch nails is getting knocked the F out 
F'ed AIDs from F'ed up sex; and fake-ass titties on a F'ed up chest 
Your all f'ed up, so whatcha wanna do? F'ed up me, and f'ed up you. 
You wanna F me like an animal; You like to Burn me on the inside 
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug; 
Just know that nothing ya do, will bring you closer to me 
ain't life a bitch? a F'ed up bitch? A f'ed up sore with a F'ed up stitch 
a F'ed up head- It's a F'ed up shame 
swinging on my nuts is a F'ed up game 
Jealousy fillin' up a F'ed up mind; It's real F'ed up like a F'ed up crime 
If I say F two more times; That's 46 F's in this F'ed up rhyme 
*hey, piss off* everybody knows this song (x2) 
You wanna F me like an animal; You like to Burn me on the inside 
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug; 
Just know that nothing ya do, will bring you closer to me 
That's enough baby

I drive myself insane just hoping I can stay

Save me, save me before I drown 
It's getting closer to the end, I look back and smile 
We conquered every single bump in my road, made it all worthwhile 
Just remember how I cared when it came crashing down 
I'd like to toast to all those angels that were always hanging 'round 
Save me, save me before I drown 
Save me, save me before I drown, drown 
Oh, oh 
Maybe life ain't what it seems, 'cause it's all a dream 
Forgive me 
Sometimes I feel like a fool 'cause I'm so uncool 
Forgive me.</field>

Hey kid, who you looking at? 
Why you standin all up in my face like that? 
You at never seen a baseball bat? 
A maniac knocking on your baseball cap? 
You better step about 10 paces back 
Or you be layin where your shoelaces at 
Go do what your momma told you 
And donâ€™t be actin like a punk 
Thinking you a soldier 
I see you gotta yourself cell phone 
I gotta number you can dial son 
Make it 911 
Tell them stop and help 
Help is on the way kid 
Pick up some Playmates 
But only if theyâ€™re naked 
I donâ€™t know how they do it in your city 
But here weâ€™re getting down to the nitty gritty 
And I hate to put you out like that 
But you been burnin like a fire with a mouth like that 
Take me back to yesterday 
Rolling dice and getting laid 
Everything was A okay 
Ohhhohhhooooh 
But now and then a cloud rolls in 
Rains on my parade and then 
Talking this and that again 
Ohhhohhhoooohohhhhhoo 
Letâ€™s brake it down for a minute 
And roll it all up in third gear for a minute 
I got the 21s rubbin on my Benz and 
I got girlies in the back rubbin on my friends and 
I donâ€™t really give a fuck about 
What these playa hating pussies give a fuck about 
Cause Iâ€™m a night ranger 
Never been a stranger 
My 2 way pagers looking for some danger 
Zoolander hit you with the magnum 
Everybody get your groove on if you have one 
And if you ainâ€™t got it then admit it 
Itâ€™s Limp Bizkit, time for you to get it 
All around it this â€™45 Prievo(?) 
Everywhere that we go 
We watch it on the Tivo 
And now youâ€™re laying in the bed you made 
Drinking Hatorade 
Think about it 
Take me back to yesterday 
Rolling dice and getting laid 
Everything was A okay 
Ohhhohhhooooh 
But now and then a cloud rolls in 
Rains on my parade and then 
Talking this and that again 
Ohhhohhhoooohohhhhhoo 
Thinking that your all that and then some 
I got news for you 
Still thinking that your all that and then some 
Man I got news for you 
Let me guess, you ainâ€™t that impressed 
Mr 
Hali-tosis of the breath 
Living lifestyles of the wish you were 
From the bad guys of the thrifty-goods 
Got room to talk kid 
I been layin this track since North Cacilac 
And the very first day you fell off the sack 
Always in fat laces spinnin on my back 
Let me think let me move let me ride 
Let me put some funk in the trunk 
Memory that can ease your pain 
Like a melody from Kurt Kobain 
Cause you never know when itâ€™s all gonna end 
And you never know when you call on a friend 
You better take a step to prepare yourself 
Cause the way your livin now ainâ€™t good for your health 
Thinking that your all that and then some 
I got news for you 
Still thinking that your all that and then some 
Man I got news for you 
Thinking that your all that and then some 
I got news for you 
Still thinking that your all that and then some 
Man I got news for you</field>

This way we can all relate. 
Worldwide we collide. 
This is how we communicate. 
So lets make somethin' out of it. 
Whoever thought we would see the day. 
I cant believe we did it. 
So lets drift away. 
Hate, 
a feelin' I don't really get. 
And hate can get you in some serious shit. 
Time is somethin' 
that may change me, 
but I cant change time so fuck it. 
ive been stumblin' 
through these thoughts 
and I thought the fact that I could be delirious. 
but as the audience grows 
security knows 
stoppin me now is kinda serious 
No use in dreadin' 
what they call Armageddon. 
I think we made it through the slump. 
But who really cares where we're headin' 
cuz now you motherfuckers got a reason to jump!! 
so lets make somethin' out of it. 
This way we can all relate. 
Worldwide we collide. 
This is how we communicate. 
So lets make somethin' out of it. 
Whoever thought we would see the day. 
I cant believe we did it. 
So lets drift away. 
We see good things change 
and good things go away. 
We see good things waste 
and we taste the pain. 
What we need is 
a place to escape from today. 
Right? 
what we need is 
a place to escape from today!! 
right?!... 
Yeah 
Bring it on. 
(x4) 
you wanna be down with the G shock!! 
fuck the glam rock!! 
assed out like ken shamrock 
Mc's detest me, 
wanna chest to chest me, 
but I aint all about that. 
You gotta be down with the G shock!! 
fuck the glam rock!! 
assed out like ken shamrock!! 
Mc's detest me, 
wanna chest to chest me, 
but you don't want none of that

We the band with the brand and we blowin up. 
This's goin out to the people who don't give a fuck. 
Time to throw a little party, who's showin up? 
Draggin swifties from the house to the front lawn. 
Start it up at dusk, wrap it up about dawn. 
All you ladys feelin crazy, time to get it on! 
Ain't invitin any fellas, they can stay at home! 
Lethal rockin on the tables, droppin all the funk. 
Sammy got the quarter, pourin drinks from his trunk. 
Otto got the fire goin woman up the buns. 
Wes is dressed up like an alien, we havin fun! 
Looks like the ratio is 90.2.10. 
90 percent filled up with women again! 
The block is full so let the party get hot! 
It's how we do it, if you like it or not!

All these naked ladies makin out with one another. 
Playboy Bunnies on the roof in the mini-skirts. 
I'm lookin up and what I'm seein then, it really hurts. 
My brother Corey D 
is paintin up a couple bodies. 
You ain't never seen a party with this many hotties! 
I just hear to Paul Wall and he's comin now. 
Reakwon is on the mic and he's buggin out! 
Corey Taylor got a harem chasin him around. 
We ain't slippin with his knot, then we goin down. 
But it doesn't got this lovin comin at me. 
Ain't nothin new caus I'm rollin with the LB!

(KoRn with Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit) 
Fred: Say what, say what? Say what, say what? Say what, say what? 
My dick is bigger than yours...My band is bigger than yours. 
Fred: Too bad I got your beans in my bag (Aha). 
You stuck up sucker, KoRny mother fucker (oooo). 
Taking over flows, it's the limp, pimp, 
Need a (dick) bizkit to save this group from Jon Davis. 
I'm gonna drop a little East Side skill (ooo), 
So you best step back, 'cause I'ma kill, I'ma kill. 
So what you thinking Mr 
Raggedy Man, 
Doing all you can to look like Raggedy Anne. 
Jonathan: Check you out punk, yes I know you feel it, 
You look like one of those dancers from the Hanson video (say what, say what), 
You little faggot ho. 
Please give me some shit to work with, 
'Cause right now I'm all it kid, 
Suck my dick kid, 
Like your daddy did. 
Fred: Who the fuck you think you talkin' to? 
I'm known for eating whiney little chumps like you (whatever). 
All up in my face with that "Are you ready?!" 
When halitosis is all you're rockin' steady. 
You little fairy, smelling on your flowers, 
Nappy hairy chest, look it's Austin Powers! (Ah yeah, baby). 
I hear you tokin' on them fag pipes clod, but you said it best, 
"There's no place to hide." 
Jonathan: What the fuck you saying? 
You're a pimp whatever. 
Limp dick, Fred Durst needs to rehearse, 
Needs to reverse, what he's sayin' 
(Say what, say what) 
Wannabe Funkdoobie's what you're playin', 
Rippin' at my bag, counterfeit, fakin'. 
Plus your bills I'm payin'. 
You can't eat that shit every day Fred, 
Lay off the bacon. 
Fred: Say what, say what, you better your fuckin' mouth Jon. 
Jon: So you hate me! 
Fred: And I hate you! 
Jon: You know what, you know what, it's all in the family. 
I hate you! 
Fred: You hate me! 
Jon: You know what, it's all in the family. 
Jon: Look at you fool, I'm gonna fuck you up twice, 
Throwing rhymes at me like, oh shit alright! Vanilla Ice! 
You better run, run while you can, 
Can never fuck me up, Bitz Climpkit. 
At least I got a phat original band. 
Fred: Who's hot? Who's not? (You). 
You best step back, KoRn on the cob (okay), 
You need a new job (ha). 
Tryin' to take 'em mic skills back to the dentist 
And buy yourself a new drill (fuck you). 
You pumpkin pie, I'll jack off in your eye, 
Climbing shoots and ladders, while your ego shatters. 
But you just can't get away (get a gay?), 
Because it's Doomsday kid, it's Doomsday. 
Jon: So I hate you! 
Fred: And you hate me! 
Jon: You know what, you know what, it's all in the family. 
I hate you! 
Fred: And you hate me! 
Jon: You know what, you know what, it's all in the family. 
Fred: You call yourself a singer (yep), 
You're more like Jerry Springer (oh, cool). 
Your favorite band is Winger (Winger) 
And all you eat is zingers (zingers?). 
You're like a fruity pebble, 
Your favorite flag is rebel (yee haa!). 
It's just too bad that you're a fag and on a lower level. 
Jonathan: So you're from Jacksonville, kicking it like Buffalo Bill. 
Getting butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck, 
While your sister's on her knees waiting for your Fuckin' nut (oh yeah). 
Fred: Wait, where'd you get that little dance? (Over here). 
Like them idiots in Waco, you're burning up in Bako (huh). 
Where your father had your mother, your mother had your brother (nah uh). 
It's just too bad your father's mad and your mother's now your lover. 
Jonathan: Come on hillbilly, can your horse do a fuckin' wheelie? 
You love it down south and, boy, you sure do got a purty mouth. 
Jonathan: I hate you! 
Fred: And you hate me! 
Jonathan: You know what, you know what, it's all in the family. 
And I hate you! 
Fred: And you hate me! 
Jonathan: You know what, you know what, it's all in the family. 
Jonathan: And I love you! 
Fred: And I want you! 
Jonathan: And I'll suck you! 
Fred: And I'll fuck you! 
Jonathan: And I'll buck fuck you! 
Fred: And I'll eat you! 
Jonathan: And I'll lick your little tainty prick, mother fucker. 
Fred: Say what? Say...what?

took a lot of crap as a little boy 
always had to fight back as a little boy 
always under attack as a little boy 
never got good grades as a little boy 
I was locked in a cage as a little boy 
still I never was afraid as a little boy 
I was feeling my rage as a little boy 
it's time to blow their minds........ 
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 
learned how to lose as an older man 
sang a lot of blues as an older man 
but I saw it all through as an older man 
put together my crew as an older man 
felt a lot of pain as an older man 
I established my name as an older man 
people piss in my game as an older man 
ain't nothin' gonna change as an older man 
it's time to blow their minds now, baby 
it's time to blow their minds now, baby 
I'm on my grind now, baby 
y'all know it's my time now, baby 
Come on! 
(chorus) 
who that is? what it say?(x3) 
what it look like? 
what it look like baby? 
got treated like a clown as a little boy 
kept my feet on the ground as a little boy 
when you're living in a dream as a little boy 
ain't nothin' like it seems as a little boy 
I was hatin' on the world as a little boy 
I was lovin' all the girls as a little boy 
I was into punk rock as a little boy 
I was breaking non-stop as a little boy 
it's time to blow their minds........... 
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 
got treated like a chump as an older man 
mixing rock with the funk as an older man 
learned what a girl was as an older man 
now I know how to love as an older man 
but I'm still a big kid as an older man 
and I'd much rather give as an older man 
still I'm singing in the rain as an older man 
ain't nothin' gonna change as an older man 
it's time to blow their minds now, baby 
it's time to blow their minds now, baby 
I'm on my grind now, baby 
y'all know it's my time now, baby 
Come on! 
(chorus) 
my life is one big dream 
I'm lost in what it means 
don't wake me up 'cuz it's almost over 
these voices in my mind 
keep tellin' me it's time 
to wake me up 'cuz it's almost over 
it's time to blow their minds now baby 
it's time to blow their minds now baby 
I'm on my grind now baby 
y'all kno it's my time now baby

my life is one big dream 
I'm lost in what it means

Where you went, I can only guess 
Where I'll be, some other day 
A memory, with all I had to say 
You gave the love, you had to spare 
And in return, I built an island there 
When I dream, I see your face 
That's when we laugh, somewhere in outer space 
The Angels over me have seen me cry in agony 
The Angels over me they all believe this side of me 
Growin' up, without a cause 
I hear the tune, of my own applause 
There aint no right, when there's a wrong 
It's my mistake, I knew it all along 
I've been a fool, what's done is done 
I can't erase, and I refuse to run 
I'm beggin' you, to please forgive 
My heart is true, it's just the way I live 
The Angels over me have seen me cry in agony 
The Angels over me they all believe this side of me 
They see me cry! 
They see me cry! 
They see me cry! 
The Angels over me have seen me cry in agony 
They see me cry! 
The Angels over me they all believe this side of me 
They see me cry!</field>

They breack it down 
I wanna rock right now 
Looking for a spot that; s hot to get down 
Looking for a night that's gonna be worth 
Busting on the shelltow and doing the smurf 
Ain't stopping this grande 
I ain't even mind it 
If you put your lips on my timming 
Hands fly to the sky 
Swinging so high 
Up to the silver lining 
Fresh dressed like a million bucks 
Tiki baseball cap you know what's up 
Inside it's the claustrophobic 
If I'm gonna flow it I need room to through it 
Follow me to the place to be 
On the back porch with the symphony 
1, 2, 3 let's go, follow me follow me 
It's a party on the back porch 
I'm gonna take you to the back door

I have hours, only lonely 
My love is vengeance 
That's never free 
No one knows what it's like 
To be the bad man, to be the sad man 
Behind blue eyes</field>

my heart is gold 
I had to run away high 
So I wouldn't come home low 
Just when things went right 
It mean they were always wrong 
Just take this song and you'll never feel 
Left all alone 
Take me to your heart 
Feel me in your bones 
Just one more night 
And I'm comin'off this 
Long and winding road 
I'm on my way 
I'm on my way 
Home sweet home 
I guess that I've seen 
To make romantic dreams 
Up in lights, fallin'off 
The silver screen 
My heart's like an open book 
For the whole word to read 
Sometimes nothing-keeps me together 
At the seams 
I'm on my way 
I'm on my way 
Home sweet home 
I'm on my way 
I'm on my way 
Home 
It's a bittersweet symphony, this life 
Just tryina to make ends meet 
You're a slave to the money then you die 
Theres no change, I can change 
I can change, I can change 
But I'm here in my mind 
I am here in my mind 
And I'm a million different people 
from one day to the next 
I can change my mind 
No, no, no 
I'm on my way 
I'm on my way 
Home sweet home 
I'm on my way 
I'm on my way 
Home sweet home 
I'm on my way 
I'm on my way

(limp bizkit with Soulfly) 
What goes around comes around, you better realize 
You kill life 
You kill life 
Why? Why? 
I see your eyes, I see your lies. 
I see you hide, inside. 
What goes around comes around, now it's your time. 
How long can you lie? 
How long can you hide? 
How long can you live with your soul bleed? 
How long can you live with your soul..... 
(Chorus) Bleed! Bleed! Bleed! Bleed! Bleed! Bleed! [repeats] 
What goes around comes around, no more lies. 
You kill life 
You kill life 
Why? Why? 
I see a mother cry 
I see a brother cry. 
Bring it on! Bring it!!! 
I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now (bleed!) [repeats] 
Motherfucker! 
I got my pride and that's all I need! 
I'll make you bleed with another blow without the radio. 
Don't take advantage of this process. 
You might have to digest a blade, made for your ass to fade. 
I'm livin' on instinct. 
Never think when I'm rushin', bones crushin'. 
When I put your sorry ass in a package, you piece of shit! 
Sealed and delivered from a savage, and now you sweat because you're going down. 
You envious clown! Bleed! 
(Chorus)

Sweet Leth 
Limp Bizkit in the house ! 
(What fucken' house?) 
Seattle baby 
Terry Date, Limp Bizkit, Staind 
Bring the noise ! 
Bass! how low can you go? 
Death row what a brother knows 
Once again, back is the incredible 
The rhyme animal 
The incredible D 
Public Enemy number one 
Five-o said "freeze!" and I got numb 
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun? 
But it's the wax that the Terminator X-1 
Now they got me in a cell 'cuz my records they sell 
'Cuz a brother like me said "well?" 
Farrakhan's a racist and I think you should listen to 
What he can say to you what you otta do 
Follow for now power of the people say. 
"Make a miracle, D 
pump the lyrical" 
United we stand, all in all, we're gonna win. 
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again 
Turn it up, bring the noise! 
I said turn it up! bring the noise! 
Never badder than bad 'cuz the brother is madder than mad 
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator 
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope 
'Cuz the beats in the lines are so dope 
Listen for lessons I'm saying 
Inside music that the critics are all blasting me 
For they'll never care for the brother and sisters 
Now across the country has us up for the war. 
We got to demostrate,(come on!) 
They're gonna have to wait( 'till we get it right!) 
Radio stations I question their playlists 
They call themselves black. 
but we'll see if they'll play this 
Turn it up, bring the noise! 
I said turn it up! bring the noise! 
Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me 
My DJ is Lethal dose, we call him Leth you know 
He can cut a record from side to side 
So what, the ride the glide should be much safer than a suicide 
Soul control, beat is the father or our rock' n' roll 
Music for whatcha, for whichin' you call a band man 
Makin' a music abuse it but you can't do it, ya know 
You call 'em demos but we ride limos, too 
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you 
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono 
Run DMC first said a DJ could be a band 
Stand on it's feet get you out your seat 
Beat is for Eric B 
and LB as well, hell 
Records from Fred D still we can rock bells 
Ever for ever, Universal it will sell 
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it 
Turn it up, bring the noise! 
I said turn it up! bring the noise! 
Bring that fucken' noise, and get the fuck up 
Get the fuck up 
Bring the noise 
Bring it 
Fuck this 
Limp Bizkit 
Fuck this 
man,fuck this 
fuck Staind 
In the studio 
Fucken Suck ass 
Bring that noise 
Man fuck this 
Terry Date is a fucken pain 
Everybody shut up and turn the fucken' tape off !</field>

Hey mister, elevate that mind into a blister. 
You might need to rest up, I'll pump that chest up 
Because that mental is fadin' 
Ego, you over played it. 
Hey buster, ya' just can't be trusted 
Tha' drama, your mama musta really been disgusted. 
But ya' got no clue always screamin' everybody owes you 
Well kid, I never did 
And never will. 
It's gone too far. 
It's gone too far, end it soon. 
I never did. 
Well I never did, kid. 
It's gone too far. 
Broken' punks when bringin' on tha' funkin' 
Knowin' you man, your probably not thinkin' 
Caught ya' lip-sincin' 
Lyricals flyin' over that head you'll be cryin' 
Lyin' in your death bed, now your just a reject (reject) 
Ya put your fate on Micky D's just to gain a little respect 
But ya' got no clue, always screamin' everybody owes you. 
Well kid, I never did 
And never will. 
It's gone too far. 
Well it's gone way too far, boy. 
I never did. 
It's gone too far. 
You need to drop that freakin' ego before ya' crash. 
Before tha' headlights are simply glarin' in your eyes and your goin' down. 
What's tha' matter with tha' life that your leadin'? 
When your bleedin', everyone's thinkin' how much they hate you. 
It's not too late, dude 
Just that time for you to zip up that grill. 
Take a deep breath 
Look around 
Ain't nobody left, just tha' target 
Bullseye. 
Still you walk around like a clown in a forcefield. 
See I'm not crazy 
You're tha' one who's crazy. 
Institution 
Bound to be the only way that we can even solve this. 
I've had about as much as I can take, so do yourself a favor. 
It's been built up for so long. 
And I just wanna get it out! 
And I just wanna get it out!! 
Clunk! 
There's certainly some distortion in there 
What? 
Certainly some distortion in there. 
I can't hear you, I've got distortion in my ear. 
A thought just came to me while watching you and the guys play that. 
Um, the distortion feels the sound 
It's like anguish or frustration. 
Like trying to thread, a needle with. 
with... 
thread. 
And you keep trying 
(Can you thread a nee. 
a needle with a piece of wood?) 
And I wonder, I wonder if that's what happened when the kids were getting the guitars 
They were trying so hard, they wanted to play like their favorite singer 
They just couldn't bring it off, so they turned it up louder just to.. 
Because even your face got red, and, and the expression on your face was that of, of 
Sheer frustration, or anger, or just.. 
what do you feel when you play this distortion on there? 
Um, what I feel when I play distortion like that is, I'm faking that anger 
Letting it all out, ya' know 
There's no reservations or politness. 
I'm no longer trying to please anyone, I'm trying to please me 
Trying to get myself off. 
That's a form of honosty, isn't it? 
I suppose..</field>

Yeah 
Hey yo 
Hey yo 
I smoke on the mic

Holding a blunt with a scope 
And blaze shit up 
Much more harder to those 
We like barbers and hoes 
Flow is like 
Hard shit 
Yeah 
I'm unstoppable the rhyme is hollow tip 
Throws while I post it 
We gotta hit 
While I take shots at 
Chat Fiend 
Its like selling poison 
Upside inside the mind 
Nigga anything Raek says goes 
Limp Bizkit shit 
Mix together 
You are convinced 
It's frozen 
When the hit store 
Mix together metal and rap 
Can't you do better than that 
At one of our shoes 
But on the other hand we like you 
Don't bring your clan or band 
We fight you 
You might get a gunshot 
Rock and rap ready to rock 
Putting more on the map 
[Fred Durst] 
I terrorize with these eyes 
All you players on the sidelines 
Get victimized 
Ain't no mamma on this planet 
Who wont cry 
When you see the baby boy sucking thumb and 
Licking crumbs from their eyes 
Switch on the blade 
Pay the price pull the pin 
What this hand grenade splash 
I think I warned you again 
Take another route 
Devils waiting for the handshake 
Better sell me 
Cuz I'm gonna lead you to the gate 
Unforgivable 
Got shot 
You invisible 
Typical 
Ridiculed 
Motherfuckin' pitiful 
You don't know the half of these bitches im going through 
Bullet proof 
Pull a tooth 
Spiting juice 
Take a shot 
Naked absolute 
When I'm through 
You is through 
Speaking all that I know is true 
Blowing through this revenue 
Something you can never do

I all I want 
Maxin' in the wind 
Sweeties that match the black bed 
Stay relax in a black tent 
Roll runners gunners that throw hundreds 
Soldiers get so blunted 
Flex and drop bombs code wanted 
I all I want 
Maxin' in the wind 
Sweeties that match the black bed 
Stay relax in a black tent 
Roll runners gunners that throw hundreds 
Soldiers get so blunted 
Flex and drop bombs code wanted

Oh!

you're freakin' me out you wear a mask - 5x 
freakin' me out you wear a mask called counterfeit, 
you're freakin' me out you wear a.. 
FAKE 
hey man wake up and smell the concrete 
strange to see you've changed 
like the LB could be identity crisis but I can't buy this 
reality bites but that's what life is pitiful you, 
your hideous behavior hate what God gave ya, 
fakin all the flava artificial minds seekin out the new trends 
get in where you fit in 
quit thinkin like a has-been diggin 
in my culture let me let your punks know 
I'm an old school soldier with the funk flow 
a damn shame you wanna change yourself 
because you're sick of yourself 
{chorus} 
well I'm sick of you too, fake 
you're a, a counterfeit, fake 
you know we figured you out well I'm sick of you too, fake 
you're a, a counterfeit, fake 
I wonder, 
I wonder I wonder what it's like to be a clone doin' nothin, 
nothin' on my own alone in your misery, 
you're bitin on my new style filed as a counterfeit, 
going down in history as nothin but a copy cat (copy cat) 
so if your fakin that you're phat 
you need a ballbat right where your head is at 
all your desperation causes separation 
now I grab the mic to intimidate your weakness 
screams from the limp on your siren 
phonies get the hint quick smacked with funk flick pain 
for the fakers fame can't maintain 
{chorus} 
all these phonies you disregarded your life (disregarded your life) 
you disrespected your friends (you disrespected your friends) 
you've even stolen your appearance (stolen) from hangin out with my family 
but I should have never dropped my guard (shoulda never dropped my guard) 
so you could stab me in the back (stab me in the back) 
but you were faking me out (you were faking me out) 
just faking me out you wear a mask (you wear a mask) 
freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit, 
you're freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit - 6x 
now you're steadily startin to change 
you wanna rearrange 
your lifestyle with live like the wild child 
with the vibe alive you could lie to try and be so fly 
a lie but you deny you're a fake 
you know we figured you're a phony (fake) 
you know we figured you out (fake) 
you know we figured you out, figured you out, 
figured you out fake [a bunch of times].</field>

One, two fizzy 
Shut the fuck up! 
And bring down ballistic 
Riff from the Bizkit 
Right through the speakers 
With the (hey, hey) 
Check this future shock 
Of rock revolution, punk 
Here it comes, so shut it up 
You keep on talking 
Iâ€™ma shut your ass 
Straight the fuck up 
Boarder cops 
Look up into the stands 
Gotta another ride on our hands 
Pull this mic 
Straight out my noogin 
The things you wanna be 
So ruin all the music 
But nevermind 
Phonies never get it 
Phonies just a riot 
Whose rockin on a diet 
Apocolypse now 
Whoâ€™s talking shit now 
Give me the countdown 
3..2..1

Now I'm gonna full up my lungs with some butane 
Turn the mic into a flame 
Damn! that shit's hot 
Super heavy 
Build like a Chevy 
and I ain't really mad at the (hey hey) 
My significant, chocolate 
Three dolla bills from the cockpit 
Here it comes 
for a break? 
you keep on talking Iâ€™m gonna 
break you up something like this 
full throttle 
better be prepared 
coming with the kick and the snare 
Downright dirty 
Ruthless movement 
Whyâ€™d you have to ruin all the music 
Donâ€™t stop till weâ€™re 
Knock knock knockin on heavens door 
Head on the floor 
Apocalypse now 
We start the shit now 
Gimme the countdown

To your face right now 
Not really sure that 
Not really sure I know how 
But Iâ€™ma try

Give you a piece of my mind 
Gonna try 
Gonna try 
And I hope you donâ€™t mind 
Iâ€™m a crack addict 
Thatâ€™s right Iâ€™m a crack addict 
You heard me Iâ€™m a crack addict 
Iâ€™m addicted to crackin' skulls when punks start static!

Hey kid, who you looking at? 
Why you standin all up in my face like that? 
You at never seen a baseball bat? 
A maniac knocking on your baseball cap? 
You better step about 10 paces back 
Or you be layin where your shoelaces at 
Go do what your momma told you 
And donâ€™t be actin like a punk 
Thinking you a soldier 
I see you gotta yourself cell phone 
I gotta number you can dial son 
Make it 911 
Tell them stop and help 
Help is on the way kid 
Pick up some Playmates 
But only if theyâ€™re naked 
I donâ€™t know how they do it in your city 
But here weâ€™re getting down to the nitty gritty 
And I hate to put you out like that 
But you been burnin like a fire with a mouth like that 
Take me back to yesterday 
Rolling dice and getting laid 
Everything was A okay 
Ohhhohhhooooh 
But now and then a cloud rolls in 
Rains on my parade and then 
Talking this and that again 
Ohhhohhhoooohohhhhhoo 
Letâ€™s brake it down for a minute 
And roll it all up in third gear for a minute 
I got the 21s rubbin on my Benz and 
I got girlies in the back rubbin on my friends and 
I donâ€™t really give a fuck about 
What these playa hating pussies give a fuck about 
Cause Iâ€™m a night ranger 
Never been a stranger 
My 2 way pagers looking for some danger 
Zoolander hit you with the magnum 
Everybody get your groove on if you have one 
And if you ainâ€™t got it then admit it 
Itâ€™s Limp Bizkit, time for you to get it 
All around it this â€™45 Prievo(?) 
Everywhere that we go 
We watch it on the Tivo 
And now youâ€™re laying in the bed you made 
Drinking Hatorade 
Think about it 
Take me back to yesterday 
Rolling dice and getting laid 
Everything was A okay 
Ohhhohhhooooh 
But now and then a cloud rolls in 
Rains on my parade and then 
Talking this and that again 
Ohhhohhhoooohohhhhhoo 
Thinking that your all that and then some 
I got news for you 
Still thinking that your all that and then some 
Man I got news for you 
Let me guess, you ainâ€™t that impressed 
Mr 
Hali-tosis of the breath 
Living lifestyles of the wish you were 
From the bad guys of the thrifty-goods 
Got room to talk kid 
I been layin this track since North Cacilac 
And the very first day you fell off the sack 
Always in fat laces spinnin on my back 
Let me think let me move let me ride 
Let me put some funk in the trunk 
Memory that can ease your pain 
Like a melody from Kurt Kobain 
Cause you never know when itâ€™s all gonna end 
And you never know when you call on a friend 
You better take a step to prepare yourself 
Cause the way your livin now ainâ€™t good for your health 
Thinking that your all that and then some 
I got news for you 
Still thinking that your all that and then some 
Man I got news for you 
Thinking that your all that and then some 
I got news for you 
Still thinking that your all that and then some 
Man I got news for you</field>

This is how we learn, (learn) 
You can’t talk to me, 
Your not supposed to be, 
In my face, 
(so get the fuck outta my face), 
But you insist, 
You gotta talk that shit 
You gotta keep that dogass breath 
All up to my face, (face) 
I remember when, 
You would never lie to a friend, 
Cuz you were so high, 
You were so shy, 
You were so fucked up any way, 
life keeps on tickin', tickin', tickin' into the future, 
This is how we learn, (learn) 
somebody better stop me, 
or at least stop this beat, 
Before we start gettin' outta hand, 
And this is how we learn, 
And this is how we burn, 
somebody better stop me, 
or at least stop this beat, 
Before we start gettin' outta hand, 
And this is how we learn, 
And this is how we burn, 
You can’t erase me, 
I’m alive as I can be, 
in your face, 
( so get the fuck outta my face), 
But you insist, 
it’s gotta turn out like this, 
it’s gotta burn out like this, 
all up to my face, (face) 
I remember how, 
you said you want it all and you want it now, 
Cuz you were so young, 
You were so dumb, 
you were so fucked up anyway, 
life keeps on tickin', tickin' tickin' into the future, 
This is how we learn (learn), 
somebody better stop me, 
or at least stop this beat, 
Before we start gettin' outta hand, 
And this is how we learn, 
And this is how we burn, 
somebody better stop me, 
or at least stop this beat, 
Before we start getten outta hand, 
And this is how we learn, 
And this is how we burn, 
think about it, (think about it) 
think about it, (think about it) 
oh my!!!, (oh my) 
where you at?!?(where you at?!?) 
c'mon, (c'mon) 
I know you’r feel’n me baby, 
I know you’r feel’n me, 
freak baby, 
freak freak baby, 
freak baby, 
freak freak baby, 
And this is how it should be done, 
And this is how it should be done, 
Cuz my style is independant to the none,

i’m gettin' the fuck outta here,

Constantly dwellin on 
how you got the best of me 
Wanna know somethin 
I cant believe 
the way you keep testin me 
and mentally molestin me 
But would you think any less of me 
if I said that I'd be there 
would you think any less of me 
if I said I really cared 
of course you would 
cause you 
only want what you cant have 
as for me 
I'm stuck with my dick in my hand 
because you don't feel nothing at all!! 
you don't feel nothing at all 
Maybe there's more to life then it seems 
I'm constantly runnin from 
reality chasin' dreams 
Wanna know somethin' I cant believe? 
just how much misery 
comes with humility 
Do you think any less of me 
now that I'm gone? 
look at me now 
everything is gone 
I cant seem to do anything right, 
but I've figured out why you don't 
let me inside 
because you don't feel nothing at all!! 
you don't feel nothing at all 
You need nothin' 
from me now 
So you think 
I'm useless to you now 
but I 
need 
one thing from you now 
I 
insist 
that you 
feel me now!! 
you said you needed me 
You said

Why can't I

I'm just as dirty down inside 
As you could ever be but 
Girl you know you can't control 
What you do not know you 
And I we can't let go when they don't control 
But you don't remember 
What you used to be like 
You don't remember 
Who you used to be 
Cause you lie 
So we stop to start, 
You and I should have never fell apart 
I hate you what I 
Hate about me

You and ii we can't let go when they don't control 
So we fade away 
So we fade away 
But you don't remember

You don't remember 
Who you used to be 
Because you lie 
Girl you break me 
Thrown into this cell 
Girl you bring me 
Greed I've never felt 
And we fuck, 
And we fight, 
And we fight, 
And we fuck, 
And we fuck, 
And we fight 
And we fight with me.. 
Aaah!! 
Take back this pain, this pain! 
Girl you know 
Take back this pain, this pain! 
Girl you know 
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck you! 
Girl you know 
Don't touch me I wont touch you so back off!!

You lie!!

Trim the fat 
Go the distance the bizkit's back 
You get no slack 
Spray the gat 
Back the clip with the riff attack

my summer days 
all great things go away 
feel the cold comin' round the bend 
everything's gonna change again 
down another day 
down another day 
oh the winter I adore 
summers gone forever more 
someday she'll come back to me 
season's change to set me free 
down another day 
down another day 
Refrão 
don't have to bore you with details 
(i'll never let you down) 
and in the morning the sunrise 
(will never let you down) 
if I could hold you tomorrow 
(I'll never let you down) 
and when she's golden, the ocean 
(will never let you down) 
the end is near, my winter fling 
change is melting everything 
now it's time to sink below 
season come, season go 
down another day 
down another day

I keep saying goodbye 
saying goodbye 
keep saying goodbye 
she's always coming back 
she keeps coming back 
she keeps coming back 
I keep saying goodbye 
saying goodbye

she's always coming back 
she keeps coming back 
you keep coming back

Then disaster takes its toll and I'm left with only me 
Maybe sorrow plays a role when you feel unkind 
Your abuses matter, standing up forever lost in time 
Save me, save me before I drown 
Save me, save me before I drown 
It's getting closer to the end, I look back and smile 
We conquered every single bump in my road, made it all worthwhile 
Just remember how I cared when it came crashing down 
I'd like to toast to all those angels that were always hanging 'round 
Save me, save me before I drown 
Save me, save me before I drown, drown 
Oh, oh 
Maybe life ain't what it seems, 'cause it's all a dream 
Forgive me 
Sometimes I feel like a fool 'cause I'm so uncool 
Forgive me.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I woke up feeling like I need 
To get out of the house right now 
I'm feeling like going downstairs, take a deep breath 
The whole world just might be ending today 
Get it together, stay calm 
Stay calm, how am I supposed to stay calm? 
Poor little kid, momma ruined his brain 
Why am I living this way? 
Why, cause I'm a loser, I was always told that 
Now I'm a loser and I love it 
I fuckin love it, I love it til my brothers 
just a puddle in a bucket 
And everyone around me, they all die and they say, "fuck it" 
Why is huh? Pouring all of my feelings through your head 
And I ain't gonna settle til that shit reaches your voice 
And now you on your ass, and now you are an ass 
Knowing you ain't listening to this shit 
Cause you an ass 
Life ain't gonna sneak up on your ass and take a bite 
It's gonna take that life back, baby it's life 
Life is born in the battlefield 
Girls, Boys will learn to kill 
On with the endless slaughter 
Born in hell 
Giving you all my time in hell 
And I love it, oh no no 
I'ma go psycho on this hoe (psycho) 
You're a sad lawless whore 
Doing this war inside out for? 
You want war, get in sync 
Now I love it more 
And now you on your ass, and now you are an ass 
Knowing you ain't listening to this shit cause you an ass 
Life ain't gonna sneak up on your ass and take a bite 
It's gonna take that life back, baby it's life 
Life is born in the battlefield 
Girls, Boys will learn to kill 
On with the endless slaughter 
All I know is I'll never know 
All I know is I'll never know 
You cannot take this away from me 
This is the one thing you cannot take away from me 
I am no longer under you 
You are the one who is under me now 
I am no longer under you 
You are the one who is under me now 
I am no longer under you 
You are the one who is under me now 
I am no longer under you 
You are the one who is under me now 
The one who is under me now 
The one who is under me now 
Took a lot of time, time with a chance 
Gonna put these motherfuckers on the floor 
So they can dance 
I'm gonna need a little kimchi, take a pump, load it up 
Throw it in the back with the Jaguar loaded up 
Been drinking muff since the 1819 
How about going meet us in the back on the 9th green 
Pussy hole never made a tootsie roll give a shit 
Clean up in this bitch just like a bag of gold 
Here we go 
Oh my god, it's that white rapper guy 
That white Leo telling everybody Gemini 
That's me, I'm the Leo on the flo 
Baby girl tell me your sign before you go 
Cause I'm about to chip it in the hole like Bubba 
Hope I don't bust another hole in the rubber 
Cause I ain't got another baby name I can use 
Maybe Tom Cruise, I'm about to hit tree to fix 
So what you really know about that, probably nothing 
You ain't know about nothing, nothing 
You got something to say, then say it 
If you gonna say it, then fuckin say it 
I ain't afraid to look you in the face 
What you gonna say 
What you gonna say when I'm in your face? 
Tell me boy, what you gonna say when I'm in your face? 
I'm gonna grab a dirty fork and jab your eyes out</field>

oh but I need some time off 
from that emotion 
time to pick my heart up of the floor 
when that love comes down 
without devotion 
when it takes a strong man baby but I'm 
I'm showing you that door 
CHORUS--cuz I gotta have faith 
gotta have faith (3x) 
baby 
I know you are asking me to stay 
say please please please don't go away 
cause you are giving me the blues 
baby 
you might mean all the words you say 
can't help but think of yesterday 
and another who tied me down to the loverboy blues 
before this river becomes an ocean 
before you pick my heart up of the floor 
when that love comes down

when it takes a strong man baby but I'm

You are my favorite mother fucker. 
I told you, didn't I? 
Drama makes the world go around 
(go around) 
Does anybody got the problem with that? (yeah) 
My business, is my bussiness, who's guilty? 
Can I get a witness? 
First thing first 
The chocolate starfish is my man Fred Durst. 
Access Hollywood liscenced to kill 
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville. 
Bringning on the dumbster funk 
A microphone machete in the back of my trunk. 
Rockin' so steady with the he-says she-says, 
And don't forget about the starfish navigation system. 
Don't hate me, I'm just an alien 
With 37 tons of new millenium. 
Dum-Di-Di-Dum, where's it coming from? 
Miss Aguiliera, come and get some. 
Oh no, which way to go? 
To the dance floor, It's on my stereo. 
Pay me no mind 
I've seen the Fight Club about 28 times. 
And I'ma keep my pants saggin` 
Keep the skateboard, a spray can for the taggin` 
And I'ma keep a lot of girls in my band wagon, 
Cause I don't give a fuck.. 
Living life in the fast lane 
I'm just a crazy mother fucker livin' it up 
Not giving a fuck 
Living life in the fast lane 
Another crazy mother fucker livin' it up 
Not giving a fuck in the fast lane 
Take two (ooo-wa!) 
Now who's the starsucker? 
I'm the starfish, you silly mother fucker 
The puff puff give, the marijuana cig 
Oops, I don't even smoke but I love the way it smells 
Give a toast to the females, sippin' lung champagne from a sea shell 
I think I counterfeit 
Then pop his ass like a zit 
With the starfish navigation system. 
No cheap thrills, Baby 
Fill a briefcase with 3 dollar billz 
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill 
Fella spittin' out hella mic skills 
And I'ma keep my pants saggin 
Keep the skateboard, a spray can for the taggin` 
And I'ma keep a lot of girls in my pimp wagon 
Cause I don't give a fuck 
Living life in the fast lane 
I'm just a crazy mother fucker livin' it up 
Not giving a fuck 
Living life in the fast lane 
Another crazy mother fucker, livin' it up 
Not giving a fuck in the fast lane 
Cause it's so easy to tell a lie 
And it's so easy, to run and hide 
But it's not easy to be alive 
So don't be wasting NON OF MY TIME! 
This world is like a cage 
And I don't think it's fair 
And I don't even think 
That anybody cares.. 
And it'll eat a hole (what!) down inside of me (what!) 
And it'll leave a scar (what!), can anybody see? (what!) 
That we got to get it out 
(got to get it out) 
We got to get it out 
(got to get it out) 
We got to get it out 
(got to get it out) 
And I'm'a get it out with the mother fucking MICROPHONE! 
PLUG IT IN MY SOUL! 
I'm a renegade riot gettin' out of control 
I'ma keep it alive and continue to be 
Flyin' like an eagle to my destiny! 
Can you feel me? (hell yeah) 
Can you feel me? (hell yeah) 
Can you feel me? (hell yeah) 
Can you feel me mother fucker?! 
Did you say? (hell yeah) 
Did you say? (hell yeah) 
Can you say hell yeah? 
I'm living life in the fast lane. 
Cause it's so easy to tell a lie, 
And it's so easy, to run and hide. 
But it's not easy to be alive, 
So don't be wasting NONE OF MY TIME! 
Yeah, bring it on! 
I'm just a crazy mother fucker livin' it up. 
Not giving a fuck. 
In the fast lane!.</field>

In the same place punk, at the very same time yeah, 
But when it takes place and you wanna talk shit 
Then step your ass up and say right to my face 
You'll get knocked the fuck out

Knocked straight the fuck out

In the act, red-handed caught up in the act, punk

Knocked straight the fuck out

How pathetic are people who verbally rape us with talking? 
We try to ignore them 
Ignore them until they keep talking 
They think that they're building an empire 
Without us 
But we've got the torch now 
We've got the fire to burn this motherfucker down down 
Down down burn this motherfucker 
Down down down down 
Burn this mother-fucker down down down 
Burn this mother-fucker down down down 
Burn this mother-fucker 
You'll get knocked the fuck out 
'Cause your mouth wrote a check

Knocked straight the fuck out

Tolstyitrol by my alias [polar bear] 
Brain tied like the SandM freak shit. 
Cold like the ice you're serving up my drinks with. 
Stick shift, fuck the automatic. 
Rollin' up in third gear, guess it's just a habit. 
And all you freaky bitches reaching out to grab it, 
Don't hesitate 'cuz you can have it, I'ma stab it! 
Demolition, came to crush the mission, 
Just in time for you maniacs to listen. 
And it 'aint nothin' cuz I don't think it's serious. 
My flow is cold, like the weather in Siberia. 
Keep your head bobbin, like a novelty. 
And all them turkey MC's wanna gobble me. 
But I'm a shark in my underground fish tank, 
And I don't give a shit what those motherfuckers think. 
B-Boy with a taste for the metal, 
A taste for the fine rhyme and I 'aint gonna settle. 
If you don't like it then you can scratch up on these nuts bitch, 
Polar bear 'aint a cracker you should fuck with. 
Buggalo, shining like a diamond. 
Momma went and bought a kid a mic, now he's rhyming. 
And now he's hated 'cuz everybody played it. 
But they're just hatin' cuz I motherfuckin' made it! 
Get a life! Get a motherfucking life! 
You don't wanna see what I can do, when I'm nice! 
You don't wanna be my enemy I promise you! 
If you do, motherfucker bring it on! 
Get a life! Get a motherfucking life! 
You don't wanna see what I can do, when I'm nice! 
You don't wanna be my enemy I promise you! 
If you do, motherfucker bring it on! 
*sigh* Hey! Let me turn it down, 
Pour me up another double shot of the crown 
Get this party hoppin' when I step into your town 
I came to boogy down, cuz I don't give a fuck! 
I don't ride in limo's, cuz limo's make me car sick 
I aint goin' out like the dancing with the stars shit 
I don't wait in line 'cuz I'm always on the guest list 
Anywhere I go, always leavin' with the best bitch! 
And all my boys get the pick of the litter 
That girl you came with, I suggest you forget her 
North Carolina is my homeland, 
I'm homegrown; just a cacky-lacky mofo 
A redneck who never had a dollar, 
Now I'm making people all around the world holla. 
And now I'm hated, cuz everybody played it. 
But they just hatin' cuz this motherfucker made it! 
Get a life! Get a motherfucking life! 
You don't wanna see what I can do, when I'm nice! 
You don't wanna be my enemy I promise you! 
If you do, motherfucker bring it on! 
Get a life! Get a motherfucking life! 
You don't wanna see what I can do, when I'm nice! 
You don't wanna be my enemy I promise you! 
If you do, motherfucker bring it on! 
Don't let the world bring you down. 
Down. 
Don't let the world bring you down. 
Down.

before i call for a face-to-face and got to rest my case 
like this is how we do it just recognize we keep gettin' right 
to it lookin' into these eyes lookin' into these eyes 
and you'll see the size of the flames then you might despise the size 
of my game step the fuck back! xzibit's on the track 
you should have buckled up 
before your head hit the dash you gotta hate that a demo 
from an eight-track brought me to a place where platinum 
comes in eight stacks you don't wanna fuck with me today 
'cause a little somethin' somethin' didn't go your way so, 
try not to be like that today 'cause i'm a real motherfucker from 
'round the way we don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place 
we're only givin' a fuck if you're invading the space 
so getcha getcha your groove on [repeats 3 times]</field>

Fight, Fight

Sometimes you gotta fight for your right 
When your not sure you're in a fight for your life, right? 
If you ain't packin any tactics 
You might get your ass kicked 
Even if you are a little knucklehead 
I'm kinda sick of being aggravated 
I'm glad I'm hated 
I guess I'm doing something right 
But that's what happened back in Columbine 
You gotta know when to stop 
And not go over the top 
Cause there's a chamber deep inside the brain 
It's covered with chains 
So don't be shaking them loose 
And if you do I'll be running for the hills 
Cause I'm ready to rock and now we're playing for real 
I gotta 
Fight Fight 
You better watch out when my adrenaline kicks I gotta 
Fight Fight 
It'S Too Late, You Already Been Hit, Damn! 
Stick 'Em Stick 'Em 
Stick 'Em Ha Haha Stick 'Em 
Stick 'Em Stick 'Em 
Yeah! (Head for the barricades) (2x) 
This world can make you stick to your stomach so I 
Put on my headphones, listen to the Deftones 
It's getting crowded in my spaceship 
Living in a dream 
Running from the hate machine 
You know it's, 
Such a drag when there's people talking down to ya 
Such a drag when everything sucks do ya, 
Walk away with spit on your face or do ya, 
Draw lines and give them a taste cause I, 
Know it's never gonna end 
If it happens again I'm going straight for the throat 
Another note 
Don't forget you had a chance 
Now I'm over the sidelines and ready to dance 
I gotta 
Fight Fight 
You better watch out when my adrenaline kicks I gotta 
Fight Fight 
It'S Too Late, You Already Been Hit, Damn!

You speak them opinions to sink in so deep. 
But its alright, your just an illusion confused by your narrow mind. 
Reality is up ahead in tha' distance, but that lack of persistance has left you behind. 
Now your reaching for your sanity, cause you' afraid of me, so don't fuck with me. 
You wanna ask me a question? Well I gotta question. 
How much longer can I tolerate this shit. 
Egos trip when your livin' on tha' flip-side 
Drop out of a uterus and died, damn. 
I see ya' pointin' your finger, ya' stereotype me cause you don't like me? 
Well you don't even know me, punk 
You don't know me. 
Stereotype me, cause you don't like me.</field>

There goes another one that kept me breathing 
I'm waiting for you I know your leaving 
I still adore you, you never need me 
Hold on 
I found another way to let you go away 
Hold on 
You found another way to bleed my soul away 
Fred: 
The things you told me to hear you speak 
I'm burning slowly I'm growing weak 
You bring me closer to yesterday 
Yesterday's a million miles away 
Why can't you hear me? 
Why can't I see you? 
And I don't understand what keeps me breathing

Left all alone 
Take me to your heart

Long and winding road

To many romantic dreams (To Make romantic dreams) 
Up in lights, fallin' off 
The silver screen 
My heart's like an open book 
For the whole world to read 
Sometimes nothing-keeps me together 
At the seams

I am here in my mind 
And I'm a million different people

Listen up, listen up, here we go... 
It's a fucked up world 
A fucked up place, everybody's judged by their fucked up face 
Fucked up dreams, fucked up life 
A fucked up kid with a fucked up knife 
Fucked up moms (moms) and fucked up dads (dads) 
A fucked up cop with a fucked up badge 
Fucked up job (job) with fucked up pay-ee-ay 
And a fucked up boss is a fucked up day 
Fucked up press with fucked up lies 
While lethal's in the back with fucked up eyes 
Hey. 
It's on. 
Everybody knows it's on. 
Hey. 
It's on. 
Everybody knows it's on. 
Ain't it a shame that you can't say fuck (fuck) 
Fuck's just a word and it's all fucked up 
Like a fucked up punk (punk) 
With a fucked up mouth (mouth) 
A nine-inch-nail -- get knocked the fuck out 
Fucked up aids from fucked up sex 
Fake-assed titties on a fucked up chest 
We're all fucked up, so whatcha wanna do with fucked up me 
And fucked up you? 
You wanna fuck me like an animal 
You like to burn me on the inside 
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug 
Just know that nothing you do will bring you closer to me 
Ain't like a bitch (bitch), a fucked up ditch (ditch) 
A fucked up sore with a fucked up stitch 
A fucked up head (head), is a fucked a shame 
Swingin' on my nuts it's a fucked up game 
Jealousy thrills up a fucked up mind 
It's real fucked up like a fucked up crime 
If I say fuck two more times, that's forty-six fucks in this fucked up rhyme 
Hey, it's on. 
Everybody knows it's on. 
Hey it's on, everybody knows it's on. 
You wanna fuck me like an animal 
You like to burn me from the inside 
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug 
Just know that nothing you do will bring you closer to me 
oooooowwwaaaaaaaaahhhhhh! hoa! 
Listen up baby 
You can't bring me (bring me) down 
I don't think so, I know so 
You better check yourself 
Before you wreck yourself 
Kiss my starfish my 
Chocolate starfish punk 
Kiss my starfish my 
Chocolate starfish 
You wanna fuck me like an animal 
You wanna burn me from the inside 
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug 
Just know that nothing you do will bring you closer to me</field>

Directions say assembly required, nothing's admired, 
The majority's been hired, wired, the truth, 
The roof is on fire. 
A life, all I desire. 
Paychecks, respect disappears quickly. 
Situation tense trickly. 
Hand jobs, yes, they have plenty. 
Backs cracked for copper pennies. 
Migraines, wrist sprains, free samples of rogaine, 
Fill me with anything. 
Regaining ground while the well endowed 
Sit proud with their heads in the clouds. 
Prophets predicted it, inscribed on the minds of the ancient tribes. 
Mother Nature's striking back. 
Come suffer with me! (repeated 3x). 
What will you do, the chosen few? 
With your Reebok shoes and your missing clues, 
Pretend it will go away? 
Oxygen levels growing thin, 
The opposite of birth unfolds within. 
Must prepare and be aware, 
The existence of man will disappear. 
No tunnel harps, angels to follow. 
Every man, woman, child swallowed. 
No eight o'clock alarm tomorrow. 
Man returns the earth he borrowed, 
And while the meek obey to repeat defeat. 
(Mother nature releases). 
Come suffer with me! (repeated 3x). 
Fred: One-nine, nine-nine (what, yeah!) 
Gotta get a grip, c'mon, what's this fuckin' world coming to? 
Run for shelter, helter skelter. 
It's too bad, before too long, there'll be no songs. 
No break of dawn, it'll all be gone, 
'Cause Mrs 
Mother Nature, she's grown to hate ya. 
It's the apocalypse kid, a little karma for all that you did. 
You want to know where we're heading? Armageddon! 
Come suffer with me! (repeated 4x).

So you should get a pen 
And write yourself a little note 
so you don't forget again 
That when it comes to cash 
I've been gettin' smoked 
Lendin' out my money 
Now I'm broke 
Somebody's gettin' choked 
Cause now its time to pay the piper 
Bums are the type of shit that's in a diaper 
Don't make me have to call a sniper 
And wipe your brains off my windshield wiper 
you dirty bug 
As soon as I get paid they come in masses 
There's someone givin' classes 
on kissin' peoples asses 
Unless you're livin where the trash is 
Don't even come around here 
askin' where my cash is 
Me I'm broke. 
I aint no joke 
I'll say it once again 
And if I get provoked 
there'll be knuckles on your chin 
Some people never learn 
Borrowin' from me you might regret it 
For one I ain't no bank 
and you got shitty credit 
As soon as I get paid 
they're comin' out the woodwork 
Take your ass and get a job 
like you should jerk 
Unless you're livin where the trash is 
But you're not 
so find another spot where the cash is 
Me, I'm broke 
Gimme back my money, bum 
You said you'd pay me back 
I'm broke and for that 
You deserve a smackin' for slackin' 
Now people say I'm a slacker 
If I'm a slacker 
Then its through the eyes

And go give that gun to Jesus and say "Jesus...you go kill the deciples of Satan and you kill the nazis, Jesus." Gimme an amen 
Amen 
Gimme a hallelujah, brother 
Hallelujah 
Feel the pain of sweet Jesus 
Gimme another amen 
Amen 
Gimme another 
Amen 
You've got to kill the noise 
You've got to kill the pollution of Satan, brother, gimme a hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Have you been healed? Have you been saved? Has it happened to you, brother? Thank the lord 
Praise the lord 
I love Jesus 
I love Jesus 
Kill the pollution...pollution

It says that you'll be gone for a while. 
Everything was gettin' better, 
I guess I'm just a fool strung out. 
What to do? 
Life is through. 
Just want to kill, myself for you. 
I wonder, 
just how sympathetic you'll be? 
You've come to take me under, 
And I've forgotten all about me. 
What to do? 
Life is through. 
Just wanna kill myself for you. 
So tell me why... 
You say goodbye. 
And tell me why... 
you're fuckin' up my whole life! 
Yeah, 
Fucking up my whole life 
So I'm on my way, 
I leave today, 
If I get away, 
It'll be okay. 
It'll be okay. 
I'm looking out a window, 
Into a world that's taking you from me. 
And I'm feeling so disgusted 
How pathetic can I possibly be? 
What to do? 
Life is through. 
Just wanna kill myself for you. 
So tell me why... 
You say goodbye. 
And tell me why... 
you're fuckin' up my whole life! 
Yeah, 
Fucking up my whole life. 
So I'm on my way, 
I leave today, 
If I get away, 
It'll be okay. 
It'll be okay. 
If there's a better place you can take me, 
A better life you can give me. 
Whatever place I can start all over. 
Then I would never need what you gave me. 
Never need you to save me. 
And never feel like this life is over. 
If there's a better place you can take me, 
A better life you can give me. 
Whatever place I can start all over. 
Then I would, never need what you gave me. 
Never need you to save me. 
And never feel like this life is over. 
Feel like this life is over. 
So I'm on my way, 
I leave today, 
If I get away, 
It'll be okay.</field>

Get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up, 
If you got the feeling jump across the ceiling,

Yo I'll bust'em in the eye 
And then i'll take the punks home

Show'em the fuck up props form the kids in Korn 
Plus my mom and my pops. 
Chorus:

So get your ass up and jump around, c'mon 
Jump around (3x) g'tup 
Jump up, jump up and get down

If your bitch steps up, I'm smacking the whore 
Word to your mom's i came to drop bombs 
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got psalms 
And just like the radical Son i've returned 
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned 
fuck your lyrics coz you ain't got none 
If you come to battle bring a shotgun 
But if you do you're a fool, cause duel to the death 
Try and step to me, you take your last breath

How many of you people remember the House Of Pain? 
I wanna bring out, 
my man Poe, from Style Elevish. 
And my man Easy Rock, 
from the Rock-Steady Crew. 
You like break-dancing baby? 
Are you ready? 
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin. 
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin. 
I won't ever slack up, punks you better back up. 
Try to play the role, and the whole crew will act up. 
Get up, stand up, c'mon put your hands up, 
And if you get the feeling, jump across the ceiling. 
Least with the funk flow, man you talkin' junk yo. 
Bust 'em in the eye, and then I'll take the punks home. 
Feelin, fuckin', amps in the trunk, 
And I got more ryhmes than the cops at a Dunkin Donuts shop. 
Soon enough I'll get props from the kids in KoRn plus my mom and my pops. 
Came to get down, came to get down, so get your ass up and jump around. 
C'mon, jump around. 
Jump around, get up! 
Jump around, c'mon! 
Jump up, jump up, and get down! 
Jump (repeated 16 times)! 
I'll sue your ass like John Mckenroe, 
If your bitch steps up.... 
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs. 
Got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms. 
Just like the Prodigal Son I've returned. 
If anyone's steppin' to me you get burned. 
Fuck your lyrics, cause you ain't got none. 
And if you wanna battle then bring a... 
Well if you do you're a fool, cause I duel to death. 
Try to step to me, you take your last breath. 
I got the skill, man I got your fill. 
Cause when I shoot, man, I shoot to kill. 
Came to get down, I came to get down, 
So get your ass up and jump around. 
C'mon 
Jump around! 
Jump around everybody! 
Jump around, it's your last chance! 
Jump up, jump up to get down!

Said that you'd been hanging with your cute

Then I get a call, kinda woke me up 
Said that they saw you chillin' with this young little fuck, 
I was kinda dazed and maybe confused, 
Never woulda expected this terrible news, 
Not only were you kissing this fool you been 
dissing 
You were playing me out 
Now you better listen 
What the fuck is going on? 
Who the fuck do you think you are? (Bitch!) 
Cause for alarm 
Put up with your shit, begging me to stay 
Even though you run your fucking mouth everyday! 
I aint some punk ass dealing with your drunk ass 
Sure your mighty fine 
But you crossed the fucking line 
Now there's no returnin' 
This lesson that your learnin' 
Pulling down your panties 
And leave your ass burnin' 
[Refrão] 
Cause I deserve more, 
I deserve more 
You act like a whore 
So just drop dead 
Just drop dead 
Rewind 
Back to the start (Go) 
When we got together I gave you my heart 
You made a few mistakes 
But that's how it goes 
And every time I broke up you gave my ass a rose 
(aww) 
Saying that your sorry 
And I'm the only one 
Believed you like a chump 
While you were having fun 
I was feelin' lonely 
While you were with your hommie 
Ain't that a bitch? 
Now your boy can blow me 
What the fuck is going on?

Gonna put your shit begging me to stay 
Even though you run your fucking mouth every day!

Do you want to catch the vibe that's keepin' me alive? 
I'm Following these phat ass beats until I die. 
Fill 'em with tension, the sick dimension 
I rumble the earth with my lowered suspension. 
Just watch the ground move 
Let the sound prove 
That it ain't fake when the girls get naked. 
Don't call it a comeback. 
We bring that beat back 
And we made sure that john kept them beats phat. 
A lyrical rampage buring' you headset. 
Open your mind 
My rhymes ain't dead yet. 
I want you to stand up put them hands up. 
I'll break it on down 
'Cause your pumpin' my band up..

Just like this 
come on, get up, get up 
Music is key 
It's the way we're set free 
From all this world 
Is throwing at me 
The rhythm's so insane 
It's flowin' your vein 
Triggerin' that neck 
poppin' a nerve up in your brain 
I don't even know ya 
But came to show ya 
That bizkits limp when the night is over. 
We shake the whole place 
Make this earth quake 
And it ain't fake 
When we start the riots. 
So rock the bells 
Psycho females 
doin' time blowin' up the phone line. 
Call it a stampede 
Comin' to your town. 
We ain't gonna hold back. 
We're comin' to get down. 
I want you to stand up 
And put them hands up and break it on down 
'Cause your pumpin' up my band..

Get higher! 
Come on! 
Get up!

It's the way we're set free

And I'll do what it takes 
If I make some mistakes 
Its okay

Just the way 
It should be 
Limp Bizkit's in the house y'all (x3) 
Yo john, bring that beat back!

And he'll destroy every single one of you 
You better watch it cause he's looking for your ass now 
Better lock all your doors and shut the house down 
He's making a list and he's checking it twice 
He was born pissed and he's ready to slice 
His reality ain't like yours or mine 
He can shed blood I hope it ain't mine 
He don't give a fuck if your crying for help 
He was born blind in the chambers of hell 
Satan gave his homeboy a license to kill 
And if he comes knocking I'm going to show him the deal 
What the fuck you gonna do about that 
What the fuck you gonna do about that 
When the killer shows up with a gat 
You gonna have to grab yourself a baseball bat 
To remind this motherfucker where the home runs at 
What the fuck you gonna do about that 
What the fuck you gonna do about that 
Your gonna have to face the moment of truth 
You know what to do 
You gonna have to find the killer in you 
He's got a trunk full of hatches and shit 
Bombs, gasoline, matches and shit 
Anything to make a human die quick 
Creeping in the night like some superfly shit 
So scandalous and everything about him is wrong 
Chainsaw starting up at the crack of dawn 
Leatherface is a pussy he don't compare 
He'll have you shitting in your motherfucking underwear 
All your homies coming hard better get a grip 
He'll kill your wife and your baby sleeping in the crib 
We got to stop and shut this motherfucker down 
Show his ass who runs this motherfucking town 
Show his ass who runs this motherfucking town 
What the fuck you gonna do about that 
What the fuck you gonna do about that 
When the killer shows up with a gat 
You gonna have to grab yourself a baseball bat

What the fuck you gonna do about that 
What the fuck you gonna do about that 
Your gonna have to face the moment of truth 
You know what to do 
You gonna have to go and find the killer in you 
Lay that motherfucker on the curb 
Let's find the killer in you 
Show that motherfucker the deal 
And now it's real 
And now it's real 
Kill that motherfucker 
Kill that motherfucker 
Kill that motherfucker 
Kill that motherfucker 
Kill that motherfucker 
Kill that motherfucker 
Kill that motherfucker

like a toothache or an earthquake. 
spontaneous combustion 
leaves a taste that so disgustin’ 
and it don’t go away too fast 
i’m a window made of broken glass 
i’ve never needed anything, 
anything but you 
and that’s what wrong 
that’s what i get 
for feeling this 
anyway… 
just let me know 
all i’ll miss 
when i’m gone 
[chorus] 
just throw it all away… you let me down 
like everybody says… you let me down 
write me off like yesterday… you let me down 
oh, i guess that your not good enough to be with me 
Rumors are tumors 
of the sick and mainly useless 
when you come to me with these things 
it’s the shit that i cant deal with. 
still i gave you all of me, 
faithfulness and honesty 
prayed for God to bring you near, 
along with all these tears. 
and that’s what wrong 
that’s what i get 
for feeling this 
anyway… just let me know 
all i’ll miss 
when i’m gone

i’d like to thank you 
for lettin’ me know i can feel this way 
feel this way 
for lettin’ me know i can feel

You know who you are 
It's not that you're waiting for some sweet tomorrow 
In a room full of darkness hoping you'll find 
Lightz 
It's not that you're waiting for some sweet tomorrow 
In a room full of darkness hoping you'll find 
What the fuck did days become 
What a phase to run 
We don't judge no priest, we don't preach we cum 
Smoke all of my lungs, fuck you i'm having fun 
We ain't blind, we see 
We don't beat we drum 
Organize the ways, damn this life is a stage 
Grab the moment and own it, 
i'm looking forward today, before i hop on this plane 
It's important to say goodbye to my kids, 
you know you better behave 
I'm living outta my soul, fuck it there's no regrets 
I'm hittin' texas we're selling this cash money a bet 
I've seen this ship before and i ain't have no fear 
I'm near, i'm near, i'm near 
Bitch i'm right here 
Fuck it ima drink if i don't get dui 
See these tickets sneak up, on you like a sniper eye, yeah, 
I'm right above the clouds boy 
Ain't no way, it's time to get it now boy 
Pain ain't so beautiful, the city of angels 
You know who you are 
It's not that you're waiting for some sweet tomorrow 
In a room full of darkness hoping you'll find 
Lightz 
I had been through this storm, been through the rain 
People tellin' me lies, nobody taking the blame 
Jumping through all my thoughts like it's a picket fence 
All the shit that i've done doesn't really makes sence 
Show 'em how to behave, show 'em how to go far 
Show 'em how to believe, show 'em just who you are 
Fell in love with a stripper, she happy outta my head 
Every fucked up lady you can say what she said 
With every single right, i'm always born white 
I'm punching these walls and it ain't no right 
No cheese, no bite, come alive in the night 
And i sleep in the day that's some vampire life 
Cash money metal, i should get a medal 
Going for the gold, life don't settle 
It's a waste to the pain, beauty is the name 
Taggin' on my heart cause my life won't change 
Pain ain't so beautiful, the city of angels 
You know who you are 
It's not that you're waiting for some sweet tomorrow 
In a room full of darkness hoping you'll find

This is dedicated to you Ben Stiller 
You are my favorite mutherfucker 
I told you, didn't I? 
Drama makes the world go around 
Does anybody got a problem with that? (yeah) 
My business is my business 
Who's guilty? 
Can I get a witness? 
First things first 
The Chocolate Starfish is my man Fred Durst 
Access Hollywood license to kill 
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville 
bringin on the dumpster funk 
My microphone machete's 
in the back of my truck 
Rockin soul steady with the 
He says, she says 
And don't forget about the 
starfish navigation system 
Don't hate me 
I'm just an alien 
With thirty seven tons of new millenium 
Dum diddie dum 
Where's it coming from? 
Misses Aguilera, come and get some 
Oh no, which way to go 
To the dance floor 
in stewa- stereo 
Pay me no mind 
I seen The Fight Club 
About twenty eight times 
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin 
Keep a skateboard 
A spray can, for the taggin' 
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls 
on my band wagon 
Cause I don't give a fuck

Now who's the star sucker? 
I'm the Starfish 
You silly mutherfucker 
Puff puff 
Give the marijuana cig 
Oops 
I don't even smoke 
But I love the way it smells 
Here's a toast to the females 
Sippin' mum's champagne from a seashell 
I take a counterfeit 
And pop his ass like a zit 
With the starfish navigation system 
No cheap thrills baby 
Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills 
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill fella 
Spittin' out hella mic skillz 
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin 
Keep a skateboard 
A spray can, for the taggin'

to run and hide but it's not easy (life in the fast lane) 
to be alive 
So don't be wasting 
None of my time 
This world is like a cage 
And I don't think it's fair 
And I don't even think 
That anybody cares 
It'll leave a hole (what?!) 
down inside of me (what?!) 
And it'll leave a scar (what?!) 
Can anybody see? (what?!) 
That we gotta get it out (gotta get it out) 
We gotta get it out (gotta get it out) 
We gotta get it out (gotta get it out) 
And I'm 'a get it out 
With the motherfuckin' microphone 
Plugged in my soul 
I'm a renegade riot getting out of control 
I'm 'a keep it alive 
And continue to be 
Flying like an eagle 
To my destiny 
So can you feel me? (Hell yeah)

So don't be wasting

Who's the man (the man in the middle) 
Whos the man? 
Whos, the m-m-man? 
[Verse 2] 
When I reminisce ignorance was bliss, 
Back in the days where the magic exist 
Never be the same as it was, 
'cuz the way it was 
Just another day in the maze of a myth 
Had a lot of fun living life on the run, 
Never had a chance to pause to get a better glance 
Everything was free and everything was fast 
Never even thought it wouldn't last 
When you go the mind of a man in the middle 
Life is just a big fat riddle, 
so figure it out 
Always thinking that you know 
Everything little thing there is to know 
But you don't really know, ya know? 
It's like love, some people get it 
For some it's just a glove 
that just never fitted 
For me it's just a pain in the ass 
But I'm addicted to the taste 
of hopin' it could last 
 
[Chorus] 
Another day another night inside a lonely world 
Another game another fight inside a lonely world 
Another wrong another right inside a lonely world 
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world 
Who's the man (the man in the middle) 
Who's the man (the man in the middle) 
Who's the man (the man in the middle) 
Who's the man (the man in the middle) 
[Verse 2] 
Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter 
At least I can say that I've never been a quitter 
I remember high school, man I hated high school 
It was like prison with bullies always putting me down 
Just a little skater boy they could pick on 
I learned to forgive'em, now I got the balls they can lick on 
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep 
With my gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek 
With the mind of a man in the middle 
It could be the end of the world as we know it 
Still I never want it all, and I never want it now 
I just want to cruise, if I loose then I'll figure it out 
How the times flies, even with the blink of an eye 
When you're young you absorb like a sponge in disguise 
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts 
It's amazing what you learn 
When you've never been taught, ya know? 
 
[Chorus] 
Another day another night inside a lonely world 
Another game another fight inside a lonely world 
Another wrong another right inside a lonely world 
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world 
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world 
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world 
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world 
Such a lonely world (such a lonely world) 
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world 
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world 
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world 
Such a lonely world (such a lonely world) 
[Chorus] 
Another day another night inside a lonely world 
Another game another fight inside a lonely world 
Another wrong another right inside a lonely world

Who's the man (in such a lonely world)

Who's the man (in such a lonely world)

Every corner that I turn 
I see a lady that burns 
Hot mama walking down the street 
I'm loving all these L.A 
freaks 
Pretty woman look my way 
I'm throwing my hook your way 
Hold tight while I reel you in 
Better leave him so tell again 
Let's cruze down Sunset 
Make a pit stop at the Rainbow 
Then we gonna hit the Roxy 
Let a few hot mamas rock me 
So many, it's hard to choose 
Take your pick, they all bad news 
Got game, they all want you 
Got shame, they always do 
Livin' in Los Angeles 
It's definitely scandalous 
So much ass in Los Angeles 
It's definitely scandalous 
You better know when to hold em' 
Know when to fold em' 
Know when to pull the brakes 
And keep rollin' 
Know when you got a Hollywood tranny 
Adam's apple 
Dick in the panties 
Gold diggin' comes with the scene 
One more fake Hollywood queen 
Got another when it coming fox 
Keep your cock in the sock 
Know what I mean 
Livin' in Los Angeles 
It's definitely scandalous 
So much ass in Los Angeles 
It's definitely scandalous 
She can pick you up 
She can bring you down 
She's got all your dreams 
Locked inside this town 
There's no way to leave 
Once you have a ride 
Just be glade you know 
That your still alive 
You want girls that crawl 
You can have it all 
Anything you want 
It's a monster's ball 
You won't have to beg 
They jump in your bed 
Better check your head 
Or you'll be left for dead 
Oh, yeah come on now 
Oh, yeah 
Yeah, live in Los Angeles 
Home of the slutes and hookers and bullshit 
Gold diggers 
Yeah you ain't missin' shit baby 
Come on, bring it on 
Livin' in Los Angeles

So much ass in Los Angeles 
It's definitely scandalous

Back in the days there was ways 
I was movin on guns all ablaze 
Pullin on the past like I do 
Still can't forgive all the abuse 
That aint no way to rise from the crib 
Still runnin hard from the shit 
Why you wanna push my buttons? 
Makin sure that I feel nothin? 
Do you really think you need to remind me 
Everytime every single second that I'm alive 
Just to make yourself feel better? I don't think so 
I just wanna do it all right 
Find me better place in this life 
We bring out the worst in each other 
That aint no way to love one another 
I just wanna be okay 
There aint nothin wrong with that 
I'm losing my life away 
Losin myself and I want it back. 
I'm a loser yes it's true 
Feels like I'm losing since I met you 
Through the good times and the bad 
Feels like I'm losing all I've ever had 
Check it out 
Do you remember when we both used to be so in love for eternity? 
All the promises that we made 
All our friends said we had it made 
Yea, there were times we were rough 
Times we were down, world spinnin round 
Everybody goes through a brawl 
But me and you could crash through it all 
We were both lions in a cage 
We were both livin through the rage 
We were still afraid and we both had everything but didn't have it made 
I'm really feelin bad that we both gonna have to say goodbye now 
But it is what it is baby I'm gonna have to take a time out 
(Goodbye) 
I just wanna be okay 
There aint nothin wrong with that 
I'm losing my life away 
Losin myself and I want it back.

I'm a loser yes it's true 
Feels like I'm losing since I met you 
Through the good times and the bad 
Feels like I'm losing all I've ever had 
Goodbye!

            <field name="lyrics">Everyday is a vivid nightmare, 
Ever since I left the highchair 
Waking up to miss the school bus, 
Breaking up again is too much 
Everything I did was no good 
Close to so good but, always no good 
Even if I changed is my destiny the same? 
Maybe I'm a little sensitive and high-strung 
mentally abused when so young 
I've heard it all before 
Critisim I ignore... 
It aint enough to be myself and be free 
Stand on this ground that lies beneath me 
Life it burns so cold then so hot 
Don't underestimate me big shot! 
[Chorus] 
Don't need these conversations 
They feel like masturbation 
To much antisapation 
Shut it up, shut it, shut it, shut it up! 
I make my decisions, 
based on your reactions 
To get my satisfaction. 
Shut it up, shut it, shut it, shut it up! 
See I'm the boy who made things happen 
Driven by complete compassion 
I'm always thinking about tomorrow 
But today is where I borrow, 
my mistakes 
Cause now im learnin' 
lessons that just keep on burnin' 
I'm easily amused and just as easily confused. 
Maybe life aint much worth livin' 
but its the gift that keeps on givin' 
No matter what your dealt 
and no matter how you felt 
Think about the time that we had zero problems 
Everyday could last forever 
But life burns so cold and so hot 
Don't underestimate me big shot! 
[Chorus] 
And soon you'll see 
how fucked up the truth can be 
A friend in need of you and me 
It's so much easier if you.. 
You JUST DON'T CARE! 
Shut it up, shut it, shut it, shut it up! 
Look at my face 
(look at my face) 
Don't treat me like innocence and think that I can't see though your 
plasticness. 
Don't pretend that you comprehend and think that I can't tell you've lost your 
place again. 
It's all good (it's all good) 
It's all right (it's all right) 
Now I'm realising who I'm dealin' with. 
(who im dealin' with) 
[repeat x2] more X (louder each time) 
[Chorus] 
And soon you'll see 
how fucked up the truth can be 
A friend in need of you and me 
It's so much easier if you.. 
You JUST DON'T CARE!

In the house 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Paul wall 
The balling is big 
Cuz the hustle is hard 
The grind is kinda huge 
So jealousy is quite large 
With credit cards and cash stacks 
My mind focused on greenbacks 
I go and get it 
I don't relax 
The player hating is to the max 
Kush sacks and powder packs 
No time to eat 
It's just snacks 
That's whiskey and cognac 
Getting fucked up like 
College frats 
Just facts 
Fascination with paper stacks 
And masturbation on baby's backs 
Assassination my player stacks 
Gang sharp like thumb tacks 
Go dump on horse gump 
They chew me up like orbits gum 
Swallow cock and eat cum 
Eat crumbs 
Run from cops but bar none 
In the streets like a bum 
If you don't like come get you some 
I hear em talking that shit 
But they ain't saying shit 
They don't wanna start shit 
Tell them they can eat shit 
They all full of shit 
Cuz they not about shit 
If they keep on talking shit 
I'm gonna make them eat shit 
Motherfucker fuck you 
With my middle finger up 
Motherfucker fuck you 
With my middle finger up 
Fuck you (fuck you) 
Fuck you (fuck you) 
Hold up 
I got moves to make 
I cruise this globe you 
Gonna hafta wait 
Imma slap that bitch upside your face 
But bitch don't smile 
Imma hafta hate 
I don't take to that shit so lightly 
Microphone got me in the zone 
What that shot patrol 
We gonna hafta brone 
Imma smack this shit upside your brain 
Upside your dome 
What 
You know what me and paul wall 
Gonna fuck this shit like some slut 
Yo bitches go get lubed up 
Get chewed out and spit out 
Like snot I blow this shit out 
I love when rock 'n' roll gets mix with hip hop ho! 
Let's shot this clock 
Blasting classics 
Now you know 
I'm head to toe 
On abby road 
I flip that super nasty flow 
Keep the ladies on the go and they keep coming back for mo' 
Cease the fake 
Increase the stakes 
This gold cobra is wilder great 
Please wait no sweet escape 
Just swisher sweets 
Ain't kush great 
Police on the take 
No beefs with fate 
No peace for fate 
Peace is the shit they speak the hate 
Just broken bones and body aches 
You gotta leap from the waist 
Hello police state 
Keep my mind on the cake 
I'm fly like superman 
But no cape 
Dripped and draped in that street scholar 
Hardly awake and half baked 
Peak the technique 
Clean the slate 
The flow is so well done like steak 
Break em down 
I got some moves to make 
Go fuck yourself if you can't relate 
They talk (yeah) 
They talk 
They talk 
They talk 
They done dug themselves a hole 
They know it's all they fault 
Gonna pour salt straight on the wound 
Getter catch this jet it's leaving soon 
Infection might be settling in 
But this doctor done checked out the room 
We blazing through like xananadu 
What? 
Now you know what not to do 
This crack here might not be for you 
But Imma gonna leave you crackers black and blue 
We wrack this shit like hand grenades 
This blunt is smoked up all day 
But had to piss on your parade 
Take all the pieces of the puzzle (you heard me?) 
If they ain't fittin' we in trouble 
Busting all your asses like a bubble 
You know I'm mad at you 
Fuck you and your attitude

Now all the critics wanna hit it 
Shit can ever did it 
Just because they don’t get 
But I’ll stay fitted 
Knew there committed 
Unless this red cap 
Gets a bad rap from his critics 
Do we always gotta cry? (gotta cry) 
Do we always gotta be inside a lie (a lie) 
Life is just a blast 
Movin really fast 
Better stay on top 
or life will kick you in the ass 
Follow me into a solo 
Remember that, kid 
So what you wanna do? 
The way you wanna run 
When your starin down a cable 
of a mic put it that you grill like a gun 
Limp Bizkit is rockin the set 
Its like Russian Roulette 
When your placin your bet 
So don’t be upset 
when your broke 
And your done 
Cuz im gonna be the one 
til I jet 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
Now I know why you want to hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
why you want to hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
Now you wanna hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
Now you wanna hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
Does anybody really know the secret? 
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it 
Its kinda sad when you don’t know the meaning 
But everything happens for a reason 
I don’t even know what I should say 
'Cause I'm an idiot a loser and a microphone abuser 
I analyze every second I exist 
Beaten on my mind every second with my fist 
And everybody wanna run (run) 
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (gun) 
You can take that ride through this life if you want 
You cant take that edge off that knife (no sir) 
And now you want your money back (money back) 
But your denied cuz your brains fried from the sac 
And there aint nothing I can do 
Cuz life is a lesson you’ll learn it when your through 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
I know why you want to hate me 
I know why you want to hate me 
Now I know why you want to hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
why you want to hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
Now you wanna hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
(Now I know why..Now I know why..Now I know why) 
Now I know why you wanna hate me 
Now I know why you wanna hate me 
Now I know why you wanna hate me 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately 
Cuz hate is all the world that’s even seen lately</field>

Are you ready? 
Do you know where you are? 
Welcome to the jungle punk 
Take a look around 
It's Limp Bizkit 
fuckin' up your town 
We downloaded the Shockwave 
For all the ladies in the cave 
To get your groove on 
And maybe you're the one 
Who flew over the cuckoo's nest 
But guess who's next? (who?) 
Generation X 
Generation Strange 
Sun don't even shine through our window paine 
So go ahead and talk shit 
Talk shit about me 
Go ahead and talk shit 
About my g-g-generation 
Cause we don't, don't give a fuck, and 
We won't ever give a fuck 
Until you 
You give a fuck about me 
And my generation 
Hey kid, take my advice 
You don't want to step into a big pile of shit 
Captain's drunk 
Your world is Titanic 
Floating on the funk 
So get your groove on 
And maybe I am just a little fucked up 
Life's just a little fucked up 
Generation X 
Generation Strange 
Sun don't even shine through our window pane

You get the blame 
And I..

Stranded, In the land of the lost, 
Standin' up I'm sideways, I'm blazin' up the path, 
Runnin' on the highways of wrath, 
Choked up, by the smoke in the charcoal, 
Lotta stamps and brands me like a barcode, 
I'm dashin' all the media strikes, to keep the media dikes, 
that's reinforced me for the fight, 
And that alone will keep John Gotti on the phone, 
I'm tanglin' on the zone, I got the bees on the track, 
Where the fuck u at? 
Mm: Tacal 
Fd: Let me hear you bitches run your mouth now, 
Mm: Shut the fuck up 
Fd: I'm pluggin' in them social skills, to keep my total bills, 
that run a million, the last time I checked it, 
thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreckin', 
wait until the second round then knock 'em out. 
Mm: They call me big john-Stud, my middle name-Mud, 
dirty water flow, too much for you thug, I can't stand the flood, 
what up doc? Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd, the sure shot, 
Mister Meth, I'm unplugged, learn, temperatures too hot for sun block, 
burn, playin with minds that get you state time, 
locked behind 12 bars, from a great mine, 
killa bees in the club, with this ladybug, 
brought his sword to the dance floor, 
to cut a rug, love is love all day, 
till they no slug, and take another life in cold blood, 
can't feel me, till it's your blood, 
murder is tremendous, crime is endless, 
same shit different day, 
father forgive us, they know not what they do, 
all praise is due, I'm big like easy, and big bamboo 
Chorus: What's that I didn't hear you, 
shut the fuck up, 
come on a little louder, 
shut the fuck up, 
everybody n 2 gether now, 
shut the fuck up, just 
shut the fuck up just, shut the fuck up(2x) 
Method Man: Headstrong, deckhorn, get right on, 
dead weight they dead wrong, 
let's get it on, 12 rounds of throw down, 
who whole crown, protect land with full pound, 
limp bizkit, get around like merry-go, bust the scenario, 
comin through your stereo, why risk it, 
lifestyles of the prolific and gifted 
essential vitamins and minerals delicious, 
word on the street is, they bit my thesis, 
knocked out they front teeth is, try to taste my, 
actin' like they heard through the grape vine, 
dope feedin' for the baseline, to provide by, 
pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles, 
where'd you find that monster, 
she beautiful, wu-tang and limp bizkit roll on the set 
kick a hole in the speaker, pull a plug and inject 
Fd: Mic check, so what's it all about, and where we gonna run, 
maybe we can 
meet up on the sun, 
discretion is advised, for the blood of virgin eyes, 
limpin' on the track with the method, so get the sun block, you gettin' one 
shot, until you dissolve I revolve around everything you got, from outta no 
where, prepare, you be blinded by the glare, I told not to stare, now you've 
turned into stone, without a microphone, but don't you forget your in the zone 
Mm: So shut the fuck up 
Fd: and take that shit back, cause all your shit's whack 
Mm: dil da wil dill dill 
Fd: When it's weighed out like that 
Burnin' up your brain like a piston, So 
all those who didn't listen, Never even knew what they were missin, and never 
knew that the sky was falling down, wu-tang clan for the crown. 
Chorus 
Mm: It was over your head all day everyday S-I-N-Y, 1-0-3-0-4, wu-tang killa 
bees, and the limp B-I-Z-K-I-T, ya'll know the time, y'all know the rhyme it 
ain't easy bein' greasy, in the world full of cleanliness and, you know all 
that other madness we gone, peace.

The thought of any problem 
The bully on Grand Ave. 
The pocket knife in his hand 
Demeanor was the same as it always was and will be 
Attitude's the same down here 
You point it at them People do bleed 
Percentages are high this year 
I wanna know when to laugh at your gun 
Careful not to push to far 
You're bringing all your power to me 
Pathetically addressed like this 
The situation worsened 
It's harder than before 
The bully's got new reasons Reasons I deplore 
things I walked away from 
Now leave me where I stood 
And all I see is blue sky 
I guess it's just the 
Same as it always was and will be 
Attitude's the same down here 
You point it at them People do bleed Percentages are high this year 
I wanna know when to laugh at your gun 
Careful not to push to far 
You're bringing all your power to me 
Looking down the barrel 
Remembering the stories 
Making light of history 
Will I ever laugh at this 
same as it always was and will be 
Attitude's the same down here 
You point it at them People do bleed Percentages are high this year 
I wanna know when to laugh at your gun

Hey, I think about the day

And I should give her a break 
My heart will ache either way 
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say? 
I won't lie, that I can't deny 
I did it all for the nookie, c'mon

Why did it take so long? 
Why, did I wait so long, huh? 
To figure it out, but I did it 
And I'm the only one 
Underneath the sun who didn't get it 
I can't believe that I could be deceived 
By my so-called girl, but in reality 
Had a hidden agenda 
She put my tender, heart in a blender 
And still I surrendered

Stick it up your... 
I'm only human 
It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice 
They'll tell you, just let it go 
It's easier said than done 
I appreciate it, I do, but 
Just leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Just leave me alone 
And nothing gonna change 
You can go away 
I'm just gonna stay here 
And always be the same 
I did it all for the nookie, c'mon

What you need is someone strong to guide you. 
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow, 
what you need is someone strong to use you.. 
like me, 
like me. 
If you want to get your soul to heaven, 
trust in me. 
Don't judge or question. 
You are broken now , 
but faith can heal you. 
Just do everything I tell you to do. 
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow. 
Let me lay my holy hand upon you. 
My Gods will 
becomes me. 
When he speaks out, 
he speaks through me. 
He has needs 
like I do. 
We both want 
to rape you. 
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life. 
Open my eyes and blind me with your light 
and your lies.</field>

Radio Sucks...by Matt Pinfield 
Hey, it's the bald man, 
and I'm here to tell you 
why the new Limp Bizkit album's so important. 
That's because Cd's like this 
will spare you from all the chart-toppin, 
teenie-boppin, disposable, 
happy horse shit that brings up 
the bile from the back of my neck. 
I have no time or tolerance 
for all shitty wack acts like that. 
I wouldn't piss on their 
Cd's to put out a fire. 
And I'm tired off all those lame-ass, 
tame-ass, pre-fabricated, 
sorry excuses for singers 
and musicians who 
don't even write their own songs! 
What the world needs now 
is a musical revolution. 
We need some rock, 
we need somethin ass-boss. 
We need something with substance, 
with depth, somethin with soul, 
some edge, some passion, 
some power! 
Shit, if it's gonna be mellow, 
Fuck, Man, it better have somethin, 
it better mean somethin! 
I'm tellin you, 
you gotta hit'em with somethin hard. 
You gotta stick'em with somethin limp, 
like Limp Bizkit. 
I'm so fuckin tired of this shit 
that I'm hearin on the radio. 
Radio Sucks!! 
The same fuckin songs over and over again, 
all the week ones, 
all that disposable crap that 
isn't gonna matter in three months, 
its just Shit. 
(Hey, Matt, calm down) 
It's crap, Fred. 
Fred, I'm tellin you, 
there's nothin but shit goin on 
and we need some new music. 
(But, well, what about Limp Bizkit?) 
Limp Bizkit is fuckin cool, 
you guys are cool, 
the new records great, 
but Fuck All That Other Shit!!! 
I'm so sick of all that week shit 
that's takin space on the charts 
(hey, Matt, calm down, man). 
Fuck this shit, I'm outta here. 
(Fuck, dude. 
Fuckin Pinfield is pissed. 
Oh man I gotta go find that bald bastard. 
Hey Matt!) 
A Word With Les Claypool 
Hit me! Firecracker. 
So there you go...fifteen of your 
hard-earned dollars right out the window. 
Most expensive piece of plastic 
I've ever come across. 
Fifteen dollars... 
Fifteen dollars on a shiny piece of plastic. 
There it is...Limp Bizkit, in all it's glory. 
Fred Durst, the man, the myth... 
the compulsive masturbater. 
You love him, you hate him, 
you love to hate him. 
Hello? Ha ha! 
Once, when I was afraid to speak, 
when I was just a lad. 
My poppy gave my nose a tweek, 
and told me I was bad. 
And then I learned a brilliant word, 
that saved my achin nose. 
The biggest word you've ever heard, 
and this is how it goes... 
"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" 
even though the sound of it 
is something quite atrocious. 
"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" 
Ahh, those were the days. 
I dunno. 
You got any more of that..ah.. 
shmokeable {???} 
So what did you think you were gettin that 
Celine Dion record? 
No, no, no, young buckey. 
You laughed, you cried, 
you just kissed your fifteen bucks goodbye. 
Limp Bizkit? I dont' think so. 
Fred Durst?! 
I dunno, but what the hell? I got paid. 
Good-bye now.</field>

Bring me to my knees 
Again 
All the times 
That I could beg you please 
In vain 
All the times 
That I felt insecure 
For you 
But I leave 
My burdens at the door 
But I'm on the outside 
And I'm looking in 
I can see through you 
See your true colors 
'Cause inside you're ugly 
You're ugly like me 
I can see through you 
See to the real you 
All the times 
That I felt like this won't end 
Was for you 
And I taste 
What I could never have 
It's from you 
All the times 
That I've tried 
My intentions 
Full of pride 
But I waste 
More time than anyone 
But I'm on the outside 
And I'm looking in 
I can see through you 
See your true colors 
'Cause inside you're ugly 
You're ugly like me 
I can see through you 
See to the real you 
All the times 
That I've cried 
All this wasted 
It's all inside 
And I feel 
All this pain 
Stuffed it down 
It's back again 
And I lie 
Here in bed 
All alone 
I can't mend 
But I feel 
Tomorrow will be OK 
But I'm on the outside 
And I'm looking in 
I can see through you 
See your true colors 
'Cause inside you're ugly 
You're ugly like me 
I can see through you 
See to the real you

            <field name="lyrics">Sometimes my intuitions 
Are nearly warning signs, 
Sometimes ignoring them 
Could fuck me up 
And this is one, one, one of those times. 
It's much too late to 
Derail this crazy train, 
You left me like your laundry 
Out here hanging, and I'm done, done, done. 
I see your lips 
They move so fast, 
But the words ain't coming out. 
If You could only stop pretending 
And dive right in me. 
I see your lipsThey move so fast, 
But the words ain't coming out. 
If You could only stop pretending 
And dive right in me. 
You were my last temptation 
The fruit I'll never need, 
To taste your blood has made my bet 
And now I'm living one, one, one big lie. 
Through penetration 
You poison carefully, 
I'm left with an empty hole 
I cannot replace You 
I will not, not, not this time. 
Not this time. 
No, not this time. 
And just know you're a part of me 
And you will always be. 
I see your lipsThey move so fast, 
But the words ain't coming out. 
If you could only stop pretending 
And dive right in me. 
I see your lips 
They move so fast, 
But the words ain't coming out. 
If you could only stop pretending 
And dive right in me. 
All the leaves are falling off of my tree, 
Nobody growing any colder than me, 
I'll admit you can talk a good game, 
You maintain the talk of a good game. 
You never met a single one that you said, 
Say anything again inside of my head 
I'll admit You made it in somehow, 
Somehow, you made it in somehow. 
You don't think much, do you ? 
You don't feel much, do you ? 
You talk way too much, 
You talk way too much. 
You don't think much, do you ? 
You don't feel much, do you ? 
You talk way too much, 
You talk way too much. 
I see your lips 
They move so fast, 
But the words ain't coming out. 
If you could only stop pretending 
And dive right in me. 
I see your lips 
They move so fast, 
But the words ain't coming out. 
If You could only stop pretending 
Stop pretending, stop pretending..</field>

straight comin' at ya, punk 
the greatest side is critical 
when digging on my concept rhythms 
keep on building like smoke 
got'cha running from the law 
maybe it's that low end 
smothered with the freestyle 
maybe it's the thought 
of being on the bottom of the pile 
style's bound to the sky lines 
keep 'em on the sidelines 
choking on my fly rhymes 
you need the Heimlich maneuver 
this ain't no joke 
you're gonna choke

when do you decide (you decide) 
then you can know in your mind (you decide) 
when do you decide 
I'll probably never understand pollution, 
you preach the noise 
about the words that you don't wanna hear 
pollution, I keep the grip tight on the mic 
when I spill pollution, 
you preach the noise 
about the words that you don't wanna hear 
pollution, I keep that grip real tight breaker, 
breaker one nine, spitting out that skill 
suicidal punk let me know you're real 
I'm walking on a thin line 
with the sticky bass line 
now you're stuck with the flow 
running through your mind 
so if you're crossing over, 
let me know you're real ?????? 
now you get the feel 
I rumble like the thunder 
now you're going under 
I bet ya wonder 
what the fuck is even going down 
I listen to 'em stereotype 
and then complain 
I can't refrain 
from bringing on the pain

so when they tell me 
to turn down that volume 
I'm gonna bring that beat back 
and when they tell Sam 
to turn down that bass 
I'm gonna bring that beat back 
and when they tell me 
to turn down the vocal 
I'm gonna bring that beat back 
and when they tell us 
to shut the fuck up 
I'm gonna bring that beat back 
yeah, gonna bring that beat back 
aw, gonna bring that beat back 
fuck, gonna bring that beat back 
yo, yo, yo J bring that beat back 
{chorus} 
I'm gonna bring that beat back 
I'm gonna bring that beat back 
I'm gonna bring that beat back, beat back 
Bring that beat back, beat back (2x)

Silent when I would used to speak 
Distant from all around me

when I don't fall down 
but you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain 
because you know it all 
and I guess things will never change 
but you might need my hand 
when falling in your whole 
Your disposition I'll remember when I'm letting go of... 
you and me we're through and rearranged 
It seems that your not satisfied 
there's too much on your mind 
So you leave and I can't believe 
all the bullshit that I find

you're no good for me 
Thank God it's over. 
You make believe 
that nothing is wrong until you're cryin' 
You make believe 
life is so long until you're dyin' 
You make believe 
that nothing is wrong until you're cryin', 
cryin' on me 
You make believe 
that life is so long until you're dyin', 
dyin' on me!! 
you think everybody is the same 
I don't think that anybody is like you 
You ruin everything 
and you kept fuckin' with me

Freak baby, freak freak baby (x3) 
Look who’s talkin’ it up baby 
One more chalkin’ it up baby 
Star maps stalkin’ it up baby 
My dogs barkin’ it up baby 
Who’d a thought i’d be layin it down baby? 
Who’d a thought i’d be turnin’ your frown baby? 
Never know about things these days baby 
‘ till your cell phone rings and it’s me baby

People in the house put them hands in the air 
Cuz if you don't care, then we don't care 
See I ain't giving a f*ck 
Quit pressing your luck 
Untouchable, branded unf*ckable 
So keep me in this cage 
Until you run that mouth 
Then Ima have to plague 
And break the f*ck out 
And then we'll see who's left 
After one round with X 
And what am I bringing next? 
Just know it's Red and Meth 
So where the f*ck you at? 
Punk, shut the f*ck up 
And back the f*ck up 
While we f*ck this track up 
Are you ready?! (3x) 
Chorus 1, Chorus 2 
Oh what, y'all thought y'all weren't goin' to see me? 
Check my dangerous slang 
Atrocious 
When I let these nuts hang 
Focus 
It's Wutang 
What the f*ck's a Hootie and the Blowfish 
I wave my black flag at the roaches 
Who approach us 
These twin supersoakers 
Who have poisonous darts for cobras 
Too late to get your blowgun unholstered 
You're left buttered up and lightly toasted 
So what? 
I drink and smoke too much 
So what? 
I cus too much 
Shut the f*ck the up 
Now when we roll 
You motherf*ckers toppin' your goal 
Cause for the platinum 
I'm jackin' niggers up in limos 
It ain't nothin' for bullets 
To unbutton your clothes 
This wretched yellow mellow tissue 
Up in his nose 
You bitches 
Swing the vine on the bad boom nuts 
I'm hairy as hell 
Ahh to hell 
And tatooed up 
I'm a dog 
Only f*ck in the bathroom, what? 
In highschool I dealt only with the classroom sluts 
My name is Johnny Donny Brascoe 
Talk the gat low 
Cut your cash flow 
Yell if you want money 
Funny how hungry they'll be 
Snatch crumbs from me 
Dark and hard 
Mix bodies in the mosh pit 
Yo, and I'm the D.O. 
You're lookin' at the raw invented 
On Friday I spent 
Thirty five to forty minutes 
Smell up the bathroom 
Like Craig Paul was in it 
Ending up on your back 
Whose whore's up in it 
Anyone can match me 
I crack 'em all a Guinness 
f*ck how many thugs are playas? 
A ball is in it 
Brick city, Shaolin 
Better call 'em sinners 
Boys that'll run up in your 
White mall and spill it 
Yo, peace and come on! 
Chorus 1, Chorus 2 
It just don't get no darker than that 
Kid with the park 
Go ahead with the boots 
And shoots to make it spark 
Now I'm a fair nigger 
But ain't there nigger 
Quicker than the hair trigger 
Took you dead nigger 
It'd better like 
Yo man, trying to hold your brains 
In your head 
But you'll be sh*tting on yourself 
Cause you're already dead 
And at the funeral you won't need a casket 
I'm leaving just enough 
For them to stuff their basket 
A tisket 
a tasket 
I really need my ass kicked 
My mom's never let me forget 
That I'm a bastard 
I aint never been sh*t 
ain't gonna be sh*t 
That's why I take sh*t 
Whenever I see sh*t 
And to their D sh*t 
D Sharper 
Do what I wanna do 
And that's what I'm gonna do 
Right here in front of you 
And I'll be running you 
And your man, straight up out 
You niggers aint running a f*ckin' thing 
But your mouth 
Chorus 1, Chorus 2 
You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit? (Yeah) 
You cant mess with Limp Bizkit (why?) 
Because we get it on (when?) 
Every day and every night (oh) 
See this platinum thing right here? (uh huh) 
Well we're doing it all the time (what?) 
So you'd better get some better beats 
And uh, get some better rhymes (doh!) 
And if you really really really wanna get sh*t started 
Then people everywhere just get retarded 
Get retarded!, Get retarded! 
People everywhere just get retarded! 
Chorus 1, Chorus 2 
That's right baby!

No one leaves and no one will 
Moon is full, never seems to change 
Just labeled mentally deranged 
Dream the same thing every night 
I see our freedom in my sight 
No locked doors, no windows barred 
No things to make my brain seem scarred 
Sleep my friend and you will see 
The dream is my reality 
They keep me locked up in this cage 
Can't they see that's why my brain says rage 
Rage, rage, rage, rage 
[Chorus:] 
Sanitarium 
Leave me be 
Sanitarium 
Leave me alone 
Build my fear of what's out there 
Cannot breathe the open air 
Whisper things into my brain 
Assuring me that I'm insane 
They think our heads are in their hands 
Violent use brings violent plans 
Keep him tied, it makes him well 
He's getting better, can't you tell? 
No more can they keep us in 
Listen, damn it, we will win 
They see it right, they see it well 
But they think this saves us from our hell 
Hell, hell, hell, hell

Oh yeah, are you happy to be here or what? 
Well all I know is at a Metallica concert, nobody's sitting down 
So everybody in those fuckin' seats stand the fuck up! 
Get up! 
Get the fuck up! 
Thats what I'm talkin' bout! 
And I want all you people on the floor 
Who are fortunate to be here tonight, to move in pretty close 
Come on in 
You back there come on in 
Alright, I want y'all to repeat after me ok? 
Leave me alone (x3) 
Leave me alone, I'm gonna break the fuck out! C'mon! 
Leave me alone (x3) 
Leave me alone, I'm gonna break the fuck out! C'mon! 
Fear of living on 
Natives getting restless now 
Mutiny's in the air 
Got some death to do 
Mirror stares back hard 
Kill is such a friendly word 
Seems the only way 
'To' reaching out again 
Fear of living on 
Natives getting restless now 
Mutiny's in the air 
Got some death to do 
Mirror stares back hard 
Kill is such a friendly word 
Seems the only way 
To bring it back again

Feelin like a shovel 
With a lot of shit in the way 
Gonna clear me a path 
Right to the culprit 
Straight to your fucked up past 
This aint about rage 
It's about disrespect 
You shoulda thought about that 
Before your track went flat 
Homie what the deal? 
Why you talkin' shit like that? 
I've had enough drama 
I don't need a chump 
Talkin' that trash in pajamas 
Heated up like a sauna 
Time to pay the piper 
I ain't givin' hope like Obama 
I'm spittin out flames 
Better hit the deck 
Ima mic check them games 
You don't need a new coach 
You need a new neck 
Hoarse(of course?) I connect with your throat 
Still shockin' like a heart attack 
Cuz I'm a maniac 
Still runnin through the shark attack 
Without a single scratch 
Still limpin' where the dog is at 
Up in my brainiac 
Still Bitin while your barkin' back 
So you can shut your trap 
Check 1-2 
I ain't even through 
Givin you grief 
Put another stain on your teeth 
Back up on your feet 
Call in the rescue 
Better get the whole damn fleet 
This attack aint stealth 
It's worldwide 
Homicide bad for your health what 
I'm goin straight for the gut 
Closin them minds 
Sewin them lips straight shut 
Go ahead put it on me 
Show me what you got 
Why you get robbed like a zombie 
It's a one man army 
Puff Puff give 
Watch em get smoked like a cig 
You heard of Freedy Kruger? 
I'm kinda like that 
With a red cap and a Ruger 
Still slingin it to ya 
Microphone hustla 
Bad motha fucka 
Screw ya. 
Still shockin' like a heart attack 
Cuz I'm a maniac 
Still runnin through the shark attack 
Without a single scratch 
Still limpin' where the dog is at 
Up in my brainiac 
Still Bitin while your barkin' back 
So you can shut your trap

My nose is running like me from the police 
It's been three weeks and I ain't got no sleep 
Now I'm chillin where the players and the hoes be, 
With two broke hands trying to roll weed 
Pop pop p-pop off the rock ship 
You might maybe know a lot of things, baby, not this 
And I'll do it all again for you, watch this 
As I limp my ass back to the cockpit 
Now start it up, let the engine roll 
And all the people in the moshpit scream for more 
(Yeah!) you scream for more! (Yeah!) and light it up 
Cuz the way we live our lives seems right to us 
Let me tell you people what you need to know 
You've gotta plant a lot of seeds for your weed to grow 
You've also gotta know when you need to run 
You hear that.. 
That's the sound of a shotgun! 
Everybody jumps from the sound of the shotgun 
In my neighborhood, everybody got one (4X) 
What you're gonna do when you're sitting all alone 
In your empty ass home with the motherfucker sawed-off 
Pop off the rock ship, pop pop pop off the rock ship (2X) 
Woke up in the morning in the county jail, 
And I can't remember yesterday that well 
Hell I, can't remember when I slept that well, 
I told this girl I've been fucking and get my belt. 
Cuz I pop pop p-pop off the rock ship 
You probably heard it all before, baby, not this 
Hear is the shout to you ladies with the hot teats 
Courtesy of limp bizkit on some rock shit 
Now here we go, start it up! 
Should I remind you motherfucker that I don't give a fuck 
(Hell no) I never have, (hell yeah) I never will 
and I will always understand how the haters feel

I'd like to dedicate this song to you,

Where you at Jacksonville,

Where you at Providence, Nashville, 
Memphis, Lauderdale, 
Portland, Orlando, Chicago, and Frisco? 
I left my heart in Austin with Mary Campbell. 
Got lost in Boston lookin' for the tea party. 
Met a child molester in Worchester 
Need a Kleenex every time I'm leavin' Phoenix. 
I get silly when I play in Philly. 
Limp Bizkit committee down in Kansas City. 
Never know what I'm in for 
when I'm play in Denver. 
Hard Rock don't stop down in Vegas. 
In Cincinnati the girls call me daddy 
and I probably ain't leavin' 
the next time I'm in Cleveland. 
Found my lucky coin in Des Moines 
and spit on a boy named Tina in Pasadena. 
We get the swing from new Orleans. 
Fort Worth and Dallas we toast 
when we're tippin' up the challis. 
Tulsa, St 
Louis, Sacto, Mesa, 
Norfolk, Lawrence, Minneapolis, St 
Paul, 
North Hampton, Detroit, Omaha, New York, L.A. 
What can I say? I can't name 'em all,

I can't help but believe in these friends, 
these bands, these stories, 
and the places that I've been 
I thank God, Mom and Dad, 
Adriana, for the love I feel inside 
Jordan, my phat ass band 
Without 'em I'd be nothin' but a pumpkin 
shoved inside a can. 
Without the fans there wouldn't be no show, 
and if that was really so than life would really blow. 
To the Firm, you always got my back. 
Korn for the love and the swappin' of the tracks. 
My brother Cory D, my man Terry Date 
We brought it to the plate 
and you made it sound great. 
Scott Weiland the melody man, 
if you can't sing it nobody can. 
Wu Tang Clan, skills from the Method. 
The world's best Mc kills on this record. 
Slim Shady, crazy ass cracker. 
Staind, a brand new drug for your brain. 
Les Claypool, for actin' like a fool 
and all of the bands for the demos that were kool. 
I'm so grateful for this life of mine. 
The ones I didn't thank, I will some other time 
Now I just want somebody, 
anybody, everybody to get the fuck up!! 
And show me what you got! 
Yeee-ha! 
Show me what you got 
Hey, ladies! 
Who's hot, who's not? 
Who? Who? 
Who's hot, who's not? 
Who's..... 
hot, baby? 
Who's hot? 
Uh... 
Yeah Lethal, I like that beat... 
Uh.. 
Bring it! 
Bring it! 
I've been around this world and then some. 
Dum ditty dum kid, where you comin' from? 
I went from the garage to steppin' on these stages. 
Outrageous rhymes left my mind 
and soon became contagious. 
An Mc with bad habits I am; 
I see a mic then I grab it 
It's scary, ain't it? 
Comin' raw with no corrections, 
savin' all perfections, 
for what I do with my erections, 
so dream on...!</field>

(bitch) 
play along 
play 
I thought I knew ya 
took the time to put my love into ya 
screw ya 
cuz now you got me sitin in the sewer 
I'm through with all them roller coaster rides 
see I ain't forgot about the knots that you been tying 
with my insides 
I dropped my pride 
without you I was sure to die 
I tried with cash 
did all I could to make it last 
now I accept that that wus in the past 
I know you love me 
you love me like a piece of trash 
but at first you were so sweet 
couldn't go without seeing your face for an hour (so sour) 
it all became a hastle 
you were even livin in my castle 
just to use me 
and verbaly abuse me 
that's not the way I'm runnin my show 
it took a while to see the light before I stopped 
and you got dropped off 
it's over, probably I'll be sweatin it 
but in the long run you'll be the one regreting it 
maybe you won't, maybe you will 
but baby you're still about as real as a 3 dollar bill 
(chorus) 
there's no one to blame, but you 
and who gets the blame? me 
(x2) 
oh oh, I sound like a bitch (a little bitch in heat) 
over that heat that I am feeling bitch I think it's cheap 
another split tale, just another split tale 
thanks for the lesson, now get your shit and hit the trail 
you know I'm comin from that old school you damn fool 
intensity is something that I'm made of 
and certainly I'm not afraid of a little smack in my face 
thanks for that taste

Yo J. 
Can I get a little bit. 
Heah, ha, eah... 
Your veins flow with poison. 
Please acknowledge my present 
This precious gift and behold and discard it like trash. 
To dominate it's in your nature, you selfish brat. 
I can't believe you had me 
Strung out over you like that! 
One minute your sweet, the next minute your sour. 
I taste the envious predictions. 
Change with each hour, I've seen this before 
You even decide to step into my world. 
Strange things occurring, 
Happening over and over and over again. 
Now bitch you are cruelty. 
You bark your orders with such degrading dialect. 
I can't believe you had me 
Strung out over you like that! 
One minute your sweet, the next minute your sour. 
I taste the envious predictions. 
Change with each hour, I've seen this before 
You even decide to step into my world. 
Gonna funk it up. 
 
One minute you think your all this 
The next minute you think your all that 
But your playin' with tha' nova 
Momma didn't show ya' 
How to take gettin' canned by the man when it's over. 
I've been hunting you down 
Waiting for the payback, your frown. 
Begging me for your mercy 
I ain't down with tha' sypathy, you see. 
And I'll always remember your tender looove! 
Wipe me under tha' rug, just so you can step on my spine.... 
I'M GONNA GET MINE! 
I'm gonna get mine! 
?????? reminds me 
(I'm gonna get mine!) 
I guess I was wasted by envy 
(I'm gonna get mine!) 
Beyond this love is such a ?????? (I'm gonna get mine!) 
I'd like to rearrange your face! I'm gonna get mine. 
Please don't wake me. 
Your so sweeeet. 
Your so sweeeet. 
Your so cheeeap. 
I'm gonna get mine! 
I'm gonna get mine! 
I'd like to rearrange your face (I'm gonnna get mine!) 
Your always right, and I'm always wrong 
(Your not my mind) 
That's why you love me so much 
(Your not mine) 
Your so sweet, I love you 
(Your not my mind) 
Your so sweet, I love you 
(Your not mine).</field>

I'm lettin' loose with the thirty odd freestyle labeled hostile by my profile

i'll be slammin them balls to the wall with the ink on my flesh 
and the yes, yes y'all no 9 to 5, I'll still survive

rocking back in the '80's live my attitude to do or die once I was a maggot 
now I'm just super fly bound for the boundaries 
no limits G phat ass rhythms driven by my destiny

All the little girls fillin up the world today 
With the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good 
But I'm gonna live my life like I should 
Now all the critics wanna hit it 
To shit-can how we did it, 
just because they don't get it 
But I'll stay fitted, new era commited 
Now this red cap gets a wrap from his critics 
Do we always gotta cry 
Do we always gotta live inside a lie 
Life's just a blast, 
it's movin' really fast 
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass 
Follow me into a solo 
Remember that kid so what you wanna do 
And where you gonna run 
when your starin' down the cable of my mic 
Pointed at your grill like a gun 
Limp Bizkit's rockin' the set 
It's like russian roulette when you're placin' your bet 
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done 
'cause I'm gonna be the one till I jet 
I know why you wanna hate me (3x) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
I know you wanna hate me (3x) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
Does anybody really know the secret 
Or the combination for this life and where to keep it 
It's kind a sad when you don't know the meaning 
But everything happens for a reason 
I don't even know what I should say 
'cause I'm an idiot, a loser 
A microphone abuser 
I analyze every second I exist 
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fist 
And everybody wanna run 
Everybody wanna hide from the gun 
You can take that ride through this life, 
if you want 
But you can't take the edge off a knife 
(no sir) 
And now you want your money back 
But you're denied, 'cause your brain's fried from the sack 
And there aint nothin' I could do 
'cause life is a lesson, 
you'll learn it when you're through 
I know why you wanna hate me (3x) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
I now you wanna hate me (3x) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
Now.. 
I.. 
know.. 
why 
(now I know why you wanna hate me) 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately (3x)</field>

(ENGLISH VERSION) 
Do you remember the time when little things made you happy 
Do you remember the time when simple things made you smile 
Life can be wonderful if you let it be 
Life can be simple if you try 
What happened to those days? 
What happened to those nights? 
Do you remember the time when little things made you so sad 
Do you remember the time when simple things made you cry 
 
Is it just me, or is it just us 
Feeling lost in this world? 
Why do we have to hurt each other? 
Why do we have to shed tears? 
Life can be beautiful if you try 
Life can be joyful if we try 
Tell me I am not alone 
Tell me we are not alone in this world fighting against the wind 
Do you remember the time when simple things made you happy 
Do you remember the time when simple things made you laugh 
You know life can be simple 
You know life is simple 
Because the best thing in life is yet to come 
Because the best is yet to come.</field>

I don't like the radio 
I don't like tv

Get the fuck up! Yeah! Check! one, two!

Here we go *here we go* Here we go 
It's a Fucked up world; What a Fucked up place 
Everybodys judged by their Fucked up face 
Fucked up dreams; F'ed up life 
A F'ed up kid with a F'ed up knife 
F'ed up moms and f'ed up dads 
and a f'ed up cop with a f'ed badge 
Wtih a f'ed up job with f'ed up pay 
and a f'ed up boss who's a f'ed up gay 
f'ed up brests, f'ed up lives 
While lethal's in the back with the f'ed of the five 
*Hey, piss off* Everybody knows this song 
*Hey, piss off* Everybody knows this song 
Ain't it a shame that you can't say F? 
F's just a word and it's all F'ed up 
And a F'ed up punk with a F'ed up mouth 
And Nine inch nails is getting knocked the F out 
F'ed AIDs from F'ed up sex; and fake-ass titties on a F'ed up chest 
Your all f'ed up, so whatcha wanna do? F'ed up me, and f'ed up you. 
You wanna F me like an animal; You like to Burn me on the inside 
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug; 
Just know that nothing ya do, will bring you closer to me 
ain't life a bitch? a F'ed up bitch? A f'ed up sore with a F'ed up stitch 
a F'ed up head- It's a F'ed up shame 
swinging on my nuts is a F'ed up game 
Jealousy fillin' up a F'ed up mind; It's real F'ed up like a F'ed up crime 
If I say F two more times; That's 46 F's in this F'ed up rhyme 
*hey, piss off* everybody knows this song (x2) 
You wanna F me like an animal; You like to Burn me on the inside 
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug; 
Just know that nothing ya do, will bring you closer to me

I'm seriously considering checking myself in 
Locked inside this key chamber 
There's millions of keys inside 
but only one can stop my anger 
and I'm not fading away, so I'll just have to die 
Chorus: 
Unlocking the doors in my mind 
How many doors will I find? 
I think I got the key 
I guess I'll just try another if that's the key

and if the vibe’s good, go to first base 
‘ cuz the first kiss could be your last taste 
i ain’t looking to screw ‘till the vibe’s right 
chorus 
see I’m the only one you know 
that can put you on cruise control 
yeah i’m the only one you’ll find 
that won’t waste all my time, on nothing 
nothing, on nothing, nothing 
my will is stronger than most 
i will not let you get close 
until i think that you deserve me 
cause that’s a no go 
i’m gonna hold out, so in the meantime 
don’t expect much from a strong mind 
until i think that you deserve me 
chorus 
i’m holdin’ out, i’m gonna wait 
wanna make it past the first date 
a little time then we can do 
all them nasty things you want to do 
don’t get me wrong just take my hand 
and i really hope you understand that 
it’s easier when every second counts 
so we’ll just have to wait 
it’s really no big deal (x2) 
i’d hate to get you in bed 
find out your empty instead 
no need to knock another home run out 
cause that’s a no go 
and i hate to be so filthy 
if we were not meant to be 
no need to knock another homerun out 
chorus 
nothin’, on nothin’, nothin’ 
on nothin’, on nothin’</field>

(I dont think so) 
I dont either 
I've gotta find a new place 
A new place to feed 
Gotta be 
Stop everything, something is not feeling right 
The planets are not all aligned 
I know when I felt this before 
My evil is thirsty for more 
I need a new allie to feed 
What can I do? 
I've got an idea 
I think I'll just become a priest 
Decieving them with my belief 
I'll preach about what life is worth 
And cover my sins with their shirts 
My demons can run around free 
No one will suspect a thing 
I'll show them its okay to lust 
A priest the children can trust 
I found a new allie to feed 
Baptized by the unexpected 
Terrorized by the imperfections 
Somethings not right 
The planets are not all aligned 
I know when I felt this before 
My evil is thirsty for more 
I need a new allie to feed 
What can I do? 
I've got an idea 
I think I'll just become a priest

Oh my god 
Im watching TV 
I cant 
Oh whats this world coming to 
I see a priest molesting children 
I see terrorists blowing up buildins 
I see someone in rage 
Killing Dimebag on stage 
What the fuck is this? 
What the fuck is this? 
I got a kid 
Should I send him to Sunday School? 
I got a kid 
Should I send him to Sunday School? 
So you can fuck him 
Oh no you aint gonna fuck him 
How bout this? 
I dont fucking know who I can trust 
In this world and I'm gonna blow 
One more time 
I'm not that scared 
Something is not feeling right 
The planets are not all aligned 
I know when I felt this before 
My evil is thirsty for more 
I need a new allie to feed

Don't tell me how to keep my composure

Wanted dead or alive here's my profile 
Hostile is the frame for my state of grace 
Severly a mental disorder 
where reality is highly distorted 
Psychosis weaken the mind 
inclined in small doses 
as we approach this 
a relentless quest for revengence 
while those who expose and pretend this 
life, is just a big ball of cherries 
a bunch of fairies 
screamin' to be scary 
It's propaganda 
Sell it to the innocent 
oh yeah they're buyin' it 
just show up to rebel again 
I'm a maniac 
hard one to handle 
You'd better come packin more than a scandal 
fucked over from the times I've been greatful 
fucked over in the times i've been hateful 
main attraction fuck you and your prissy (*pussy*??) mouth 
come again flip, now we got some action 
on and on is the name that they gave me 
and your misery came here to save me

Just live and let die 
Check, check, check, comon 
If you could take a minute of your life 
A certain minute when you feel the lightning strike 
Danger is the only level of that moment 
But it's your moment and you know you'll fucking own it. 
Glorified in the grace by your victory 
When your done, you escape without memory 
Blindfolded through this life as we learn 
And consequences when the wrong pages turn 
It's an E! true hollywood story 
Take a man down with his own glory 
Now guess who's next 
At some point we come down from the highs 
It's no big deal we move on with our lives ?????? 
And some of us let the last color cries ????? 
Do the math, you can laugh when I die 
If life is just a fantasy life then could you 
Live this fantasy life for soemthing would you 
Just remember that the ??? are not posable 
And the mother fucking heroes are dispsable 
It's an E! true hollywood story 
Take a man down with his own glory 
Now guess who's next 
It's an E! true hollywood story 
Take a man down with his own glory

So what about the hardcore that ain't hard anymore 
Or the shit talkers who ain't shit anymore 
Or the old fighters that can't fight anymore 
Or the white kid's who ain't white any more 
Or the actors that don't act anymore 
Or the rappers that don't rap anymore 
Or the hipsters that don't hip anymore 
Or the limpsters that don't limip anymore

You can know that mine aches too 
And when you run away 
I run away like you 
I run away like you, I do 
But you know theres a part of me that will always let you down 
And you know theres a part of me that will always make you cry 
And you know theres a part of me that just wont let you die

I surrender into you, I do 
Keep surrendering to you, I do, I do

And slightly obsessed with falling too deep 
And malfunction, you're a virus 
Who's intention is fucking up something 
You're a crater 
On the face of a problem much greater 
It's the violence, or lack thereof control 
Body and soul, digging a hole 
Is the blood stainless? 
Enjoy the pain with accepting your grief 
Are you finished? 
Dumb fucking question, 
don't let yourself fall asleep 
Ressurect the intention 
Once your vision 
is now mass-produced, 
Imagine the insults a blessing 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Just imagine accepting the truth 
Imagine accepting the truth 
The pendulum swinging 
Hypnosis is taking control, now you linger 
On a shadow of a doubt 
Have you really figured what you're all about? 
Don't trust your instincts 
Just open the chamber 
where you keep those darkest regrets 
All the things you've done wrong 
Rebellious at heart all along 
Is your leader a voice? 
Somehow you replaced 
all your game with a debt 
Now the payback's a bitch 
Why owe your life to a bitch? 
Absolutely pathetic 
And regret it 
when told you are made of mistakes 
Imagine the insults a blessing 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Imagine accepting the truth 
Now speak to your leader! 
Now speak to your leader! 
Your father who art in heaven 
Hallowed be thy name, 
Deliver us from evil, 
deliver us from evil 
Your father who art in heaven 
Hallowed be thy name, 
Deliver us from evil, 
deliver us from evil 
Our father who art in heaven 
Hallowed be thy name, 
Deliver me from evil, 
deliver me from evil 
Our father who art in heaven 
Hallowed be thy name, 
Deliver me from evil, 
deliver me from evil

1 2 1 2 what the fuck ya gonna do? 
You know I see right through you 
When you act like you don't know me 
You lie, you cheat 
You steal, you lose 
wouldn't wanna be in your shoes 
Always lookin over your shoulder 
For the ones you stick 
You sick little prick 
It looks like your times runnin out 
Creepin up your back 
So whatchu all about? 
I'm too fuckin' good 
And fuckin' proud 
I'm gonna show you how 
Bad it hurts to be a clown 
You're the kind of guy with two faces 
Just another life that's wasted 
Here's a little fact 
You do me like that 
End up in the back of my trunk in a sack 
You'd better keep your hands off 
What's mine or anybody else's 
When you're selfish 
Your wealth is 
All you crave from the cradle to the grave 
I'm too fuckin' good 
And fuckin' proud 
I'm gonna show you how 
Bad it hurts to be a clown 
I got a little bitty question 
Just what the fuck are you thinkin? 
You think you're all that and then some 
Well you're not 
I think you're dum ditty dumb 
I take it back 
Those thoughts are kinda whack 
Don't really need that kind of karma on the track 
Maybe Freddy Krueger will step into your dream and 
Burn you like a demon and leave your ass screamin 
To be exact I wanted to react 
Mission of attack 
Your head was gettin cracked 
But you're a human bein 
That's lucky to be breathin 
And that's that 
that's that 
I don't trust anybody 
Cuz nobody trust me 
Never gonna trust anybody 
And that's the way its gonna be 
I'm too fuckin' good 
And fuckin' proud 
I'm gonna show you how 
Bad it hurts to be a clown.</field>

I make fight music for high school kids 
I put lives at risk when I drive like this 
from a slip disk from a Limp Bizkit disk 
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts 
so I get pissed and cant pick which wrist to slit 
little rich kids in cribs dont attempt this shit 
so step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch 
so I says to the girl I'm like what up girl 
shut up girl, showed her a cut up squirrel 
she screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her 
slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer 
I moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon (yo baby) (what are you on?) 
I looked at 'em both and I was like look 
check this out toots I'm lookin for Cookie Puss 
I need to speak to him immediately 
they played my video on MTV last week 
and just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some 
here comes Fred Durst 
Fred: yo Shady let me get someone 
who knows what galaxy I came from 
one where a bass drum hung from my high chair 
now I'm a nightmare you stay right there 
I got the fever for the flavor of a single 
see me and Shady I think we got it locked down 
shocked by the sound I got you crusin' with your top down 
these two blondes I offered them both a drink 
and this you would think could get the party started 
but instead the girls turned their heads 
opened up their mouth it smelled like somebody farted 
so it was time for me to move on 
Shady said the living room was a dance floor so turn me loose I was 
cuttin' the rug with this chick 
bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick 
ramblin' on about how, how he was gonna kill me wow! 
I spilled a drink on his shirt 
but no he insisted we should go 
before I could drop him 
Shady had to clock him 
the music stopped 
the party stood in shock 
I looked around grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf. 
Chorus: 
Turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose 
this party's goin our way 
or no way at all, [why dont you] 
Eminem: Turn me loose you better 
tell them to come reshingle the roof cuz 
just keep givin' me free drinks 'til I puke 
then Fred will ask me to lead sing in his group 
I'm sittin at the bar and I'm not being approached 
cuz Fred's over there stealin all of my ho's (yo Fred save me some) 
I walked to these siamese twins 
and asked to have a threesome 
told them two heads are better than one 
plus I respect how ya'll roll 
together as one got a slap in the teeth 
and a kick in the groin stood up like (wait where are you goin?) 
o well three strikes and i'm out 
and I just struck out (edited) times 
in a row (ow) I ain't cryin no more fuck it 
I'm chillin did a shot of jeager fell asleep 
on the ceiling. 
Fred: who knows what galaxy I came from 
one where a bass drum hung from my 
high chair now im a nightmare you stay right

Go! 
I stare into space and hope we're not alone 
Am i searching for something that's better than home?

Stress is tremendous and pressure is endless 
No one on this planet like me to be friends with 
I've been working so hard 
I've been working so hard 
I'm underneath the sun 
And i'm underneath the gun 
I'm losing my mind and i know there's no remedy 
I've become a failure who's living on memories 
I've been working so hard 
Loneliness can't be cured with no medicine 
Look to the stars so they'll straighten my head again 
I've been working so hard 
I've been working so hard

Such a fool to take the blame and run away 
Sometimes 
I beat up myself, i 
Lock my own way, i 
Cloud all my thoughts 
Please go away 
Oh, nevermind me 
I'm checking out now 
And won't ever come back 
Now that my life doesn't exist 
Yeah, you're right, how do it feel to be right, knowing that i was wrong? 
Nothing is right when you're wrong (2x) 
Yeah, i'm underneath the sun 
And i'm underneath the gun

Always 'til the end 
No one knows me better than myself 
Just how far I go to keep you safe 
The legacy is much deeper than my wealth 
It lies within this miniature I've made 
And he tells me 
He tells me I'm not alone 
Yeah, he tells me 
He tells me I'm not alone 
He's my son 
My beautiful boy 
My very best friend 
I'm begging you God, don't ever take him away 
Until the end 
I'll be your daddy 'til the end 
Until the end 
I'll always be here for you 
Until the end 
I'll be your daddy 'til the end 
Until the end 
Always 'til the end 
[Solo] 
He's my son 
My beautiful boy 
My very best friend 
I'm begging you God, don't ever take him away 
Until the end 
I'll be your daddy 'til the end 
Until the end 
I'll always be here for you 
Until the end 
I'll be your daddy 'til the end 
Until the end 
Always 'til the end

Down in a hole there are so many ways 
To find yourself some light 
It' always the miracles keep waiting all you like 
Ain't got no time to waste I know the end is near 
And if I run away I'll always end up here 
Walking away from the things I adore 
Telling the truth for once I'm sure 
It's always a sign when you feel yourself bleed 
I'm walking away from all I need 
I can't escape the tragedy that always brings me down 
If I could eliminate those things that make me frown 
Take all the baggage that follows me around 
And just disintegrate burn it to the ground 
Walking away from the things I adore 
Telling the truth for once I'm sure 
It's always a sign when you feel yourself bleed 
I'm walking away from all I need 
I'm walking away! 
Guitar solo 
Walking away! 
Walking away from the things I adore 
Telling the truth for once I'm sure 
It's always a sign when you feel yourself bleed 
I'm walking away from all I need 
I'm walking away!</field>

Strapped with the flow like a gatlin blow 
Walk with a limp it's the pirate pimp 
On a nightmare track (with a stack of gold?) 
Stuck like a psycho white bred hybrid 
Ninnies? gets plucked from your eye lid 
Get that? yall better come quick, better come fast 
I'ma drop a match in ya gas BOOM 
Every hit don't lie, pitch you a fit when your shit don't fly 
Eat you alive, got that punk, spit this fire to the bizkit funk 
Uno, Dos, trace of ya face, Catch me a case when you run from the ghost 
With a cup and a click one little slip 
the alligator grip gonna turn you to toast 
So why try, if ya gonna die 
You're goin straight to the gate in the sky 
With all the hate I relate to the crime 
one more sucka emcee gonna fry 
So why try, if ya gonna die 
You're goin straight to the gate in the sky 
With all the hate I relate to the crime 
one more sucka emcee gonna fry 
Round 2, stagger to your feet 
homies in ya corner thought ya done went to sleep 
this one oughta do it, so step it on back 
Or you can see the stars when ya knocked out flat 
I'ma tell ya something ya probably never knew 
Tangle with the lion you gonna end up in the zoo 
Check out all ya crew lookin in my cage 
It's feedin time playa I'ma eat you like a plague 
Times are gettin tough but I aint had enough 
this heavy metal beatin' on ya brain is gonna crush 
Oh what a rush, like a million women 
Sour on the crush with all of you lemons 
Maybe I'm a twisted but man it's just the bizkit 
Having me some fun with you dumb little tricklets 
you know who you are, you insecure gorillas 
the underdog freddy d now became ya killa 
So why try, if ya gonna die 
You're goin straight to the gate in the sky 
With all the hate I relate to the crime 
one more sucka emcee gonna fry 
So why try, if ya gonna die 
You're goin straight to the gate in the sky 
With all the hate I relate to the crime 
one more sucka emcee gonna fry 
I'ma rock it like some tnt blow it up like a G with a dolla bill 3 
All ya g's with the fleas c'mon please don't lie fuck with me and you'll fry 
So why try, if ya gonna die 
You're goin straight to the gate in the sky 
With all the hate I relate to the crime

So why try, if ya gonna die 
You're goin straight to the gate in the sky

Why do we die? 
Why do we die? 
Slow down 
You wonder how I've been, you ain't been checking in 
Just hope my vital signs will send me home again 
My baby's in the grass, Jesus on the dash 
I drive myself insane just hoping I can stay 
My so-called life is so good 
Why do we die? 
Why do we die? 
Slow down 
Slow down, Slow down, Slow down 
When deserts turn into floods, water gets covered with mud 
No magic coffing today, not today

No magic coffing today, not today

Everybody that hates 
Before it's too late 
So proud to be free 
But who can we blame 
Don't be ashamed 
Do you think we can change 
How I wish 
How I wish you were here 
We're one lost soul swimming in a fish bowl 
Year after year 
Running over the same old ground 
What have we found 
The same old fears 
Wish you were here 
We don't need 
Need anymore pain 
We just need to remain on the very same page 
So much to gain 
No more losing a friend 
We're losing ourselves 
We just need your help

So glad you're here</field>

No more excuses no lies 
You're stories endin'

            <field name="lyrics">It starts with 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time 
All I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 
It's so unreal 
Didn't look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know 
I wasted it all 
just to watch you go 
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried 
It all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a 
memory of a time when 
I tried so hard and got so far 
But in the end, it doesn't even matter 
I had to fall to lose it all 
But in the end it doesn't even matter 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to remind myself how 
I tried so hard 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I'm surprised it got so [far] 
Things aren't the way they were before 
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then 
But it all comes back to me [in the end] 
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried 
It all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a 
memory of a time when 
I tried so hard and got so far 
But in the end, it doesn't even matter 
I had to fall to lose it all 
But in the end it doesn't even matter 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
for all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
for all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
I tried so hard and got so far 
But in the end, it doesn't even matter 
I had to fall to lose it all 
But in the end it doesn't even matter</field>

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface

Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
Become so tired 
So much more aware 
I'm becoming this 
All I want to do 
Is be more like me 
And be less like you 
Can't you see that you're smothering me 
Holding too tightly 
Afraid to lose control 
'Cause everything that you thought I would be 
Has fallen apart right in front of you 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I can't feel you there

I may end up failing too

You were just like me

Who cares if one more light goes out?

In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh

Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel 
(Nothing to lose) 
Just stuck, hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own 
And the fault is my own 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
What I thought was never real 
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long

I want to find something I've wanted all along

And I've got nothing to say 
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face 
(I was confused) 
looking everywhere only to find that it's 
Not the way I had imagined it all in my mind. 
(So what am I) 
What do I have but negativity 
Cause I can't justify the way 
everyone is looking at me 
(Nothing to lose) 
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own 
And the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
Like I'm close to something real 
I want to find something I've wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 
I will never know 
Myself until I do this on my own 
And I will never feel 
Anything else until my wounds are healed 
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me 
And I will break away 
I'll find myself today

What I thought was never real 
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long

I won't be ignored(2x) 
Time won't heal 
This damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
I can't feel 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored.</field>

Take me down to the fighting end 
Wash the poison from off my skin 
Then show me how to be whole again 
Fly me up on a silver wing 
Past the black, where the sirens sing 
Warm me up in the nova's glow 
And drop me down to the dream below 
'Cause I'm only a crack 
In this castle of glass 
Hardly anything there for you to see 
For you to see 
Bring me home in a blinding dream 
Through the secrets that I have seen 
Wash the sorrow from off my skin 
And show me how to be whole again 
'Cause I'm only a crack 
In this castle of glass 
Hardly anything there for you to see 
For you to see 
'Cause I'm only a crack

As explosions broke in the sky 
All that I needed 
Was the one thing I couldn't find 
And you were there at the turn 
Waiting to let me know 
We're building it up 
To break it back down 
We're building it up 
To burn it down 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
The colors conflicted 
As the flames climbed into the clouds 
I wanted to fix this 
But couldn't stop from tearing it down 
And you were there at the turn 
Caught in the burning glow 
And I was there at the turn 
Waiting to let you know 
We're building it up 
To break it back down 
We're building it up 
To burn it down 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
You told me yes 
You held me high 
And I believed when you told that lie 
I played soldier, you played king 
And struck me down when I kissed that ring 
You lost that right to hold that crown 
I built you up but you let me down 
So when you fall, I'll take my turn 
And fan the flames as your blazes burn 
And you were there at the turn 
Waiting to let me know 
We're building it up 
To break it back down 
We're building it up 
To burn it down 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
When you fall, I'll take my turn 
And fan the flames as your blazes burn 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
When you fall, I'll take my turn 
And fan the flames as your blazes burn 
We can't wait

Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary 
Wish that I could slow things down 
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic 
And I drive myself crazy 
Thinking everything's about me 
Yeah I drive myself crazy 
Cause I can't escape the gravity 
I'm holding on 
Why is everything so heavy 
Holding on 
So much more than I can carry 
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down 
If I just let go, I'd be set free 
Holding on 
Why is everything so heavy 
You say that I'm paranoid 
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me 
It's not like I make the choice 
To let my mind stay so fucking messy 
I know I'm not the center of the universe 
But you keep spinning round me just the same 
I know I'm not the center of the universe 
But you keep spinning round me just the same

Like opening the wound 
I'm picking me apart again 
You all assume 
I'm safe here in my room 
Unless I try to start again 
I don't want to be the one 
The battles always choose 
Cause inside I realize 
And I'm the one confused 
I don't know what's worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
I don't know why I instigate 
And say what I don't mean 
I don't know how I got this way 
I know it's not alright 
So I'm 
Breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit 
Tonight 
Clutching my cure 
I tightly lock the door 
I try to catch my breath again 
I hurt much more 
Than anytime before 
I had no options left again 
I don't want to be the one 
The battles always choose 
Cause inside I realize 
That I'm the one confused 
I don't know what's worth fighting for

I don't know why I instigate

I don't know how I got this way 
I'll never be alright 
So I'm 
Breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit 
Tonight 
I'll paint it on the walls 
Cause I'm the one at fault 
I'll never fight again 
And this is how it ends 
I don't know what's worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
But now I have some clarity 
To show you what I mean 
I don't know how I got this way 
I'll never be alright 
So I'm breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit

But memories left abandoned 
There was nowhere to hide

And the ground caved in 
Between where we were standing

Something in here's not right today 
Why am I so uptight today? 
Paranoia's all I got left 
I don't know what stressed me first 
Or how the pressure was fed 
But I know just what it feels like 
To have a voice in the back of my head 
It's like a face that I hold inside 
A face that awakes when I close my eyes 
A face watches every time I lie 
A face that laughs every time I fall 
(And watches everything) 
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is hearing me 
Right underneath my skin 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
I know I've got a face in me 
Points out all my mistakes to me 
You've got a face on the inside too and 
Your paranoia's probably worse 
I don't know what set me off first 
But I know what I can't stand 
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is 
I can't add up to what you can 
But everybody has a face that they hold inside 
A face that awakes when they close their eyes 
A face that watches everytime they lie 
A face that laughs everytime they fall 
(And watches everything) 
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is watching you too 
Right inside your skin 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
The face inside is right beneath your skin 
The face inside is right beneath your skin 
The face inside is right beneath your skin 
The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me 
The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me 
(The Sun) 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within

I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be

(No, no turning back now)

I remember what they taught to me 
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be 
Remember listening to all of that and this again 
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in 
And now you think this person really is me 
And I'm trying to bend the truth

Battle symphony 
Please just don't give up on me 
And my eyes are wide awake 
For my battle symphony 
For my battle symphony 
They say that I don't belong 
Say that I should retreat 
That I'm marching to the rhythm 
Of a lonesome defeat 
But the sound of your voice 
Puts the pain in reverse 
No surrender, no illusions 
And for better or worse 
When they turn down the lights

Shining with the light from the sun 
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming 
The moon's going to owe it one 
It makes me think of how you act to me you do 
Favors and then rapidly you just 
Turn around and start asking me about 
Things that you want back from me 
I'm sick of the tension 
Sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest 
I wanna be in another place 
I hate when you say you don't understand 
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and 
Step on people like you do 
And run away all the people I thought I knew 
I remember back then who you were 
You used to be calm used to be strong 
Used to be generous but you should've known that you'd 
Wear out your welcome now you see 
How quiet it is all alone I'm so 
Sick of the tension sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest I'm so

This is not the beginning 
Just a voice like a riot 
Rocking every revision 
But you listen to the tone 
And the violent rhythm 
Even though the words sound steady 
Something empty's within em 
We say yeah 
With fists flying up in the air 
Like we're holding onto somenthing 
That's invisible there 
Cause we're living at the mercy 
Of the pain and the fear 
Until we dead it 
Forget it 
Let it all disappear 
Waiting for the end to come 
Wishing I had strength to stand 
This is not what I had planned 
It's out of my control 
Flying at the speed of light 
Thoughts were spinning in my head 
So many things were left unsaid 
It's hard to let you go 
I know what it takes to move on 
I know how it feels to lie 
All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what I haven't got 
Sitting in an empty room 
Trying to forget the past 
This was never meant to last 
I wish it wasn't so 
I know what it takes to move on 
I know how it feels to lie 
All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what I haven't got 
What was left 
When that fire was gone 
I throught it felt right 
But that right was wrong 
All caught up in the eye of the storm 
And trying to figure out 
What it's like moving on 
And I don't even know 
What kind of things I said 
My mouth kept moving 
And my mind went dead 
Picking up the pieces 
Nowhere to begin 
The hardest part of ending 
Is starting again 
All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what I haven't got 
This is not the end 
This is not the beginning 
Just a voice like a riot 
Rocking every revision 
But you listen to the tone 
And the violent rhythm 
Even though the words sound steady 
Something emptys within them 
We say yeah 
With fists flying up in the air 
Like we're holding onto something 
That's invisible there 
Cause we're living at the mercy 
Of the pain and the fear 
Until we dead it 
Forget it 
Let it all disappear</field>

Sayin' everything I've said before 
All these words they make no sense 
I found bliss in ignorance 
Less I hear the less you say 
You'll find that out anyway

Everything you say to me 
[Takes me one step closer to the edge] 
And I'm about to break 
I need a little room to breath, 
[Because I'm one step closer to the edge,] 
I'm about to break 
I find the answers aren't so clear 
Wish I could find a way to disappear 
All these thoughts they make no sense 
I found bliss in ignorance 
Nothing seems to go away

Another day's been laid to waste 
In my disgrace 
Stuck in my head again 
Feels like I'll never leave this place 
There's no escape 
I'm my own worst enemy... 
I've given up! 
I'm sick of feeling 
Is there nothing you can say? 
Take this all away 
I'm suffocating 
Tell me, what the fuck is wrong 
with me? 
I don't know what to take 
Thought I was focused 
but I'm scared 
I'm not prepared 
I hyperventilate 
Looking for help, 
somehow, 
somewhere 
And no one cares 
I'm my own worst enemy... 
I've given up 
I'm sick of feeling 
Is there nothing you can say? 
Take this all away

Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time 
Hand grenade pins in every line 
Throw 'em up and let something shine 
Going out of my fucking mind 
Filthy mouth, no excuse 
Find a new place to hang this noose 
String me up from atop these roofs 
Knot it tight so I won't get loose 
Truth is, you can stop and stare 
Run myself out and no one cares 
Dug the trench out, laid down there 
With a shovel up that'll reach somewhere 
Yeah, someone pour it in 
Make it a dirt dance floor again 
Say your prayers and stomp it out 
When they bring that chorus in 
(Chester Bennington) 
(Chorus) 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away 
(Mike Shinoda) 
I bleed it out, go, stop the show 
Drop your words and let sloppy flow 
Shotgun, opera, lock and load 
Cock it back and then watch it go 
Mama, help me, I've been cursed 
Death is rollin' in every verse 
Candy paint on his brand new hearse 
Can't contain him, he knows he works 
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie 
Doesn't matter how hard I try 
Half the words don't mean a thing 
And I know that I won't be satisfied 
So I try ignoring him 
Make it a dirt dance floor again 
Say your prayers and stomp it out 
When they bring that chorus in 
(Chester Bennington) 
(Chorus) 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, I've opened up these scars 
I'll make you face this 
I've pulled myself so far 
I'll make you face this now 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

Thank you, thank you, thank you 
You far too kind 
Haha 
Uh, yeah 
Ready? 
Let's go 
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? 
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy 
So, for one last time, I need y'all to roar 
Now, what the hell are you waiting for? 
After me, there shall be no more 
So, for one last time, nigga, make some noise 
Get 'em, Jay 
Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that 
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at 
Can't none of y'all mirror me back 
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G 
Rap in his prime 
I'm young H.O.: Rap's Grateful Dead 
Back to take over the globe-now break bread 
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express 
Out the country but the blueberry still connect 
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck 
But when you young what the fuck you expect? (yep, yep) 
Grand openin'-grand closin' 
God damn, your man Hov cracked the can open again 
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen? 
Just draw off inspiration 
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him (him) 
With cheap imitations for these generations 
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? 
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy 
So, for one last time, I need y'all to roar 
Now, what the hell are you waiting for? 
After me, there shall be no more 
So, for one last time, nigga, make some noise 
What the hell are you waiting for 
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you 
Knew if I paid my dues how will they pay you? 
When you first come in the game they try to play you 
Then you drop a couple of hits 
look how they wave to you 
From Marcy to Madison Square 
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah) 
As fate would have it Jay's status appears 
To be at an all-time high-perfect time to say goodbye 
When I come back like Jordan wearin' the four-five 
It ain't to play games with you 
It's to aim at you-probably maim you 
If I owe you I'll blow you to smithereens 
Cocksucka', take one for your team 
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing) 
I came, I saw, I conquered 
From record sales to sold-out concerts 
So mo'fucka', if you want this encore 
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore 
I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
Feeling so faithless 
Lost under the surface 
Don't know what you're expecting of me 
Put under the pressure 
Of walking in your shoes 
[Caught in the undertow/ 
Just caught in the undertow] 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
[Caught in the undertow/ 
Just caught in the undertow] 
And every second I waste is more than I can take 
I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
Become so tired 
So much more aware 
I'm becoming this 
All I want to do 
Is be more like me 
And be less like you 
I've become so numb 
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (more) 
I've become so numb 
So, for one last time, I need y'all to roar 
One last time, I need y'all to roar</field>

I got lots of friends, 
so I don't need pets

Ernie got wasted and bert went flat 
They got kicked out and they can't come back

They're standing outside 
Singing supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 
Yeah, they're standing outside singing

Waiting for a light that never comes 
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh 
Waiting for a light that never comes 
When I was young, they told me, they said 
Make your bed, you lie in that bed 
A king can only reign 'til instead 
There comes that day it's 'off with his head' 
Night gets darkest right before dawn 
What don't kill you makes you more strong 
You'll have my mercy, then when you're gone

We stood on the wall 
We laughed at the sun 
We laughed at the guns 
We laughed at it all 
And when they 
They told us to go 
We paid them no mind 
Like every other time 
But little did we know 
Today 
I looked for a sign 
With flames in my hands 
A line in the sand 
Between yours and mine 
And it came 
Like fire from below 
Your greed led the call 
My flag had to fall 
But little did you know 
Another day, your truth will come 
You're gonna pay for what you've 
Pay for what you've done 
You'll get what's yours, and face your crime 
You'll tell them give me back what's mine 
Give me back what's mine! 
I had never been a coward 
I had never seen blood 
You had sold me an ocean 
And I was lost in the flood 
We were counting on a leader 
We were driven by need 
But couldn't take temptation 
And we were blinded by greed 
You were steady as a sniper 
We were waiting on a wire 
So we never saw it coming 
When you ran from the fire 
You can try intimidation 
And you can try to ignore 
But when the time comes calling 
Yeah, you are gonna get yours 
Another day, your truth will come 
You're gonna pay for what you've 
Pay for what you've done 
You'll get what's yours, and face your crime 
You'll tell them, give me back what's mine 
Give me back what's mine 
And so today, your truth has come 
You're gonna pay for what you've 
Pay for what you've done 
You'll get what's yours, you're out of time 
And you will give me back what's mine 
Give me back what's mine 
Give me, give me back what's mine 
Give me, give me back what's mine 
What's mine 
Give me, give me back what's mine 
What's mine 
What's mine 
Give me back what's mine

We stood on the wall

Shining with the light from the sun 
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming 
The moon's going to owe it one

Favors and then rapidly you just 
Turn around and start asking me about

I'm sick of the tension 
Sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest 
I wanna be in another place 
I hate when you say you don't understand 
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and 
Step on people like you do 
And run away all the people I thought I knew 
I remember back then who you were 
You used to be calm used to be strong 
Used to be generous but you should've known that you'd 
Wear out your welcome now you see 
How quiet it is all alone I'm so 
Sick of the tension sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest I'm so

In darkness, 
Lying with the gun across his chest. 
Pretending, 
He's heartless, 
As the fire flashes in the sky. 
He was fragile, 
And frozen, 
When the bullet took away his friend. 
And now he's somehow, 
More broken. 
He's pulling his weapon to his side, 
Loading it full of his goodbyes, 
Holding an enemy across the line. 
He's pulling his weapon to his side, 
Loading it full of his goodbyes, 
Holding an enemy across the line. 
Sweating, 
And shaking, 
Lying with her hands across her chest. 
She wakes with, 
Her cravings, 
As the fire flashes in her eye. 
She was fragile,

When the needle took away her friend,

Loading it full of her goodbyes, 
Holding an enemy across the line. 
With every battle he's chosing, 
With every fight he's losing, 
His enemy's not far behind. 
With every promise she's broken, 
With every lie she's spoken, 
Her enemy's not far behind. 
It's your time. 
It's your time. 
It's your time. 
It's - your - TIME! 
He's pulling his weapon to his side, 
Loading it full of his goodbyes, 
Holding an enemy across the line. 
She's pulling her weapon to her side, 
Loading it full of her goodbyes, 
Holding an enemy across the line. 
With every battle he's chosing, 
With every fight he's losing, 
His enemy's not far behind. 
With every promise she's broken, 
With every lie she's spoken, 
Her enemy's not far behind.</field>

Uh 
So whatcha waiting for? 
Anticipating more 
Why you debate what it can take to instigate a war? 
Yeah I've been hating on the time I wasn't hated for 
There's nothing they can fucking say 
They didn't say before 
But you could never see it, your battle's not mine 
Wanna skate and play it safe 
But this takes a shot time 
You're waiting for a purpose, I already got mine 
While you tell me step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4! 
And if I do what you demand 
You say 
You'll let me understand 
You say 
You're gonna hold me to your word 
And if I sell myself away 
You say 
I"ll have no debt to pay 
You say 
I'm gonna get what I deserve 
Woah 
You word 
Obey 
My debt 
Repaid 
Our trust 
Betrayed 
All for nothing 
All for nothing 
Came back, there's no other way to say it 
So let me break this fucker down for ya 
I really don't know ya 
You're talk, but let me show you 
Where to put your paranoia 
Your're joking 
I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw yah 
I'm disgusted wonder 
What's gonna make you tuck your tail below ya 
And no I'm not your soldier 
I'm not taking any orders 
I'm a five star general infantry controller 
Need a lesson, let me show you 
Have you checking your composure 
While I make you step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4! 
And if I do what you demand 
You say 
You'll let me understand 
You say 
You're gonna hold me to your word 
And if I sell myself away 
You say

Disjointed heart 
I've got no commitment 
To my own flesh and blood 
Left all alone 
Far from my home 
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart, I 
Keep it locked up inside 
Cannot express 
To the point I've regressed 
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed, I 
Keep it locked up inside 
Keep me a distance from your lies 
It's too late to love me now 
You helped me to show me 
It's too late to love me now 
You don't even know me 
Breaking a part of my heart 
to find release 
Taking you out of my blood 
to bring me peace 
Breaking a part of my heart 
to find release 
Taking you out of my blood 
to bring me peace 
Breaking a part of my heart 
to find release (break) 
Taking you out of my blood 
to bring me peace (me) 
Breaking a part of my heart 
to find release (too) 
Taking you out of my blood 
to bring me peace 
Keep it locked up inside 
Keep me a distance from your lies 
Breaking a part of my heart 
To find release (break) 
Taking you out of my blood 
To bring me peace (me) 
Breaking a part of my heart 
To find release (too) 
Taking you out of my blood 
To bring me peace 
Breaking a part of my heart 
To find release 
Taking you out of my blood 
To bring me peace 
Breaking a part of my heart 
To find release 
Taking you out of my blood 
To bring me peace 
Keep me a distance 
Keep me a distance 
Keep me a distance 
Keep me a distance 
Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness 
Cryptic colloquialism shifts your midrift 
Dark all I do embark the shadows 
Involved with my thought catalog, 
analogue, rap catalog 
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, 
hurt by persistance 
The twisted web of tangled lies 
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste 
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes 
Against the state of being 
Feeling the weight - less -ness pressed between the ceiling 
Reeling around room 
Riding a bubble of sound proof 
It's the frequency making you 
Sha-shake with every boom 
Involuntary muscle contraction 
Ignoring and drinking 
musical gas field euphoria 
The sound pounds to make the dead flush 
To have you a head rush 
with red thoughts and said stuff</field>

Never know a word that I'm saying 
So the only thing to keep the blood flowing 
Is to let you know I'm not playing 
I'mma see your lies exposed 
I'mma see the justice done 
I'mma see the sun come back 
I'mma see the kingdome come 
Take it where it can't come back 
Take it where the shadows been 
Take it to the breaking point 
Take it to the end 
Saying that the end is near 
God, you have no idea 
Used to be afraid, but now 
Only thing I fear is fear 
This is where the line gets drawn 
Something that you've always known 
This is what you're hiding from 
True colors that are yours to own 
Give me back the fire I had 
Give me back the faith I lost 
Give me back the trust you broke 
Give me back the pride it cost 
Take the venom out of my blood 
Take the pain you put me in 
Take it when I tell you so 
Take it to the end</field>

I guess thing aren't the same anymore

He got crazy and I did too

Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block, 
Half-cocked nearly half the time 
Give it back, give it back, give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it 
One time for the words divine, 
And two times for the things 
that you hope you never have to say 
Three scenes in a dead man's dream, 
And the girls tell the boys 
that they better fucking run away 
Live it up, or g-g-give it up, turn it up, tune it out, 
Let it rhyme with the other line

And a long memory 
I been searching for an answer 
Always just out of reach 
Blood on the floor 
Sirens repeat 
I been searching for the courage 
To face my enemies 
When they turn down the lights 
I hear my battle symphony 
All the world in front of me 
If my armor breaks 
I'll fuse it back together 
Battle symphony 
Please just don't give up on me 
And my eyes are wide awake 
For my battle symphony 
For my battle symphony 
They say that I don't belong 
Say that I should retreat 
That I'm marching to the rhythm 
Of a lonesome defeat 
But the sound of your voice 
Puts the pain in reverse 
No surrender, no illusions 
And for better or worse 
When they turn down the lights 
I hear my battle symphony 
All the world in front of me 
If my armor breaks 
I'll fuse it back together 
Battle symphony 
Please just don't give up on me 
And my eyes are wide awake 
If I fall 
Get knocked down 
Pick myself up off the ground 
If I fall 
Get knocked down 
Pick myself up off the ground 
When they turn down the lights 
I hear my battle symphony 
All the world in front of me 
If my armor breaks 
I'll fuse it back together

You're wasting your talent, Randy 
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right... 
Why does it look like night today? 
Something in here's not right today 
Why am I so uptight today? 
Paranoia's all I got left 
I don't know what stressed me first 
Or how the pressure was fed 
But, I know just what it feels like 
To have a voice in the back of my head 
It's like a face that I hold inside 
A face that awakes when I close my eyes 
A face that watches every time they lie 
A face that laughs every time they fall 
(And watches everything) 
So I know that, when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is hearing me 
Right underneath my skin. 
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right... 
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em 
Cause I don't fucking need 'em 
Take 'em out the 'hood, keep 'em lookin' good 
But I don't fucking feed 'em 
First time they fuss I'm breezing, talking about: What's the reason? 
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word bitch 
Better trust and believe him 
In the cut where I keep 'em 
Til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts 
Then it's, beep, beep and I'm pickin 'em up 
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck 
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs 
Divorce him and split his bucks 
Just because you got good head, I'm gonna break bread 
So you can be livin' it up? Shit I.. 
Parts with nothin', y'all be frontin' 
Me give my heart to a woman? 
Not for nothin', never happen I'll be forever mackin' 
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion 
I got no patience 
And I hate waitin'... 
Hoe get yo' ass in

Better lock that kid up 
Face full of teeth when he hock that spit up 
Pacing the beat like a beast 
Rocking the block on repeat 
Speak from the cut like a rush of blood 
Paint red on the sleeves of the ones you love 
Lay the sick ones down and the bells will ring 
Put pennies on the eyes let the dead men sing 
I shiver and shake the warm air cold 
I'm alone on my own 
In every mistake I dig this hole 
Through my skin and bones 
It's harder starting over 
Than never to have changed 
With Blackbirds following me 
I'm digging out my grave 
They close in, swallowing me 
The pain, it comes in waves 
I'm getting back what I gave 
I sweat through the sheet as daylight fades 
As I waste away 
It traps me inside mistakes I've made 
That's the price I pay 
It's harder starting over 
Than never to have changed 
With Blackbirds following me 
I'm digging out my grave 
They close in, swallowing me 
The pain, it comes in waves 
I'm getting back what I gave 
I drop to the floor like I did before 
Stop watching 
I'm coughing 
I can't be more 
What I want and what I need are at constant war 
Like a well full of poison 
A rotten core 
The blood goes thin 
The fever stings 
And I shake from the hell that the habits bring 
Let the sick ones down 
The bells will ring 
Put pennies on the eyes 
Let the dead men sing 
With Blackbirds following me 
I'm digging out my grave 
They close in, swallowing me 
The pain, it comes in waves

You push it back down / You push it back down 
No / you'll never get it inside 
Push it back down 
Black out 
Blood in your eye 
You say that it's not your fault 
And swear that I am mistaken 
You said it's not what it seems 
No remorse for the trust you're breaking 
You run but then back you fall 
Suffocate in the mess you're making 
You can't get enough you take 
And take and take and take and take 
Fuck it 
Are you listening? 
No / you've gotta get it inside

No / you'll never get it inside

No / you'll never get it inside 
Push it back down 
Black out 
Blood in your eye 
Floating down / as colors fill the light 
We look up from the ground / in fields of paperwhite 
And floating up / you pass us in the night 
A future gazing out / a past to overwrite 
So come down / far below 
We've been waiting to collect the things you know 
Come down / far below 
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go 
Come down

Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time 
Hand grenade pins in every line 
Throw 'em up and let something shine 
Going out of my fucking mind 
Filthy mouth, no excuse 
Find a new place to hang this noose 
String me up from atop these roofs 
Knot it tight so I won't get loose 
Truth is, you can stop and stare 
Run myself out and no one cares 
Dug the trench out, laid down there 
With a shovel up that'll reach somewhere 
Yeah, someone pour it in 
Make it a dirt dance floor again 
Say your prayers and stomp it out 
When they bring that chorus in 
(Chester Bennington) 
(Chorus) 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away 
(Mike Shinoda) 
I bleed it out, go, stop the show 
Drop your words and let sloppy flow 
Shotgun, opera, lock and load 
Cock it back and then watch it go 
Mama, help me, I've been cursed 
Death is rollin' in every verse 
Candy paint on his brand new hearse 
Can't contain him, he knows he works 
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie 
Doesn't matter how hard I try 
Half the words don't mean a thing 
And I know that I won't be satisfied 
So I try ignoring him 
Make it a dirt dance floor again 
Say your prayers and stomp it out 
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, I've opened up these scars 
I'll make you face this 
I've pulled myself so far 
I'll make you face this now 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

            <field name="lyrics">In the dark days, I'll part ways with the blame. 
Trying to maintain, but it's still all the same 
It's all a game. 
Hear my name in the rain and the pain, I'm wearing my face with a tear stain 
Your faint fondness, honestly it's time to give you a piece of my mind and show you that you're blind. 
And in the design of the world I called "mine" know that you can't stand on both sides of the line. 
Everything is my fault 
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame) 
The problems have two faces 
Everything is my fault 
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame) 
The problems have two faces 
Everything is my fault 
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame) 
The problem's have two faces 
Pass all the blame over to me, it will come eventually 
Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly 
With my eyes shut, I'm seeing the truth in your words 
They're absurd, slurred into beauty to be heard 
You swim through deceit, the lies that you tell 
The stories you sell, knowing you well, I keep distance 
And every instance you keep your thoughts concealed 
What I feel, just another spoke in the wheel 
Kneel here or nothing, thrown down and trembled by your ego 
And eaten away by my own version of the real 
Everything is my fault 
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame) 
The problems have two faces 
Everything is my fault 
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame) 
The problems have two faces 
Pass all the blame over to me, it will come eventually 
Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly 
(Who's to blame?) 
Nothing, thrown down 
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame) 
Trampled by your heel 
(Play the game and win a tear stain) 
Eaten by my own 
(Pass the blame cause you'll feel it if you don't) 
Version of the real 
Nothing, thrown down 
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame) 
Trampled by your heel 
(Play the game and win a tear stain) 
Eaten by my own 
(Pass the blame cause you'll feel it if you don't)

Like opening the wound 
I'm picking me apart again 
You all assume 
I'm safe here in my room 
Unless I try to start again 
I don't want to be the one 
The battles always choose 
Cause inside I realize 
And I'm the one confused 
I don't know what's worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
I don't know why I instigate 
And say what I don't mean 
I don't know how I got this way 
I know it's not alright 
So I'm 
Breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit 
Tonight 
Clutching my cure 
I tightly lock the door 
I try to catch my breath again 
I hurt much more 
Than anytime before 
I had no options left again 
I don't want to be the one 
The battles always choose 
Cause inside I realize 
That I'm the one confused 
I don't know what's worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
I don't know why I instigate 
And say what I don't mean 
I don't know how I got this way 
I'll never be alright 
So I'm 
Breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit 
Tonight 
I'll paint it on the walls 
Cause I'm the one at fault 
I'll never fight again 
And this is how it ends 
I don't know what's worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
But now I have some clarity 
To show you what I mean 
I don't know how I got this way 
I'll never be alright 
So I'm breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit

I go insane on bubbles

            <field name="lyrics">The cycle repeated 
As explosions broke in the sky 
All that I needed 
Was the one thing I couldn't find 
And you were there at the turn 
Waiting to let me know 
We're building it up 
To break it back down 
We're building it up 
To burn it down 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
The colors conflicted 
As the flames climbed into the clouds 
I wanted to fix this 
But couldn't stop from tearing it down 
And you were there at the turn 
Caught in the burning glow 
And I was there at the turn 
Waiting to let you know 
We're building it up 
To break it back down 
We're building it up 
To burn it down 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
You told me yes 
You held me high 
And I believed when you told that lie 
I played soldier, you played king 
And struck me down when I kissed that ring 
You lost that right to hold that crown 
I built you up but you let me down 
So when you fall, I'll take my turn 
And fan the flames as your blazes burn 
And you were there at the turn 
Waiting to let me know 
We're building it up 
To break it back down 
We're building it up 
To burn it down 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
When you fall, I'll take my turn 
And fan the flames as your blazes burn 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
When you fall, I'll take my turn 
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

The blood of innocents burning in the skies 
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea 
And poured it out in an ocean of debris 
Oh 
I'm swimming in the smoke 
Of bridges I have burned 
So don't apologize 
I'm losing what I don't deserve 
What I don't deserve. 
We held our breath when the clouds began to form 
But you were lost in the beating of the storm 
But in the end, we were made to be apart 
Like separate chambers of the human heart 
No 
I'm swimming in the smoke 
Of bridges I have burned 
So don't apologize 
I'm losing what I don't deserve 
It's in the blackened bones 
Of bridges I have burned 
So don't apologize 
I'm losing what I don't deserve 
What I don't deserve 
I'm swimming in the smoke 
Of bridges I have burned 
So don't apologize 
I'm losing what I don't deserve 
The blame is mine alone 
For bridges I have burned 
So don't apologize 
I'm losing what I don't deserve

Do I follow my instincts blindly? 
Do I hide my pride behind these bad dreams 
And give into sad thoughts 
that are maddening? 
Do I sit here and try to stand it? 
Or do I try to catch them red-handed? 
Do I trust someone and get fooled by phoniness? 
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? 
Because I can't hold on when 
I'm stretched so thin 
I make the right moves but I'm lost within 
I put on my daily facade but then 
I just end up getting hurt again

(to anything watching everything spin) 
With thoughts of failure sinking in 
If I turn my back I'm defenseless 
And to go blindly seems senseless 
If I hide my pride and let it all go on 
(then they'll) 
Take from me till everything is gone 
If I let them go I'll be outdone (but if I) 
Try to catch them I'll be outrun 
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer 
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

I'm so afraid

All she wants to do is get rid of this hell

He can't be told 
Says he's got it all under control 
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with 
But in reality 
It would be a problem to just quit 
An addict; and he can't hold the reins 
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same 
Tries to slow down the problem he's got 
But can't get off the carousel 
until he makes it stop 
He can only fool himself for so long 
He can only fool himself for so long 
He can only fool himself for so long

She demanded her respect 
Twenty years of falling underfoot 
Twenty reasons to regret 
You would look for what you couldn't see 
Scared to be what she became 
She would tell you what you couldn't be 
It's why you had yourself to blame 
Alone again 
You tried to disappear 
And hold it in 
Pretending not to hear 
This voice without a sound 
Voice that tears you down 
You're trying not to fear 
Saying this is in your head 
But it whispers in your ear 
Saying this is what you get 
She was ready with your penalty 
When eventually you'd fall 
She was there inside your memory 
Saying this was all your fault 
Alone again 
You tried to disappear 
And hold it in 
Pretending not to hear 
This voice without a sound 
Voice that tears you down 
You're trying not to fear

Why does every good thing have to end?

I changed, a man I thought I'd never be 
I've burned every bridge before it began 
I swear, I'm gonna change 
Here, I wait swimming in a sea of dark 
I'm lost in the current of my faults 
Here, I sink holding on with all I had 
The tide will rise I'm gonna own what's mine

Controlling 
I can't seem

My walls are closing in,

I've felt this way before, 
So insecure 
Crawling in my skin, 
These wounds they will not heal, 
Fear is how I fall, 
Confusing what is real, 
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me, 
Distracting, reacting, 
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection, 
It's haunting, 
How I can't seem,

My walls are closing in,

Alright now, wasn't that fun?

I'm gonna leave you baby 
I'm gonna tie you up 
To the railroad tracks 
Gonna tie you up 
To the railroad tracks 
I'm gonna tie you up 
Leave you down there 
By the railroad tracks 
When the train comes by 
It's gonna take you away 
Yeah</field>

My motivation is gone before you even came 
Today, yesterday it both seem the same 
And no matter how I try i just can't change 
Give me one reason i should go outside 
Everything will be the same no matter how what i try 
Some people will live, some people will die 
Some people will build their whole life on a lie 
I used to blame you for the things that i thought you would say 
So now i can't blame you for going away 
Cause these memories of the blood beating under my skins 
Repeating the same thoughts again and again 
Again and again 
Said we couldn't last long enough for be strong enough 
Again and again 
Said our voices weren't loud enough 
And we've had enough because 
We want our future back 
We want our own mistakes 
To take our own path 
We want to do it again 
Again and again 
Said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough 
Again and again 
Said our voices weren't loud enough 
And we've had enough because 
We want our future back 
We want our own mistakes 
To take our own path 
We want to do it again 
Again and again 
Said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough 
Again and again 
Said our voices weren't loud enough 
And we've had enough because 
We want our future back 
We want our own mistakes 
To take our own path 
We want to do it again</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I have a dream 
Of a scene between the green hills 
Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed 
People don't talk about keeping it real 
It's understood that they actually will 
And intoxicated and stimulated emcees 
Staring in the trees 
Paranoid 
Are gone in the breeze 
Watch them flee 
Hip hop heads 
Take a walk with me 
And what you'll see is a land 
Where the sand's made of crushed up wax 
And the sky beyond you is krylon blue 
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme 
Emcees have left materialism behind them 
Meanwhile I just grip my mic 
And hope me and my team make it through alright 
Because say what you will 
And say what you might 
But don't ignore who it's for 
At the end of the night 
Because this is dedicated to the kids 
Dedicated to wherever music lives 
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same 
And dedicated to the people advancing the game 
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong 
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong 
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run 
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun 
I've seen a lot of shit 
I've talked to a bum out on sunset strip 
He asked me how would you feel 
If everybody acted like you didn't exist 
You'd lose your grip 
Probably eventually flip 
So let it be known 
The only reason that we do this 
Is so you can pick it up 
And just bang your head to it 
While emcees fight to see who could be the commonest 
We float overhead like a space odyssey monolith 
Overseeing the game 
Over being part of the same 
Old thing it's all gonna change 
In a hurricane of darkness and pain 
In acidic rain and promises you won't do it again 
Meanwhile I just grip my mic 
And hope me and my team make it through alright 
Because say what you will 
And say what you might 
But don't ignore who it's for 
At the end of the night 
Because this is dedicated to the kids 
Dedicated to wherever music lives 
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same 
And dedicated to the people advancing the game 
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong 
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong 
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run 
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun 
Pulling me close the shadow is warm inside 
This is where I feel at home 
this is my place to hide 
Pulling me close the shadow is warm inside 
This is where I feel at home 
this is my place to hide 
This is dedicated to the kids 
Dedicated to wherever music lives 
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same 
And dedicated to the people advancing the game 
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong 
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong 
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run 
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun 
This is dedicated to the kids 
Dedicated to wherever music lives 
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same 
And dedicated to the people advancing the game 
What's real everybody who doesn't feel safe 
What's real everybody who knows they're out of place 
What's real everybody with nowhere to run 
Who will hide from the shadows waiting for the sun</field>

Oh, whoa 
Sailing out away from this 
To ports of foreign shores 
Let us not forget to miss 
The ones we cannot hold 
Oh, whoa

When I pretend everything is what I want it to be 
I look exactly like what you always wanted to see 
When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am 
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can but 
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay I'm just 
(Trying to bend the truth) 
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be, so I'm

If you feeling like a pimp, go on, brush your shoulders off 
Ladies is pimps too, go on, brush your shoulders off 
This is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you, 
get that dirt off your shoulders 
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulders 
I probably owe it to y'all 
probably be locked by the force 
Tryin to hustle some things 
there I go with the porsch 
Feeling no remorse 
feeling like my hand was forced 
middle finger to the Law 
nigga, gripping my balls 
Said, the ladies they love me, 
from the bleachers they screaming 
all the ballers is bouncing 
they like the way I be leanin' 
all the rappers be hatin' 
off the track that I'm makin' 
but all the hustlers, they love it 
just to see one of us make it 
came from the bottom of bottom 
to the top of the pops 
nigga "LONDON" Japan 
and I'm straight up the block 
like a running back, get it man 
I'm straight off the block 
I could run it back nigga cuz I'm straight with the ROC 
If you feeling like a pimp, go on, brush your shoulders off 
Ladies is pimps too, go on, brush your shoulders off 
This is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you,

Ya homie holdin' position 
in the kitchen with soda 
i just whipped up a watch 
tryin to get me a rover 
tryin to stretch out the coka 
like a wrestler, yes sir 
keep the heckler close 
you know them smokers'll test ya 
but like, 52 cards went out 
im through dealing now 
52 bars come out 
now you feel 'em now 
52 cars roll out 
remove ceiling in case 
52 broads come out 
now you chillin with a boss bitch 
of course, SC on the sleeve 
at the forty-forty club 
ESPN on the screen 
I paid a grip for the jeans 
plus the slippers is clean 
no chrome on the wheels 
I'm a baller for real G 
I remember what they taught to me 
Remember condescending talk for who I ought to be 
Remember listening to all of that and this again 
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in 
And now you think this person really is me and I'm 
(Trying to bend the truth) 
Cuz the more I push the more I'm pulling away cuz I'm 
(Lying my way from you) 
No no turning back now 
(I wanna be pushed aside so let me go) 
No no turning back now 
(Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone) 
No turning back now 
(Anywhere on my own cuz I can see) 
No no turning back now 
(The very worst part of you) 
(The very worst part of you is ME) 
This isn't what I wanted to be, 
I never thought that what I said would 
have you running from me 
Like This 
This isn't what I wanted to be, 
I never thought that what I said would 
have you running from me

This isn't what I wanted to be,

But everything what it happened to it was unreal 
Therefore if the world where we live this no finish 
Then why to be worried about the time that already passed 
Then it does not look at for brings, 
and exactly thus it says me 
If the future has something that makes me to believe 
That everything in it has felt and has a solution 
That all the questions have reply 
And that everything of one day for the other 
goes to decide itself 
It says me where I go 
Shows to me what I cannot see 
Makes to speak me what I do not know 
Makes with that I breathe the air who I never breathed 
I make with that I feel the touch of the guitar 
Then it does not look at for brings, 
and exactly thus it says me 
If the gift has direction, 
if all pain that I am feeling was in vain 
That all can speak what to want 
that nothing goes to change this 
That I woke up of I dream where I age 
Only one spectator 
that only saw what it was happening 
at that moment of desperation and chaos 
The world this is of itself, 
then it shows my directions to me 
It says me where I go 
Shows to me what I cannot see 
Makes to speak me what I do not know 
Makes with that I breathe the air who I never breathed 
I make with that I feel the touch of the guitar 
Then it does not look at for brings, 
and exactly thus it says me 
If the past has some thing to have 
with that I am passing 
That if I to close the eyes will see 
as everything did not pass of a simple dream 
Where I could not wake up 
But now I already feel the blood to run in my veins 
He says me where I go 
Shows to me what I cannot see 
Makes to speak me what I do not know 
Makes with that I breathe the air who I never breathed

Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
Something has been taken 
From deep inside of me 
A secret I've kept locked away 
No one can ever see 
Wounds so deep they never show 
They never go away 
Like moving pictures in my head 
For years and years they've played 
Refrão 
If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
If I can take all the shame to the grave I would 
If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
If I can take all the shame to the grave I would 
It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
Sometimes I remember 
The darkness of my past 
Bringing back these memories 
I wish I didn't have 
Sometimes I think of letting go 
And never looking back 
And never moving forward so 
There'd never be a past 
Refrão 
If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would 
If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
If I can take all the shame to the grave I would 
Just washing it aside 
All of the helplessness inside 
Pretending I don't feel so misplaced 
Is so much simpler than change 
It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
It's easier to run 
(If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made) 
It's easier to go 
(If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
If I could take all the shame to the grave)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Hey yo 
When this first started off 
it was just Linkin Park 
But then in the middle 
Came Motion Man 
And at the end of it all 
It was Kutmasta Kurt with a remix 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time 
All I know, time was just slipping away 
And I watched it count down to the end of the day 
Watched it 
watch me and the words that I say 
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins 
I know that I didn't look out below 
And I watched the time go right out the window 
Tried to grab hold, tried not to watch 
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock 
But in the end no matter what I pretend 
The journey is more important that the end or the start 
And what it meant to me 
Will eventually be a memory of a time when 
I tried so hard 
I tried so hard and got so far 
But in the end it doesn't even matter 
I had to fall to lose it all 
But in the end it doesn't even matter 
Hey, yo 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time 
All I know, hah, I so-socialize 
Like the host of the party 
I spoke, shaked, and made eye-contact 
Partied and toasted strong, all that 
Northeast, southwest cost 
I'm staring out the window, 
no opportunity to mingle 
I tried to sew it up to weaken your system 
I had you throwing up 
I brought you back into things 
Like the imaginary man of your dreams 
You'd always seem to make it worth it 
I picked skin, I never nursed it 
You felt like loving, never played real 
I'm bringing the pleasure 
By any means it means I'm leaving your team 
Hell of a team, man it seems 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter

In The End

Remix 
One thing, I don't know how 
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now 
‘Cause when I designed this rhyme 
I was scared of it all 
Scared to fall, 
I hadn't even tried to crawl 
But I was forced to run with you mocking me 
Stopping me, backstabbing me constantly 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
Watch the clock now chock-full of hipocrisy 
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale 
Every single little thing you said to make things fail 
Every single word you sputtered just to get your peace 
But it really doesn't matter to me 
'Cause from the start to the end no matter what I pretend 
The journey is more important that the end or the start 
And what it meant to me 
Will eventually be 
a memory of a time when 
I tried so hard 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter</field>

And what I said still stuck in my head 
But mis-led thinking the things I do 
Would make you never wanna come back 
But an on-front attack 
So you could never run from that 
Being trapped in this beau 
Some that I never wanted to do 
But through it all you've got to see 
That where I want to be 
Is over the pen again 
Letting it out of me 
In the center of the day 
n a dream 
Seeing all my thoughts 
Getting lost in between 
Realizing one 
Not the way that it seems 
And the killing and the killer with a head full of screams 
I wanna live in another place 
Where no one can say that I live for them 
Start seeing it's not meant to be for me 
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
...starts... 
We're gonna be crushed 
When it all falls apart 
Knowing no matter how low 
Hoping that you won't know 
The strain it puts to me, seeing what you've done 
And consequently I've run away, just hidden again 
Within the boundaries of an anguish 
Don't Want me to say this 
But you're dragging me down 
Lost in the chaos 
Being tossed around 
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic 
Hope that some day you'll regret this 
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time 
Adding to the panic in my confine 
You try to take the best of me 
Go away 
Shut...up...why</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I am 
Little bit of loneliness 
A little bit of disregard 
A handful of complaints 
But I can't help the fact 
That everyone can see these scars 
I am 
What I want you to want 
What I want you to feel 
But it's like 
No matter what I do 
I can't convince you 
To just believe this is real 
So I let go 
Watching you 
Turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here 
Cause you're all that I got 
I can't feel 
The way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal 
This damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
I am 
A little bit insecure 
A little unconfident 
Cause you don't understand 
I do what I can 
But sometimes I don't make sense 
I am 
What you never want to say 
But I've never had a doubt 
It's like no matter what I do 
I can't convince you 
For once just to hear me out 
So I let go 
Watching you 
Turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here 
Cause you're all that I got 
I can't feel 
The way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal 
This damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Now 
Hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me 
Like it or not right now (2x) 
I can't feel 
The way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored(2x) 
Time won't heal 
This damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
I can't feel 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Back, before I said goodbye, 
Just as the first day turned to night, 
Just as the concrete turned to dust, 
And the steel turned into rust, 
All I could think was 
I need a way to dig through the damage, 
Couldn't think of a way to get through this, 
Now I see you takin advantage, 
And I found another reason to do this. 
I'm diggin us a hole to travel through, 
I wanna find a way to rattle you, 
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit, 
You're gonna have to follow me under it. 
Let go, it's begun, 
Close your eyes, I'm not done, 
Breathe a word, and waste your breath, 
And keep it up till there's nothing left. 
Now, that I said goodbye, 
Just as the darkness turned to light, 
Just as the next light turns to day, 
And the world gets underway, 
All I can see is the anticipation, 
Waiting to take this out on the wind and the raindrops, 
And I waited patiently taking it in, 
Ready for the first of the face offs. 
I'm diggin us a hole to travel through, 
I wanna find a way to rattle you, 
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit, 
You're gonna have to follow me under it. 
Let go, it's begun, 
Close your eyes, I'm not done, 
Breathe a word, and waste your breath, 
And keep it up till there's nothing left. 
I'm diggin us a hole to travel through, 
I wanna find a way to rattle you, 
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,

Nothing ever stops all these thoughts 
And the pain attached to them 
Sometimes i wonder why this is happening 
Its like nothing i can do will distract me when 
I think of how i shot myself in the back again 
Cause from the infinite words i could say 
I put all the pain you gave to me on display 
But didn't realize 
Instead of setting it free 
I took what i hated and made it a part of me 
Mike 
[it never goes away] 
[it never goes away] 
Chester 
And now 
You've become a part of me 
You'll always be right here 
You've become a part of me 
You'll always be my fear 
I can't separate myself from what i've done 
I've given up a part of me 
I've let myself become you 
Mike 
Hearing your name the memories come back again 
I remember when it started happening 
I'd see you in every thought i had and then 
The thoughts slowly 
found words attached to them 
And i knew as they escaped away i was 
Committing myself to them and every day I 
Regret saying those things cause now i see that I 
Took what i hated and made it a part of me 
Mike 
[it never goes away] 
[it never goes away]

And now 
You've become a part of me

Get away from me, gimme my space back 
You gotta just go 
Everything comes down to memories of you 
I've kept it in but now I'm letting you know 
I've let you go, so get away from me 
Gimme my space back 
You gotta just go 
Everything comes down to memories of you 
I've kept it in but now I'm letting you know 
I've let you go, so get away from me

I've let myself become you 
I've let myself become you 
I've let myself become lost inside

And suddenly tomorrow's moment washed away 
Cuz I don't have a reason and you don't have the time

For something we won't find 
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday 
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade 
We said it was forever 
But then it slipped away 
Standing at the end of the final masquerade 
The final masquerade 
All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep 
All you've ever wanted 
The truth I couldn't speak 
Cuz I can't see forgiveness, and you can't see the crime 
And we both keep on waiting for 
What we left behind 
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday 
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade 
We said it was forever

(again) 
Idon't want to show my face to the world today 
It's like two different people live inside of me 
(and you're so perfect) 
You left me living inside of this hole 
I, tearing away from my soul 
I, feel myself losing control 
I'm living for nothing 
What would it be like to live a day in your life 
I want to know 
Living for nothing 
I cannot deal with the way that I feel inside 
I've got to know 
Living for you 
I don't want to have to beg for another day 
All I ever really wanted was a chance to say 
That you're not perfect 
You left me living inside of this hole 
I, tearing away from my soul 
I, feel myself losing control 
I'm living for nothing 
What would it be like to live a day in your life 
I want to know 
Living for nothing 
I cannot deal with the way that I feel inside 
I've got to know 
Living for you 
I don't wanna show my face 
Show my face 
I don't wanna show my face 
Show my face 
You left me living inside of this hole 
I, tearing away from my soul 
I, feel myself losing control 
I'm living for nothing 
I cannot deal (I cannote deal) 
You left me all alone 
I cannot deal (I cannote deal) 
And I think for nothing 
I cannot deal (I cannote deal) 
You left me all alone

Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care (2x) 
There's a place so dark you can't see the end 
(Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend 
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions 
Forcefully, the power of suggestion 
Then with the eyes shut looking thought the rust and rottendust 
A small spot of light floods the floor 
And pours over the rusted world of pretend 
The eyes ease open and its dark again 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care 
In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 
Moving all around 
Screaming of the ups and downs 
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound 
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps past the 
Street lamps, chain-link, and concrete 
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn 
Floats on down the street till the wind is gone 
The memory now is like the picture was then 
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care (2x) 
In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 
Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I'm telling you that 
I see it right through you (7x) 
In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up (2x)</field>

It can't get no bigger than this 
Ma homie Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park 
Puttin' down with DJ Vice 
Let 'em know Mike! 
Let it begin with the stutter of light and short circuits 
Driven to givin' a minimal life more purpose 
Behind closed curtains 
I don't even exist 
this magic's created in the mirrors in the mist 
It's Mike Shinoda and DJ Vice at the same time 
Rhymes like rain that trickle down your main line 
And flood your streets over a high-tech beat 
To sneak two and full beats into turntable techniques 
I Don't sleep to dream 
I sleep to build stamina 
Energy to plant in advanced 
Get ya camera 
With these rhymes you better seal off the parameter 
One line and ya swimmin' off 
the south coast of Canada 
This is the sound 
Me and Vice in the cut 
Roughing it up 
Just incase you might get tough 
Nitrogen 'n' in my breath 
Just to light things up 
And DNA in every line 
So it's live enough 
DJ Vice!</field>

We're stuck in a place so dark you can hardly see 
The manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe 
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me 
I block out the sight of the powers that be 
And duck away into the darkness, times up 
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut 
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend 
And the eyes easy open and it's dark again

Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs 
I'm nauseated by the polluted rock that's all around 
Watching the wheels of cars 
that pass I look past 
To the last of the light and the long shadows it casts 
A window grows and captures the eye 
And cries out a yellow light as it passes me by 
And a young shadowy figure sits in front of a box 
Inside a building of rock with antennas on top 
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain 
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game 
And while the insides change the box stays the same 
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name 
The memories I keep are from a time like then 
I put on my paper so I could come back to them 
Someday I'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend 
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

I'm here at this podium talking, the ceremonial offerings 
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring 
(What's happening?) 
City governments are eternally napping 
Trapped in greedy convenants 
causing an urban collapsing 
Bullets that scar souls with dark holds 
Get more then your car stole, 
some hearts be blacker than charcoal 
(For real) This society's deprivation depends 
Not on our differences but the separation within 
No preparation is made, limited aid, and minimum wage 
Living in a tenement cage for innocent pay 
Tragedy within a parade 
The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague 
In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly

It was the junkyard crooked letter C-I-entific 
Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum 
Hear one, lalala loose, find me fearsome 
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone 
Testing the eight-hundred, eighteenth batallion 
Shallow the one who's cruise, run like rebels 
Enola Gay rhymes kicked the notch up a level 
In intensity, 
send back attacks that you sent to me 
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me 
MP3 versus R33 MCs 
Swiss cheese your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze 
We're MCs with enemy companies 
With my hand full of lyrics talking 'bout "you want these?" 
Please, don't even speak the name of channels 
And low gadget mic shit, put it down like pens 
For my friends and my fam' 
Let them dodge it around 
This mic shot through the back of an MC's hand 
With the strength that he had a bridge 
You don't want that, 
close body fields in hand to hand combat 
Battle cats, it's like the sectional speech 
warfare words, slash cords 
Compete for, and lyricals shots get rid of 
Don't question my intention when your butt gets kicked 
Trying to to see while I... 
Can you see it? 
I'll be here 
Teflon metallic syllabalic attacks 
Trying to see while I... 
If you see it 
I'll be here 
We harm MCs with these lyrically back smacks 
Why wait, I didn't look down my soul (8x) 
Trying to to see while I... 
Can you see it? 
I'll be here 
Teflon metallic syllabalic attacks 
Trying to see while I... 
If you see it 
I'll be here

Another day's been laid to waste 
In my disgrace 
Stuck in my head again 
Feels like I'll never leave this place 
There's no escape 
I'm my own worst enemy... 
I've given up! 
I'm sick of feeling 
Is there nothing you can say? 
Take this all away 
I'm suffocating 
Tell me, what the fuck is wrong 
with me? 
I don't know what to take 
Thought I was focused 
but I'm scared 
I'm not prepared 
I hyperventilate 
Looking for help, 
somehow, 
somewhere 
And no one cares 
I'm my own worst enemy... 
I've given up 
I'm sick of feeling

To the edge again 
Shaking, lonely, and I am drinking again 
Woke up tonight and no one's here with me

I'm dying tonight 
I'm giving in to you 
Watch me crumble 
I'm giving in to you 
I'm crying tonight

Caught up, in life 
Losing all my friends 
Family has tried, to heal all my addictions 
Tragic it seems, to be alone again

The stress has got me 
I'm giving in 
Giving 
Giving in now! 
Take me under

Pack it up and disappear 
You better have some place to go 
'Cause you can't come back around here 
Good goodbye 
(Don't you come back no more) 
Live from the rhythm, it's 
Something wild, venomous 
Enemies trying to read me 
You're all looking highly illiterate 
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix 
You won't find an equivalent 
I've been here killing it 
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot 
And it makes you so mad 
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you 
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one 
There's more than one of you 
And you can't understand the fact 
That it's over and done, hope you had fun 
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus 
Headed back where you're from 
So say goodbye and hit the road 
Pack it up and disappear 
You better have some place to go 
'Cause you can't come back around here

Good goodbye

Good goodbye

Goodbye, good riddance 
A period is after every sentence 
Did my time with my cellmate 
Maxed out so now we finished 
Every day was like a hail date 
Every night was like a hailstorm 
Took her back to my tinted windows 
Showin' out, she in rare form 
Wings up, now I'm airborne 
King Push, they got a chair for him 
Make way for the new queen 
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em 
Consequence when you ain't there for him 
Were you there for him? 
Did you care for him? 
You were dead wrong 
(Don't you come back no more) 
So say goodbye and hit the road 
Pack it up and disappear 
You better have some place to go 
'Cause you can't come back around here 
Good goodbye 
(hoooh) 
Good goodbye 
(Don't you come back no more) 
Good goodbye 
(hoooh) 
Good goodbye 
(Don't you come back no more) 
Let me say goodbye to my demons 
Let me say goodbye to my past life 
Let me say goodbye to the darkness 
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight 
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me 
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life 
And I still keep raising the bar like 
Never seen a young black brother 
in the chart twice 
Goodbye to the stereotypes 
You can't tell my kings we can't 
Mandem we're linking tings in parks 
Now I gotta tune with Linkin Park 
Like goodbye to my old hoe's 
Goodbye to the cold roads 
I can't die for my postcode 
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast 
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's gang 
So say goodbye and hit the road 
Pack it up and disappear 
You better have some place to go 
'Cause you can't come back around here 
Good goodbye 
(hoooh)

What you think we should be 
What the answers are 
What it is we can't see 
Tell us all again 
How to do what you say 
How to fall in line 
How there's no other way 
But ooh 
We all know 
You're guilty all the same 
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame 
You're guilty all the same 
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame 
You're guilty all the same 
Show us all again 
That our hands are unclean 
That we're unprepared 
That you have what we need 
Show us all again 
Cause we cannot be saved 
Cause the end is near 
Now there's no other way 
And ooh 
You will know

There's no one else to blame 
Guilty all the same 
Guilty all the same 
You're guilty all the same 
Yeah 
You already know what it is 
Can y'all explain what kind of land is this 
When a man has plans of being rich 
But the bosses plans is wealthy 
There'll be a money scheme 
A clean split is nonsense the same 
Even confidence is filthy 
They talk team,they take the paper route 
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty 
At anybody's expense, no shame 
With a clear conscience 
No regrets, they're guilt free 
Bu they claim that ain't the way that they built me 
Smoke screen before the flame 
Know as soon as they're gone the deal be 
say it's time for things to change 
Rearrange that good product we built cheap 
Anything is more to gain 
Drain, manipulated it like ''aw this is real deep'' 
Until no more remain, but I'm still me 
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio 
And record companies kill me 
Try to force me to strain it, no way 
You've got the gall to say 
"Yo how real could real be? " 
You feel me? 
Yeah we'll see 
If greed be to blame 
Greedy for the fame 
Tv or a name 
Media and the game 
To me you're all the same 
You're guilty 
You're guilty all the same 
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame 
You're guilty all the same 
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame 
There's no one else to blame

Hybrid 
I've been digging in the crates ever since I was living in space 
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits 
I mastered numerology, big band theology, 
performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology 
Invented the mic so I can start blessing it 
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist 
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I twist mic chords to double helixes 
to show them what I'm made of 
I buckle knees like leg braces 
cast a spell of instrumental-ness 
on all of you emcees who hate us 
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on 
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones 
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this 
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise 
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice 
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage 
Bringin you up and takin you down 
High voltage 
Comin at you from every side 
High voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
Akira 
I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones 
Never satisfied my rhymes jones 
Spraying bright day over what you might say 
My blood types krylon, technicolor type-A 
On highways write with road rage 
pages of wind, in cages a tin, that bounce all around 
Surround sound 
Devouring the scene 
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same-thing 
Sing-songs karaoke copy bullshit 
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics 
Forth dimension, combat convention 
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention 
Meant to put you away, with the pencil 
Pistol, official, sixteen line rhyme missile 
While you risk your all 
I pick out at your flaws 
Spitting raw blah, blah, blah you can say you saw 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage 
Bringin you up and takin you down 
High voltage 
Comin at you from every side 
High voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage 
Bringin you up and takin you down 
High voltage 
Comin at you from every side 
High voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
Who's the man, demandin' your hand over your land rover? 
no mans bolder when he jams your plans over 
I inflict sclerosis, the most ferocious 
When I spy my third eye's extremely high voltage 
That's why I need ruby-quartz glasses, cause when I glance 
There's a chance, then I might blast the masses 
Subliminals transmitted through piano 
Integrated in flow, calculated in nano 
I use skills when I need, please heed the rhyme 
I heal when I bleed when I proceed through time 
I walk through walls and the inanimate obstacles 
By inducing the reduction of cells and molecules 
I bring the knowledge you swallow a steak that's a hologram 
I box your head, fatten your lip like collagen 
The telepath deliver verses with no postage 
Pharoah Monch, Mike Shinoda, we high voltage 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound

Abandoned houses where the shadows lived 
I never been higher than I was that night 
I woke up driving my car 
I couldn't see then what I see right now 
The road dissolving like an empty vow 
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night 
I knew I took it too far 
All you said to do was slow down 
I remember, now I remember

I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, 
then I'm halfway right (halfway right) 
Told me "Kid, you're going way to fast 
You burn too bright, 
you know you'll never last" 
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now 
I woke up driving my car 
Said I'd lose you if I lost control 
I just laughed because what do they know? 
Here I am, standing all alone 
Because I took it too far

Lightweights step it aside when we come in. 
Feel it in your chest, 
The syllables get pumping. 
People on the street they panic and start running. 
Words on loose leaf sheet complete coming. 
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme 
I'm dumping. 
Healing the blind I promise to let the sun in. 
Sick of the dark ways 
we march to the drum and 
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping. 
Fuck that 
I wanna see some fist pumping. 
Risk something. 
Take back what's yours 
Say something that you know they might attack you for 
Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before. 
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for. 
Like this war's really just a different brand of war. 
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor. 
Like they understand you in the back of the jet 
When you 
Can't put gas in your tank. 
And these fuckers are 
Laughing their way to the bank 
Cashing the check 
Asking you to have compassion 
Have some respect. 
For a leader so nervous in obvious way 
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay 
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day 
In their living room laughing like 
What did he say? 
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen 
In my living room watching 
I am not laughing. 
Cause when it gets tense I know what might happen. 
The world is cold the bold men take action. 
Have to react to get blown into fractions. 
Ten years old, It's something to see another 
Kid my age drug under a jeep 
Taken and bound 
And found later under a tree 
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me. 
Do you see? 
The soldiers 
They're out today they 
Brush the dust from bulletproof vests away. 
It's ironic. 
At times like this you pray, 
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday. 
There's bombs in the buses 
Bikes 
Roads 
Inside your markets 
Your shops 
Your clothes 
My dad 
He's got a lot of fear I know 
But enough pride inside not to let that show. 
My brother had a book he would hold with pride 
A little red cover with a broken spine. 
On the back he hand wrote a quote inside: 
"When the rich wage war it's the poor who die" 
And meanwhile 
The leader just talks away 
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay 
The rest of the world watching at the end of the day 
Both scared and angry like 
What did he say? 
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen.

I can't seem to focus, 
It's hopeless unless the sky opens, 
Look you in the eyes and all I see is a blur hopin, 
That my previous mindstate; could be resurrected, 
To the old me; it's like you had me injected with imperfection, 
How could you be so reckless? I initially meant it, 
Seems like you put your effort into me, what am I left with? 
Nothin' but a canvas with a black and white portrait, 
Of me and you, in a burnin' garden of scorchin' orchids. 
Simple beauty that's bein torn down by your power, 
That constantly pounds on my soul hour after hour, 
Now I can hardly breathe, get rid of these memories, 
Continually haunting me, 
Cant change who I've come to be, 
The darkness only ends as soon as you open your eyes, 
And you hope to realize that hope is cloaked in disguise, 
Again I look you in the eyes and all I see is a blur, 
But when I look in the mirror I can see who you were. 
[Chester:] 
Nothing I can say or do, 
Will take away what I've been through, 
What you were is what I've come to be, 
Nothing you can say to me, 
Will take away these memories, 
What you were is what I've come to be! 
(what I've come to be x2)

Once I am inside, I'm lost and cant pretend, 
These pictures in my mind, are not a part of me,

Yeah I drive myself crazy

Holding on 
So much more than I can carry 
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down 
If I just let go, I'd be set free 
Holding on 
Why is everything so heavy 
You say that I'm paranoid 
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me 
It's not like I make the choice 
To let my mind stay so fucking messy 
I know I'm not the center of the universe

            <field name="lyrics">I don't like my mind right now 
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary 
Wish that I could slow things down 
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic 
And I drive myself crazy 
Thinking everything's about me 
Yeah I drive myself crazy 
Cause I can't escape the gravity 
I'm holding on 
Why is everything so heavy 
Holding on 
So much more than I can carry 
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down 
If I just let go, I'd be set free 
Holding on 
Why is everything so heavy 
You say that I'm paranoid 
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me 
It's not like I make the choice 
To let my mind stay so fucking messy 
I know I'm not the center of the universe 
But you keep spinning round me just the same 
I know I'm not the center of the universe 
But you keep spinning round me just the same 
I'm holding on 
Why is everything so heavy 
Holding on 
So much more than I can carry 
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down 
If I just let go, I'd be set free 
Holding on 
Why is everything so heavy 
I know I'm not the center of the universe 
But you keep spinning round me just the same 
I know I'm not the center of the universe 
But you keep spinning round me just the same 
And I drive myself crazy 
Thinking everything's about me 
I'm holding on 
Why is everything so heavy 
Holding on 
So much more than I can carry 
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down 
If I just let go, I'd be set free 
Holding on 
Why is everything so heavy 
Why is everything so heavy 
Why is everything so heavy

            <field name="lyrics">I've been digging in the crates 
Ever since I was living in space 
Before the rat race 
Before monkeys had human traits 
I mastered numerology, Big Bang theology 
Perfomed lobotomies with telekinetic psycology 
Invented the mic, so I could start blessing it 
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point 
Like an impressionist 
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I'll twist my cords like double helixes 
And show them what I'm made of 
I buckle knees like leg braces 
Cast the spell of instrumentalist 
On all of you emcees who hate us (So try on) 
Leave you without shoulder to cry on 
From now to infinity let icons be bygones 
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this 
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise 
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice 
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this 
Chorus: 
High voltage, this is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage, bringin' you up and takin' you down 
High voltage, comin' at you from every side 
High voltage, making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
(Akira) 
I've put a kink in the backbones 
Of clones, with microphones 
Never satisfied my rhymes jones 
Spraying bright day over what you might say 
My blood types krylon, technicolor type-A 
On highways ripe with road rage 
Pages of wind, in cages a tin 
That bounce all around (Surround sound) 
Devouring the scene 
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same-thing 
Sing-songs karaoke copy bullshit 
Break bones verbally 
With sticks and stones tactics 
Fourth dimension, combat convention 
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention 
Meant to put you away, with the pencil 
Pistol, official, sixteen line rhyme missile 
While you risk your all 
I pick out at your flaws 
Spitting raw blah, blah, blah 
You can say you saw 
Chorus (x2): 
High voltage, this is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage, bringin' you up and takin' you down 
High voltage, comin' at you from every side 
High voltage, making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
(x2) 
Sometimes I feel like a prophet 
Misunderstood, under the gun 
Like a new disease 
Chorus (x4):

I like to rock and rap, you know what I mean? 
People are acting like, you know, "wow that's a new invention" 
That shit thing, you know 
We're constantly evolving 
It is constantly changing (Sometimes) 
There's a world of change 
Everybody's always trying to put labels on it, there ain't no label for this 
shit 
They always gotta try to put a label on it 
Try to create something so they can water it down

            <field name="lyrics">Hit The Floor 
There are just too many 
Times that people 
Have tried to look inside of me 
Wondering what i think of you 
And i protect you out of courtesy 
Too many times that i've 
Held on when i needed to push away 
Afraid to say what was on my mind 
Afraid to say what i need to say 
Too many 
Things that you've said about me 
When i'm not around 
You think having the upper hand 
Means you've got to keep putting me down 
But i've had too many stand-offs with you 
It's about as much as i can stand 
So I'm waiting until the upper hand 
Is mine 
[refrão] 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not 
Watch it drop 
Making your heart stop 
Just before you hit the floor 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not 
Missed your shot 
Making your heart stop 
You think you won 
And then it's all gone 
So many people like me 
Put so much trust in all your lies 
So concerned with what you think 
To just say what we feel inside 
So many people like me 
Walk on eggshells all day long 
All i know is that all i want 
Is to feel like i'm not stepped on 
There are so many things you say 
That make me feel like you've crossed the line 
What goes up will surely fall 
And i'm counting down the time 
Cause i've had so many stand-offs with you 
It's about as much as i can stand 
So i'm waiting until the upper hand 
Is mine 
[refrão] 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not 
Watch it drop 
Making your heart stop 
Just before you hit the floor 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not 
Missed your shot 
Making your heart stop 
You think you won 
And then it's all gone(4x) 
Now it's all gone 
I know i'll never trust a single thing you say 
You knew your lies would divide us 
But you lied anyway 
And all the lies have got you floating 
Up above us all 
But what goes up has got to fall 
[refrão] 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not 
Watch it drop 
Making your heart stop 
Just before you hit the floor 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not 
Missed your shot 
Making your heart stop 
You think you won 
And then it's all gone(4x) 
Now is all gone</field>

To keep ya'll waiting 
This goes out to everybody still hating 
For those that fake / 
Ya'll can keep on fakin' 
I'm cooking a plate for you to 
Stick your whole face in 
Tastes good don't it cousin? 
Just so you know it's nothin' 
I get you buggin' like some codiene 
In some robutussin 
It's just the way that I approach each time 
I slap the track and turn around 
And choke each rhyme 
Broadcast to the nation like nbc 
With pages of 16s like an mpc 
Deliver an ass-whipping via mp3 
Giving you people more reality than mtv 
Do it ppv / 
Snap necks with the pressure 
Make a mess / 
Then carry you out on a stretcher 
You could sue but / 
Ooh the law won't protect ya 
Even the court room sketcher 
Could not sketch ya 
You're not following me / 
I got your number like 
Caller I.d 
/ try it / you can holler at me 
I promise you pain / 
I will chop your body in threes 
And you'll be sitting there stuttering / 
P-p-probabably 
Follow me / I got styles / 
You can copy one 
Back of your mind / 
I know you wanna stop me son 
But here's news for you fucker: 
that can not be done 
You can think that I'm finished I have not begun 
I'm grinding / 
Putting these kids to bed 
You think you're hard-boiled / 
Fucker you're an easter egg 
You got a pastel shell and a soft inside / 
Squash your pride 
You think I fucking lost my mind / 
I'm not playing 
I might as well be making a bomb 
I lay you down to foundation when I'm taking you on 
Bet the farm on the rhyme 
For the sake of my mom 
She's like / 
Mike show these pigs what kind of bacon you're on 
It's funny but don't laugh / 
Money with no cash 
The villain of vocab / 
I'm killing this notepad 
The realest I wrote man / 
You don't even know half 
I'm banking a full tank / 
You're running on low gas 
Take that / I'm cutting off your fun 
You're nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun 
We can dance but your chances are slim to none 
And you can think that I'm finished 
I have not begun 
Got a razor-blade tongue 
And I get this done 
No running just dumping on your clique for fun 
Machine shop got it locked 
like the game's a joke 
Say something funny get the whole gang provoked 
Better buckle down fucker / 
Go get your own 
We been working ten years 
Just to get this known 
The people on the block 
Starting to get numb 
They expect that its fresh 
When the new shit come 
Here it goes let em know they can fix the frown 
Railroad rap hot tracks running you down 
And they ask and repeat 
How I do this now 
Like I'm really gonna tell em how I get this sound 
We just do what we do give you that fix 
We come in the back like we run this bitch 
Turn the lights down low / 
And we start the show 
When I give it to ya / 
Give it right back and it goes 
Take that / take that / 
Cutting off your fun 
You're nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun 
We can dance but your chances are slim to none 
You can think that I'm finished I have not begun 
Follow me / 
I got styles / 
You can copy one 
Back of your mind / 
I know you wanna stop me son 
But here's news for you fucker: 
That can not be done 
You can think that I'm finished

Climbing through tomorrow

Into winter now bitter sweet 
And across that horizon, the sun is setting down 
You're forgetting now

And tell them I was alone 
Oh tell me I am the only one 
And there's nothing that can stop me

But hands beg me to stay. 
Your lips say that you love, 
Your eyes say that you hate. 
There's truth in your lies, 
Doubt in your faith. 
What you build you lay to waste. 
There's truth in your lies, 
Doubt in your faith. 
All I've got's what you didn't take. 
So I, I won't be the one, 
Be the one to leave this, 
In pieces. 
And you, you will be alone, 
Alone with all your secrets, 
And regrets. 
Don't lie. 
You promised me the sky, 
Then tossed me like a stone. 
You wrap me in your arms, 
And chill me to the bone. 
There's truth in your lies, 
Doubt in your faith. 
All I've got's what you didn't take. 
So I, I won't be the one, 
Be the one to leave this, 
In pieces. 
And you, you will be alone, 
Alone with all your secrets, 
And regrets. 
Don't lie. 
So I, I won't be the one, 
Be the one to leave this, 
In pieces. 
And you, you will be alone, 
Alone with all your secrets, 
And regrets. 
Don't lie.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">It starts with 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time 
All I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 
It's so unreal 
Didn't look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know 
I wasted it all 
just to watch you go 
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried 
It all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a 
memory of a time when 
I tried so hard and got so far 
But in the end, it doesn't even matter 
I had to fall to lose it all 
But in the end it doesn't even matter 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to remind myself how 
I tried so hard 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I'm surprised it got so [far] 
Things aren't the way they were before 
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then 
But it all comes back to me [in the end] 
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried 
It all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a 
memory of a time when 
I tried so hard and got so far 
But in the end, it doesn't even matter 
I had to fall to lose it all 
But in the end it doesn't even matter 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
for all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
for all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
I tried so hard and got so far 
But in the end, it doesn't even matter 
I had to fall to lose it all 
But in the end it doesn't even matter</field>

And multiplies til' you can taste the sun 
and burnt by the sky you try to take it from 
but if it falls, there's no place to run 
crumbling down 
it's so unreal 
they're dealing you in to determine your end 
and sending you back again, the places you've been 
and bending your will, till it breaks you within 
and still they 
fill their eyes 
with the twilight, through the skylight, in the highlights 
on a frame of steel 
see the brightness of your likeness as I write this on a pad with 
the way I feel 
hear the screaming, in my dreaming, as it seeming 
that you played your part 
like you're heartless take apart this in the darkness 
but I know that 
I tried so hard 
and got so far 
but in the end 
it doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
to lose it all 
but in the end 
it doesn't even matter 
I've looked down the line 
what's there and is not what ought to be 
held back by the battles they fought for me 
calling me to be part of their property 
and know I see that 
I get no chance 
I get no break 
fakes and snakes quickly lead to mistakes 
and as the tightrope within slowly starts to thin 
I can only hope that they 
close their eyes 
to the twilight through the skylight, in the highlights 
on a frame of steel 
see the brightness of your likeness, as I write this on a pad 
to the way I feel 
hear the screaming in my dreaming as it seeming 
that you played your part 
like you're heartless take apart this in the darkness 
but I know that 
I tried so hard 
and got so far 
but in the end

to lose it all 
but in the end 
it doesn't even matter 
I've put my trust in you 
pushed as far as I can go 
for all this, there's only one thing you should know 
I've put my trust in you ! 
pushed as far as I can go 
for all this, there's only one thing you should know 
I've put my trust.. 
in you 
pushed as far as I can go 
for all this.. 
there's only one thing you should know 
I've tried so hard

And in spite of all I should've done 
I was not mad at you 
I was not trying to tear you down

I was too scared to say out loud 
If I cannot break your fall 
I'll pick you up right off the ground 
If you felt invisible 
I won't let you feel that now

When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown 
With the cataclysm raining down, insides crying save me now 
You were there and possibly alone 
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation 
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known 
Remember all the sadness and frustration 
And let it go, let it go 
And in the burst of light that blinded every angel 
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars 
You felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space 
No one there to catch you in their arms 
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation 
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known 
Remember all the sadness and frustration 
And let it go, let it go 
Let it go 
Let it go 
Let it go 
Let it go 
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation 
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known

Hip-Hop hits 
And you do it like this 
It's goin' down (It's goin' down) 
It's goin' down (It's goin' down) 
It's goin' down (It's goin' down) 
It's goin' down 
It's goin' down 
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound 
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now 
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down 
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style 
The combination of a vocal caress 
With lungs that gasp for breath 
From emotional stress 
With special effects 
And a distorted collage 
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage 
Pre-Chorus: 
It's goin' down 
The logical progression on a the timeline 
The separation narrowed down to a fine line 
To blur the edges so they blend together properly 
Take you on an audible odyssey 
Now it's goin' down 
Chorus: 
Put it out for the world see 
LP and X-men to the 10th degree 
It's goin' down 
Nobody in the world to see 
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 
It's goin' down 
Put it out for the world see 
Me and x-men to the 10th degree 
It's goin' down 
Everybody in the world to see 
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 
It's goin' down 
Put put put it up 
And it goes like this 
And you do it like this 
It's goin' down 
Once again it is 
Composed sentences all together venomous 
The four elements of natural force 
Projected daily through the sound of the source 
Everybody on board with this blend 
The sword with the pen 
The mightiest is the weapons 
Swinging right from the chin 
The elevate of mental states 
Long gone with the wind 
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends 
It's going down 
Stalence emulation readily 
Trekking through the weaponry 
Of the pure pedigree 
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me 
Whatever the weather be 
We invent the steadily 
It's going down to sub-terrestrial high 
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots 
Execution of collaborative plots 
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop 
Pre-Chorus: 
It's going down 
A logical progression on a the timeline 
The separation narrowed down to a fine line 
To blur the edges so they blend together properly 
Take you on an audible odyssey 
Now, it's going down 
Chorus: 
Put it out for the world see 
Me and x-men to the 10th degree 
It's going down 
Everybody in the world to see 
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 
It's goin' down 
Put it out for the world see

Everybody in the world to see 
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA 
Was herbin' 'em in the home of the terrapins 
Got it dirt cheap for them 
Plus if they was short wit' cheese I would work wit' them 
Boy and we got rid of that dirt for them 
Wasn't born hustlers I was burpin' 'em 
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy 
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me 
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy 
Cops wanna knock me, D.A 
wanna box me in 
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky 
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me 
Therefore he doesn't exist 
So poof..

Yo, It starts with one thing... 
I don’t know why 
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
All I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 
It’s so unreal 
Didn’t look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on and didn’t even know 
I wasted it all just to watch you go 
I kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when 
I tried so 
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit 'em

with the fo'-fo' Faggots runnin' to the po-po's, 
smoke 'em like cocoa 
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload 
Fuck dat, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed 
Left holes through some guy clothes 
Stop your bullshittin', glock with the full clip 
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit 
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip 
See the nigga layin' shocked when the bullet hit 
And hey ma, how you, know nigga'z wanna buy you 
But see me I wanna fuck for free, like akinyele 
Take this ride 'til you feel it inside ya belly 
If it's tight get the k-y jelly 
All night get you wide up inside the telly 
Side to side, 'til you say jay-z you're too much for me 
I am 
A little bit of loneliness 
a little bit of disregard 
Handful of complaints 
but I can't help the fact 
That everybody can see these scars 
I am 
What I want you to want 
what I want you to feel 
But it's like no matter what I do 
I can't convince you 
To just believe this is real 
So I Let go watching you turn your back 
like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here cause your all that I've got 
Got a condo with nuttin' but condoms in it 
The same place where the rhymes is invented 
So all I do is rap and sex, 
imagine how I stroke 
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette? 
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a tec, 
never jam though 
Never get high, never run out of ammo 
Nigga'z hatin' 'n' shit cause I slayed your bitch 
You know your favorite, 
I know it made you sick 
And now you're, actin' raw 
but you never had war 
Don't know how to carry your hoe, 
wanna marry your hoe 
Now she's mad at me, cause your majesty, 
Just happened to be a pimp with a tragedy 
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked her friend 
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again 
I seen her tears as she busted in, 
I said 
"shit there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!" 
I am 
A little bit insecure a little unconfident 
Cause you don't understand I do what I can 
But sometimes I don't make sense 
I am 
What you never wanna say 
but I've never had a doubt 
It's like no matter what I do 
I can't convince you 
For once just to hear me out 
So I Let go 
watching you turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got 
I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal this damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Now 
Hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not 
Right now 
Hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not 
Right now

Uh, I give you what you came for / this is not the same though 
Got a different method but I still can bring the pain so 
Y'all stuck in that same flow / I got that insane flow 
High as y'all can get you're never really in my range though 
Yes I'm half anglo / half fried panko 
All prime-time rhymer / let the bass bang low 
All you fucking lames go / aiming at my name, know 
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for 
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for!

Crawling in my skin 
Without a sense of confidence, confidence, confidence 
Consuming, confusing 
Crawling in my skin 
Without a sense of confidence 
And I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take 
There's something inside me 
That pulls beneath the surface 
Crawling in my skin 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds they will not heal 
These wounds won't heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing, confusing what is real 
Confusing what is real 
There's something inside me that 
Pulls beneath the surface 
Consuming, confusing 
This lack of self-control 
I fear is never ending 
Controlling, I can't seem 
To find myself again 
My walls are closing in 
Without a sense of confidence 
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take 
I've felt this way before 
So insecure 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing what is real 
Discomfort endlessly 
Has pulled itself upon me 
Distracting, reacting 
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection 
It's haunting how I can't seem

Crawling in my skin 
These wounds they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing what is real

Fear is how I fall

you were so scared 
But no one would listen,

So if you're asking me 
I want you to know 
When my time comes forget

Help me leave behind 
Some reasons to be missed 
And don't resent me, 
and when you're feeling empty 
Keep me in your memory, 
leave out all the rest 
Leave out all the rest 
Don't be afraid I've taken my beating 
I've shared what I made 
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through 
I've never been perfect, but neither have you 
So if you're asking 
me I want you to know 
When my time comes forget 
the wrong that I've done 
Help me leave behind 
Some reasons to be missed 
Don't resent me, 
and when you're feeling empty 
Keep me in your memory, 
leave out all the rest 
Leave out all the rest 
Forgetting all the hurt inside 
You've learned to hide so well 
Pretending someone else can come 
And save me from myself 
I can't be who you are 
When my time comes forget 
the wrong that I've done 
Help me leave behind 
Some reasons to be missed 
Don't resent me, and 
when you're feeling empty 
Keep me in your memory, 
leave out all the rest 
Leave out all the rest 
Forgetting all the hurt inside

Saying that I softened 
I was ducking down to reload 
So you can save your 
petty explanations 
I don't have the patience 
Before you even say it, I know 
You let your pride or your ego 
Talk slick to me, no 
That is not the way I get down 
And look at how you lose your composure 
Now let me show you 
Exactly how the breaking point sounds 
I want to see you choke on your lies 
Swallow up your greed 
Suffer all alone in your misery 
Choke on your lies 
Swallow up your greed 
Suffer all alone in your misery 
What is it you want me to tell you? 
I'm not the failure 
I would rather live and let be 
But you came with the right kind of threat to 
Push me to let you 
Know you can't intimidate me 
You disrespect me so clearly 
Now you better hear me 
That is not the way it goes down 
You did it to yourself and it's over 
Now let me show you 
Exactly how the breaking point sounds 
I want to see you choke on your lies 
Swallow up your greed 
Suffer all alone in your misery 
Choke on your lies 
Swallow up your greed 
Suffer all alone in your misery 
I want to see you choke on your lies 
Swallow up your greed 
Suffer all alone in your misery 
Choke on your lies 
Swallow up your greed 
Suffer all alone in your misery 
You did it to yourself / 
you did it to yourself 
You did it to yourself / 
you did it to yourself 
You did it to yourself / 
you did it to yourself 
You did it to yourself / 
you did it to yourself

Will embrace the world in grey 
And the sun will set for you 
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation 
You build up hope of failures, all you've known 
Remember all the sadness and frustration 
And let it go, oh oh oh oh 
Let it go oh oh oh, oh

But can't begin to tell me how

Was there something I could say

Was I lost all along? 
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one? 
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one? 
Is there sunshine where you are? 
The way there was when you were here 
'Cause I'm just sitting in the dark 
In disbelief that this is real 
In disbelief that this is real

Never gonna be another one, no 
I followed 
So taken

Then sorrow 
Then sickness 
Then the shock when you flip it on me 
So hollow 
So vicious 
So afraid I couldn't let myself see 
That I could never be held 
Back or up no 
I hold myself 
Check the rep 
Yep you know mine well 
Forget the rest 
Let them know my hell 
There and back 
Yet my soul ain't sell 
Kept respect up 
The best they fell 
Let the rest be the tale they tell 
That I was there saying 
In these promises broken 
Deep below 
Each word gets lost in the echo 
So one last lie 
I can see through 
This time I finally let you 
Go 
Test my will 
Test my heart 
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up 
Ya'll go hard 
I go smart 
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh? 
I've seen that frustration 
Been crossed and lost and told no 
And I've come back 
Unshaken 
Let down and lived and let go 
So you can let it be known 
I don't hold back I hold my own 
I can't be mapped 
I can't be cloned 
I can't c-flat 
It ain't my tone 
I can't fall back I came too far 
Hold myself up and love my scars 
Let the bells ring wherever they are 
'Cause I was there saying 
In these promises broken 
Deep below 
Each word gets lost in the echo 
So one last lie 
I can see through 
This time I finally let you 
Go 
No 
You can tell 'em all now 
I don't back up 
I don't back down 
I don't fold up and I don't bow 
I don't roll over 
Don't know how 
I don't care where the enemies are 
Can't be stopped all I know go hard 
Won't forget how I got this far 
For every time saying 
In these promises broken 
Deep below 
Each word gets lost in the echo 
So one last lie 
I can see through 
This time I finally let you

I'm just trying to bend the truth 
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be 
So I'm 
Lying my way from you 
(No, no turning back now) 
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go 
(No, no turning back now) 
Let me take back my life 
I'd rather be all alone 
(No turning back now) 
Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see 
(No, no turning back now) 
The very worst part of you is me 
I remember what they taught to me 
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be 
Remember listening to all of that and this again 
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in 
And now you think this person really is me 
And I'm trying to bend the truth 
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away 
'Cause I'm

I let myself down again 
All because I run 
And silence splits me open I run 
And it puts me underground 
But there's no regret 
And no roads left to run</field>

I'm hanging off the edge 
Storm clouds gather beneath me 
Waves break above my head 
Headfirst hallucination 
I wanna fall wide awake now 
You tell me it's alright 
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight 
But nobody can save me now 
I'm holding up a light 
I'm chasing out the darkness inside 
'Cause nobody can save me 
Stared into this illusion 
For answers yet to come 
I chose a false solution 
But nobody proved me wrong 
Headfirst hallucination 
I wanna fall wide awake 
Watch the ground giving way now 
You tell me it's alright 
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight 
But nobody can save me now 
I'm holding up a light 
I'm chasing out the darkness inside 
'Cause nobody can save me 
Been searching somewhere out there 
For what's been missing right here 
(I wanna fall wide awake now) 
I've been searching somewhere out there 
For what's been missing right here 
(I wanna fall wide awake now) 
I wanna fall wide awake now 
So tell me it's alright 
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight 
And only I can save me now 
I'm holding up a light 
Chasing out the darkness inside 
And I don't wanna let you down 
But only I can save me! 
Been searching somewhere out there 
For what's been missing right here</field>

Coming, coming at you 
Coming, coming at you 
[Mike] 
[you] 
Peep the style and the kids checking for it 
The number one question is how could you ignore it 
We drop right back in the cut 
Over basement tracks 
With raps that got you backing this up like 
[rewind that] 
We're just rolling with the rhythm 
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division 
With these non-stop lyrics of life living 
Not to be forgotten 
But still unforgiven 
But in the meantime there are those who wanna 
Talk this and that / so I suppose 
That it gets to a that point feelings gotta get hurt 
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt 
[it goes] 
[Chester] 
Try to give you warning 
But everyone ignores me 
[Mike] 
[told you everything loud and clear] 
[Chester] 
But nobody's listening 
Call to you so clearly 
But you don't want to hear me 
[Mike] 
[told you everything loud and clear] 
[Chester] 
But nobody's listening 
[Mike] 
I got a 
Heart full of pain 
Head full of stress 
Handful of anger 
Held in my chest 
And everything left is a waste of time 
I hate my rhymes 
[but hate everyone else's more] 
I'm riding on the back of this pressure 
Guessing that it's better 
That I can't keep myself together 
Because all of this stress 
Gave me something to write on 
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on 
You never forget the blood sweat and tears 
The uphill struggle over years 
The fear and trash talking 
And the people it was to 
And the people that started it 
Just like you 
[Chester] 
Try to give you warning 
But everyone ignores me 
[Mike] 
[told you everything loud and clear] 
[Chester] 
But nobody's listening 
Call to you so clearly 
But you don't want to hear me 
[Mike] 
[told you everything loud and clear] 
[Chester] 
But nobody's listening 
[Mike] 
I got a 
Heart full of pain 
Head full of stress 
Handful of anger 
Held in my chest 
Uphill struggle 
Blood sweat and tears 
Nothing to gain 
Everything to fear 
Heart full of pain 
Head full of stress 
Handful of anger 
Held in my chest 
Uphill struggle 
Blood sweat and tears 
Nothing to gain 
Everything to fear 
Heart full of pain, heart full of pain, heart full of pain...

With arms up, stretched into the sky 
With eyes like, echoes in the night 
Hiding from the hell that you've been through 
Silent one, you.... 
Go, giving up your home

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface

Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
Become so tired 
So much more aware 
I'm becoming this 
All I want to do 
Is be more like me 
And be less like you 
Can't you see that you're smothering me 
Holding too tightly 
Afraid to lose control 
'Cause everything that you thought I would be 
Has fallen apart right in front of you 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I can't feel you there

And I know 
I may end up failing too 
But I know 
You were just like me 
With someone disappointed in you 
I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there

Thank you, thank you, thank you 
You far too kind 
Haha 
Uh, yeah 
Ready? 
Let's go 
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? 
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy 
So, for one last time, I need y'all to roar 
Now, what the hell are you waiting for? 
After me, there shall be no more 
So, for one last time, nigga, make some noise 
Get 'em, Jay 
Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that 
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at 
Can't none of y'all mirror me back 
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G 
Rap in his prime 
I'm young H.O.: Rap's Grateful Dead 
Back to take over the globe-now break bread 
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express 
Out the country but the blueberry still connect 
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck 
But when you young what the fuck you expect? (yep, yep) 
Grand openin'-grand closin' 
God damn, your man Hov cracked the can open again 
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen? 
Just draw off inspiration 
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him (him) 
With cheap imitations for these generations 
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? 
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy 
So, for one last time, I need y'all to roar 
Now, what the hell are you waiting for? 
After me, there shall be no more 
So, for one last time, nigga, make some noise 
What the hell are you waiting for 
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you 
Knew if I paid my dues how will they pay you? 
When you first come in the game they try to play you 
Then you drop a couple of hits 
look how they wave to you 
From Marcy to Madison Square 
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah) 
As fate would have it Jay's status appears 
To be at an all-time high-perfect time to say goodbye 
When I come back like Jordan wearin' the four-five 
It ain't to play games with you 
It's to aim at you-probably maim you 
If I owe you I'll blow you to smithereens 
Cocksucka', take one for your team 
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing) 
I came, I saw, I conquered 
From record sales to sold-out concerts 
So mo'fucka', if you want this encore 
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore 
I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
Feeling so faithless 
Lost under the surface 
Don't know what you're expecting of me 
Put under the pressure 
Of walking in your shoes 
[Caught in the undertow/ 
Just caught in the undertow] 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
[Caught in the undertow/ 
Just caught in the undertow] 
And every second I waste is more than I can take 
I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
Become so tired 
So much more aware 
I'm becoming this 
All I want to do 
Is be more like me 
And be less like you 
I've become so numb 
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (more) 
I've become so numb

One last time, I need y'all to roar</field>

We saw brilliance when the world was asleep 
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

In a sky of a million stars 
It flickers, flickers

If a moment is all we are 
We're quicker, quicker 
Who cares if one more light goes out? 
Well I do 
The reminders pull the floor from your feet 
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh 
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair 
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there

Wish I could find a way to disappear

There's nothing there to see 
Nothing but my own mistake 
Staring back at me 
I've lied to you 
The same way that I always do 
This is the last smile 
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you 
(Everything falls apart, 
even the people who never frown eventually break down. 
Everything has to end, 
we'll soon find that you're out of time left 
to watch it all unwind) 
For the sake of being with you 
(Everything falls apart, 
even the people who never frown 
eventually break down) 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
Why I stay when you just push away 
No matter what you see 
You're still so blind to me 
I've tried like you 
To do everything you wanted to. 
This is the last time 
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you 
(Everything falls apart, 
even the people who never frown eventually break down) 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie 
(Everything has to end, 
we'll soon find that you're out of time left 
to watch it all unwind) 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
Why I stay when you just push away 
No matter what you see 
You're still so blind to me 
Revert psychology is failing miserable, 
It's so hard to be left all alone. 
Telling you is the only chance for me, 
There's nothing left, but to turn and face you... 
When I look into your eyes 
There's nothing there to see 
Nothing but my own mistake 
Staring back at me and asking 
Why, 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie, 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
Why I stay when you just push away 
No matter what you see 
You're still so blind to me 
Why I stay when you just push away 
No matter what you see 
You're still so blind to me</field>

It's like a face that I hold inside 
A face that awakes when I close my eyes 
A face watches every time I lie 
A face that laughs every time I fall 
(And watches everything) 
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is hearing me 
Right underneath my skin 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
I know I've got a face in me 
Points out all my mistakes to me 
You've got a face on the inside too and 
Your paranoia's probably worse 
I don't know what set me off first 
But I know what I can't stand 
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is 
I can't add up to what you can 
But everybody has a face that they hold inside 
A face that awakes when they close their eyes 
A face that watches everytime they lie 
A face that laughs everytime they fall 
(And watches everything) 
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is watching you too 
Right inside your skin 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
The face inside is right beneath your skin 
The face inside is right beneath your skin 
The face inside is right beneath your skin 
The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me 
The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me 
(The Sun) 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
(I feel The light betray me - the sun) 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Part of me won't go away 
Everyday reminded how much I hate it 
Weighted against the consequences 
Can't live without it so it's senseless 
Wanna cut it out of my soul 
And just live with a gaping hole 
Take control of my life 
And wash out all the burnt taste 
I made the problems in the first place 
Hang my head low cause it's part of me 
You hardly see right next to the heart of me 
Hurting me, the routine scar 
New cuts cover where the old ones are 
And I'm sick of this 
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts 
that grate on my sanity 
I rather not even be then the man 
that's staring in the mirror through me 
Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what's killing me 
Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what's killing me 
Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what's killing me 
Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what's killing me 
I feel it everyday 
I feel I made my way 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
Swallowing me 
(how can it be frightening if you've never felt it) 
Once it's been dealt with 
you feel like you've been touched by something angelic 
And then melted down into a pool of peace 
Cease to be the animal you used to be 
Remove the broken parts 
you know were wrong 
And feel the karma when the problem's all gone 
And then you start to see 
another piece of yourself that you can't let be 
And that reason will last fight to free yourself 
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well 
And now you know you can choose 
to lose the part in your heart 
Where your insides bruise 
You can live if you're willing to 
Put a stop to just what's killing you 
Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what's killing me 
Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what's killing me 
Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what's killing me 
Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what's killing me 
I feel it everyday 
I feel I made my way 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
Swallowing me 
Alive in me, inside of me, 
A part of me screams away silently 
This part of me won't go away, 
Part of me won't go away 
Everywhere I look around 
I see how everyone aught to be 
Every time I see myself 
I see there's always something wrong with me 
I feel it everyday 
I feel I made my way 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
Swallowing me 
I feel it everyday 
I feel I made my way 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
Swallowing me 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me</field>

I hate when you say you don't understand 
I wanna be in the energy 
Not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
I watch how the 
Moon sits in the sky on a dark night 
Shining with the light from the sun 
If the sun doesn't give light to the moon, assuming 
The moon's going to owe it one 
It makes me think of how you act with me 
You do favors and then rapidly 
You just turn around and start asking me about 
Things that you want back from me 
I'am sick of the tension sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest 
I'm sick of the tension sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest 
I wanna be in another place 
I hate when you say you don't understand 
I wanna be in the energy 
Not with the enemy 
A place for my head

I hate when you say you don't understand 
I wanna be in the energy 
Not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
I wanna, i wanna I wanna, I wanna.... 
2, 2,3,3, yo, yo, yo 
Keep me in a john to keep me calm 
you and your mom keep all the dram 
used to be a team, pass that baton 
but you flop that bond when u drop that bomb 
take you to the john at babylon 
flushed down with the sound that you carry on 
i dont really give a dang you pissed on my lawn 
took a dump like a bum in a battle zone 
so sick of you stressin 
sick of you fessin 
sick of you actin like i owe you sum' 
find another place to feed your face 
if you dont, we gon bump, get it up, get crumb 
so sick of you stressin

            <field name="lyrics">If your having girl problems 
I feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me! 
He's got the rap patrol on the gat patrol 
Foes that wanna make sure his casket's closed 
Rap critics that say he's "money cash hoes" 
He's from the hood stupid what type of facts are those 
If you grew up with holes in your zapitos 
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' doe 
So fuck critics you can kiss our whole assholes 
You don't like our lyrics you can press fast forward 
Got beef with radio 
If we don't play they show 
They don't play our hits 
Well we don't give a shit, so 
All these mags trying to use our ass 
So advertisers can give em more cash 
For ads...fuckers 
I don't know what you take us as 
Or understand the intelligence that jay-z has 
From rags to riches nigga we ain't dumb 
We got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me! 
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If your having girl problems 
I feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
The year is '94 and in my trunk is raw 
In my rear view mirror is the mother fuckin' law 
I got two choices ya'll pull over the car or 
Bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor 
Now I ain't tryin to see no highway chase with jake 
Plus I got a few dollars 
I can fight the case 
So I...pull over to the side of the road 
And I heard "son do you know why I'm stoppin' you for?" 
Cause I'm young and I'm black 
and my hats real low 
Do I look like a mind reader sir, I don't know 
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo? 
"well you was doin fifty five in a fifty four" 
"liscense and regestration and step out of the car" 
"are you carryin' a weapon on you 
I know alot of you are" 
I ain't steppin' out of shit 
all my papers legit 
"do you mind if I look round the car a little bit?" 
Well my glove compartment is locked 
So is the trunk and the back 
And I know my rights 
so you gon' need a warrant for that 
"aren't you sharp as a tack you 
Some type of lawyer or something?" 
"or somebody important or somethin'?" 
Nah I ain't pass the bar but I know a little bit 
Enough that you won't 
illegally search my shit 
"well see how smart you are when the k-9's come" 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me! 
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If your having girl problems 
I feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me! 
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If your having girl problems 
I feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me! 
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If your having girl problems 
I feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Now once upon a time not too long ago 
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe 
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin' a pussy 
But a pussy havin no god damn sense, 
try and push me 
I tried to ignore him and talk to the lord 
Pray for him, cause some fools 
just love to perform 
You know the type loud as a motor bike 
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight 
The only thing that's gonna happen is im'ma get to clappin 
He and his boys gon be yappin to the captain 
And there I go traped in the kit kat again 
Back through the system with the riff raff again 
Fiends on the floor scratchin' again 
Paparazzi's with they cameras snappin' them 
D.a 
tried to give the nigga the shaft again 
Half-a-mile for bail 'cause I'm african 
All because this fool was harrasin' them 
Tryin to play the boy like hes saccarin' 
But ain't nothin sweet 'bout how I hold my gun 
I got 99 problems but this bitch ain't one 
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If your having girl problems 
I feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me 
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If your having girl problems 
I feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me 
Shut up when I'm talking to you 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up when I'm talking to you 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
I'm about to break 
Everything you say to me 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me! 
I need a little room to breathe 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me! 
Everything you say to me 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me! 
I need a little room to breathe 
I got 99 problems 
And I'm about to break</field>

You woke the devil

But you were careless to let it fall 
You held it all 
And I was by your side 
Powerless 
I watched you fall apart 
And chased you to the end 
I'm left with emptiness 
That words cannot defend 
You'll never know what I became because of you 
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

            <field name="lyrics">Why does it feel like night today? 
Something in here's not right today 
Why am I so uptight today? 
Paranoia's all I got left 
I don't know what stressed me first 
Or how the pressure was fed 
But I know just what it feels like 
To have a voice in the back of my head 
Like a face that I hold inside 
Face that awakes when I close my eyes 
Face that I watch every time I lie 
Face that laughs every time I fall 
(it watches everything) 
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is hearing me 
Right underneath my skin 
It's like I'm 
Paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
Hey yo 
Here we go again 
With the pain I feel that isn't real 
But in my mind 
When I find myself in places 
With names but no faces 
My memory races at speeds 
A hundred degrees 
My soul will bleed 
Devil must've planted the seed 
Now it feels like my back's against the wall, 
I'm takin the fall 
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all 
I don't know whom I can trust, 
They're screaming my name 
I need somebody to help me out of the frame 
All I'm trying to do is just master me 
All I'm tryin to do is smoke and blast a beat 
But something keeps on talking to me conciously, 
Responsibly keeps haunting me 
From dusk til dawn everything has something for ya 
That voice has got you projecting paranoia 
Cold sweat, shining on your face exposing your purpose 
And if I ripped off your skin I'd probably find a, 
Another person 
Theres nothing worse 
Than trying to bring yourself up back from the dead 
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head 
It's like I'm 
Paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
It's like I'm 
Paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a 
Whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I 
Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
(the face inside is right beneath your skin x4) 
The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me 
The sun goes down 
It's like I'm paranoid 
I feel the light betray me 
The sun 
(it's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin) 
It's like I'm 
Paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin</field>

Night is dripping down 
Glistening 
And I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now 
Cause I'm leaving now 
It's time you let me go 
Let me go 
Till then carry on 
And miss me when I'm gone 
Oh don't let anyone give you away 
Just carry on 
And miss me when I'm gone 
Oh don't let anyone take my place 
Take my place 
This tear between us is getting thinner now 
Getting thinner now 
Bittersweet 
And ‘cross that horizon this sun is setting now 
Slowly setting now 
It's time to let me go 
Let me go 
Till then carry on 
And miss me when I'm gone 
Oh don't let anyone give you away 
Just carry on

Tell them I couldn't help myself 
And tell them I was alone 
Tell them I was the only one 
And there's nothing that can stop me from going home 
Tell them I couldn't help myself 
And tell them I was alone 
Oh tell them I was the only one 
And there's nothing that can stop me 
From going home! 
Oh tell them I was the only one 
And there's nothing that can stop me 
From going home!</field>

The same way that I always do 
This is the last smile

Everything Falls apart, even the people who

[The sacrifice of hiding in a lie] 
everything has to end, you'll soon find 
were out of time left to watch it all unwind, 
[The sacrifice is never knowing]

Why I never walked away 
Why I play myself this way 
Now I see you're testing me 
Pushes me away

The Chevy undresser 
Stupid dope fresh tight shit resurrector 
Top gun man mod best of the besta 
The living MC, peace and resta 
Still tested the flexed gunna 
The make funna the appisary make runna 
Make summa cold with rhymes that spit 
Get gifted, lifted, delinquent wit 
I be the prophet, in my hand 
Top it, stop it, felt like rockin when I rock it 
Locked it down with this perverse verse 
Every fuckin curse I burst to hurt 
Room crowds physical fitness rhymes 
Coke heads couldn't do my lines 
I'm decorated like Christmas pines with Italian rocks 
MCs become silhouettes in shock 
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways 
Losing my pride will save it in many days 
Hit the dirt 
Because the words I spit will do more than just rip 
your shirt 
I'll bitch slap your soul 
Track the track control 
You coming at me? 
You can't hack it though 
So ridiculous 
Watching my crew get sick of this 
Wickedness 
Pitchin this 
Lyrical brichisness 
To crews and cliques 
Maiden, men, and mistresses 
This is my life 
The twilight, the fight night 
And trying to see nothing but the highlights 
When I write 
These eyes on horizons 
Top of Mike, start cries on to Krylon 
Fire on, rude men telekinetically 
As aterically beats become a clarity 
Feel averity's heroism, and heresy 
And severe every MC I see with neverity 
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways 
Losing my pride will save it in many days 
Why not? 
What a keep? 
Why not? 
What a keep? 
Why not? 
What a keep? 
Why not give me what I came to deserve? 
Why not give me what I came to believe? 
Why not give me what I came to deserve? 
Why not give me what I came to believe?

Confined by the things we own 
We're not without, we're like each other 
Pretending we're here alone 
And far away they burn their buildings 
Right in the face of the damage done

(Bottom to top I stop) 
At the core of the rotten 
(Stop to just what I thought) 
But sun has escaped us 
(So I've frightened the sky) 
And I'm far from a rapist 
(Thinking why did I try) 
From the top to the bottom 
(Bottom to top I stop) 
At the core of the rotten 
(Stop to just what I thought) 
But sun has escaped us 
(So I've frightened the sky) 
And I'm far from a rapist 
(Thinking why did I try) 
From the thread to the needle; middle to end 
Where skies cock back and shock that 
which couldn't defend 
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question 
Forcefully; the power of suggestion 
Then, with the eyes tightly shut 
looking through the rust 
And rotten dust, a spot of light floods the floor 
Pours itself upon the world of pretend 
Then the eyes ease open and it's dark again 
From the top to the bottom 
(Bottom to top I stop) 
At the core of the rotten 
(Stop to just what I thought) 
But sun has escaped us 
(So I've frightened the sky) 
And I'm far from a rapist 
(Thinking why did I try) 
In a minute you'll find me 
Eyes burn me up... 
You say you'll never forget me 
But the lies have piled up 
Moving all around, swinging of the ups and downs 
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound 
And as the wheels go 'round, the sunset creeps past the 
Street lamps, cars, chainlinks, and concrete 
A window then grows, and captures the eye 
And cries out a yellow light as it passes it by 
A small black figure sits in front of a box 
Inside a box of rock with a needles on top 
Nothing stops in this land of the chain 
When brains lose not knowing they were part of the game 
And in the insides grow, the box stays the same in shame 
Shovel up the pieces to the pain 
You can try to hide yourself in the world of pretend 
But when the paper's crumpled up 
it can't be perfect again 
De cima para baixo, 
De baixo para cima eu paro. 
No caroço da podridão 
Paro simplesmente o que pensei. 
O sol escapou de nós, 
Então eu passo a ser o brilho do céu, 
E estou longe de ser um violador. 
Veja o porquê de se ter tentado. 
In a minute you'll find me 
Eyes burn me up... 
You say you'll never forget me 
But the lies have piled up 
Yeah I got you caught in the act 
You better step back 
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you 
In a minute you'll find me 
Eyes burn me up... 
You say you'll never forget me 
But the lies have piled up... 
(In a minute you'll find me 
Eyes burn me up... 
You say you'll never forget me 
But the lies keep piling up...)</field>

Hey, mike, what's up? 
This is roc, just asking you what's happening? 
I was just touching base, seeing how your easter went 
Just seeing if you're going to see joe sometime soon, too, 
Because he's got my keyboard 
that I've been trying to get back 
I've been trying to call him 
and he hasn't been returning any messages 
So I'm seeing what the best angle is to, 
you know, get it back</field>

I don't think ya'll ready 
Yo, I don't think ya'll ready 
Graffiti decorations under a sky of gray 
This constant apprehension still giving me away 
The lessons I've forgotten 
In spite of all I've learned 
Now I find myself in question 
(Point, point the finger at me again) 
Guilty by association 
(Point, point the finger at me again) 
I wanna runaway 
(I wanna runaway) 
I wanna know the truth 
(I wanna know the truth) 
I wanna know the answers 
(I wanna know the answers) 
I wanna shut the door 
(And open up my mind) 
And open up my mind 
(And open up my mind) 
Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of gray 
This constant apprehension won't seem to go away 
All my talk of starting over 
These words were never true 
Now I find myself in question 
(Point, point the finger at me again) 
I'm guilty by association 
(Point, point the finger at me again) 
I wanna runaway 
(I wanna runaway) 
I wanna know the truth 
(I wanna know the truth) 
I wanna know the answers 
(I wanna know the answers) 
I wanna shut the door 
(And open up my mind) 
And open up my mind 
(And open up my mind) 
Gonna runaway, gonna runaway 
Gonna runaway, gonna runaway 
Runaway {being scratched over and over again} 
(Ya'll not ready) 
Hey yo I don't think ya'll ready for what I'm about to do 
Y'all new school dudes ain't even got no clue 
How dare you forget about Bam and Zulu 
Two urban jazz DJ's they paved the way 
Let me spit it to y'all who said I wasn't gonna make it 
Every time I blaze it, ya'll the first to hate it 
My team reins supreme and stays strong 
Every 2 series son, they scared to put us on 
Can't get with the high prince, get off your high atis 
Too many of y'all is dyin' for us so I gotta blaze it 
I'm still reppin' BK, Brooklyn D and on 
Hell fire and family alienation 
Banging hits in the backyard 
Out on the episode 
I'm a little kid named 
Phoenix Orion 
I wanna runaway 
(I wanna runaway) 
I wanna know the truth 
(I wanna know the truth) 
I wanna know the answers 
(I wanna know the answers) 
I wanna shut the door 
(And open up my mind) 
And open up my mind 
(And open up my mind)</field>

And we won't settle for what they give 
And we'll keep on standing Keep on fighting 
no backing down That's how we're living 
Our minds are made up and we're focused 
No more believing what we've been told 
'Cause our bags are packed 
There's no turning back 
We walk alone on these winding roads 
Weep not for roads untraveled 
Weep not for sights unseen 
May your love never end and if you need a friend 
There's a seat here alongside me 
Whoa 
May your love never end and if you need a friend 
There's a seat here alongside me</field>

You say the weight of the world 
Has kept you from letting go 
And you think compassion's a flaw 
And you'll never let it show 
And you're sure you hurt in a way 
That no one will ever know 
But someday the weight of the world 
Will give you the strength to go 
(oh, oh) (yeah!) (yeah!) 
Hold on, the weight of the world 
Will give you the strength to glow 
So hold on, the weight of the world 
Will give you the strength to go 
So hold on, the weight of the world 
Will give you the strength to go 
(yeah, yeah) 
Just hold on, (hold on)

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark 
Finally I can see you crystal clear 
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare 
See how I leave with every piece of you 
Don't underestimate the things that I will do 
There's a fire starting in my heart 
Reaching a fever pitch 
And it's bringing me out the dark 
The scars of your love remind me of us 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
The scars of your love they leave me breathless 
I can't help feeling 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it 
To the beat 
Baby I have no story to be told 
But I've heard one of you 
And I'm gonna make your head burn 
Think of me in the depths of your despair 
Making a home down there 
As mine sure won't be shared 
The scars of your love remind me of us 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
The scars of your love they leave me breathless 
I can't help feeling 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it 
To the beat 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it 
With the beating 
Throw your soul through every open door 
Count your blessings to find what you look for 
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold 
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow 
We could have had it all 
We could have had it all 
It all, it all it all, 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it 
To the beat 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it 
To the beat</field>

Graffiti decorations 
Under a sky of dust 
A constant wave of tension 
On top of broken trust 
The lessons that you taught me 
I learn were never true 
Now I find myself in question 
They point the finger right at me again 
Guilty by association 
You point the finger right at me again 
I wanna run away 
Never say goodbye 
I wanna know the truth 
Instead of wondering why 
I wanna know the answers 
No more lies 
I wanna shut the door 
And open up my mind 
Paper bags and angry voices 
Under a sky of dust 
Another wave of tension 
Has more than filled me up 
All my talk of taking action 
These words were never true 
Now I find myself in question 
They point the finger right at me again 
Guilty by association 
You point the finger right at me again 
I wanna run away 
Never say goodbye 
I wanna know the truth 
Instead of wondering why 
I wanna know the answers 
No more lies 
I wanna shut the door 
And open up my mind 
I'm gonna run away... 
And never say good bye! (Gonna run away...) 
I'm gonna run away... 
And never wonder why! (Gonna run away...) 
I'm gonna run away... 
And open up my mind! (Gonna run away...) 
I wanna run away 
Never say goodbye 
I wanna know the truth 
Instead of wondering why 
I wanna know the answers

Don't you run with scissors, son

Never listened when she said 
Sharp edges have consequences, I 
Guess that I had to find out for myself 
Sharp edges have consequences, now 
Every scar is a story I can tell 
Should've played it safer from the start 
Loved you like a house of cards 
Let it fall apart 
But all the things I couldn't understand 
Never could've planned 
They made me who I am 
Put your nose on paperbacks 
Instead of smoking cigarettes 
These are years you're never getting back 
Stay along the beaten path 
Never listened when she said 
Sharp edges have consequences, I 
Guess that I had to find out for myself 
Sharp edges have consequences, now 
Every scar is a story I can tell 
We all fall down 
We live somehow 
We learn what doesn't kill us 
makes us stronger

I'm an animal, tearing flesh into bone 
Randomly rippin' everything gone 
Unless they forget what, then let it be known 
I'll bury every competitor, every predator 
Anyone ever forget it, you'll regret it forever 
Never been nothing short of a legend

            <field name="lyrics">In the center of the silence 
The violent thoughts are thrown through 
The thick smoke of flickering lights that brighten the room 
All the things that you wanted to say get lost and thrown away 
You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind 
Can't turn back when you cross the line 
Sometimes someone you know who just doesn't care 
Has to see you go to know you were there 
This is the summer of the rain 
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute 
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back and I forget it 
Know that this is the summer of the rain 
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute 
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back and I forget it 
I know that all of this will soon be gone 
You don't really have to prove them wrong 
Sometimes you got no control of where you go 
Taken down a road you don't know 
And you feel so lost you want to hide your face 
You don't recognize the place your in 
Sometimes the sun doesn't shine your way 
Sometimes the night doesn't turn to day 
But sometimes the light's so bright it burns through the night 
And keeps the darkness at bay (Run away) 
This is the summer of the rain 
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute 
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back when I forget it 
Know that this is the summer of the rain 
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute 
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back when I forget it 
I know that all of this will soon be gone 
You don't really have to prove them wrong 
I know soon enough you'll make them see 
You'll be far away from them with me 
Follow the link in the chain without a name 
Steal the light that darkens these remains 
Take it away to the place you've been trapped 
Break all you know to bring it all back 
This is the summer of the rain 
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute 
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back when I forget it 
Know that this is the summer of the rain 
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute 
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back when I forget it 
I know that all of this will soon be gone 
You don't really have to prove them wrong 
I know soon enough you'll make them see 
You'll be far away from them 
Alone with me</field>

And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me 
(I was confused) 
And I let it all out to find that 
I'm not the only person with these things in mind 
(Inside of me) 
but all the vacancy the words revealed 
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel 
(Nothing to lose) 
Just stuck, hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own 
And the fault is my own 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
What I thought was never real 
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long 
(Erase all the pain till it's gone) 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
Like I'm close to something real. 
I want to find something I've wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 
And I've got nothing to say 
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face 
(I was confused) 
looking everywhere only to find that it's 
Not the way I had imagined it all in my mind. 
(So what am I) 
What do I have but negativity 
Cause I can't justify the way 
everyone is looking at me 
(Nothing to lose) 
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own 
And the fault is my own 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
What I thought was never real 
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long 
(Erase all the pain till it's gone) 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
Like I'm close to something real 
I want to find something I've wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 
I will never know 
Myself until I do this on my own 
And I will never feel 
Anything else until my wounds are healed 
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me 
And I will break away 
I'll find myself today 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
What I thought was never real 
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long 
(Erase all the pain till it's gone) 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
Like I'm close to something real 
I want to find something I've wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 
I wanna heal, I wanna to feel like 
I'm somewhere I belong 
I wanna heal, I want to feel like

Watching the raindrops blinking red and white 
Thinking of you back on the ground 
That willful fire burning in your eyes 
I only halfway apologize 
And I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
Sometimes things refuse 
To go the way we planned 
Oh I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There will be a day 
That you will understand 
You will understand 
After a while you may forget 
But just in case the memories cross your mind 
You couldn't know this when I left 
Under the fire of your angry eyes 
I never wanted to say goodbye 
So I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
Sometimes things refuse 
To go the way we planned 
Oh I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There will be a day 
That you will understand 
You will understand 
Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up 
Tried to call home but nobody could wake up 
Switch your time zones can't pick the bass up 
I just passed out by the time you wake up 
Best things come to those who wait 
And it's time to get pumped on any road you take 
Don't ever have a problem make no mistake 
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away 
So I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There are things we have to do that we can't stand 
Oh I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There will be a day that you will understand 
Oh I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There are things we have to do that we can't stand 
(Things we have to do that we can't stand) 
Oh I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There will be a day that you will understand 
You will understand 
You will understand 
You will understand</field>

Y'all better wake up 
You think we don't see ya'll driftin' 
Sleepin' on the job and forgettin' your position 
Sit straight and listen 
What you are missin' 
I cook up a batch hot straight out the kitchen 
No indecision i spit right 
Heavy as a fist fight 
No gloves and no masks 
No pain and no slack 
No way to look back 
Nobody to say i can't make my own path 
'cause the way that y'all act 
I wanna break somethin' 
Comin' at me like the pain i feel means nothin' 
Comin' from a place where you can't relate 
Where every word from your face comes across as fake 
And i can hardly take 
The way that ya'll treat us 
Sendin' this out to anyone who won't believe us 
Spellin' it out so y'all know the deal 
And if you can't feel it maybe you can't feel 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Man who are you? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Who… what you sayin'? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Who… what you writin'? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Man who are you? 
Tell ‘em motion 
Eat your words 
Sayin' what you used to say 
And act how you used to act 
Everytime you heard my occupation 
Was a rap attack 
My conversation's stacked 
I switch my defence on you 
Everytime you want to get deep 
You'll see my knuckle package 
Born to die 
Ferocious mc 
Make you go back and write your rhymes 
My style chokes up 
Like a little league baseball player 
It moves i'm stranglin' as i'm swingin' 
As main mangler 
I wanna d4 
Poach you as your seafood is c4 
I'm gonna rap are you still knee-high 
Y'all wanna train with me guy 
Man it's destructive 
Man it's like jabs from boxing champ lennox 
Perfect for your head 
I'll fit it like new era hats that 
Talk of suits b-boy adequate 
Express myself with my hang-side 
Then i extend one finger the middle 
Fuck the fourth place 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Man who are you? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Who… what you sayin'? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Who… what you writin'? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Man who are you? 
Yo motion 
Yeah? 
Sometimes i feel it's like nothin' that i do is ever good enough [for real] 
Like i should stop and go back to l.a. 
Back away where i know i won't be seen 
And nobody's gonna critique the music that i make 
And mistake me for some fuckin' kid with a backpack 
Rappin' on a track just to make a buck for 
a mixtape that sucks and dj's that don't get it 
But i been down that road and i know 
People don't wanna go 
Where i might go 
Don't wanna know what it's like to step outside 
Your zone with a mic just controllin' the hype 
And if we need to take shots from them 
And be stopped by them 
Just to make these ends 
Then so be it 
I will not hold my breath 
I'm gonna spit 'til i got none left 
Motion where you at? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Man who are you? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Who… what you sayin'? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Who… what you writin'? 
I'm standing in the middle of it 
Man who are you?</field>

Until you fall into the hole 
You dug for yourself while you slept here 
Too young, too selfish, too cold 
And when you find out what's been waiting 
The moment you open your eyes 
You'll see your true reflection 
The very first time in your life 
You cannot fight what's in you 
This will not be goodnight 
You cannot fight what's in you 
This will not be goodnight 
Cry to yourself 
Nothing will help 
It's too late to change what's been done 
You do what you've always done best 
You run 
Into the hole you fall deeper 
Deeper the faster you run 
It won't stop until you accept it 
Accept everything that you've done 
You cannot fight what's in you 
This will not be goodnight

Watch as the room rocks 
Men only moon walk 
Mixed media slang 
Banging in your boom box verbal violence 
Lyrical stylist 
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish 
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty 
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an mc 
With your lack of skill and facility 
You're killing me 
And the dj in the group just for credibility 
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes 
You're not an emcee if someone else writes your lines 
And rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer 
Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years 
But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up 
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck 
So how does it stack up - none of it's real 
You want to be an emcee you've got study the skill 
Chorus: 
Who can rock a rhyme like this? 
Bring it to you every time like this 
Who can rock a rhyme like this? 
Step, step up, step, step up 
So you pick up a pen 
And write yourself a new identity 
But mentally you don't have the hip hop energy 
With a tendency to make up stories 
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard 
Was top 40 (top 40) 
And your record company completely missing it 
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate 
So in a battle you can't hack it 
React with whack shit 
And get smacked with verbal back flips 
Get your ass kicked by a fabulous battle catalysts 
It's taken decades for emcees to establish this 
You're new to hip hop and welcome if your serious 
But not on the mic 
Leave that to the experienced 
Spoken 
Using the waves of sound 
the true master Paralyses his opponents 
leaving him vulnerable to attack

Peep the style and the kids checking for it 
The number one question is how could you ignore it 
We drop right back in the cut 
Over basement tracks 
With raps that got you backing this up like 
[rewind that] 
We're just rolling with the rhythm 
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division 
With these non-stop lyrics of life living 
Not to be forgotten 
But still unforgiven 
But in the meantime there are those who wanna 
Talk this and that so I suppose 
That it gets to a that point feelings gotta get hurt 
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt 
[it goes] 
Try to give you warning 
But everyone ignores me 
[told you everything loud and clear] 
But nobody's listening 
Call to you so clearly 
But you don't want to hear me 
[told you everything loud and clear] 
But nobody's listening

It's Going Down, Check It Out It's Going Down 
It's goin' down 
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound 
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now 
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down 
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style 
The combination of a vocal caress 
With lungs that gasp for breath 
From emotional stress 
With special effects 
And a distorted collage 
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage 
It's goin' down 
The logical progression on a the timeline 
The separation narrowed down to a fine line 
To blur the edges so they blend together properly 
Take you on an audible odyssey 
Now it's goin' down 
It's goin' down 
The logical progression on a the timeline 
The separation narrowed down to a fine line 
To blur the edges so they blend together properly 
Take you on an audible odyssey 
Now it's goin' down 
Put it out for the world see 
LP and X-men to the 10th degree 
It's goin' down 
Nobody in the world to see 
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 
It's goin' down 
Put it out for the world see 
LP and x-men to the 10th degree 
It's goin' down 
Everybody in the world to see 
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 
It's goin' down 
When I Say: It's Going, You Say: Down 
It's Going Down, It's Going Down 
When I Say: It's Going, You Say: Down

Renound MC's surround as the beat breaks down 
In 2 elements clobbin' up those that have been blessed 
And it's the M-I see the way it ought to be ponessed 
Yes, yes am I the one to keep you on your toes 
Most...Definitely in my b-boy pose, its the..electric boogie with the slight twist 
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this 
Now see what I have, I want you 
Be with me or Stick n' Move 
Now see what I had, I want you 
Be with me or Stick n' Move 
MC's dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic 
Now it's like You Sit, You Stay 
Cobra path lifestyles I'm kickin' 
Stickin' MC's real quick 'cause times tickin' 
At the drop of the defense, I let loose the venom 
Sendin', I shot of verbal heat up in 'em 
The ending will come, grab your family and run 
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots from the sun 
Record in the world, four-thousand-eighty-one 
Question my intentions and your whole world is done 
Like wars to Rome, turn your eyeballs into Saturn 
Full metal jacket fully auto rhyme pattern

            <field name="lyrics">What do I do to ignore what's behind me? 
Do I follow my fate to escape blindly? 
Do I hide my pride behind these bad dreams 
And give into sad thoughts that are maddening? 
Do I let go and try to stand it? 
Or do I try to catch them red-handed? 
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness? 
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? 
The sunlight burns the skin of sleeping man 
I make the right turns but I'm lost within 
I put on my daily facade but then 
I just end up 
Getting hurt again 
Chorus: 
By myself (myself) 
I ask why (but in my mind I find) 
I can't rely on myself (myself) 
I ask why (but in my mind I find) 
I can't rely on myself 
I can't hold on 
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
(Playing against you, I can't win) 
Without some failure sinking in 
If I turn my back I'm defenseless 
And to give in to fate seems senseless 
If I hide my pride and I lie sleepless 
and won't feel for the cope with my weakness 
If I let them go i'll be outdone 
But if I try to catch them i'll be outrun 
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer 
Then i'll be buried in the silence of the answer 
(chorus) 
By myself (myself) 
I ask why (but in my mind I find) 
I cant rely on myself (myself) 
I ask why (but in my mind I find) 
I can't rely on myself 
I can't hold on 
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
(Playing against you, I can't win) 
Without some failure sinking in 
How do you think 
That I've lost so much 
I'm always afraid 
That I'm out of touch 
How do you expect 
That I will know what to do 
When all I know 
Is what you tell me to 
Don't you (know) 
I can't tell you how to make it (go) 
No matter what it do, how hard I (try) 
I can't seem to convince myself (why) 
I'm stuck on the outside(2x) 
I can't hold on 
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
(Playing against you, I can't win) 
Without some failure sinking in 
I can't hold on 
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on

It's real 
It's up to you to make it happens 
It's up to you to make it real 
And you know...how I feel 
To be some - to me so 
And you know...how I feel 
To be some - to me so 
Tell me what you know 
Tell me what you feel 
It's doesn't matter when you're down 
When you looked at me with your eyes 
Smile on face is seem happy 
Are you happy? 
And you know...how I feel 
To be some - to me so 
And you know...how I feel 
To be some - to me so 
Yeah yeah yeah 
And you know...how I feel 
To be some - to me so</field>

Chilling rain, like an ocean everywhere 
Don't want to reach for me, do you? 
I mean nothing to you, 
The little things give you away 
And now there will be no mistaking 
The levees are breaking 
All you've ever wanted... 
Was someone to truly look up to you 
And six feet under water, I do... 
Hope decays, generations disappear 
Washed away, as a nation simply stares 
Don't want to reach for me, do you? 
I mean nothing to you, 
The little things give you away 
But now there will be no mistaking 
The levees are breaking

Love keeps us kind 
It keeps us kind 
When you've suffered enough 
And your spirit is breaking 
You're growing desperate from the fight 
Remember you're loved and you always will be 
This melody will bring you right back home

A few people laughed, a few people cried,

I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, 
the Bhagavad-Gita 
Vishnu is trying to persuade 
the Prince that he should do his duty, 
and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form, 
and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' 
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another." -

Two.. 
three... 
I was born with the hunger of a lion 
The strength of a sun 
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come 
Original style like a 808 drum 
So I don't run the track no 
I make the track run 
My momma taught me words 
My daddy built rockets 
I put 'em both together now tell me what I got 
It's a pretty smart weapon 
I can shoot it I can drop it 
But learn to respect it 
'cause you clearly can't stop it 
Like that... 
It ain't over 
'cause the sharks on the left side 
The snakes on the right 
And anything you do they wanna get a little bite 
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right 
'cause once they get their teeth in 
Nothing really fights 
And as for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose 
And you can run your mouth 
Like you can try to fill my shoes 
But steady little soldier 
I ain't standing next to you 
I'd be laying on the ground 
Before you're even in my view 
Like that... 
Give me the strength of the rising sun 
Give me the truth of the words unsung 
And when the last bells ring 
The poor men sing 
Bring me to kingdom come 
This is something for ya people on the block to 
Black out and rock to 
Give you what you need 
Like poppa, who shot ya 
Separate the weak from the obsolete 
You're meek/I creep hard on impostors 
And switch styles on a dime 
Quick-witted y'all 
Quit trippin' I don't have time for your crying 
I grind tough 
Sucker, make your mind up 
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup? 
Bang, bang 
Little monkey man playing 
With the big guns only get you slain 
I ain't playin' 
I'm just saying 
You ain't got a sliver of a chance 
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants 
So shake shake down 
Money, here's the breakdown 
You can play the bank 
Imma play the bank takedown 
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get ya 
I'm just a banks 
You're a brainwash 
Get the picture 
Like that... 
We swim against the rising waves 
And crash against the shore 
The body bends until it breaks 
The early morning sings no more 
So rest your head it's time to sleep 
And dream of what's in store 
The body bends until it breaks 
Then sings again no more 
'cause time has torn the flesh away 
The early morning sings no more</field>

And blew away as I collapsed, so cold 
A black wind took them away, from sight 
And held the darkness over day, that night 
And the clouds above move closer 
Looking so dissatisfied 
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing 
I used to be my own protection, but not now 
Cause my path has lost direction, somehow 
A black wind took you away, from sight 
And held the darkness over day, that night 
And the clouds above move closer 
Looking so dissatisfied 
And the ground below grew colder 
As they put you down inside 
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing 
So now you're gone, 
and I was wrong 
I never knew what it was like, 
to be alone 
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day 
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day 
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day

What was left 
When that fire was gone 
I throught it felt right 
But that right was wrong 
All caught up in the eye of the storm 
And trying to figure out 
What it's like moving on 
And I don't even know 
What kind of things I said 
My mouth kept moving 
And my mind went dead 
Picking up the pieces 
Nowhere to begin

What would you say? 
Do you believe in life after death?) 
In the chill of the night, 
I can feel my heart racing, 
As I run towards the light, 
that seems so far away, 
Wondering forever, in the darkest of shadows, 
Wondering if I will ever see you again. 
Wondering if I will ever see you again 
I'll take your love (I'll take your love), 
I'll take your hate (take your hate), 
I'll take your desire. 
I'll take the world, 
When it turns on you (when it turns on you), 
I'll set it afire. 
(The walking dead, the walking dead.) 
Digging in the dirt, 
I can feel you getting closer, 
Steadying my hands through the blistering pain, 
Anxiously awaiting for the earth to reveal you, 
Wondering if I will ever see you again. 
Wondering if I will ever see you again. 
I'll take your love (I'll take your love), 
I'll take your hate (take your hate), 
I'll take your desire. 
I'll take your heart, 
I'll take your pain (I'll take your pain), 
I'll bring you to life. 
I'll bring you to life...

Marching with no stepping 
Murder with no killing 
Illin' every direction 
First, no sequel 
Do the math, no equal 
John with no Yoko 
More power and less people 
And no, I'm not afraid of that 
Print it in your paperback 
Every rap is made in fact 
To act as a delayed attack 
Every phrase a razor blade 
That's saved until they play it back 
To slay and leave 'em lying on the pavement 
Bang, fade to black 
In the wastelands of today 
When there's nothing left to lose 
And there's nothing more to take 
But you force yourself to choose 
In the wastelands of today 
Where tomorrow disappears 
While the future slips away 
And your hope turns into fear 
In the wastelands of today

Roll credits, you get it

Take it how you take it 
I'm the opposite of vacancy

Y'all can hate and wait and see

In the wastelands of today 
Where tomorrow disappears 
While the future slips away 
And your hope turns into fear 
And your hope turns into fear 
In the wastelands of today 
In the wastelands of today 
When there's nothing left to lose 
And there's nothing more to take 
But you force yourself to choose

While the future slips away 
And your hope turns into fear 
And your hope turns into fear

Together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs 
Up against the wall 
(Busta Rhymes) 
See a nigga survived the worst 
But my life is glorious (uh!) 
But I know that I leaped every hurdle 
And I'm so victorious (uh!) 
Take a look I'm a symbol of greatness 
Now call a nigga Morpheus (yeah) 
As force securin' the win, but they 
Believe I'm so notorious (yeah) 
You know that I've been 'bout my bread 
Even though we rappin' now (yes) 
We used to live on the strip even though 
A nigga higher level trappin' now (oh!) 
Superseded everyone of my little struggles and (uh!) 
So your head never ever been an option (trust) 
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic 
And I'm about to take the hood shoppin' (get it!) 
(Chester Bennington and Busta Rhymes) 
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas) 
We made it even though we had our backs 
Up against the wall (come on) 
Forever we waited (ah hah) 
And they told us we were never gonna get it 
But we took it on the road 
(To the riches) 
on the road 
(To the ghetto) 
on the road 
(In the projects, to this bangin' instrumental) 
on the road 
(Rise with me) 
on the road 
(Come and get it) 
on the road 
(Mike Shinoda) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo 
When it all got started we were steadily 
Just getting rejected 
And it seemed like nothin' we could do 
would ever get us respected 
At best we were stressed at the worst 
They probably said we're pathetic 
Had all the pieces to that puzzle 
Just the way to connect it 
I was fighting through every rhyme 
Tightening up every line 
Never restin' the question if I 
Was out of my mind 
It finally came time to do it and let it die 
So we put the chips on the table and 
Told them to let it ride, sing it (yeah) 
(Chester Bennington and Busta Rhymes) 
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas) 
We made it even though we had our backs 
Up against the wall (come on) 
Forever we waited (ah hah)

(Rise with me) 
on the road 
(Come and get it) 
on the road 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look 
In case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin' 
This shit that I can leave for 
My children's (children's) children's (children) 
Now on the wake up I smile, to see how far I've come (yeah) 
Fighting for sales when I'm stripped 
To negate the hustle from (yeah) 
From nights in jail on a bench 
using my muscles son (yeah) 
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russel was 
(yeah nigga) 
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it (oh!) 
Let's make a toast to the hustle 
Regardless how you get it, sing it

So this is how we fall apart

I never thought I could sink so low 
I never let myself down

We are

Cause when our heads betray our hearts 
We fake what we don't know 
And if our doubt begins again 
The answers find us in the end 
So in the meantime we'll pretend

The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow 
I'm not a criminal not a role model 
Not a born leader I'm a tough act to follow 
I am not the fortune and the fame 
Nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game 
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain 
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems 
And it seems ugly but it can get worse 
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse 
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works 
Everybody wants the next thing 
to be just like the first 
And I'm not a robot 
I'm not a monkey 
I will not dance even if the beat's funky 
Opposite of lazy far from a punk 
Ya'll ought to stop talking 
start trying to catch up motherfucker 
And all the people say 
Lauryn said money change a situation 
Big said it increase the complication 
Kane said don't step I ain't the one 
Chuck said that uzi weigh a motherfuckin' ton 
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me 
Rockin' every stage in every place that it brought me 
I'm awfully underrated but came here to correct it 
And so it ain't mistaken I'ma state it for the record 
I am the opposite of wack opposite of weak 
Opposite of slack synonym of heat 
Synonym of crack closest to a peak 
Far from a punk 
Ya'll ought to stop talking 
start trying to catch up motherfucker 
And all the people say 
Oh when they come for me 
Come for me

You left my trust on the falling line 
As the promises break, the only mistake's 
Giving you what was mine 
Your words are clear but their meaning's gone 
The notes are right but the tuning's wrong 
And when you tell me again that I should give in 
I can only take it so long (long, long, long) 
RAH! 
You're terrified, terrified 
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away! 
You're terrified, terrified 
You'd rather throw it all away! 
Fear is dancing inside your lies 
Exposing secrets that you've disguised 
And I'm biting my tongue as you become 
Victim of a compromise 
Cause I know who you really are 
Not a scratch where you can take a scar 
And it's time that you seek the truth without me 
I can only get you so far (far, far, far)

Wish there was something real 
Wish there was something true 
Wish there was something real

I'm the one without a soul 
I'm the one with this big fucking hole 
No new tale to tell 
Twenty-six years on my way to hell 
Gotta listen to your big time hard line 
Bad luck fist fuck 
Don't think you're having all the fun 
You know me I hate everyone 
I want to but I can't turn back

To the cold of the static 
And put my cold feet on the floor 
Forgot all about yesterday 
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore 
A little taste of hypocrisy 
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake 
Slow to react 
Even though you're so close to me 
You're still so distant, 
and I can't bring you back 
It's true, the way I feel 
Was promised by your face 
The sound of your voice 
Painted on my memories 
Even if you're not with me 
I'm with you 
You, now I see, keeping everything inside 
With you 
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes 
I hit you and you hit me back 
And we fall to the floor 
The rest of the day stands still 
Fine line between this and that 
But when things go wrong, 
I pretend the past isn't real 
Now I'm trapped in this memory 
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake 
Slow to react 
Even though you're so close to me 
You're still so distant,

Talk a lot of game but yet you don't know 
Static on the way / make us all say whoa

Get down and obey every word 
Steady getting mine if you haven't yet heard 
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd 
Don't fight the power nobody gets hurt 
If you haven't heard yet then I'm letting you know 
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload 
And no one make a move unless my people say so 
Got everything outta control, now everybody go 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
Steel unload, final blow 
We the animals, take control 
Hear us now, clear and true 
Wretches and kings we come for you 
So keep pace, how slow can you go 
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know 
Fire on the way, make you all say whoa 
The people up top and the people down low 
Get down and I'm running it like that 
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at 
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi hat 
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact 
So get with the combat, I'm letting 'em know 
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down no 
So / push the button let the whole thing blow 
Spinning everything outta control, now everybody go 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
Feel unload, final blow 
We the animals, take control 
Hear us now, clear and true 
Wretches and kings we come for you 
Steel unload, fire blow 
Filthy animals, beat them low 
Skin and bone, black and blue 
No more this sun shall beat onto you 
From the front to the back and the side to side 
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high 
From the front to the back and the side to side 
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high

Shut up, Shut up... 
(When I'm talking to you) 
Shut up... 
I'm about to 
Wasn't that fun 
Let's try something else, else, else 
Forty five caliber killa 
But out of the filla 
Dela ville show ya'll brothers 
How you not a gorilla 
Smooth talking 
Fully automatic 
Weapon concilla 
Taste thriller 
Break thriller 
Let's hit em with the bounce filla 
Filthy stinking 
Standing on solid ground 
And still be sinking 
Submerging in the parks 
Still be Linkin 
Pluck beef when it starts 
Hope you're thinking 
It's not a mirage 
I'm in a mother fucking tractor 
From out of the garage 
When or if you can duck 
But it's hard to dodge 
In the back of that spine 
Where my dogs is lodge 
Gonna flip it straight up 
Ripping apart your squad 
Xe cutioner style 
The cuts and blends 
Like a syringe 
Banging you and each of your limbs 
See me coming through your party 
Hard 
Without no bodyguard 
Smoking something 
Stomping on each of your Tims 
I'm the B to the L the A the C king 
And when it come to planning 
The thought 
To keep thinking 
Man 
Shut up...</field>

The cold comes, racing through my skin 
Searching for a way to get to you 
Through the storm you 
Go, giving up your home 
Go, leaving all you've known 
You are not alone 
 
With arms up, stretched into the sky 
With eyes like, echoes in the night 
Hiding from the hell that you've been through 
Silent one, you 
Go, giving up your home 
Go, leaving all you've known 
 
You go, giving up your home 
Go, leaving all you've known 
You are not alone 
 
You go, giving up your home 
Go, leaving all you've known

Go, you are not alone 
You are not alone

            <field name="lyrics">I remembered black skies / the lightning all around me 
I remembered each flash / as time began to blur 
Like a startling sign / that fate had finally found me 
And your voice was all I heard 
That I get what I deserve 
 
So give me reason / to prove me wrong / to wash this memory clean 
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes 
Give me reason / to fill this hole / connect the space between 
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies 
Across this new divide 
 
There was nothing in sight / but memories left abandoned 
There was nowhere to hide / the ashes fell like snow 
And the ground caved in / between where we were standing 
And your voice was all I heard 
That I get what I deserve 
 
So give me reason / to prove me wrong / to wash this memory clean 
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes 
Across this new divide 
 
In every loss / in every lie 
In every truth that you'd deny 
And each regret / and each goodbye 
Was a mistake to great to hide 
And your voice was all I heard 
That I get what I deserve 
 
So give me reason / to prove me wrong / to wash this memory clean 
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes 
Give me reason / to fill this hole / connect the space between

            <field name="lyrics">What do I do to ignore them behind me? 
Do I follow my instincts blindly? 
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams 
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening? 
Do I sit here and try to stand it? 
Or do I try to catch them red-handed? 
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness 
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? 
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin 
I make the right moves but I'm lost within 
I put on my daily facade but then 
I just end up getting hurt again 
By myself (myself) 
 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can't rely on myself (myself) 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can't rely on myself 
 
I can't hold on 
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
To end things watching everything spin 
With thoughts of failure sinking in 
 
If I turn my back I'm defenseless 
And to go blindly seems senseless 
If I hide my pride and let it all go on 
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone 
If I let them go I'll be outdone 
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun 
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer 
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer 
By myself (myself) 
 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can't rely on myself (myself) 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can't rely on myself 
 
I can't hold on 
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
To end things watching everything spin 
With thoughts of failure sinking in 
 
How do you think 
I've lost so much 
I'm so afraid 
I'm out of touch 
How do you expect 
I will know what to do 
When all I know 
Is what you tell me to 
 
Don't you 
I can't tell you how to make it 
No matter what I do 
How hard I 
I can't seem to convince myself 
I'm stuck on the outside 
Don't you 
I can't tell you how to make it 
No matter what I do 
How hard I 
I can't seem to convince myself 
I'm stuck on the outside 
 
I can't hold on 
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
(To anything watching everything spin) 
Without some failure sinking 
 
I can't hold on 
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
(To anything watching everything spin)

Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care 
 
There's a place so dark you can't see the end 
(Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend 
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions 
Forcefully, the power of suggestion 
Then with the eyes shut looking thought the rust and rotten dust 
A spot of light floods the floor 
And pours over the rusted world of pretend 
And the eyes ease open and its dark again 
 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care 
 
In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 
 
Moving all around 
Screaming of the ups and downs 
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound 
The wheels go 'round and the sunset creeps past the 
Street lamps, chain-link, and concrete 
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn 
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone 
The memory now is like the picture was then 
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again 
 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care 
 
In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 
 
Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I'm telling you that 
I see it right through you 
Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I'm telling you that 
I see it right through you 
Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I'm telling you that 
I see it right through you 
Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I'm telling you that 
I see it right through you 
Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I'm telling you that 
I see it right through you 
Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I'm telling you that 
I see it right through you 
Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I'm telling you that 
I see it right through you

I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
All I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 
 
It's so unreal 
Didn't look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know 
Wasted it all just to watch you go 
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me 
Will eventually be a memory of a time when 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme 
To remind myself of a time when 
I tried so hard 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I'm surprised it got so 
Things aren't the way they were before 
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then 
But it all comes back to me in the end 
You kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
For all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
For all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter</field>

Less I hear the less you'll say

Everything you say to me 
Takes me one step closer to the edge

I need a little room to breathe 
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break 
 
I find the answers aren't so clear 
Wish I could find a way to disappear 
All these thoughts they make no sense 
I find bliss in ignorance 
Nothing seems to go away

Shut up when I'm talking to you 
Shut up, shut up, shut up 
Shut up when I'm talking to you 
Shut up, shut up, shut up 
Shut up, I'm about to break!

Something in the air's not right today 
Why am I so uptight today? 
Paranoia's all I got left 
I don't know what stressed me first 
Or how the pressure was fed 
But I know just what it feels like 
To have a voice in the back of my head 
Like a face that I hold inside 
A face that awakes when I close my eyes 
A face watches every time I lie 
A face that laughs every time I fall 
(It watches everything) 
So I know now when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is hearing me 
Right beneath my skin 
 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
 
I know I've got a face in me 
Points out all my mistakes to me 
You've got a face on the inside too 
Your paranoia's probably worse 
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand 
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is 
I can't add up to what you can but 
Everybody has a face that they hold inside 
A face that awakes when I close my eyes 
A face that watches every time they lie 
A face that laughs every time they fall 
(It watches everything) 
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is watching you too 
Right inside your skin 
 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
 
The face inside is right beneath your skin 
The face inside is right beneath your skin 
The face inside is right beneath your skin 
 
The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me 
The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me 
 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

sits in the sky in the dark night 
Shining with the light from the sun 
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming 
The moon's going to owe it one 
It makes me think of how you act to me 
You do 
Favors and then rapidly, you just 
Turn around and start asking me about 
Things you want back from me 
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest 
I want to be in another place 
I hate when you say you don't understand 
(You'll see it's not meant to be) 
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
 
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and 
Step on people like you do and 
Run away the people I thought I knew 
I remember back then who you were 
You used to be calm used to be strong 
Used to be generous but you should've known 
That you'd 
Wear out your welcome now you see 
How quiet it is all alone 
I'm so 
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest 
I'm so 
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest 
 
I want to be in another place 
I hate when you say you don't understand

I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy

You try to take the best of me 
Go away 
You try to take the best of me 
Go away 
You try to take the best of me 
Go away 
You try to take the best of me 
Go away 
You try to take the best of me 
Go away 
You try to take the best of me 
Go away 
You try to take the best of me 
Go away 
You try to take the best of me 
Go away

You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind) 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
 
Why I never walked away 
Why I played myself this way 
Now I see your testing me pushes me away 
Why I never walked away 
Why I played myself this way 
Now I see your testing me pushes me away 
 
We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie 
We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
 
Why I never walked away 
Why I played myself this way 
Now I see your testing me pushes me away 
Why I never walked away 
Why I played myself this way 
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

Under the sky of dust 
A constant wave of tension 
On top of broken trust 
The lessons that you taught me 
I learned were never true 
 
Now I find myself in question 
They point the finger at me again 
Guilty by association 
You point the finger at me again 
 
I wanna run away 
Never say goodbye 
I wanna know the truth 
Instead of wondering why 
I wanna know the answers 
No more lies 
I wanna shut the door 
And open up my mind 
 
Paper bags and angry voices 
Under a sky of dust 
Another wave of tension 
Has more than filled me up 
All my talk of taking action 
These words were never true 
 
Now I find myself in question 
They point the finger at me again 
Guilty by association 
You point the finger at me again 
 
I wanna run away 
Never say goodbye 
I wanna know the truth 
Instead of wondering why 
I wanna know the answers 
No more lies 
I wanna shut the door 
And open up my mind 
 
I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye 
Gonna run away, gonna run away 
Gonna run away, gonna run away 
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why 
Gonna run away, gonna run away 
Gonna run away, gonna run away 
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind 
Gonna run away, gonna run away 
Gonna run away, gonna run away 
Gonna run away, gonna run away 
Gonna run away, gonna run away 
 
I wanna run away 
Never say goodbye 
I wanna know the truth 
Instead of wondering why 
I wanna know the answers 
No more lies 
I wanna shut the door 
And open up my mind 
 
I wanna run away and open up my mind 
I wanna run away and open up my mind 
I wanna run away and open up my mind 
I wanna run away and open up my mind</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I woke up in a dream today 
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor 
Forgot all about yesterday 
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore 
A little taste of hypocrisy 
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react 
Even though you're so close to me 
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back 
 
It's true 
The way I feel 
Was promised by your face 
The sound of your voice 
Painted on my memories 
Even if you're not with me 
 
I'm with you 
You now I see 
Keeping everything inside (with you) 
You now I see 
Even when I close my eyes 
 
I hit you and you hit me back 
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still 
Fine line between this and that 
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real 
Now I'm trapped in this memory 
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react 
So, even though you're close to me 
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back 
 
It's true 
The way I feel 
Was promised by your face 
The sound of your voice 
Painted on my memories 
Even if you're not with me 
 
I'm with you 
You now I see 
Keeping everything inside (with you) 
You now I see 
Even when I close my eyes 
 
I'm with you 
You now I see 
Keeping everything inside (with you) 
You now I see 
Even when I close my eyes 
 
No, no matter how far we've come 
I can't wait to see tomorrow 
No matter how far we've come 
I can't wait to see tomorrow 
With you 
 
You now I see 
Keeping everything inside (with you) 
You now I see 
Even when I close my eyes 
 
With you 
You now I see 
Keeping everything inside (with you) 
You now I see

Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits 
Mastered numerology and big bang theology 
I've been digging in the crates 
Ever since I was living in space 
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits 
I mastered numerology and big bang theology 
Preformed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology 
Invented a mic so I could start blessing it 
Chin checking kids to make my point like an impressionist 
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I twist my cords like double helix's 
To show u what I'm made of 
I buckle knees like leg braces 
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of these MC's who hate us 
Try on, leave u with out a shoulder to cry on 
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones 
I fire bombs ghostly notes haunt this 
I tried threats but moved on to a promise 
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice 
And run the gauntlet with whoever that what this is

Never satisfied my rhymes Jones 
Spraying bright day over what u mite say 
My blood type is krylon technicolor type a 
On highways ripe with road rage 
On pages of wind, cages of tin that bounce all around 
Surround sound 
Devouring the scenes 
Subliminal gangrene paintings over all the same things 
Sings songs karaoke copy bullshit 
Break bones verbally with stick and stones tactics 
Fourth dimension compact convection 
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention 
Meant to put u away with 
A pencil, pistol, official, sixteen lines, a rhymes missile 
While you risk your all, I pick at all your flaws

Bringin' u up and takin' u down

This is my time of the year 
This is my December 
This is all so clear 
 
This is my December 
This is my snow covered home 
This is my December 
This is me alone 
 
And I 
Just wish that I didn't feel 
Like there was something I missed 
And I 
Take back all the things I said 
To make you feel like that 
And I 
Just wish that I didn't feel 
Like there was something I missed 
And I 
Take back all the things that I said to you 
 
And I give it all away 
Just to have somewhere to go to 
Give it all away 
To have someone to come home to 
 
This is my December 
These are my snow covered dreams 
This is me pretending 
This is all I need 
 
And I 
Just wish that I didn't feel 
Like there was something I missed 
And I 
Take back all the things I said 
To make you feel like that 
And I 
Just wish that I didn't feel

            <field name="lyrics">What do I do to ignore them behind me 
Do I follow my instincts blindly 
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams 
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening 
Do I sit here and try to stand it 
Or do I try to catch them red-handed 
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness 
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness 
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin 
I make the right moves but I'm lost within 
I put on my daily facade but then 
I just end up getting hurt again 
 
By myself (myself) 
I ask why 
But in my mind I find 
I can't rely on myself (myself) 
I ask why 
But in my mind I find 
I cant rely on myself 
I cant look around 
(Its too much to take in) 
I cant hold on 
(When I'm stretched so thin) 
I can't slow down 
(Watching everything spin) 
I can't look past 
(Its starting over again) 
 
If I turn my back I'm defenseless 
And to go blindly seems senseless 
If I hide my pride and let it all go on 
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone 
If I let them go I'll be outdone 
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun 
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer 
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer 
 
By myself (myself) 
I ask why 
But in my mind I find 
I can't rely on myself (myself) 
I ask why 
But in my mind I find 
I can't rely on myself 
I can't look around 
(Its too much to take in) 
I can't hold on 
(When I'm stretched so thin) 
I can't slow down 
(Watching everything spin) 
I can't look past 
(Its starting over again) 
 
Don't you(being said repeatedly in the background) 
Don't you (know) 
I can't tell you how to make it (go) 
No mater what I do, how hard I (try) 
I can't seem to convince myself (why) 
I'm stuck on the outside 
Don't you (know) 
I can't tell you how to make it (go) 
No matter what I do, how hard I (try)

Hey, Mike, what's up? 
This is Roc, just asking you what's happening? 
I was just touching base, seeing how your Easter went 
Um, just seeing if you're going to see Joe sometime soon, too, 
Because he's got my keyboard that I've been trying to get back 
I've been trying to call him and he hasn't been returning any messages 
So I'm seeing what the best angle is to, you know, get it back 
Heyy dude this is a good idea to get a message around...i like that

I need a little room to breathe 
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break 
 
I'm about to break 
This room to breathe 
This room to breathe 
This room to breathe 
 
I cannot take this anymore 
Saying everything I've said before 
All these words, they make no sense 
I found bliss in ignorance 
Less I hear, the less you say 
You'll find that out anyway 
I find the answers aren't so clear 
Wish I could find a way to disappear 
All these thoughts, they make no sense 
I found bliss in ignorance 
Nothing seems to go away 
Over and over again 
Just like before 
 
Everything you say to me 
And I'm about to break 
I need a little room to breathe 
And I'm about to break 
 
Everything you say to me 
And I'm about to break 
I need a little room to breathe 
And I'm about to break 
 
These are the places where I can feel torn from my body 
My flesh, it peels during this ride we can cut upwhat we like 
I'm about to break 
Waiting alone, I cannot resist 
Feeling this hate, I have never missed 
Please, someone, give me a reason to rip off my face 
Blood is a pouring 
And pouring 
And pouring 
And pouring 
And pouring 
And pouring 
And pouring 
And pouring 
And pouring 
And pouring 
 
Shut up when I'm talking to you 
Shut up 
Blood is pouring 
Shut up 
Blood is pouring 
Shut up 
Blood is pouring 
Shut up when I'm talking to you 
Shut up 
Blood is pouring

            <field name="lyrics">Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park 
Then in the middle came Motion Man 
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix  
 
One thing I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time 
All I know, time was just slipping way 
 
And I watched it count down till the end of the day 
Watched it watch me and the words that I say 
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins 
I know that I didn't look out below 
 
And I watched the time go right out the window 
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch 
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock 
But in the end no matter what I pretend 
 
The journey is more important than the end or the start 
And what it meant to me will eventually be 
A memory of the time when I tried so hard 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time 
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party 
 
All for shake and made eye contact 
Party control showing all that 
Northeast, Southwest coast 
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle 
 
I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder 
I brought you back of the thing 
Like the imaginary man of your dreams 
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it 
 
A pig skin I never nerved you 
You felt lever never pleather, real bringing the pleasure 
By any means and means of leaving you teens 
Holler for teen magazines but I tried so hard 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man 
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt 
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man 
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt 
 
One thing I don't know how 
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now 
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all 
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl 
 
And I was forced to run, with you mocking me 
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly 
Remembering all those times you fought with me 
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy 
 
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale 
Every single little thing you said and make it expel 
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't matter to me 
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend 
 
The journey is more important than the end or the start 
And what it meant to me will eventually be 
A memory of the time when I tried so hard 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
In the end</field>

Hybrid 
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space 
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits 
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekanetic psychology 
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it 
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist 
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of 
I buckle knees like leg braces, cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us 
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on 
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones 
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this 
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise 
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice 
And run the guantlett with whoever that wants this 
 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage 
Bringin you up and takin you down 
High voltage 
Comin at you from every side 
High voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 
Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones 
Never satisfied my rhymes jones 
Spraying bright day over what you might say 
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A 
On highways write with road rage 
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around 
Surround sound 
Devouring the scenes 
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things 
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit 
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics 
Forth dimension, compact convention 
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention 
Ment to put you away, with the pencil 
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile 
While you risk your all 
I pick out at your flaws 
Spitting rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw 
 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage 
Bringin you up and takin you down 
High voltage 
Comin at you from every side 
High voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage 
Bringin you up and takin you down 
High voltage 
Comin at you from every side 
High voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 
Who's the man, the man in your hand over your land 
Roving over man's bolding when he's jammin your plans ova 
I am vics clorousos, the most ferocious 
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage 
That's why I need ruby corks glasses, cause when I glance at the chest 
Then I might blast the masses 
Subliminals transmitted through piano 
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano 
My IU skills are when I mean plea sees the rhyme I hear as I proceed through time 
I walk through the walls and the inanimate obstacles 
While educed to the reduction of cells and molecules 
I bring the knowledge the you swallow like the state of hologram 
I bot your head, fat your lip like collagen 
A telepath of the another verse with no postage 
Mike Shinoda, we are high voltage 
 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage 
Bringin you up and takin you down 
High voltage 
Comin at you from every side 
High voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage 
Bringin you up and takin' you down 
High voltage 
Comin at you from every side 
High voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

*faint* Crawling in my skin 
(Without a sense of confidence) 
*faint* Consuming, Confusing... 
Crawling in my skin 
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take) 
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface... 
 
Ah, Crawling in my skin, (Crawling in my skin) 
These wounds, they will not heal... (Wound, they will not heal) 
Fear is how I fall, (fear is how I fall) 
Confusing... Confusing what is real... 
Confusing what is real... 
 
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface 
Consuming, confusing, 
This lack of self-control, I fear, is neverending. 
Controlling, I can't seem 
to find myself again. My walls are closing in... 
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take.) 
I've felt this way before, SO INSECURE!!! 
 
Crawling in my skin, 
these wounds, they will not heal. 
Fear is how I fall, 
Confusing what is real. 
 
Discomfort, endlessly, has pulled itself upon me, 
distracting, reacting, 
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection, 
It's haunting, how I can't seem... 
To find myself again, my walls are closing in. 
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take!) 
I've felt this way before, SO INSECURE!!! 
*Hold 1.5 times longer than last time* 
 
Without a sense of confidence, (confidence) 
Without a sense of confidence, (confidence) 
Without a sense of Confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take. 
Without a sense of confidence, (confidence) 
Without a sense of confidence, (confidence) 
Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take. 
 
Seem to find myself again, My walls are closing in... 
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take!) 
I've felt this way before, SO INSECURE!!! 
 
Crawling in my skin, 
Thses wounds, they will not heal. 
Fear is how I fall, 
Confusing what is real. 
Crawling in my skin, 
These wounds, they will not heal. 
Fear is how I fall, 
Confusing, confusing what is real.</field>

I hate when you say you don't understand, 
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head. 
 
I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night, 
Shining with the light from the sun, 
The sun doesn't give light to the moon, 
Assuming the moons gonna owe it one, 
And makes think of how you act to me, you do favors that rapidly, 
You just turn around and start asking me about things you want back from me, 
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger, 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this, 
Find another place to feed your greed, 
While I find a place to rest, I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger, 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this, find another place to feed your greed, 
While I find a place to rest. 
 
I want to be in another place, I hate when you say you don't understand, 
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head. 
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to 
 
Two Two Three Three Ya Ya Ya 
Gimme energon to keep me calm 
You and your mom keep on the drom 
Used to be a team, passed that baton 
But you flop that bod as you drop that bomb 
Take it to the john in your babylon 
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on. 
I don't really give a dang you pissed on my lawn 
Took a dump like a punk now the battles on. 
 
So sick of you stressin' 
Sick of you fessin' 
Sick of you actin' like I owe you some 
Find another place to feed your face 
If you don't we gonna bump, get it up, get crunk.

Still be Linkin' pluck beef when its starts, fuck what your thinking, its not a mirage 
 
I'm in a mother fuckin' tractor from out of the garage 
With an if through the duck, but its hard to dodge 
In the back of that spine where my dogs' lie 
Gonna flip it straight up rippin' apart ya squad  
 
X to the excutioner style, cuts and blends  
Like a syringe hangin' you from each of ya limbs  
See me comin' through ya party hard  
Without no bodyguard

Nothing but my own mistakes 
Staring back at me 
 
 
Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind 
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down 
Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind 
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down 
 
I've lied 
To you 
This is the last smile 
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you 
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down) 
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind) 
For sake of being with you 
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down) 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
 
Why I stayed with you 
Just push away 
No matter what you see 
You're still so blind to me 
 
 
I've tried 
Like you 
To do everything you wanted to 
This is the last time 
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you 
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down) 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie 
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwind) 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
 
Why I stayed with you 
Just push away 
No matter what you see 
You're still so blind to me 
 
Reverse phsycology's failing miserably 
It's so hard to be, left all alone 
Telling you is the only chance for me 
there's nothing left but, to turn and face you 
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see 
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me 
Asking why... 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie (why) 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
 
Why I stayed with you 
Just push away 
No matter what you see 
You're still so blind to me 
Why I stayed with you 
Just push away 
No matter what you see 
You're still so blind to me</field>

I'm picking me apart again 
You all assume 
I'm safe here in my room 
Unless I try to start again 
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 
'cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused 
 
I don't know what's worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
I don't know why I instigate 
And say what I don't mean 
I don't know how I got this way 
I know it's not alright 
So I'm breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit tonight 
 
Clutching my cure 
I tightly lock the door 
I try to catch my breath again 
I hurt much more than any time before 
I have no options left again 
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 
'cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused 
 
I don't know what's worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
I don't know why I instigate

I don't know how I got this way 
I'll never be alright 
So I'm breaking the habit 
I'm breaking the habit tonight 
 
I'll paint it on the walls 
'cause I'm the one at fault 
I'll never fight again 
And this is how it ends 
 
I don't know what's worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean 
I don't know how I got this way 
I'll never be alright

            <field name="lyrics">It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
 
Something has been taken from deep inside of me 
A secret I've kept locked away 
No one can ever see 
Wounds so deep they never show 
They never go away 
Like moving pictures in my head 
For years and years they've played 
 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
I would take all the shame to the grave 
 
It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
 
Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past 
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have 
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back 
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past 
 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
I would take all the shame to the grave 
 
Just washing it aside 
All of the helplessness inside 
Pretending I don't feel misplaced 
Is so much simpler than change 
 
It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
 
It's easier to run 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made 
It's easier to go 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would

I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel

Face away and pretend I'm not

Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal this damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored 
 
I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident 
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can 
But sometimes I don't make sense 
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt 
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out 
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
You face away and pretend I'm not

Put all pain you gave to me on display

Hearing your name the memories come back again 
I remember when it started happening 
I see you n' every thought I had and then 
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them 
And I knew as they escaped away 
I was committing myself to em n' everyday 
I regret saying those things 'cause now I see that I

Wondering what I think of you well I protect you out of courtesy 
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away 
Afraid to say what was on my mind 
Afraid to say what I need to say 
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around 
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down 
But I've had too many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand 
So I wait till the upper hand is mine 
 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not, watch it drop 
Making your heart stop 
Just before you hit the floor 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not, missed your shot 
Making your heart stop 
You think you've won 
And then it's all gone 
 
So many people like me that put so much trust in all your lies 
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside 
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long 
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on 
There are so many things you say that make me feel you cross the line 
What goes up will surely fall, and I am counting down the time 
'Cause I've had so many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand 
So I waiting until the upper hand is mine 
 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not, watch it drop 
Making your heart stop 
Just before you hit the floor 
One minute you're on top

Making your heart stop 
You think you've won 
And then it's all gone 
And then it's all gone 
And then it's all gone 
And then it's all gone 
Now it's all gone 
I know I'll never trust a single thing you say 
You realize you divide us but you lied anyway 
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all 
But what goes up has got to fall 
 
One minute you're on top 
The next you're not, watch it drop 
Making your heart stop 
Just before you hit the floor

            <field name="lyrics">When I pretend everything is what I want it to be 
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see 
When I pretend I can forget about the criminal I am 
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can, 
But I can't pretend this is the way it will stay,  
I'm just trying to bend the truth 
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be so I'm 
Lying my way from you 
 
(No, no turning back now) 
I want to be pushed aside so let me go (no, no turning back now) 
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone (no turning back now) 
Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see (no, no turning back now) 
The very worst part of you is me 
 
I remember what they taught to me 
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be 
Remember listening to all of that and this again 
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in 
And now you think this person really is me and I'm 
(Trying to bend the truth) 
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away 
'Cause I'm lying my way from you 
 
(No, no turning back now) 
I want to be pushed aside so let me go (no, no turning back now) 
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone (no turning back now) 
Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see (no, no turning back now) 
The very worst part of you 
The very worst part of you 
Is me 
 
This isn't what I wanted to be 
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me 
Like this 
 
This isn't what I wanted to be 
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me

Come, coming at you, 
Come, coming at you, 
Peep the style and the kids checking for it 
The number one question is how could you ignore it 
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks 
With raps that got you backing this up like (rewind that) 
We're just rolling with the rhythm 
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division 
With these non-stop lyrics of life living 
Not to forgotten but still unforgiven 
But in the meantime there are those who want to 
Talk this and that, so I suppose 
It gets to a point feelings gotta get hurt 
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt 
 
Try to give you warning but everyone ignores me 
(Told you everything loud and clear) 
But nobody's listening call to you so clearly 
But you don't want to hear me 
(Told you everything loud and clear) 
But nobody's listening 
 
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress 
Handful of anger, held in my chest 
And everything's left is a waste of time 
I hate my rhymes (but hate everyone else's more) 
I'm riding on the back of this pressure 
Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together 
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on 
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on 
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears 
The uphill struggle over the years 
The fear and trash talking 
And the people it was to 
And the people that started it 
Just like you 
 
Try to give you warning but everyone ignores me 
(Told you everything loud and clear) 
But nobody's listening 
Call to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me 
(Told you everything loud and clear) 
But nobody's listening 
 
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress 
Handful of anger, held in my chest 
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears 
Nothing to gain, everything to fear 
 
A heart full of pain, head full of stress 
Handful of anger, held in my chest 
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears 
Nothing to gain, everything to fear 
 
A heart full of pain, a heart full of pain 
Try to give you warning but everyone ignores me 
(Told you everything loud and clear) 
But nobody's listening 
Call to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me 
(Told you everything loud and clear) 
But nobody's listening 
 
A heart full of pain, head full of stress 
But nobody's listening 
Handful of anger, held in my chest 
Nobody's listening 
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears 
Nobody's listening 
Nothing to gain, everything to fear 
But nobody's listening

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface 
I don't know what you're expecting of me 
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes 
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow 
 
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there 
Become so tired, so much more aware 
By becoming this all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you 
 
Can't you see that you're smothering me? 
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control 
'Cause everything that you thought I would be 
Has fallen apart right in front of you 
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow 
And every second I waste is more than I can take! 
 
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there 
Become so tired, so much more aware 
By becoming this all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you 
 
And I know I may end up failing too 
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you 
 
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there 
Become so tired, so much more aware 
By becoming this all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you

I had nothing to say  
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me 
(I was confused) 
And I let it all out to find that I'm not the only person with these things in mind (inside of me) 
But all the vacancy the words revealed 
Is the only real thing that I got left to feel (nothing to lose) 
Just stuck, hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own, 
And the fault is my own 
 
I want to heal, I want to feel, 
What I thought was never real 
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain 'til it's gone) 
I want to heal, I want to feel 
Like I'm close to something real 
I want to find something I've wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 
 
And I've got nothing to say 
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face (I was confused)  
Looking everywhere only to find that it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind (so what am I?) 
What do I have but negativity? 
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me (nothing to lose) 
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own, 
And the fault is my own 
 
I want to heal, I want to feel, 
What I thought was never real 
I want to let go of the pain I've held so long (erase all the pain 'till it's gone) 
I want to heal, I want to feel 
Like I'm close to something real 
I want to find something I've wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 
 
I will never know myself until I do this on my own 
And I will never feel, 
Anything else until my wounds are healed 
I will never be 
Anything 'til I break away from me 
And I will break away, and find myself today 
 
I want to heal, I want to feel 
What I thought was never real 
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain til it's gone) 
I want to heal, I want to feel, 
Like I'm close to something real 
I want to find something I've wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 
 
I want to heal I want to feel like I'm, 
Somewhere I belong, 
I want to heal I want to feel like I'm somewhere I belong

            <field name="lyrics">It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
 
Something has been taken from deep inside of me 
A secret I've kept locked away 
No one can ever see 
Wounds so deep they never show 
They never go away 
Like moving pictures in my head 
For years and years they've played 
 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
I would take all the shame to the grave 
 
It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
 
Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past 
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have 
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back 
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past 
 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
I would take all the shame to the grave 
 
Just washing it aside 
All of the helplessness inside 
Pretending I don't feel misplaced 
Is so much simpler than change 
 
It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
 
It's easier to run 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made 
It's easier to go 
If I could change I would take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could stand up and take the blame I would 
I would take all the shame to the grave</field>

Hand grenade pins in every line 
Throw 'em up and let something shine 
Going out of my fucking mind 
 
Filthy mouth, no excuse 
Find a new place to hang this noose 
String me up from atop these roofs 
Knot it tight so I won't get loose 
 
Truth is you can stop and stare 
Bled myself out and no one cares 
Dug a trench out, laid down there 
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere 
 
Yeah, someone pour it in 
Make it a dirt dance floor again 
Say your prayers and stomp it out 
When they bring that chorus in 
 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
 
I bleed it out 
Go, stop the show 
Choppy words in a sloppy flow 
Shotgun opera, lock and load 
 
Cock it back and then watch it go 
Mama, help me, I've been cursed 
Death is rolling in every verse 
Candy paint on his brand new hearse 
 
Can't contain him; 
He knows he works 
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie 
Doesn't matter how hard I try 
Half the words don't mean a thing 
 
And I know that I won't be satisfied 
So, why try ignoring him? 
Make it a dirty dance floor again 
Say your prayers and stomp it out 
When they bring that chorus in 
 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
 
I bleed it out 
I've opened up these scars 
I'll make you face this 
I've pulled myself so far 
I'll make you face this now 
 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away

I've given up 
I'm sick of feeling 
Is there nothing you can say?

Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me! 
 
I don't know what to take 
Thought I was focused, but I'm scared 
I'm not prepared 
I hyperventilate 
Looking for help somehow, somewhere

I got to say something 
Lightweights stepping aside, 
When we come in 
Feel it in your chest 
The syllables get pumping 
People on the street 
They panic and start running 
Words on loose leaf 
Sheet complete coming 
I jump on my mind 
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping 
Healing the blind 
I promise to let the sun in 
Sick of the dark ways 
We march to the drumming 
Jump when they tell us 
They want to see jumping 
Fuck that, I want to 
See some fist pumping 
Risk something 
Take back what's yours 
Say something that you know 
They might attack you for 
'Cause I'm sick of being treated 
Like I had before 
Like it's stupid standing for 
What I'm standing for 
Like this war is really just 
A different brand of war 
Like it doesn't cater the rich 
And an abandon the poor 
Like they understand you 
In the back of the jet 
When you can't put gas in your tank 
These fuckers are laughing their way 
To the bank and cashing their check 
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect 
 
For a leader so nervous 
In an obvious way 
Stuttering and mumbling 
For nightly news to replay 
And the rest of the world 
Watching at the end of the day 
In the living room laughing 
Like what did he say? 
 
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen 
 
In my living room watching 
But I am not laughing 
'Cause when it gets tense 
I know what might happen 
The world is cold 
The bold men take action 
Have to react 
Or get blown into fractions 
Ten years old is something to see 
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep 
Taken and bound and found later under a tree 
I wonder if he thought the "next one could be me" 
Do you see? 
The soldiers they're out today 
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away 
It's ironic 
At times like this you pray 
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday 
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads 
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes 
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know 
But enough pride inside not to let that show 
My brother had a book he would hold with pride 
A little red cover with a broken spine 
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside 
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die 
 
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away 
Stuttering and mumbling 
For nightly news to replay 
And the rest of the world 
Watching at the end of the day 
Both scared and angry 
Like what did he say? 
 
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed 
And don't resent me 
And when you're feeling empty 
Keep me in your memory 
Leave out all the rest 
Leave out all the rest 
 
Forgetting 
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well 
Pretending 
Someone else can come and save me from myself 
I can't be who you are 
I can't be who you are</field>

Through the windows, up the stairs 
Chilling rain 
Like an ocean everywhere 
Don't wanna reach for me, do you? 
I mean nothin' to you 
The little things give you away 
And now there will be no mistakin' 
The levees are breakin' 
 
All you've ever wanted 
Was someone to truly look up to you 
And six feet under water 
I do 
 
Hope decays 
Generations disappear 
Washed away 
As a nation simply stares 
 
Don't wanna reach for me do you 
I mean nothin' to you 
The little things give you away 
But there will be no mistakin' 
The levees are breakin' 
 
All you've ever wanted 
Was someone to truly look up to you 
And six feet under water 
I do 
All you've ever wanted 
Was someone to truly look up to you 
And six feet under ground now 
Now I 
Now I do 
 
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 
Little things give you away 
Little things give you away 
Little things give you away 
Little things give you away

In your lies? 
Do you tell yourself "I don't realize"? 
 
Your crusade's a disguise 
Replace freedom with fear 
You trade money for lives

No, no more sorrow 
I've paid for your mistakes 
Your time is borrowed 
Your time has come to be replaced 
 
I see pain 
I see need 
I see liars and thieves 
Abused power with greed 
I had hope 
I believed 
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived 
 
You will pay for what you've done 
 
No, no more sorrow 
I've paid for your mistakes 
Your time is borrowed 
Your time has come to be replaced 
 
Thieves and hypocrites! 
Thieves and hypocrites! 
Thieves and hypocrites! 
 
No, no more sorrow

And blew away as I collapsed, so cold 
 
A black wind took them away from sight 
And now the darkness over day, that night 
And the clouds above move closer 
Looking so dissatisfied 
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing 
 
I used to be my own protection, but not now 
Cause my path has lost direction, somehow 
A black wind took you away from sight 
And now the darkness over day, that night 
 
And the clouds above move closer 
Looking so dissatisfied 
And the ground below grew colder 
As they put you down inside 
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing 
 
So now you're gone, and I was wrong 
I never knew what it was like to be alone 
 
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day 
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day 
On a Valentine's Day (I used to be my own protection) 
On a Valentine's Day (but not now)

Erase myself 
And let go of what I've done 
 
Put to rest what you thought of me 
While I clean this slate 
With the hands of uncertainty 
So let mercy come and wash away 
What I've done 
 
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become 
Erase myself 
And let go of what I've done 
 
For what I've done 
I start again 
And whatever pain may come 
Today this ends 
I'm forgiving what I've done

Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact 
That everyone can see these scars 
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel 
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you 
To just believe this is real 
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend I'm not 
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got 
 
I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal this damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored 
 
I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident 
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can 
But sometimes I don't make sense 
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt 
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out 
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
You face away and pretend I'm not 
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got 
 
I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored

Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored

You're gonna listen to me like it or not 
Right now, hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me like it or not

Alone with a sinking feeling 
I saw through the words you said 
To the secrets you've been keeping 
It's written upon your face 
All the lies how they cut so deeply 
You can't get enough you take 
And take and take and never say 
 
No, you've gotta get it inside 
You push it back down 
You push it back down 
No, you'll never get it inside 
Push it back down black out blood in your eye 
 
You say that it's not your fault 
And swear that I am mistaken 
You said it's not what it seems 
No remorse for the trust you're breaking 
You run but then back you fall 
Suffocate in the mess you're making 
You can't get enough you take 
And take and take and take and take 
Fuck it are you listening? 
 
No, you've gotta get it inside 
You push it back down 
You push it back down 
No, you'll never get it inside 
Push it back down 
You push it back down 
No, you've gotta get it inside 
You push it back down 
You push it back down 
No, you'll never get it inside 
Push it back down 
Black out blood in your eye 
 
Floating down, as colors fill the light 
We look up from the ground 
In fields of paper white 
And floating up you pass us in the night 
A future gazing out a past to overwrite 
So come down far below 
We've been waiting to collect the things you know 
Come down far below 
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go 
 
Come down 
Oh 
Come down 
Oh 
Come down

But you were lost in the beating of the storm 
But in the end we were made to be apart 
In separate chambers of the human heart

Waiting for the end to come 
Wishing I had strength to stand 
This is not what I had planned 
It's out of my control 
 
Flying at the speed of light 
Thoughts we're spinning in my head 
So many things were left unsaid 
It's hard to let you go 
 
(Oh) I know what it takes to move on 
I know how it feels to lie 
All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what I haven't got 
 
Sitting in an empty room 
Trying to forget the past 
This was never meant to last 
I wish it wasn't so 
 
(Oh) I know what it takes to move on 
 
I know how it feels to lie 
All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what I haven't got 
 
Yeah, yeah 
What was left when that fire was gone? 
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong 
All caught up in the eye of the storm 
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on 
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said 
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead 
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin? 
The hardest part of ending is starting again! 
 
All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what I haven't got 
 
This is not the end 
This is not the beginning 
Just a voice like a riot 
Rocking every revision 
But you listen to the tone 
And the violent rhythm 
Though the words sound steady 
Something empty's within 'em 
(Holding on to what I haven't got) 
 
We say "Yeah!" 
With fists flying up in the air 
Like we're holding onto something 
That's invisible there 
'Cause we're living at the mercy of 
The pain and the fear 
Until we get it, forget it 
Let it all disappear

I am not a pattern to be followed 
The pill that I'm on 
Is a tough one to swallow 
I'm not a criminal 
Not a role model 
Not a born leader 
I'm a tough act to follow 
 
I am not the fortunate and the fame 
Or the same verse I'm telling you to forfeit the game 
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain 
And I found out the underbelly is sicker than it seems 
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse 
'Cause even the blueprint is a gift and a curse 
'Cause once you have the theory of how the thing works 
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first 
 
And I'm not a robot 
I'm not a monkey 
I will not dance even if the beat's funky 
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk ya'll 
Stop talking, start tryna catch up mother fucker 
 
And all the people say 
Aah, aah, aah 
 
Tryin' to catch up mother fucker 
 
Aah, aah, aah 
 
Lauren said money changes situations 
Big said it increases the complication 
Kane said don't stab, I ain't the one 
Chuck said that an Uzi weigh a mother fucking ton 
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me 
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me 
I'm awfully underrated 
But can be corrected 
 
And so this second I'm gonna save it for the record 
I am the opposite of whack 
Opposite of weak 
Opposite of slack 
Standing in the heat 
Standing in a crack 
Closest to a beat, far from a punk 
Ya'll outta stop talking, start tryna catch up mother fucker 
And all the people say 
Aah, aah, aah 
 
Trying to catch up mother fucker 
 
Aah, aah, aah

Come for me 
I'll be gone 
 
Oh when they come for me

Filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows 
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of peoples normally humane 
 
Of sending men home from the dark and bloody battlefields 
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged

Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love

Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus 
And you've got to make it stop 
 
To save face, how low can you go? 
Talk a lotta game, but yet you don't know 
Static on the wind, makes us all say whoa 
The people up top push the people down low 
Get down, and obey every word 
Steady, get in line if you haven't yet heard 
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd 
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt 
If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know 
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload 
And no one make a move, unless my people say so 
Got everything outta control, now everybody go 
 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 
Feel alone, final blow 
We, the animals, take control 
Hear us now, clear and tall 
Wretches and kings, we come for you 
 
So keep face, how slow can you go? 
Talk a lotta shit, and yet you don't know 
Fire on the wind, makes you all say whoa 
The people up top and the people down low 
Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that 
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at 
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat 
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact 
So get with the combat, I'm lettin' them know 
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no 
So push the button, let the whole thing blow 
Spinning everything outta control, now everybody go 
 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 
Feel alone, final blow 
We, the animals, take control 
Hear us now, clear and tall 
Wretches and kings, we come for you 
Still alone, fight our blow 
Filthy animals beat down low 
Steel and bone, black and blue 
Run at the sunshine, we come for you 
 
From the front to the back and to side to side 
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high 
Front to the back and the side to side 
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high 
Front to the back and the side to side 
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high 
Front to the back and the side to side 
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high 
Front to the back and the side to side 
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high

All that I needed 
Was the one thing I couldn't find 
And you were there at the turn 
Waiting to let me know 
 
We're building it up 
To break it back down 
We're building it up 
To burn it down 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
 
The colors conflicted 
As the flames, climbed into the clouds 
I wanted to fix this 
But couldn't stop from tearing it down 
And you were there at the turn 
Caught in the burning glow 
And I was there at the turn 
Waiting to let you know 
 
We're building it up 
To break it back down 
We're building it up 
To burn it down 
We can't wait 
To burn it to the ground 
 
You told me yes 
You held me high 
And I believed when you told that lie 
I played soldier, you played king 
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring 
You lost that right, to hold that crown 
I built you up, but you let me down 
So when you fall, I'll take my turn 
And fan the flames 
As your blazes burn 
 
And you were there at the turn 
Waiting to let me know 
 
We're building it up 
To break it back down 
We're building it up 
To burn it down 
We can't wait

Never gonna be another one, no

Then sorrow, then sickness 
Then the shock when you flip it on me 
So hollow, so vicious 
So afraid I couldn't let myself see 
That I could never be held 
Back up, no, I'll hold myself 
Check the rep, yep you know my rail 
Forget the rest let them know my hell 
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell, 
Kept respect up the vets stay their, 
Let the rest be to tell they tale 
That I was there saying 
 
And these promises broken 
Deep, feeble 
Each word gets lost in the echo 
So one last lie I can see through 
This time I finally let you 
Go, go, go 
 
Test my will, test my heart 
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up 
Y'all go hard, I go smart 
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh? 
I've seen that frustration 
Big cross, they're lost but don't know 
And I've come back unshaken 
Let down, I've lived and let go 
So you can let it be known 
I don't hold back, I hold my own 
I can't be mad, I can't be calm 
I can't sing flat, it ain't my tone 
I can't fall back, I came too far 
Hold myself up and love my scars 
Let the bells ring wherever they are 
'Cause I was there saying 
 
And these promises broken 
Deep, feeble

So one last lie I can see through 
This time I finally let you 
Go, go, go 
 
No, you can tell 'em all now 
I don't back up, I don't back down 
I don't fold up, and I don't bow 
I don't roll over, don't know how 
I don't care where the enemies are 
Can't be stopped, all I know go hard! 
Won't forget how I got this far 
And every time, saying 
 
And these promises broken 
Deep, feeble 
Each word gets lost in the echo

With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun 
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come 
Original style, like an eight of eight drum 
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run 
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets 
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got 
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it 
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it 
 
Like that 
 
It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right 
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite 
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right 
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights 
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose 
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes 
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you 
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view 
Like that 
 
Give me the strength of the rising sun 
Give me the truth of the words unsung 
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing 
Bring me to kingdom come 
 
This is something for your people on the block to 
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need 
Like Papa, who shot ya 
Seperate the weak from the obsolete 
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors 
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all 
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying 
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up 
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up? 
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing 
With the big guns only get you slain 
I ain't playing, I'm just saying 
You ain't got a sliver of a chance 
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents 
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down 
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down 
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you 
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture? 
It's like that 
 
We swim against the rising waves 
That crash against the shore 
The body bends until it breaks 
The early morning sings no more 
 
So rest your head 
It's time to sleep 
And dream of what's in store 
The body bends until it breaks 
And sings again no more 
'Cause time has torn the flesh away 
The early morning sings no more</field>

These snakes in the grass, supplying the venom 
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em 
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden 
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em 
Go on already hit 'em, yeah you gotta be kiddin' 
Wanna talk about a victim, I'ma put you there with 'em!

You were that foundation 
Never gonna be another one, no 
I followed, so taken 
So conditioned I could never let go 
Then sorrow, then sickness 
Then the shock when you flip it on me 
So hollow, so vicious 
So afraid I couldn't let myself see 
That I could never be held 
Back up, no, I'll hold myself 
Check the rep, yep you know my rail 
Forget the rest let them know my hell 
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell, 
Kept respect up the vets stay their, 
Let the rest be to tell they tale 
That I was there saying 
 
[Chorus] 
And these promises broken 
Deep, feeble 
Each word gets lost in the echo 
So one last lie I can see through 
This time I finally let you 
Go, go, go 
 
Test my will, test my heart 
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up 
Y'all go hard, I go smart 
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh? 
I've seen that frustration 
Big cross, they're lost but don't know 
And I've come back unshaken 
Let down, I've lived and let go 
So you can let it be known 
I don't hold back, I hold my own 
I can't be mad, I can't be calm 
I can't sing flat, it ain't my tone 
I can't fall back, I came too far 
Hold myself up and love my scars 
Let the bells ring wherever they are 
'Cause I was there saying 
 
[Chorus] 
 
No, you can tell 'em all now 
I don't back up, I don't back down 
I don't fold up, and I don't bow 
I don't roll over, don't know how 
I don't care where the enemies are 
Can't be stopped, all I know go hard! 
Won't forget how I got this far 
And every time, saying

They didn't say before 
 
You could never see it

Wanna skate and play it safe

So let me break this fucker down for ya'

Where to put your paranoia 
You joke and I don't half a half a sucker bone to throw ya 
I'm disgusted by what can make you tuck your tail below ya 
And no, I'm not your soldier 
I'm not taking any orders 
I'm a five-star general infantry controller

The light on the horizon 
Was brighter yesterday 
Shadows floating over 
Skies begin to fade 
You said it was forever 
But then it slipped away 
Standing at the end of 
The final masquerade 
 
All I ever wanted 
Secrets that you keep 
All you ever wanted 
The truth I couldn't speak 
'Cause I can't see forgiveness 
And you can't see the crime 
And we both keep on waiting 
For what we left behind

No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me 
Smoke scream, we're going in flames 
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be 
Say it's time for things to change 
We arrange that dope product we built cheap 
Anything if it's more to gain 
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep 
Until no more remains, but I'm still me 
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio 
You record companies kill me 
Try to force me to strain it, no way 
They got the gall to say "yo, how real can real be?" 
You feel me? you will see, the greed will be to blame 
Greedy for the fame, TV or a name 
Media, the game, to me your all the same 
You're guilty 
 
You're guilty all the same 
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame

Oh you don't know what you've got 
No you don't know what you've got 
It's your battle to be fought 
No you don't know what you've got

Only war 
Victory decides who's wrong or right 
It will not cease 
Only grow 
You better be prepared to fight 
 
And it will not apologize 
For laying down your life 
 
War 
 
There's no pain 
It was there 
And it has become your only right 
And words you lost 
In your despair 
Forever black each on your life 
 
And it will not apologize 
For laying down your life 
 
War, destroy you 
 
It needs no sign to justify 
Laying down your life 
 
War, destroy you 
 
War</field>

Marchin with no steppin' 
Murder with no killin' 
Illin' every direction 
First, no sequel 
Do the math, no equal 
John with no Yoko 
More power, less people 
 
And no, I'm not afraid of that 
Print it in your paperback 
Every rap is made in fact 
To act as a delayed attack 
Every phrase a razor blade 
That's saved until they play it back 
To slay and leave em laying on the pavement 
Bang, fade to black 
 
In the wastelands of today 
When there's nothing left to lose 
And and there's nothing more to take 
But you force yourself to choose 
 
In the wastelands of today 
Where tomorrow disappears 
While the future slips away 
And your hope turns into fear 
In the wastelands of today 
 
Roll credits, you get it 
The show's done 
They're talking for just talking 
But meaning, they got none 
None of 'em come proper 
They talk like a shotgun 
But how many got bred with integrity? 
Not one 
 
So no, I'm not afraid 
To see these suckers hold a blade to me 
Ain't no way to shake the ground 
I built before you came to be 
Take it how you take it 
I'm the opposite of vacancy 
And this is not negotiation 
Y'all can hate and wait and see 
 
In the wastelands of today 
When there's nothing left to lose 
And and there's nothing more to take 
But you force yourself to choose 
 
In the wastelands of today 
When tomorrow disappears 
When the future slips away 
And your hope turns into fear 
In the wastelands of today 
 
In the wastelands of today 
When there's nothing left to lose 
And and there's nothing more to take 
But you force yourself to choose 
 
In the wastelands of today 
When tomorrow disappears 
When the future slips away 
And your hope turns into fear 
In the wastelands of today</field>

Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary 
Wish that I could slow things down 
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic

Thinking everything's about me 
Yeah, I drive myself crazy 
'Cause I can't escape the gravity 
 
I'm holding on 
Why is everything so heavy? 
Holding on 
So much more than I can carry 
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down 
If I just let go, I'd be set free 
Holding on 
Why is everything so heavy?

You say that I'm paranoid 
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me 
It's not like I made the choice 
To let my mind stay so fucking messy 
I know I'm not the center of the universe 
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same 
I know I'm not the center of the universe

And a long memory 
I've been searching for an answer 
Always just out of reach 
Blood on the floor 
Sirens repeat 
I've been searching for the courage 
To face my enemies 
 
When they turn down the lights 
 
I hear my battle symphony 
All the world in front of me 
If my armor breaks 
I'll fuse it back together 
Battle symphony 
Please just don't give up on me 
And my eyes are wide awake 
 
For my battle symphony 
For my battle symphony 
 
They say that I don't belong 
Say that I should retreat 
That I'm marching to the rhythm 
Of a lonesome defeat 
But the sound of your voice 
Puts the pain in reverse 
No surrender, no illusions 
And for better or worse 
 
When they turn down the lights 
I hear my battle symphony 
All the world in front of me 
If my armor breaks 
I'll fuse it back together 
Battle symphony 
Please just don't give up on me 
And my eyes are wide awake 
 
If I fall, get knocked down 
Pick myself up off the ground 
If I fall, get knocked down 
Pick myself up off the ground 
 
When they turn down the lights 
 
I hear my battle symphony 
All the world in front of me 
If my armor breaks 
I'll fuse it back together 
Battle symphony 
Please just don't give up on me 
And my eyes are wide awake

In a sky of a million stars

Who cares when someone's time runs out? 
If a moment is all we are 
We're quicker, quicker 
Who cares if one more light goes out? 
Well I do 
 
The reminders pull the floor from your feet 
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh 
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair 
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

Watching the raindrops blinking red and white 
Thinking are you back on the ground 
There with a fire burning in your eyes 
I only halfway apologize 
 
And I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
Sometimes things refuse to go the way we planned 
Oh I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There will be a day that you will understand 
You will understand 
 
After a while you may forget 
But just in case the memories cross your mind 
You couldn't know this when I left 
Under the fire of your angry eyes 
I never wanted to say goodbye 
 
So I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
Sometimes things refuse to go the way we planned 
Oh I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There will be a day that you will understand 
You will understand 
 
Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up 
Tried to call home but nobody would wake up 
Switch your time zones can't pick the bass up 
I just passed out by the time you wake up 
Best things come to those who wait 
And it's time to get pumped on any road you take 
Don't ever have a problem make no mistake 
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away 
 
I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There are things we have to do that we can't stand 
Oh I'll be sorry for now 
That I couldn't be around 
There will be a day that you will understand 
Oh I'll be sorry for now

Pumpkins scream in the dead of night 
This is Halloween, everybody make a scene 
Trick or treat 'til the neighbors gonna die of 
fright! 
It's our town 
Everybody scream. 
In this town of Halloween... 
I am the one hiding under your bed, 
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red. 
I am the one hiding under your stairs 
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair. 
This is Halloween, this is Halloween, 
Halloween...(etc) 
In this town, we call home, 
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song! 
In this town, don't we love it now 
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise. 
'Round that corner, man, 
Hiding in a trashcan 
Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll 
Scream! This is Halloween, 
Red 'n black, slimy green... 
Aren't you scared? Well, that's just fine! 
Say it once, say it twice, 
Take the chance and roll the dice 
Ride with the moon in the dead of night (oh) 
Everybody scream, everybody scream 
In our town of Halloween. 
I am the clown with the tearaway face... 
Here in a flash and gone without a trace. 
I am the who when you call 
Who's there? 
I am the wind blowing through your hair. 
I am the shadow on the moon at night, 
filling your dreams to the brim with fright. 
This is Halloween, This is Halloween 
HALLOWEEN! HALLOWEEN! 
Tender Lumplings everywhere 
Life's no fun without a good scare. 
That's our job, but we're not mean 
In our town of Halloween. 
In this town 
don't we love it now? 
Everyone's waiting for the next surprise. 
Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back and 
Scream 
like a banshee make you jump 
out of your SKIN! 
This is Halloween, 
Everyone scream, won't ya 
Please make way for a special guy... 
Our man Jack is 
King of the Pumpkin Patch. 
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King now. 
This is Halloween, THIS IS HALLOWEEN (etc.)

Reach out and touch faith 
Feeling unknown 
And you"re all alone 
Flesh and bone 
By the telephone 
Lift up the receiver 
I'll make you a believer 
I will deliver 
You know I'm a forgiver 
Reach out and touch faith 
Your own personal jesus 
Reach out and touch faith</field>

I didn't have to sell you 
You threw your money in the pissing well 
You do just what they tell you 
Repent, that's what I'm talking about 
I shed the skin to feed the fake 
Repent, that's what I'm talking about 
Whose mistake am I anyway? 
Cut the head off 
Grows back hard 
I am the hydra 
Now you'll see your star 
Prick your finger it is done 
The moon has now eclipsed the sun 
Angel has spread his wings 
The time has come for bitter things 
Repent, that's what he's talking about 
I shed the skin to feed the fake 
Repent, that's what he's talking about 
Whose mistake am I anyway? 
Cut the head off

Our antichrist is almost here 
When you are suffering 
Know that I have betrayed you</field>

Because I wasn't invited to it anyway 
You said I tasted famous so I drew you a heart 
But now I'm not an artist, I'm a fucking work of art 
I got an F and a C, and I got a K too 
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like u 
You wanted perfect, you got your perfect 
Now I'm too perfect for someone like you 
I was a dandy in your ghetto with a snow white smile 
But you'll never be as perfect whatever you do 
What's my name? What's my name? 
Ah-ah, Ah-ah 
Hold the S because I am an ain't

Hold the S because I am an ain't

I am bone top, a deathset, on a mop stick 
You infected me to diamonds, I took all your shit 
Your sell-by-date expired so you had to be sold 
I'm a suffer-genius and then a sex symbol 
You wanted perfect, you got your perfect 
Now I'm too perfect for someone like you

Won't you drag him to the shed 
And unload six rounds in their fucking face?

All the vases are so broken

Trade them in for dollar bills 
Cake on some more make-up to 
Cover up all those lines 
Wake up and stop shaking 
Cuz you're just wasting time 
Don't you want some of this? 
Don't you need some of this? 
You take but cannot be given 
You ride but cannot be ridden 
Pinch this tiny heart of mine 
Wrap it up in soiled twine 
You never read what you've written 
I'll be your lover, I'll be forever 
I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when i'm high 
Don't you want some of this? 
Don't you need some of this? 
You shove your hair down my throat 
I feel your fingers in me 
Tear this bitter fruit to mess 
And wrap it in your soiled dress 
Now you must spit out the seeds

I'll show you what it feels like with out it 
This time I won't hesitate to kill to protect what I believe in 
This time I won't hesitate to kill to protect what I believe in 
I get by now I'm not really dead 
but i really needed someone to save me 
leaving me alone to die 
is worse than having the guts to kill me 
If you don't know what forever feels like 
I'll show you what it feels like with out it 
I'll show you what it feels like without it

Repent, that's what he's talking about 
Whose mistake am I anyway? 
Cut the head off 
Grows back hard 
I am the hydra 
Now you'll see your star 
The time has come it is quite clear 
Our antichrist is almost here 
When you are suffering 
Know that I have betrayed you</field>

Do I follow my instincts blindly? 
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams 
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening? 
Do I sit here and try to stand it? 
Or do I try to catch them red-handed? 
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness 
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? 
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin 
I make the right moves but I'm lost within 
I put on my daily facade but then 
I just end up getting hurt again 
By myself, I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can't rely on myself 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can't rely on myself 
I can't hold on 
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
(To anything watching everything spin) 
With thoughts of failure sinking in 
If I turn my back I'm defenseless 
And to go blindly seems senseless 
If I hide my pride and let it all go on then they'll 
Take from me 'til everything is gone 
If I let them go I'll be outdone 
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun 
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer 
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer 
By myself, I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can't rely on myself 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can't rely on myself 
I can't hold on 
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
(To anything watching everything spin) 
With thoughts of failure sinking in 
How do you think, I've lost so much? 
I'm so afraid, I'm out of touch 
How do you expect, I will know what to do? 
When all I know is what you tell me to 
Don't you know, I can't tell you how to make it go? 
No matter what I do, how hard I try 
I can't seem to convince myself why 
I'm stuck on the outside 
Don't you know, I can't tell you how to make it go? 
No matter what I do, how hard I try 
I can't seem to convince myself why 
I'm stuck on the outside 
I can't hold on 
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
(To anything watching everything spin) 
With thoughts of failure sinking in 
I can't hold on 
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)

I can't hold on

            <field name="lyrics">The sun did not shine. 
It was too wet to play. 
So we sat in the house 
All that cold, cold, wet day 
I sat there with Sally. 
We sat there, we two. 
And I said "How I wish 
We had something to do!" 
Too wet to go out 
And too cold to play ball. 
So we sat in the house. 
We did nothing at all. 
So all we could do was to 
Sit! 
Sit! 
Sit! 
Sit! 
And we did not like it. 
Not one little bit. 
*BUMP* 
And then 
Something went bump! 
How that bump made us jump! 
We looked! 
Then we saw him step in on the mat! 
We looked! 
And we saw him! 
The Cat in the Hat! 
And he said to us, 
"Why do you sit there like that?" 
"I know it is wet 
And the sun is not sunny. 
But we can have 
Lots of good fun that is funny!" 
"I know some good games we could play," 
Said the cat. 
"I know some new tricks," 
Said the Cat in the Hat. 
"A lot of good tricks. 
I will show them to you. 
Your mother 
Will not mind at all if I do." 
Then Sally and I 
Did not know what to say. 
Our mother was out of the house 
For the day. 
But our fish said, "No! No! 
Make that cat go away! 
Tell that Cat in the Hat 
You do NOT want to play. 
You should not be here. 
You should not be about. 
You should not be here 
When your mother is out!" 
"Now! Now! Have no fear. 
Have no fear!" said the cat. 
"My tricks are not bad," 
Said the Cat in the Hat. 
"Why, we can have 
Lots of good fun, if you wish, 
With a game that I call 
UP-UP-UP with a fish!" 
"Put me down!" said the fish. 
"This is no fun at all! 
Put me down!" said the fish. 
"I do NOT wish to fall!" 
"Have no fear!" said the cat. 
"I will not let you fall. 
I will hold you up high 
As I stand on a ball. 
With a book in one hand! 
And a cup on my hat! 
But that is not ALL I can do!" 
Said the cat... 
"Look at me! 
Look at me now!" said the cat. 
"With a cup and a cake 
On the top of my hat! 
I can hold TWO books! 
I can hold up the fish! 
And a little toy ship! 
And some milk on a dish! 
And look! 
I can hop up and down on the ball! 
But that is not all! 
Oh, no. 
That is not all... 
"Look at me! 
Look at me! 
Look at me NOW! 
It is fun to have fun 
From up there on the ball. 
And Sally and I, 
We saw ALL the things fall! 
And our fish came down, too. 
He fell into a pot! 
He said, "Do I like this? 
Oh, no! I do not. 
This is not a good game," 
Said out fish as he lit. 
"No, I do not like it, 
Not one little bit!" 
"Now look what you did!" 
Said the fish to the cat. 
"Now look at this house!</field>

Resurrection needs your death 
To happen twice 
Fall on my heart 
And burn and forge 
Your tortured black-smitten 
Into the sharpest, fucking sword 
Don't assume that I'm always with you 
It's just where my mortal body happens to be 
No sineater to slay

Watching monkey suicide 
Sunday aids and church wine wash it away 
Christ consciousness 
Manifest to the golden ratio 
5 or 500 year ago 
We were 15 foot high 
And to die 
Was a bardot bridge(t) 
We never thought we'd cross 
To burn down behind and below 
No sineater to slay 
Us children of cain 
Watching monkey suicide 
Sunday aids and church wine wash it away 
Don't assume that I'm always with you 
It's just where my mortal body happens to be 
So take your little black book 
I see the way that you look in to it 
I'll eat it and I'll cut my tongue 
And all the pages you spread, 
Sweet as honey you said 
But I'm choking on your bitter stories 
No sineater to slay

My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies 
I didn't know what love was on that day 
my heart's a tiny bloodclot 
I picked at it 
it never heals it never goes away 
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye 
we were too dumb to run 
too dead to die 
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye 
we were too dumb to run 
too dead to die 
This was never my world 
you took the angel away 
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay 
This was never my world 
you took the angel away 
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay 
I would have told her then 
she was the only thing 
that I could love in this dying world 
but the simple word "love" itself 
already died and went away 
This was never my world 
you took the angel away 
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay 
This was never my world 
you took the angel away 
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay 
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye 
we were too dumb to run 
too dead to die 
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye 
we were too dumb to run 
too dead to die

This was never my world 
you took the angel away 
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay 
This was never my world 
you took the angel away 
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

Her heart's bloodstained egg 
we didn't handle with care 
it's broken and bleeding 
and we can never repair

TV sells hypocrisy 
It's feeding off of apathy 
Above the surface all is well 
But dig up it and go to hell 
Just put a bullet in my head 
I've already have been left for dead 
Just shut your mouth and close your eyes 
Reality's alive

A pill to make you numb

You'll be deformed in your porn.

But they seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes 
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes

And I know, and I'm coming down 
Fail to see the tragic turn it into magic 
My big top tricks will always make you happy 
But we all know the hat is wearing me 
My bag is in the hat 
It's filled with this and that 
And my visions getting fat 
The rabbit's just a chicken in disguise 
Stars and pills and meatballs dance before our eyes 
They will bite the hand, if it is slower than 
The quickness of there scrutinizing eyes 
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic

I don’t burn 
And I don’t bleed 
Wrap that guilt up deep inside 
Religion has an alibi 
What more 
Could you need? 
Fortune and fame 
Torture and shame 
You still don’t understand 
Glory and blame

This is only a game, this is only a game 
 
(chorus) 
But then our star rushes in, 
Feeling like a child and looking like a woman 
She has been forecast with an attempt to kill herself 
But the ending didn't test well 
I was invited to a beheading today 
I thought I was a butterfly next to your flame 
A rush of panic and the lock has been raped 
This is only a game, this is only a game 
 
Eat me, drink me eat me, drink me 
This is only a game, this is only a game 
But then our star rushes in, 
Feeling like a child and looking like a woman 
She has been forecast with an attempt to kill herself 
But the ending didn't test well 
So picking my skin and my scales 
I see my horror reflected in the sundown of your blank stare 
I see my horror reflected in the sundown of your blank stare 
Eat me, drink me eat me, drink me 
This is only a game, this is only a game</field>

Shadows of the evening 
Crawl across the years 
Ya walk across the floor with a flower in your hand 
Trying to tell me no one understands 
Trade in your hours for a handful dimes 
Gonna' make it, baby, in our prime 
Get together one more time (8x) 
Hey, honey 
You won't have along wait for me now 
I'll be there in just a little while 
You see, I gotta go out in this car with these people and

Get my rocks off.

And i may do you more. 
And i may turn into something, 
That you ain't ready for. 
I might want your body, 
And i might want your bread. 
And i might want your mama, 
To come visit me instead. 
To get my rocks off, 
Get my rocks off the mountain and roll 'em on down. 
Sometimes i dream of chicks, 
To bring me everlasting joy. 
Sometimes i dream of animals, 
Sometimes i dream of boys.

Sometimes raise the dead. 
Sometimes say i just say fuck it all 
And roll back in to bed.

Before our sorceries 
The party has just begun 
Timelapse and dancing and rotting in place, 
And we have reached the high end of low 
The high end of low 
The high end of low 
You can take me, 
The grave can take me 
The earth is waiting to eat us alive 
I love you damaged, 
I need human wreckage 
I have to look up 
Just to see Hell 
Fallen, fallen, fallen from grace now for you 
this is why you should run 
Fallen, fallen, fallen from grace now for you 
This is why you should run 
The core of a woman is where her body 
Chooses to revolve like a corpse 
Centrifugal, melted under the skin, bacteria? 
Into the napalm heart I explode, 
I explode 
I explode 
You can take me, 
The grave can take me 
The earth is waiting to eat us alive 
I love you damaged, 
I need human wreckage 
I have to look up

Fallen, fallen, fallen from grace now for you 
This is why you should run 
Fallen, fallen, fallen from grace now for you 
This is why you should run

No shadows 
No reflections here 
Lie cheek to cheek in your cold embrace. 
It started so tragic as a slaughterhouse 
She pressed the knife against your heart 
And say that 'I love you' so much you must kill me now. 
I love you so much you must kill me now... 
If I was your vampire 
Slim as the moon 
Instead of killing time 
We'll have each other till the sun. 
If I was your vampire 
Death waits for no one. 
Put my hands across your face 
Because I think our time has come. 
Digging your smile apart with my spade tongue 
And the hole is where the heart is 
We built this tomb together 
I will fill it alone. 
Beyond the pale 
Everything's black no turning back 
If I was your vampire 
Slim as the moon 
Instead of killing time 
We'll have each other till the sun. 
If I was your vampire 
Death waits for no one. 
Put my hands across your face 
Because I think our time has come. 
Blood stained sheets in the shape of your heart 
This is where it starts 
This is where it will end 
Here comes the moon again. 
Six nineteen and I know I'm ready. 
Drive me off the mountain 
You'll Burn and I'll eat your ashes. 
Impossible we're seducing our corpse. 
If I was your vampire 
Slim as the moon 
Instead of killing time 
We'll have each other till the sun. 
If I was your vampire 
Death waits for no one. 
Put my hands across your face 
Because I think our time has come. 
This is where it starts 
This is where it will end 
Here comes the moon again.

Sharpen my bones, stab you once for each time 
I thought you were trying to take something 
You'll never be good enough to even look upon 
It's better to push something when it's slipping 
Than to risk being dragged down 
If you want to hit bottom 
And bother trying to take it me with you 
And I won't answer if you call 
Too happy to live in Hell trying to break your fall 
This isn't mine, won't need to change the names 
Everyone around you has murdered someone, something sacred 
Isn't one nail without her under it 
Isn't any white cotton panties that are soaked and 
stained red

I figured to call, and tell you 
a little story that happened to me today 
I was cruising down the fort lauderdale strip.. 
you know, spring 
Break, hell 
You know, you get the picture.. 
and I'm cruising down the street 
And I park my car, and 
I'm playing one of your tapes, and some guy 
Comes up he's wearing this bruce springsteen t-shirt, budweiser 
One hand, marlboro cigarette in the other 
You know, beer and cigarettes.. 
what a man! you get the hint! 
He comes up to me, and him.. 
he and I get into this ten minute 
Debate over whether or not you guys are satanic 
I'm looking at this guy like, "get a life, okay" 
No, I'm serious.. 
I will say one thing 
I'm glad they have people like bruce springsteen for one reason: to 
Get nine million cows off of your back, so you can get the real 
People to come to your shows 
Anyway, I t.. 
I told him that you would send him a really nice love 
Letter, but I forgot/all I gotta do is ask his address his address 
But he declined.. 
what a life, huh? 
Well, all I know is I'm bored, and if I have to watch marcia brady 
Scream "oh, my nose!" one more time today, I think I'm going to 
Get a knife and go kill that bruce springsteen guy 
Well, it's been real, and I'm babbling 
and, no, I have no idea what 
The fucking movie that is, so I guess I don't get my tape, huh? 
Well, have a nice day 
I know.. 
have a nice day: bang! 
Too much of that brady bunch shit 
talk to you later...</field>

Marilyn Manson 
 
Love is a fire. 
Burns down all that it sees. 
Burns down everything. 
Everything you think 
Burns down.. 
everything you say. 
 
She blew me her death-kiss 
And the mouth-marks bled down my eye, 
Like her dying on my windshield. 
I can already feel her worms 
Eating my spine. 
So how can it be this lonely? 
Is this all we get 
for our lives? 
Is love only sweeter when 
one of dies? 
Then I knew that our love was 
just a car crash away. 
I knew that our love was just a car crash away. 
I knew that our love was 
just a car crash away. 
I knew that our love was 
just a car crash away. 
Love is a fire. 
Burns down all that it sees. 
Burns down everything. 
Everything you think 
Burns down.. 
everything you say. 
Love is a fire. 
Burns down all that it sees. 
Burns down everything. 
Everything you think 
Burns down.. 
everything you say. 
I knew that our love was 
just a car crash away. 
Knew that our love was 
just a car crash away. 
Just a car crash away. 
 
I knew that our love was 
just a car crash away. 
I knew that our love was 
just a car crash away. 
Love is a fire. 
Burns down all that it sees. 
Burns down everything. 
Everything you think 
Burns down..

Love is a fire. 
Burns down all that it sees. 
Burns down everything.

We wear lawsuits when we get high, high, high 
I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you 
I hope this hook gets caught in your mouth 
I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you 
Don't say no, just say now 
I like a big car cause I'm a big star 
I'll make a big rock and roll hit 
I'd like to love you but my heart is a sore 
I am, I am, I am so yours 
Ka-Boom, Ka-Boom 
Ka-Boom, Ka-Boom 
Ka-Boom, Ka-Boom 
I'd like to la-la-la-la love you 
Ka-Boom, Ka-Boom 
Ka-Boom, Ka-Boom 
Ka-Boom, Ka-Boom 
I'd like to la-la-la-la love you 
Inhale exhale, lets all hail 
It's a depraved new world 
Inhale exhale, lets all hail 
It's a depraved new world 
I like a big car cause I'm a big star 
I'll make a big rock and roll hit 
I'd like to love you but my heart is a sore 
I am, I am, I am so yours 
I am a big car, and I'm a strip bar 
Call it fake, I call it as good as it gets 
Nothing in this world is for real 
Except you are for me, and I am so yours

I do a crooked little dance with my funny little monkey 
What I want what I want is just your children 
I hate what I have become to escape what I hated being 
Calliopenis envy from your daddy 
You're not gonna hear what he don't want to hear 
What I say disgusts him 
He wants to be me and that scares him 
"Let's do a funny little dance with my funny little monkey" 
The black keys 
Actually, he loves you 
Here is my real head 
Here is my real head 
I wear this f**king mask because you cannot handle me 
Here is my real head 
They try to blink me not to think me 
Don't want to bring me out 
I am the rotten teeth my fists are lined with suckers 
My prison skins an eyesore-mirror-sketch-pad 
I am your son 
Your dad 
You fag 
I am your fad 
Here is my real head 
Here is my real head 
I wear this f**king mask because you cannot handle me 
Here is my real head 
I have to take your voice and and stick my fingers in it 
F**k f**k f**k f**k f**k

And make us a blood pact, babe 
To love and to fuck and to only see ourselves 
And remember this 
Your hotel hall won't be so vacant 
And I can tell that you ain't faking 
Because I take death threats 
Like the best of them 
Would you kill, kill, kill for me? 
I love you enough to ask you again 
Would you kill, kill, kill for me? 
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me 
Kill, kill, kill for me 
Bloody noses are just like roses 
But what happens when we are betrayed? 
Won't you drag him to the shed 
And unload six rounds in their fucking face? 
This is a sacrifice 
Your hotel hall won't be so vacant 
And I can tell that you ain't faking 
Because I take death threats 
Like the best of them 
Would you kill, kill, kill for me? 
I love you enough to ask you again 
Would you kill, kill, kill for me? 
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me

The world that hates me has taken its toll

are all your infants in abortion cribs 
i was born into this 
everything turns to shit 
the boy that you loved 
is the man that you fear 
pray untill you're number, asleep from all your pain 
your apple has been rotting 
tomorrow's turned up dead 
I have it all and I have no choice but to 
I'll make everyone pay and you will see 
you can kill yourself now 
because you're dead in my mind 
the boy that you loved 
is the monster you fear 
peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark 
you've poisoned all your children 
to camouflage your scars 
pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear 
pray your life was just a dream 
the cut that never heals 
pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream 
(i am so tangled in my sins that i cannot escape) 
pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed 
someone had to go this far 
i was born into this 
everything turns to shit 
the boy that you loved 
is the man that you fear 
peel off all those eyes and crawl into th dark 
you've poisoned all your children 
to camouflage your scars 
pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear 
pray your life was just a dream 
the cut that never heals 
pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream 
the world in my hands 
there's no one left to hear you scream 
there's no one left for you 
(we know when your wishes are granted 
many of your dreams will be destroyed)</field>

Of new and different ways to murder your heart 
I'm just a painting that's still wet 
If you touch me I'll be smeared, you'll be stained 
Stained for the rest of your life 
Turn around, walk away 
Before you confuse the way we abuse each other 
If you're not afraid of getting hurt 
Then I'm not afraid of how much I hurt you 
I'm well aware I'm a danger to myself 
Are you aware I'm a danger to others? 
There's a crack in my soul 
That you thought was a smile 
Whatever doesn't kill you 
Is gonna leave a scar 
Leave a scar 
And whatever doesn't kill you 
Is gonna leave a scar 
I'm more like a silver bullet 
Than I'm like a gun 
Not easy to hold 
I'm moving fast 
And if I stay inside your heart 
I'm certain that this will be the end your life 
Turn around, walk away 
Before you confuse the way we abuse each other 
If you're not afraid of getting hurt

Leave a scar 
And whatever doesn't kill you

But the chances are I'm gonna fuck you over

Barb Warner: I can't hear ya. 
Blanche Wyer: I woke at 6:30 this morning with a headache. 
Barb Warner: Oh... 
Blanche Wyer: I wonder to take 'em or not... 
Barb Warner: I wouldn't take 'em. 
Blanche Wyer: I don't know, the headache is heavier than anything else. 
Barb Warner: It's the first time that you took 'em? 
Blanche Wyer: Second. 
Barb Warner: Yeah... 
Blanche Wyer: I had a little bit of a headache this morning. 
Barb Warner: I wouldn't take 'em, mom. 
Blanche Wyer: I won't take 'em now, 'cause I have a toothache that hurts too a 
little bit 
I've taken everything I got, been thinkin' 
Barb Warner: All that blood pressure medicine you take and stuff too 
You 
shouldn't take those things 
You're better off not to sleep then to take the... 
Blanche Wyer: ? 
Barb Warner: Oh, my god! No wonder you got a headache! Your pressure's probably 
sky high! Why don't...You gotta take that every day! 
Blanche Wyer: I try though... 
Barb Warner: Are you crazy? 
Blanche Wyer: It's been 3 days... 
Barb Warner: That's probably why you have a headache now...Did you take it 
today? 
Blanche Wyer: I did this morning, yeah. 
Barb Warner: That's probably why you have a headache, 'cause your pressure's up. 
Blanche Wyer: Yeah. 
Barb Warner: I don't know how you can forget to take it 
And when that's the 
only pill you take... 
Blanche Wyer: I'm sorry, I have so many pills you'd be surprised. 
Barb Warner: Well, the blood pressure pill is the most important one. 
Blanche Wyer: Yeah, I know... 
Barb Warner: There ain't no other one as important as that one. 
Blanche Wyer: I got one more and then I gotta get to the store 
I got two 
refills on it. 
Barb Warner: You only got one pill?! 
Blanche Wyer: I only take one a day... 
Barb Warner: Well, yeah, but you shouldn't let 'em get that low... 
Blanche Wyer: I guess not, but I can take one in the morning and then go get 
some more... 
Barb Warner: They're expensive! If you have to pay for 'em.. 
Procardia? 
Blanche Wyer: No, the other one. 
Barb Warner: Which ones? 
Blanche Wyer: I gotta pay for procardia. 
Barb Warner: Were you taking that every day? 
Blanche Wyer: Yeah. 
Barb Warner: Well, that's the blood pressure pill.. 
The heart pill, the 
procardia 
And what's the other one? 
Blanche Wyer: Ah, H-Y-D-R-O-T-O-N. 
Barb Warner: Oh, that's something to do with water and.. 
And.. 
Water and, uh, 
blood pressure. 
Blanche Wyer: This one tag does say it's for blood pressure... 
Barb Warner: Yeah, I think it works like a water pill type pressure, but the 
procardia's the important one. 
Blanche Wyer: Yeah. 
Barb Warner: You have to take that every day. 
Blanche Wyer: Yeah. 
Barb Warner: You should take that the first thing when you get up... 
Blanche Wyer: Yeah...I know. 
Barb Warner: Well, how come you ain't got taken it? 
Blanche Wyer: I took it yesterday, the procardia. 
Barb Warner: Well, how come you didn't take it today? 
Blanche Wyer: I had the headache today... 
Barb Warner: That's why you have a headache! You gotta take the procardia... 
Take it now! That's what it's for, your headache! It's to make your blood 
pressure come down. 
Blanche Wyer: Yeah. 
Barb Warner: If you don't you're gonna ha.. 
You'll have a stroke if you don't 
take it 
If you got a pretty.. 
Headache that bad you're gonna have a stroke... 
Blanche Wyer: I got a headache that bad this morning. 
Barb Warner: Well, you better go take the procardia right now. 
Blanche Wyer: I will, I'll take it when I hang up. 
Barb Warner: You didn't take that other blood.. 
blood pressure pill either? 
Blanche Wyer: Yeah, I did this morning... 
Barb Warner: Well, you should take the procardia right now. 
Blanche Wyer: I'll take the procardia in after nine 
Got a horrible morning... 
Barb Warner: Well, you... 
Blanche Wyer: I'm glad you can't see it. 
Barb Warner: Well, how long has it been since you took the procardia? 
Blanche Wyer: Three days. 
Barb Warner: How many? 
Blanche Wyer: Three... 
Barb Warner: Well, see, that's ridiculous.. 
You better go take it right now. 
Blanche Wyer: I will. 
Barb Warner: Then you'll find out your headache will go away. 
Blanche Wyer: Yeah 
I've taken it now, the procardia, just yet. 
Barb Warner: Any other medicine you're taking ain't that important 
You ain't 
got nothing but nerve pills 
They ain't important. 
Blanche Wyer: I take those every day... 
Barb Warner: Well, the nerve pills ain't that important 
The blood pressure 
medicine's important.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Paranoid, sittin' in a deep sweat 
Thinkin' I gotta fuck somebody before the week ends 
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head 
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death 
I hear the sound of your last breath 
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left 
You was in the right place with me at the wrong time 
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fuckin' mind 
Calm down, back to reality 
Don't fear death, 'cause I know that it follows me 
Flashes, I get flashes of jason 
Gimme a knife, a million lives I've wasted 
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a fuck 
Pussy play superman, your ass'll get boxed up 
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick 
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic 
Lookin' through her window, now my body is warm 
Shes naked, and I'm a peepin tom 
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinkin' rape 
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate 
Leavin' out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth 
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch 
Whipped out my knife, said, if you scream, I cut you 
Opened her legs and commenced the fuckin' 
She begged me not to kill her, so I gave her a rose 
Then slit her throat 
and watched her shake till her eyes closed 
Had sex with the corpse before I left her 
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter 
Run for shelter never crossed my mind 
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine 
Dial 911 for the bitch 
But the cops ain't shit 
when they're fuckin' with the mind of a lunatic 
I sit alone in my four-cornered room starin' at candles 
Dreamin' of the people I've dismantled 
I close my eyes and I'm in the circle 
These images of sons of bitches that I murdered 
Glad bags of bodies bein' fucked up 
Looks like I take a fit of my rage, I'm goin' nuts 
Boys used to die when I'm full fo' that fry 
I be eatin' when I'm high 
So I say fuck and just let bullets fly 
Like I said, my poster face is my identity 
A homicidal maniac with suicidal tendencies 
I'm on the violent tip, so yo, get a grip 
And bitch, better come equipped, I ain't takin' no shit 
'Cause here comes the mind of a lunatic 
My girl's gettin' skinny, 'cause she's strung out on coke 
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat 
Her grandma was standin' there, she was screamin' out 
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade in granny's ass 
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel 
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil 
Pulled out my 
38 and aimed at the bitch 
A cop says (freeze, motherfucker!) bitch, suck my dick 
I said, die, motherfucker! As I blasted 
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic 
The scent of buckshots in human flesh 
Pigs dyin' from bullet wounds to the chest 
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road 
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode 
Fuck that, 'cause I ain'ts to die 
So I reloaded my uzi and fired up another fry 
It's got me crazy as fuck 
A ragin' psychotic full of that angel's dust 
The cops had that place surrounded 
Hunted for a way to get out - and I found it 
Innocent bystanders will watch, I set an example 
I popped one, let me go, goddammit 
Scot free 
Or all of these motherfuckers comin' with me 
All of a sudden the shit got silent 
I remember wakin' up, in an asylum 
Bein' treated like a troubled kid 
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit 
Think this is hard? This ain't as hard as it gets 
No tellin' what's bein' thought up in the mind of a lunatic 
January 5th, 1969 
A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic 
I should'a been killed 
My sister fucked around and let me live 
Now I developed a criminal behavior 
Fuck with me, and I'll slay ya 
Ass, beyond recognition, shit 
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch 
I beg your pardon, on talkin' to borden 
You'll never find a motherfucker, so save your milk cartons 
Cross the line, your ass is mine 
I don't care if you're 9 or 99 
Blind, crippled, or crazy, it don't faze me 
Your funky ass will be pushin' up daisies 
You wanna know what makes me click? 
My psychiatrist says I got the mind of a lunatic 
I ain't got it all, so don't fuck with me 
Unless your ass wanna be made history 
I'll blow your motherfuckin' house up 
And if your wife and kids say "stop", they're fucked 
I don't give a damn who I slay 
Don't let me get a hold of some 'e' and 'j' 
'Cause when the shit hits the fan 
I'll stab your ass quicker than a mexican 
The nightmares I leave you with 
Will seem to make freddy bitch ass look like a wet dream 
This is fact, not fictional, you son of a bitch 
I got the mind of a lunatic</field>

I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread 
Along came a choo-choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo 
And now my monkey's dead 
At least he looks that way 
But then again don't we all 
What I make is what I am, I can't be forever 
I had a little monkey 
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread 
Along came a choo-choo and knocked my monkey coo-coo 
And now my monkey's dead 
Poor little monkey 
Make you...break you...make you...break you...lookout 
What I make is what I am, I can't live forever 
We are our own wicked gods 
With little g's and big dicks 
Sadistic and constantly inflicting a slow demise 
I had a little monkey and I sent him to the country 
And I fed him on gingerbread 
Along came a choo-choo and knocked my monkey coo-coo 
And now my monkey's dead 
The primate's scream of consonance is a reflection 
Of his own mind's dissonance</field>

"Take my money," Is all I think. 
He looks at the earring. 
"Fag," he mumbles. 
I don't mind. 
He's fat. 
No one likes him. 
Life's too short. 
I pass a table of black girls 
With short hair. 
They look like men. 
They all look the same. 
I can hear the strobe now, 
It's loud. 
And the music's too bright. 
I look for my friends, 
But I can't remember if I came alone 
Or not. 
Doesn't matter though. 
There's hundreds of people 
Who have waited all their lives, 
No doubt, 
To be my friend. 
And as I near the bar 
I see two persons 
Eating each other's faces. 
I bark to the bartender. 
He gives me a placebo. 
I'm "so young," he tells me, 
"To be here." 
I nod and swallow the bland drink. 
Then I stumble several times 
Near a crowd, 
And they think I'm a good dancer. 
I hear a girl tell another girl 
That some girl she knows 
Watched a girl 
Puke in the toilet. 
I smile in their general direction. 
The good-looking one comes over 
And bites my cheek. 
It hurts, 
And I start to 
Hit her. 
But she's grinning, 
And I can see my blood on her teeth. 
And I pull her to me. 
"My place or yours?" 
"The gutter will be fine," 
she confesses. 
As we walk out, 
She takes another bite from my cheek, 
And I smile at the fat man 
By the door.</field>

But they made one contribution that I live by to this day, 
It's the food pyramid, 
And its approved the USDA 
Oh grains of the foundation, 
So please take my advice, 
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice, 
Three to five of vegetables, 
And four fruits is best, 
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest, 
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese, 
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry 
A body needs to grow, 
And grow and take regimes, 
Why meat can be a tasty treat, 
Like fish or even beans 
And when you eat your sweets, 
Make sure you try, 
To limit your servings, 
Or you'll... 
DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Everybody! 
My body is a pyramid that's made of healthy foods, 
So do what we say, 
(Yeah!) 
Eat right every day, 
(Food!),

            <field name="lyrics">Prelude (the family trip) 
There's no earthly way of knowing 
Which direction we are going 
There's no knowing where we're rowing 
Or which way the river's flowing 
Is it raining, is it snowing? 
Is a hurricane blowing? 
Not a speck of light is showing 
So the danger must be growing 
Are the fires of hell aglowing? 
Is the grizzly reaper mowing? 
Yes! 
The danger must be growing 
For the rowers keep on rowing 
And they're certainly not showing 
Any signs that they are slowing 
. 
Stop the boat.</field>

and we don't want to live forever 
and we know that suffering is so much better 
this is for the people, they want you 
this is for the people, they want you 
getting high on violence, baby 
give the bills time to work 
we all could be martyred in the 
winter of our discontent 
(getting high on violence, baby) 
every night we are nailed into place and 
every night we just can't seem to 
ever remember the reason why 
(getting high on violence, baby) 
and we don't want to live forever

            <field name="lyrics">The sky was blond like her 
Was a day to take the child 
Out back and shoot it 
Could have buried all my dead 
Up in her cemetery head 
She had dirty word witchcraft 
I was in the deep end of her skin 
Then it seemed like a one car wreck 
But I knew it was a horrid tragedy 
Ways to make the tiny satisfaction disappear 
Blow out the candles on all my Frankensteins 
At least my death wish will come true 
You taste like Valentine's 
And we cry, you're like a birthday 
Should have picked the photograph 
It lasted longer than you 
Putting holes in happiness 
We'll paint the future black 
If it needs a color 
Death sentence is now a story 
Who'll be digging 
When you finally let me die? 
Romance of our assassination 
If you're Bonnie, I'll be your Clyde 
But the grass is greener here 
I can see all of your snakes 
You wear your ruins well 
Please run away with me to hell 
Blow out the candles on all my Frankensteins 
At least my death wish will come true 
You taste like Valentine's 
And we cry, you're like a birthday 
Should have picked the photograph 
It lasted longer than you 
Blow out the candles on all my Frankensteins 
At least my death wish will come true 
You taste like Valentine's 
And we cry, you're like a birthday 
Should have picked the photograph

Smiling faces on the wall 
I took a walk down the hall 
I banged my fist against the door 
I tossed a quarter to the whore 
The Camera flashes in my eyes 
I spread the news she spreads her thighs 
Red, red in my head 
Red, red in my head 
I grabbed her knuckles and I yanked them all 
I bent her in half like a barbie doll 
Love, hate, viscerate 
Take this flesh and meditate 
I sat there with her 
We sat there 2 
She said to me 
What should we do 
Well, I know some tricks 
and I'll show them to you 
Your mother won't mind at all if I do 
To you 
The poor little girl 
The poor little girl 
The poor little girl didn't know what to say 
For her mother was out of the house today 
Today 
Today 
Red, red in my head 
Red, red in my head

Red, red they call me red 
Red, in bed

Always it is calling me, for the blood of man 
They say I cannot be this, I am jaded, hiding from the day. 
I can't bare, I cannot tame the hunger in me 
Oh, I say I did it always searching, you can't fuck with fate. 
So instead you'll taste my pain. 
The hunger inside given to me, makes me feel alive. 
Always out stalking prey, in the dark I hide. 
Feeling, falling, hating, feel like I am fading, hating life. 
They say I cannot be this, I am jaded, hiding from the day. 
I can't bare, I cannot tame the hunger in me... 
Oh, I say I did it always searching, you can't fuck with fate. 
So instead you'll taste my pain. 
You say your life I'm taking, always bothering me, I can't take this anymore, I'm failing, always smothering me 
You look down on me, hey what you see, take this gift from me, you will soon feed from me. 
Nothing seems exciting, always the same hiding 
It's haunting me 
It's haunting me 
It's haunting me 
It's haunting me. 
It's haunting me...</field>

I'm wide awake the more I sleep 
you'll understand when I'm dead 
I went to god just to see 
and I was looking at me 
saw heaven and hell were lies 
when I'm god everybody dies 
scar, can you feel my power? 
shoot here and the world gets smaller 
scar, scar, can you feel my power? 
one shot and the world gets smaller 
let's jump upon the sharp swords 
and cut away our smiles 
without the threat of death 
there's no reason to live at all

shoot shoot shoot motherfucker (x2) 
each thing I show you is a piece of my death 
no salvation, no forgiveness (x5) 
this is beyond your experionce 
forgiveness...

And his house down 
And wait for the fire to spread 
Sometimes hate is not enough 
To turn this all to ashes 
Together as one 
Against all others 
Break all of our wings to 
Make sure it crashes 
We're running to the edge of the world 
Running, running away 
We're running to the edge of the world 
I don't know if the world will end today 
I had no choice 
To erased the debt of our family 
Let you say goodbye 
With lips like dynamite 
And everyone turned their backs 
Because they knew 
When we held on tight to each other 
We were something fatal 
that fell into the wrong hands 
Sometimes hate is not enough 
To turn this all to ashes 
Together as one 
against all others 
Break all of their wings to

Didn't know it yet 
So we chanted work work work 
But they didn't know they were dead 
Didn't know they were dead 
Then the winter flew to a sick young coward 
Look into then, like went on hating 
? Lady, a gently apple to own by God 
There were men of brand new parents 
Didn't know it yet 
So we chanted work work work 
But they didn't know they were dead 
Didn't know they were dead

Slave neva dreams to be free

But they get famous when we fuck

New york city son of sam 
With a gun in hand 
He reapes the women of our land 
Blood and family 
Darkness death depravity 
Keep out of his way 
Live to lie another day 
(with a.44 gun to shoot her down, down) 
He was told to kill 
Dogs and demons gave him will 
Spirit roaming night 
Sullen vampire hating light 
Nobody wants him 
He just stares at the world 
Planning his vengeance 
That he will soon unfurl 
Now the time is here 
For son of sam to spread fear 
Father holy ghost 
Wicked son who kills the most 
Nobody wants him 
They just turn their heads 
Nobody helps him 
Now he has his revenge 
Gunshots full of lead 
Fill his victims full of dread 
Running as fast as they can 
Son of sam kills again 
Down, down, down

You drained my heart, you made a spade, 
But there's still traces of me in your veins 
You drained my heart, and made a spade, 
There's still traces of me in your veins 
All my lilies' mouths are open, 
Like they're beggin' for dope and hopin' 
Their bitter petal chant 'we can kick, you won't be back' 
I'm a diamond that is tired, 
Of all the faces i've acquired 
We must secure the shadow 'ere the substance fades 
You drained my heart, and made a spade, 
But there's still traces of me in your veins 
You drained my heart, and made a spade,

The pains that are withheld for me

That suicide is painless

And I can take or leave it if I please 
The game of life is hard to play 
I'm gonna lose it anyway 
The losing card, I'll someday lay 
So this is all I have to say 
Suicide is painless 
It brings on many changes 
And I can take or leave it if, I please 
The sword of time will pierce our skin 
It doesn't hurt when it begins 
But as it works its way on in 
The pain grows stronger, watch it grin 
Suicide is painless 
It brings on many changes 
And I can take or leave it if I please 
A brave man once requested me 
To answer questions that are key 
"is it to be, or not to be?" 
And I replied: 
"why ask me?" 
But suicide is painless 
It brings on many changes 
And I can take or leave it if I please 
And you can do the same thing if you please</field>

It's all anatomic

Capitalism has made it this way, 
Old-fashioned fascism

Hey you, what do you see 
something beautiful, something free 
hey you, are you trying to be mean 
If you live with apes, man 
It's hard to be clean 
There's no time to discriminate, 
Hate every motherfucker that is in your way 
Hey! Hey! (repeat 4x)

Fake abuse for our bios, blacken our own eyes 
The grass isn't greener on the other side 
We set it on fire 
And we have no reason why 
We set fashion, not follow 
Spit vitriol, not swallow 
We're good for nothing, but being everything that's bad 
We know who we are and what we want to say 
And we don't care who's listening 
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well 
We're the bright young things 
I've got my villain necktie and a mouth of hi-fi 
So sharp, I'm bleeding from my Judas hole 
I'm the Arch Dandy 
No-Goodnik and I'm headed for Crashville 
I'm most monster with my groan box in the "Meat Show" 
We set fashion, not follow 
Spit vitriol, not swallow 
Good for nothing, but being everything that's bad 
We know who we are and what we want to say 
And we don't care who's listening 
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well 
We're the bright young things 
Crashing the ether 
We've got the loudest stereotype 
Even neophytes deep 6 your pro-life 
We don't to move a prayer bone 
We're so beautfil and damned 
Simply as a "still-life" 
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause 
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause 
Stop the song and remember what you used to be 
Somebody that could fucking impress me 
We know who we are and what we want to say 
And we don't care who's listening 
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well 
We are the bright young things 
We know who we are and what we want to say 
And we don't care who's listening 
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well 
We're the bright young things.</field>

Let's sing the death song kids 
We light a candle on an earth 
we made into hell 
and pretend that we're in heaven 
Each time we do, we get

These are the things that you obsessively fetishize 
Or make yourself grow to love

Its like a garden with two flowers 
One just blocking and casting a shadow 
Just like yours 
Then it becomes a struggle 
Of sunlight 
Or rain 
Or weeds 
She and every she 
Is doomed to be your idea of her

You are no longer the flower

I am used 
Its all ruined if you meet their friends

Double-crossed and glossed over in my pathos 
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal? 
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal? 
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic 
And I'm ready to meet my maker 
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic 
I'm ready to meet my maker 
Lazarus got no dirt on me 
Lazarus got no dirt on me 
And I rise in every occasion 
I'm the mephistopheles of Los Angeles 
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal? 
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal? 
 
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic 
And I'm ready to meet my maker 
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic 
I'm ready to meet my maker 
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic 
And I'm ready to meet my maker 
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic

Lazarus got no dirt on me 
Lazarus got no dirt on me 
And I rise in every occasion

Marilyn Manson 
They call her bulldozer speech demon 
Without distractions of hope 
She makes the depression business look surprisingly novel. 
And she's not just royal, allegedly loyal 
Not unfaithful but she has no faith in me. 
Inhale the damage smoothly paradise isn't lost, it was hiding all along. 
(chorus) 
There's the ones that you love, 
the ones that love you, 
the ones that make you come. 
The ones that make you come unglued. 
I can't turn my back on you 
when you are walking away. 
Bottomless celebrity scar staged circuses for schoolgirls, 
Us boys are all dressed up like a mediocre suicide omen. 
Here comes the red carpet grave 
Again and again and again, 
Oh man. 
There's the ones that you love, 
the ones that love you, 
the ones that make you come. 
The ones that make you come unglued. 
I can't turn my back on you, 
when you are walking away. 
I can't turn my back on you, 
when you are walking away. 
Can't turn my back on you, 
when you are walking away, 
when you are walking away. 
There's the ones that you love, 
the ones that love you, 
the ones that make you come. 
The ones that make you come unglued. 
There's the ones that you love, 
the ones that love you, 
the ones that make you come. 
The ones that make you come unglued. 
It's easy to beat the system, 
Had a hard time beating the symptoms... 
Had a hard time beating the symptoms... 
I can't turn my back on you, 
can't turn my back on you, 
I can't turn my back on you, 
when you are walking away. 
Here comes the red carpet grave 
again and again and again. 
Here comes the red carpet grave 
again and again and again, 
oh man.

            <field name="lyrics">The Telephone 
Another night of too much cough syrup 
I'm awakened by the incessant ringing of a telephone 
I still have dreams caked in the corners of my eyes 
and my mouth is dry and tastes shitty 
Again the ringing 
Slowly I bustle out of bed 
The remnants of an erection still lingering in my 
shorts 
Like a bothersome guest 
Again the ringing 
Carefully I abscond to the bathroom 
As to not display my manhood to others 
There I make the perfunctory morning faces 
Which always seem to precede my daily contribution 
To the once-blue toilet water 
That I always enjoy making green 
Again the ringing 
I shake twice like most others 
and I'm annoyed by the dribble that always seems to 
remain 
Causing a small acreage of wetness on the front of my 
briefs 
I slowly languidly, lazily, crazily, 
Stumble into the den 
Where my father smokes his guitars 
I mean cigars 
In his easy chair 
I know all about easy chairs 
and then I sing a song for my friends 
Jesus is my boyfriend 
Jesus is my boyfriend 
You can't have him 
Because jesus is my boyfriend 
Ringing ringing 
Dang it goddamn motherfucking son-of-a-bitch is 
ringing 
I walk into the kitchen and I 
Stare blankly at that shrieking plastic bastard 
Since it keeps ringing I know it's her 
and since it keeps ringing she knows it's me 
We are the world, we are the children 
We are the ones who make a darker day 
So let's start killing 
There's a choice you're making 
We're sparing our own lives 
It's true we'll make a darker day</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I had a dream - this one I feel the need to mention 
I was happy for awhile and I stop being scared 
And ashamed to say what's on my mind 
But you thought I changed after awhile 
And said “you better treat me different or else” 
“Or else” is like a stupid fucking thing to say to someone like me 
someone like me 
Wow! 
Don’t be surprised I can look you in the eye 
It’s hard to take you serious when you drained me inside 
I’m worse than what you think you’d catch from me 
Complicated is understated 
Did you stop and take a look at who you fell in love with? 
It doesn’t matter how many times I say it 
It never gets on 
That’s why I have to say 
It doesn’t matter if you’re going to come 
Or just going I never wanted you to come here anyway 
There’s a word that’s like you 
Because it can’t be a noun a verb or exclamation or the thing I say 
When something is unbelievable 
When I’m not able to believe how unbelievably unbelievable 
That you believe you could not be leavable 
That’s when I have to say 
Wow!

I kill myself in small amounts 
In each relationship it's not about love.

It was never about her, it was about the hurt.

Got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely 
Stick your stupid slogan in 
Everybody sing 
Are you motherfuckers ready 
For the new shit? 
Stand up and admit 
Tomorrow's never coming 
This is the new shit 
Stand up and admit 
Do we get it? No! 
Do we want it? Yeah! 
This is the new shit 
Stand up and admit 
So, let us entertain you</field>

We all know the way it ends 
No matter how many times we film it 
The audience thinks they've seen it for the first time 
Things that pretty are always kept behind glass 
Someone like me, someone like me can't make it last 
I like you damaged, but I need something left 
Something for me, something for me to wreck 
You are my sickness 
We all know the way it ends 
No matter how we film it, the audience thinks 
That they saw it for the first time 
Things that pretty are always kept behind glass 
Someone like me, someone like me can't make it last 
I like you damaged, but I need something left 
Something for me, something for me to wreck 
I like you damaged, but I need something left 
Something for me, something for me to wreck 
Something for me to wreck 
Something for me to wreck 
My seed would have make new fruit 
And you could have been a tree 
Or I could have cut you down 
Or just let you be 
These things that pretty are always kept behind glass 
Someone like me, someone like me can't make it last 
I like you damaged, I like you damaged 
I like you damaged 
I like you damaged, I like you damaged 
I like you damaged, damaged 
I like you damaged</field>

And things I cannot speak 
She comes on like a crippled plaything 
Her spine is just a string 
I wrapped our love in all this foil 
Silver-tight like spider legs 
I never wanted it to ever spoil 
But flies will always lay their eggs 
Take your hatred out on me 
Make your victim my head 
You never ever believed in me 
I am your tourniquet 
Prosthetic synthesis with butterfly 
Sealed up with virgin stitch 
If it hurts baby please tell me 
Preserve the innocence 
I never wanted it to end like this 
But flies will lay their eggs 
Take your hatred out on me 
Make your victim my head 
You never ever believed in me 
I am your tourniquet 
What I wanted, what I needed 
What I got for me 
What I wanted, what I needed 
What I got for me 
Take your hatred out on me 
Make your victim my head 
You never ever believed in me

Take your, take your 
Get up out of me 
I'm not proud with me 
I never ever believed in me

Something has grown out of my chest.

It is hard and cold. 
It has been dormant for many years. 
We are trying to save you, I have come to save you 
This is what you deserve, 
this is what we deserve 
This is something we have brought upon ourselves. 
We are not a victim, you are not a victim 
we are not a victim, you are not a victim

God will crawl at my feet.

By giving you no time instead of it all 
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school 
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool 
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years 
Then they expect you to pick a career 
When you can't really function you're so full of fear 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV 
And you think you're so clever and classless and free 
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
There's room at the top they are telling you still 
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill 
If you want to be like the folks on the hill 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
If you want to be a hero well just follow me 
If you want to be a hero well just follow me</field>

So watered down-your feelings have turned to mud. 
"Love everybody" is destroying the value of 
All hate has got me nowhere

I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping away

Oh no, I am all the things they said I was 
Oh no, it is everything they said it was 
Oh no, I am all the things they said I was 
When you get to heaven you will wish you you're in hell 
When you get to heaven you will wish you you're in hell 
When will you realize, you're already here 
You'll thank us now that you have crossed over 
Don't pick the scabs or you will never heal 
The world shudders as the worm gets its wings 
Oh no, it is everything they said it was 
Oh no, I am all the things they said I was 
Oh no, it is everything they said it was 
Oh no, I am all the things they said I was 
Then i got my wings and I never even knew it 
When i was a worm, thought I wouldn't get through it... 
When you get to heaven you will wish you you're in hell 
When you get to heaven you will wish you you're in hell

This one I feel the need to mention 
I was happy for a while and I stopped being scared 
And ashamed to say what's on my mind 
But you thought I'd change after a while 
And said you better treat me different or else... 
Or else seems like a stupid fucking thing to say to someone like me 
Someone like me 
WOW 
WOW 
WOW 
Wo Wo Wo Wo Wo WOW 
Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye 
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside 
Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye 
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside 
I'm worse than what you think you'd catch from me 
Complicateds understated did you stop and take a look at who you fell in love with? 
At who you fell in love with? 
Does it matter how many times I say it? 
It never gets old thats why I have to say 
WOW 
WOW

Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye 
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside 
Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye 
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside 
It doesn't matter if you're going to come or just going 
I never wanted you to come here anyway 
There's a word thats like you because it can be a noun a verb a exclamation or the thing I say 
When something is unbelievable when I'm not able to believe how unbelievably unbelievable 
That you believe you could not be-lievable 
That's when I have to say 
WOW 
WOW 
WOW

Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye 
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside

Marilyn Manson 
I'm just like rolling a stone up a hill in Hades 
If you want to lie with me, you're going to be a liar 
Hell-flavored, I've got mood poisoning 
you must be something that I hate 
I'm just a prison of property buckets full of better misery 
There's not a word for what I want to do to you 
There's not a word for what I want to do to you

Like you were walking onto a yacht 
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye 
Your scarf it was apricot 
You had one eye in the mirror 
As you watched yourself gavotte 
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner 
They'd be your partner and 
You're so vain 
You probably think this song is about you 
You're so vain 
I bet you think this song is about you 
Don't you, don't you? 
You had me several years ago 
When I was still naive 
You said that we made such a pretty pair 
And that you would never leave 
But you gave away the things you loved 
And one of them was me 
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee 
Clouds in my coffee and 
You're so vain 
You probably think this song is about you 
You're so vain 
I bet you think this song is about you 
Don't you, don't you? 
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee 
Clouds in my coffee and... 
So vain 
Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga 
And your horse naturally won 
Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia 
To see the total eclipse of the sun 
Well, you're where you should be all the time 
And when you're not 
You're with some underworld spy 
Or the wife of a close friend 
Wife of a close friend 
You're so vain 
You probably think this song is about you 
You're so vain 
I bet you think this song is about you 
Don't you, don't you? 
You're so vain 
You probably think this song is about you 
You're so vain 
I bet you think this song is about you 
Don't you, don't you?</field>

Dreams of dragon's fire 
And of things that will bite 
Sleep with one eye open 
Gripping your pillow tight 
Exit light 
Enter night 
Take my hand 
We're off to never neverland 
Now I lay me down to sleep 
Pray the Lord my soul to keep 
If I die before I wake 
Pray the Lord my soul to take

And never mind that noise you heard 
It's just the beasts under your bed 
In your closet, in your head

And quickly he's subdued 
Through constant pained disgrace 
The young boy learns their rules 
With time the child draws in 
This whipping boy done wrong 
Deprived of all his thoughts 
The young man struggles on and on he's known 
A vow unto his own 
That never from this day 
His will they'll take away 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
Never shined through in what I've shown 
Never be

Won't see what might have been

Never shined through in what I've shown 
Never free 
Never me 
So I dub thee unforgiven 
They dedicate their lives 
To running all of his 
He tries to please them all 
This bitter man he is 
Throughout his life the same 
He's battled constantly 
This fight he cannot win 
A tired man they see no longer cares 
The old man then prepares 
To die regretfully

That there's not much left of me 
Nothing is real but pain now 
Hold my breath as I wish for death 
Oh please God, wake me 
Back in the womb it's much too real 
In pumps life that I must feel 
But can't look forward to reveal 
Look to the time when I'll live 
Fed through the tube that sticks in me 
Just like a wartime novelty 
Tied to machines that make me breathe 
Cut this life off from me 
Hold my breath as I wish for death 
Oh please God, wake me 
Now the world is gone I'm just one 
Oh God help me 
Hold my breath as I wish for death

Imprisoning me 
All that I see 
Absolute horror

I cannot die

Taken my speech 
Taken my hearing 
Taken my arms 
Taken my legs

Simply nothing more to give 
There is nothing more for me 
Need the end to set me free 
Things not what they used to be 
Missing one inside of me 
Deathly lost, this can't be real 
Cannot stand this hell I feel 
Emptiness is filling me 
To the point of agony 
Growing darkness taking dawn 
I was me, but now he's gone 
No one but me can save myself 
But it's too late 
Now I can't think 
Think why I should even try 
Yesterday seems as though it never existed 
Death greets me warm 
Now I will just say goodbye</field>

But now I see the sun 
Now I see the sun 
Yes, now I see it 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
Turn the pages 
Turn the stone 
Behind the door 
Should I open it for you? 
Yeah 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
So sick and tired 
I stand alone 
Could you be there 
'Cause I'm the one who waits 
The one who waits for you 
Oh 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
Turn the pages 
Turn the stone 
Behind the door 
Should I open it for you? 
Oh, what I've felt 
Oh, what I've known

And I bury it in you 
Because you're unforgiven too 
Never me

Told me when I was young 
"Son, your life's an open book 
Don't close it 'fore its done" 
"The brightest flame burns quickest" 
That's what I heard her say 
A son's heart's owned to mother 
But I must find my way 
Let my heart go 
Let your son grow 
Mama, let my heart go 
Or let this heart be still 
Yeah, still 
Rebel, my new last name 
Wild blood in my veins 
They bring strings around my neck 
The mark that still remains 
Left home at an early age 
Of what I heard was wrong 
I never asked forgiveness 
But what I said is done 
Let my heart go 
Let your son grow 
Mama, let my heart go 
Or Let this heart be still 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness l now take to my grave 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness I now take to my grave 
So let this heart be still 
Mama, now I'm coming home 
I'm not all you wished of me 
But a mother's love for her son 
Unspoken, help me be 
I took your love for granted 
And all the things you said to me 
I need your arms to welcome me 
But a cold stone's all I see 
Let my heart go 
Let your son grow 
Mama, let my heart go 
Or let this heart be still 
Let my heart go 
Mama, let my heart go 
You never let my heart go 
So let this heart be still 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness l now take to my grave 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness I now take to my grave

I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier 
I said stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya

I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly 
She swore that she'd love me, no never would she leave me 
But devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy 
Musha raim dum a doo dum a da 
Whack for my daddy-o

There's whiskey in the jar-o 
Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber 
Takin' Molly with me, but I never knew the danger 
For about six, maybe seven, yeah in walked Captian Farrell 
I jumped up with my pistols, and I shot him with both barrells

Constant chill deep inside 
Shouting gun, 
On they run through the endless gray 
On they fight, for they are right, 
Yes, but who's to say? 
For a hill, men would kill. 
Why? they do not know 
Stiffened wounds test their pride 
Men of five, still alive 
Through the raging glow 
Gone insane from the pain 
That they surely know 
For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on 
For whom the bell tolls 
Take a look to the sky 
Just before you die 
It's the last time he will 
Blackened roar, massive roar, 
Fills the crumbling sky 
Shattered goal fills his soul 
With a ruthless cry 
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery 
He hears the silence so loud 
Crack of dawn, all is gone 
Except the will to be 
Now they see what will be, 
Blinded eyes to see 
For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on

You can listen to the engines Moanin' out it's one note song 
You think about the woman or the girl 
You knew the night before 
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way 
They always do 
When you're riding sixteen hours 
And there's nothing much to do 
And you don't feel much like riding 
You just wish the trip was through 
Here I am - on the road again 
There I am - up on the stage 
Here I go - playing star again 
There I go - turn the page 
So you walk into this restaurant strung out from the road 
And you feel the eyes upon you 
As you're shaking off the cold 
You pretend it doesn't bother you 
But you just want to explode 
Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk 
Other times you can 
All the same old clichés, "is it woman? is it man? " 
And you always seem outnumbered 
You don't dare make a stand 
Make your stand 
Here I am - on the road again 
There I am - up on the stage 
Here I go - playing star again 
There I go - turn the page 
Oo-ooh, out there in the spotlight 
You're a million miles away 
Every ounce of energy you try to give away 
As the sweat pours out your body 
Like the music that you play, yeah 
Later in the evening, you lie awake in bed 
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in your head 
You smoke the day's last cigarette 
Remembering what she said 
What she said 
He-ey 
Yeah 
And here I am - on the road again 
There I am - up on a stage 
Here I go - playing star again 
There I go - turn the page 
There I go - turn that page 
There I go, yeah, yeah 
There I go, yeah, yeah 
There I go, yeah 
There I go, yeah 
There I go, oo-oo-ooh

Would change his life forever? 
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course 
By the light of golden treasure 
Was he the one causing pain 
With his careless dreaming? 
Been afraid, always afraid, 
Of the things he's feeling 
He could just be gone 
He would just sail on 
He'll just sail on 
How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go? 
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold? 
How can I be lost? In remembrance I relive 
And how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive? 
These days drift on inside a fog 
Thick and suffocating 
His sinking life, outside its hell 
Inside, intoxicating 
He's run aground Like his life, 
Water much too shallow 
Slipping fast, down with his ship, 
Fading in the shadows 
Now a castaway 
They've all gone away 
They've gone away

May it be 
That we should see the light 
When reaper calls 
May it be 
That we walk straight and right 
When doubt returns 
May it be 
That faith shall permeate our scars 
When we're seduced 
Then may it be 
That we not deviate our cause 
All sinners, a future 
All saints, a past 
Beginning, the ending 
Return to ash 
Now that we're dead, my dear 
We can be together 
Now that we're dead, my dear 
We can live forever 
When all is pain 
May it be 
It's all we've ever known 
When flame consumes 
May it be 
It warms our dying bones 
When loss has won 
May it be 
It's you I'm madly fighting for 
When kingdom comes 
May it be 
We walk right through that open door 
All sinners, a future 
All saints, a past 
Beginning, the ending 
Return to ash 
Now that we're dead, my dear 
We can be together 
Now that we're dead, my dear 
We can live forever 
All sinners, a future 
All saints, a past 
Beginning, the ending 
Return to ash 
Now that we're dead, my dear 
We can be together 
Now that we're dead, my dear 
We can live, we can live forever 
Return to ashes, shed this skin 
Beyond the black, we rise again 
We shall live forever</field>

Winter it will send 
Throwing all you see 
Into obscurity 
Death of Mother Earth 
Never a rebirth 
Evolution's End 
Never will it mend 
Never 
Fire 
To begin whipping dance of the dead 
Blackened is the end 
To begin whipping dance of the dead 
Color our world blackened 
Blistering of Earth 
Terminate its worth 
Deadly nicotine 
Kill what might have been 
Callous frigid chill 
Nothing left to kill 
Never seen before 
Breathing nevermore 
Never 
Fire 
To begin whipping dance of the dead 
Blackened is the end 
To begin whipping dance of the dead 
Color our world blackened 
Blackened 
Opposition…Contradiction…Premonition…Compromise 
Agitation…Violation……Mutilation…Planet Dies 
Darkest color 
Blistered Earth 
True death of life 
Termination…Expiration…Cancellation…Human Race 
Expectation…Liberation…Population…Lay to waste 
See our mother 
Put to death 
See our mother die 
Smoldering decay 
Take her breath away 
Millions of our years 
In minutes disappears 
Darkening in vain 
Decadence remains 
All is said and done 
Never is the sun 
Never 
Fire 
To begin whipping dance of the dead 
Blackened is the end 
To begin whipping dance of the dead 
Fire 
Is the outcome of hypocrisy 
Darkest potency 
In the exit of humanity 
Color our world blackened 
Blackened.</field>

Curses rest on thee 
Solitaire and sorrow 
All Eternity 
Save the Earth and claim perfection 
Deem the mass and blame rejection 
Hold the pose, reign perception 
Grudges break your back 
All you bear 
All you carry 
All you bear 
Place it right on, right on me 
Die as you suffer in vain 
Own all the grief and the pain 
Die as you hold up the skies 
Atlas, Rise! 
How does it feel on your own? 
Bound by the world all alone 
Crushed under heavy skies 
Atlas, Rise! 
Crucify and witness 
Circling the sun 
Bastardize and ruin 
What have you become? 
Blame the world, and blame your maker 
Wish 'em to the undertaker 
Crown yourself the other savior 
So you carry on 
All you bear 
All you carry 
All you bear 
Place it right on me, right on me 
Die as you suffer in vain 
Own all the grief and the pain 
Die as you hold up the skies 
Atlas, Rise! 
How does it feel on your own? 
Bound by the world all alone 
Crushed under heavy skies 
Crushed under heavy skies 
Atlas, Rise! 
Masquerade as maker 
Heavy is the crown 
Beaten down and broken 
Drama wears you down 
Overload, the martyr stumbles 
Hit the ground and heaven crumbles 
All alone, the fear shall humble 
Swallow all your pride 
All you bear 
All you carry 
All you bear 
Place it right on, right on me 
Die as you suffer in vain 
Own all the grief and the pain 
Die as you hold up the skies 
Atlas, Rise! 
How does it feel on your own? 
Bound by the world all alone 
Crushed under heavy skies 
Crushed under heavy skies 
Atlas, Rise!</field>

I run but it stays right by my side

You feed it once and now it stays 
Now it stays 
So tear me open, but beware 
There's things inside without a care 
And the dirt still stains me 
So wash me until I'm clean 
It grips you so hold me 
It stains you so hold me 
It hates you so hold me 
It holds you so hold me 
Until it sleeps 
So tell me why you've chosen me 
Don't want your grip 
Don't want your greed 
Don't want it 
I'll Tear me open, make you gone 
No more can you hurt anyone 
And the fear still shakes me 
So hold me until it sleeps 
It grips you so hold me 
It stains you so hold me 
It hates you so hold me 
It holds you, holds you, holds you

I don't want it.. 
No 
So tear me open, but beware 
The pain's inside without a care 
And the dirt still stains me 
So wash me til I'm clean

No longer will you hurt anyone 
And the hate still shapes me

Money talking 
Power wolves beset your door 
Hear them stalking 
Soon you'll please their appetite

Hammer of justice crushes you 
Overpower 
The ultimate in vanity

I can't believe the things you say

Justice is lost 
Justice is raped 
Justice is gone 
Pulling your strings

Seeking no truth 
Winning is all 
Find it so grim 
So true 
So real 
Apathy their stepping stone 
So unfeeling 
Hidden deep animosity 
So deceiving 
Through your eyes their light burns 
Hoping to find 
Inquisition sinking you 
With prying minds

Truth assassin 
Rolls of red tape seal your lips

Their money tips her scales again

Cannot feel

You've arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried. 
Take her down now, don't want to see her face 
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my 
disgrace. 
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice. 
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price. 
See their bodies out on the ice. 
Take my time. 
Am I evil? Yes I am. 
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am. 
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head. 
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread. 
Taking no chances, you come with me. 
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free. 
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice. 
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price. 
See their bodies out on the ice. 
Take my time. 
Am I evil? Yes I am. 
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am. 
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride. 
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride. 
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat. 
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet. 
Am I evil? Yes I am. 
Am I evil? I am man. 
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire. 
You can come with me, sweet desire. 
My face is long forgot, my face not my own. 
Sweet and timely whore, take me home. 
Am I evil? Yes I am. 
Am I evil? I am man. 
My soul is longing for, await my heir. 
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself. 
My face is long forgot, my face not my own. 
Sweet and timely whore, take me home. 
Am I evil? Yes I am. 
Am I evil? I am man. 
Am I evil? Yes I fuc*ing am.

Arching back, shape-shift derange

Scratching at the door 
Am I savage? 
I don't recognize you anymore

Snap inside, the beast about complete 
Change 
Soon infects the rest

Howling evermore

Out at you from their hiding place

Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah 
Like silver scrapes in May 
Now the sands become a crust 
And most of you have gone away, then you're gone away 
Ah, come Susie dear, let's take a walk 
Just out there upon the beach 
I know you'll soon be married 
And you want to know where winds come from 
Well, it's never said at all 
On the map that Carrie reads 
Behind the clock back there you know 
At the four winds bar, mm, yeah 
Yeah 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey!

Four winds at the four winds bar 
Two doors locked and windows barred

The other one's a duplicate 
The queenly flux, eternal light 
Or the light that never warms 
Yes, the light that never, never warms 
Yes, the light that never, never warms 
Never warms, never warms 
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst 
Out at you from their hiding place 
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear 
Would find themselves at four winds bar 
It's the nexus of the crisis 
And the origin of storms 
Just the place to hopelessly 
Encounter time and then came me 
Yo! 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Call me Desdenova, eternal light 
These gravely digs of mine 
Will surely prove a sight 
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent

Solitaire and sorrow 
All Eternity 
Save the Earth and claim perfection 
Deem the mass and blame rejection 
Hold the pose, reign perception

Place it right on, right on me 
Die as you suffer in vain 
Own all the grief and the pain 
Die as you hold up the skies 
Atlas, Rise! 
How does it feel on your own? 
Bound by the world all alone 
Crushed under heavy skies 
Atlas, Rise! 
Crucify and witness 
Circling the sun 
Bastardize and ruin 
What have you become? 
Blame the world, and blame your maker 
Wish 'em to the undertaker 
Crown yourself the other savior 
So you carry on

Atlas, Rise! 
Masquerade as maker 
Heavy is the crown 
Beaten down and broken 
Drama wears you down 
Overload, the martyr stumbles 
Hit the ground and heaven crumbles 
All alone, the fear shall humble 
Swallow all your pride 
All you bear 
All you carry 
All you bear 
Place it right on, right on me 
Die as you suffer in vain 
Own all the grief and the pain 
Die as you hold up the skies 
Atlas, Rise! 
How does it feel on your own? 
Bound by the world all alone

When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski 
In the dark of the moon 
It made me dream of Nosferatu 
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau 
Oh wouldn’t it be lovely 
I was thinking Peter Lorre 
When things got pretty gory as I 
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate 
I was feeling snappy perhaps I’d been napping 
And I’d just ate 
A following heart can tear you apart 
On a midnight to 8 shift 
A graveyard romance can only give one chance 
As the tombstones weave and breathe 
Feeling happy when my heart got beating 
On a Sunday afternoon 
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses 
And stars were still illumed 
I have three hearts that I keep apart 
Trying to relate 
To normal feelings and the nightime reelings 
And some absynthe drunk so late 
The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk 
Onto the size of dessert plates 
But me I’m happy cause I got my little nappy 
And some opium to set me straight 
I’m just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl 
While my looks still hold me straight 
Straight up to illusion and fantasy’s fusion 
Of reality mixed with drink 
I’m just a small town girl who’s gonna give life a whirl 
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate</field>

You did not desert me

So many different suns

But we live in different ones 
Now the sun's gone to hell

But it's written in the starlight

All sanity is now beyond me 
Delusion 
All sanity is but a memory 
My life 
The war that never ends 
Leave the battlefield 
Yet its horrors never heal 
Coming home from war 
Pieces don't fit anymore 
Make it go away

All sanity is but a memory 
My life 
The war that never ends 
Father please come home 
Shell shocked all I've known 
Father please come home 
Label him a deadwood soldier now 
Cast away and left to roam 
Rapid is the road to sacrifice 
Just takes longer to come home 
Confusion 
All sanity is now beyond me 
Delusion 
Crossfire ricochets inside me 
Trapped in a memory forever

You're just the funeral I've been

Cyanide 
living dead inside 
Break this empty shell forever more. 
Say, is that rain or are they tears? 
That has stained your concrete face for years. 
The crying, weeping, shedding strife 
Year after year, life after life. 
An air of freshly broken ground. 
A concrete angel lit right down 
Upon the grave which swallos fast 
It's peace at last, peace at last! 
Empty they say, 
Death, won't you let me stay? 
Empty they say, 
Death, hear me call your name

stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back 
Blood follows blood and we make sure

Try to rob us of it, but it's no use 
Steamroller action crushing all 
Victim is your name and you shall fall

We chew and spit you out 
we laugh, you scream and shout 
All flee, with fear you run 
You'll know just where we come from

Damage jackals ripping right through you 
sight and smell of this, it gets me goin' 
Know just how to get just what we want 
tear it from your soul in nightly hunt

No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend

now an empty shell 
twenty one, only son 
but he served us well 
Bred to kill, not to care 
do just as we say 
finished here, Greeting Death

Back to the front

Back to the front 
you will die when I say, you must die 
Back to the front 
you coward 
you servant 
you blindman 
Barking of machinegun fire, does nothing to me now 
sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow 
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory seeker trends 
bodies fill the fields I see

Kill, have no fear 
Lie, live off lying 
Hell, Hell is here 
I was born for dying 
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say 
had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day 
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done 
left to die with only friend 
Alone I clench my gun 
Soldier boy, made of clay

The self deprivation 
The self flagellation of you

We do like you haughty 
We do love to look upon your perfect body 
The hair on your shoulders 
The smell of your armpit 
The taste of your vulva and everything on it 
We all really love you 
And you have no meaning 
You don't even see us 
You were never caring 
You go do what you do 
You do it for you 
No one exists with you 
You're way above caring 
Leave a trail upon the wake 
That no one ever tries to take 
Because waiting for you 
Thinking of you 
Is another way of dying 
Is another way of dying 
I'm clawing your chest 
'Til your collarbone bleeds 
Piercing your nipples 'til I bite them off 
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders 
Way above caring 
Way above caring 
And your Kotex jukebox 
Your Kotex jukebox 
I'm doomed, I'm swearing 
Waiting for you 
In your high heels and nightie 
Your leather dress squeaking 
Latex now sweating, waiting for you 
In your tincture 
Your opium white bathrobe 
Your white tiles run red now 
Are we both dead now? 
The liquid exchange of our heart 
The liquid exchange of our heart 
Are we both dead now? 
You're way above caring 
Your heart on your sleeve 
A red star of idiocy

Oblivious to caring

Feeling 
Feeling 
What a glorious feeling 
To be so rejected 
So rejected 
An idiot's idiocy 
My caring for you 
You think I'm a book or a table 
You can rest your fuckin' feet on 
When you're able 
The taste of your vulva, everything on it 
The hair on your shoulders 
The smell of your armpit 
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body 
We love you regal 
We love you haughty 
Oblivious to caring 
Oblivious to caring 
Caring 
Oh my dear 
Oh my dear 
Oh my dear 
Oblivious to caring 
Are we really dead now? 
Are we both dead now?</field>

Lies dreaming in death 
He sleeps under cosmos shaking 
Stars granting his breath 
He wakes as the world dies screaming 
All horrors arrive 
He wakes giving earth its bleeding 
Pure madness alive 
And He haunts you 
And He binds your soul 
And He loathes you 
And reclaims it all 
You turn to stone 
Can't look away 
You turn to stone 
Madness, they say 
Cthulhu, awaken 
He sways in abyss returning 
Inhaling black skies 
He shakes with a torture burning 
All lost in his eyes 
And He haunts you 
And He binds your soul 
And He loathes you 
And reclaims it all 
You turn to stone 
Can't look away 
You turn to stone

Seething damnation

Death by creation

What Is This Hell You Have Put Me Through 
Believer 
Deceiver 
Day In Day Out Live My Life Through You 
Pushed Onto Me What's Wrong Or Right 
Hidden From This Thing That They Call Life 
Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
Every Thought I'd Think You'd Disapprove 
Curator 
Dictator 
Always Cencoring My Every Move 
Children Are Seen But Are Not Heard 
Tear Out Everything Inspired 
Innocence 
Torn From Me Without Your Shelter 
Barred Reality 
I'm Living Blindly 
Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
Time Has Frozen Still What's Left To Be 
Hear Nothing 
Say Nothing 
Cannot Face The Fact I Think For Me 
No Guarantee,It's Life As Is 
But Damn You For Not Giving Me My Chance 
Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
You've Clipped My Wings Before I Learned To Fly 
Unspoiled 
Unspoken 
I've Outgrown That Fucking Lullaby 
Same Thing I've Always Heard From You 
Do As I Say Not As I Do 
Innocence 
Torn From Me Without Your Shelter 
Barred Reality 
I'm Living Blindly 
I'm In Hell Without You 
Cannot Cope Without You Two 
Shocked At The World That I See 
Innocent Victim Please Rescue Me 
Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
Hidden In Your World You've Made For Me 
I'm Seething 
I'm Bleeding

Undying Spite I Feel For You

Don't forget, my son, 
To include everyone 
Tuck you in, warm within 
Keep you free from sin 
Till the sandman he comes 
Sleep with one eye open 
Gripping your pillow tight 
Exit light 
Enter night 
Take my hand 
We're off to never neverland 
Something's wrong, shut the light 
Heavy thoughts tonight 
And they aren't of Snow White 
Dreams of war, dreams of liars 
Dreams of dragon's fire 
And of things that will bite 
Sleep with one eye open 
Gripping your pillow tight 
Exit light 
Enter night 
Take my hand 
We're off to never neverland 
Now I lay me down to sleep 
Pray the Lord my soul to keep 
If I die before I wake 
Pray the Lord my soul to take 
Hush little baby, don't say a word 
And never mind that noise you heard 
It's just the beasts under your bed 
In your closet, in your head 
Exit light 
Enter night 
Grain of sand 
Exit light 
Enter night 
Take my hand 
We're off to never neverland</field>

Can't get caught in the endless circle 
Ring of stupidity 
Out of my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see 
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings 
Don't tell me what to do 
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side 
And I can see through you 
Feed my brain with your so called standards 
Who says that I ain't right 
Break away from your common fashion 
See through your blurry sight 
Out of my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see 
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 
See them try to bring the hammer down 
No damn chains can hold me to the ground 
Life is for my own to live my own way...</field>

Truth is an offence 
You silence for your confidence 
Do you hear what I hear? 
Doors are slamming shut 
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Bittering distress 
Who decides what you express? 
Do you take what I take? 
Endurance is the word 
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd 
Doesn't matter what you see 
Or into it what you read 
You can do it your own way 
If it's done just how I say 
Independence limited 
Freedom of choice 
Choice is made for you my friend 
Freedom of speech 
Speech is words that they will bend 
Freedom with their exception 
Do you fear what I fear? 
Living properly 
Truths to you are lies to me 
Do you choose what I choose? 
More alternatives 
Energy derives from both the plus and negative 
Do you need what I need? 
Boundaries overthrown 
Look inside, to each his own 
Do you trust what I trust? 
Me, myself, and I 
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the Selfish lie 
Doesn't matter what you see 
Or into it what you read

Desire not a thing 
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

Drifting further every day 
Getting lost within myself 
Nothing matters, no one else

Simply nothing more to give 
There is nothing more for me 
Need the end to set me free 
Things not what they used to be 
Missing one inside of me 
Deathly lost, this can't be real 
Cannot stand this hell I feel 
Emptiness is filling me 
To the point of agony 
Growing darkness taking dawn 
I was me, but now he's gone 
No one but me can save myself 
But it's too late 
Now I can't think 
Think why I should even try 
Yesterday seems as though it never existed 
Death greets me warm 
Now I will just say goodbye</field>

Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins 
One for each of us and our sins 
So you lay us in a line 
Push your pins, they make us humble 
Only you can tell in time 
If we fall or merely stumble 
But tell me 
Can you heal what father's done 
Or fix this hole in a mother's son 
Can you heal the broken worlds within 
Can you strip away so we may start again 
Tell me, can you heal what father's done 
Or cut this rope and let us run 
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free 
You jab another pin 
Jab another pin in me 
Yeah 
Mirror, mirror upon the wall 
Break the spell or become the doll 
See you sharpening the pins 
So the holes will remind us 
We're just the toys in the hands of another 
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust 
But tell me 
Can you heal what father's done 
Or fix this hole in a mother's son 
Can you heal the broken worlds within 
Can you strip away so we may start again 
Tell me, can you heal what father's done 
Or cut this rope and let us run 
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free 
You jab another pin 
Jab another pin in me 
Jab it 
Blood for face 
Sweat for dirt 
Three X's for the stone 
To break this curse 
A ritual's due 
I believe I'm not alone 
Shell of shotgun 
Pint of gin 
Numb us up to shield the pins 
Renew our faith 
Which way we can 
To fall in love with life again 
To fall in love with life again 
To fall in love with life again 
To fall in love 
To fall in love 
To fall in love with life again 
So tell me 
Can you heal what father's done 
Or fix this hole in a mother's son 
Can you heal the broken worlds within 
Can you strip away so we may start again 
Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done 
Or cut this rope and let us run 
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free 
You jab another pin 
Jab another pin in me 
Oh yeah 
No more pins in me, yeah 
No more, no more pins in me 
No more, no more pins in me 
No more, no more, no more 
No, no, no.</field>

Constant chill deep inside 
Shouting gun, 
On they run through the endless gray 
On they fight, for they are right, 
Yes, but who's to say? 
For a hill, men would kill. 
Why? they do not know 
Stiffened wounds test their pride 
Men of five, still alive 
Through the raging glow 
Gone insane from the pain 
That they surely know 
For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on 
For whom the bell tolls 
Take a look to the sky 
Just before you die 
It's the last time he will 
Blackened roar, massive roar, 
Fills the crumbling sky 
Shattered goal fills his soul 
With a ruthless cry 
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery 
He hears the silence so loud 
Crack of dawn, all is gone 
Except the will to be 
Now they see what will be, 
Blinded eyes to see 
For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on

Better raise your ears 
The sound of hooves knocks at your door 
Lock up your wife and children now 
It's time to wield the blade 
For now you have got some company 
The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They have come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four Horsemen ride 
or choose your fate and die 
You have been dying since the day you were born 
You know it has all been planned 
The quartet of deliverance rides 
A sinner once a sinner twice 
No need for confession now 
Cause now you have got the fight of your life 
The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They have come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four Horsemen ride 
or choose your fate and die 
Time 
Has taken its toll on you 
The lines that crack your face 
Famine 
Your body it has torn through 
Withered in every place 
Pestilence 
For what you have had to endure 
And what you have put others through 
Death 
Deliverance for you for sure 
There is nothing you can do 
So gather round young warriors now 
and saddle up your steeds 
Killing scores with demon swords 
Now is the death of doers of wrong 
Swing the judgment hammer down 
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat 
The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They have come to take your life 
On through the dead of night

I see you with your portraiture 
Does he love you? 
Does he love you too? 
The brush strokes 
Kiss your breasts and toes 
I cry icicles in my stein 
The heartbeats flutter 
With an abnormal rhythm 
The pain shoots through my body 
A sword between my thighs 
I wish that I could kill you 
But I too love your eyes 
You’re feeling less whore but you stimulate 
The hatred smolders in your eyes 
I’d drop to my knees in a second 
To salivate in your thighs 
But all I do is fall over 
I don’t have the strength I once had 
In you and your prickless lover 
And his easel in his eyes 
I feel the pain creep up my leg 
Blood runs from my nose 
I puke my guts out at your feet 
You’re more man than I 
To be dead to have no feeling 
To be dry and spermless like a girl 
I want so much to hurt you 
I want so much to hurt you 
I want so much to hurt you 
Marry me 
I want you as my wife 
Spermless like a girl

I'm loose, I'm clean, I'm burning lean and mean, and mean. 
Ignite the open trail, 
Excite, exhale, comin' on, hot from hell, yeah hot from hell. 
CHORUS 
Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire, 
Oooh, yeah-heh. 
On I burn! 
On, and on, and on.. 
Give me fuel, 
On, and on, and on.. 
Give me fire, 
On, and on, and on.. 
My desire, 
On, and on, and on.. 
CHORUS 
Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!

Come won't you stay 
Sincere 
Sincere 
All ends in tears 
Endure

Thoughts most impure 
Concede 
Concede 
But both shall we bleed 
Oh, halo on fire 
The midnight knows it well 
Fast, is desire 
Creates another hell 
I fear to turn on the light 
For the darkness won't go away 
Fast, is desire 
Turn out the light 
Halo on fire 
Allure 
Allure 
Sweetness obscure 
Abide 
Abide 
Secrets inside 
Deprive 
Deprive 
To feel so alive 
Obey 
Obey 
Just don't turn away 
Oh, halo on fire 
The midnight knows it well 
Fast, is desire 
Creates another hell 
I fear to turn on the light 
For the darkness won't go away 
Fast, is desire 
Turn out the light 
Halo on fire 
Prayers cannot get through 
Return to sender 
Unto which of you 
Shall I surrender 
Twisting in disguise 
Dark resurrection 
Lighting up the skies 
Wicked perfection 
Too dark to sleep 
Can't slip away 
Open or close 
My eyes betray 
Beyond the black 
Come won't you stay 
Hello darkness 
Say goodbye 
Hello darkness 
Say goodbye 
Hello darkness 
Say goodbye</field>

Pure black looking clear

Try getting back to me 
Get back which used to be

Shoot in

Distributor of pain 
Your loss becomes my gain 
Anger

That thunders aimless through my head 
And hate is the fame 
Chained to the wheel until I'm dead 
Rage is a flame 
Creates a touch to boil the seas 
And rage is to blame 
Forever sorry I shall be 
And from a darkness I descend 
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge 
You took away tomorrow, still I stand 
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand 
You took away tomorrow, still I stand 
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand 
Wrath is the name 
Branding suffer onto you 
And wrath takes the shame 
And holds me down until its through 
And from a darkness I descend 
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge 
You took away tomorrow, still I stand 
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand 
You took away tomorrow, still I stand 
I sink into the sorrow, but still I stand 
And hate is a train 
They'd hung for those fleshes carved 
And hate takes the blame 
A beast that never slows at all 
And from a darkness I descend 
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge 
Burst into flame, the bitter end 
And shake these gates of hell again 
Cursed to drown in sorrow... 
You took away tomorrow, still I stand 
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand 
You took away tomorrow, still I stand 
You left me here with sorrow, still I stand</field>

She is wretched but she comforts me... 
After everyone goes home, 
She’s always there for me ! 
And when the sun goes hellbound... 
And the moon does resurrect the night ! 
I’ll hide within her... 
Not much good has come out of the light ! 
After everyone goes home, 
And I’m left here on my own, 
I will run straight to hell and back ! 
Straight to hell and back ! 
When they turn out all their lights, 
And I’m left to brood at night, 
Always return to hell and back ! 
Straight to hell and back ! 
Straight down, yeah !!! 
A lonely light in a window 
Just longing for some company ! 
Tragic, heartless and hateful 
But there’s nothing as willing as she ! 
And when the night has fallen 
It falls hard and then it all begins ! 
When she starts her calling 
I feel my darkness growing from within ! 
After everyone goes home, 
And I’m left here on my own, 
I will run straight to hell and back ! 
Straight to hell and back ! 
When they turn out all their lights,

Straight to hell and back ! 
I will run straight to hell and back ! 
I become two ! 
We become one ! 
Unbridled… unequaled… unholy… undone ! 
The path is cut deep ! 
The path is worn well ! 
I’ll follow my footsteps to the warmth of hell ! 
The warmth of hell ! 
After everyone goes home,

Countless hatreds built my shrine 
I was born in anger's flame 
He was abel, I was cain 
I am here 
I'm hell unbound 
Burn your kingdom to the ground 
To the ground 
Here comes revenge, just for you 
Revenge, you can't undo 
Revenge, is killing me 
Revenge, set me free 
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth 
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof 
Revenge, just for you 
Revenge 
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge 
I return this nightmare, I will find you 
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you 
Man has made me oh so strong 
Blurring lines of right and wrong 
Far too late for frail amends 
Now it's come to sweet revenge 
Desperate hands 
That lose control 
Have no mercy on your soul 
On your soul 
Here comes revenge, just for you 
Revenge, you can't undo

A light that warms no matter where they go 
They're off to find the hero of the day 
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way 
Still the window burns 
Time so slowly turns 
And someone there is sighing 
Keepers of the flames 
Do you feel your name? 
Can you hear your babies crying? 
Mama they try and break me 
Still they try and break me 
Excuse me while I tend to how a feel 
These things return to me that still seem real 
Now deservingly this easy chair 
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair 
Don't want your hate 
But the first I'll make 
For years 
can't hold or feel 
No I'm not all me 
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel 
But now the dreams 
And waking screams 
That everlast the night 
So build a wall 
Behind it crawl 
And hide until it's light 
So can you hear your babies crying now? 
Still the window burns 
Time so slowly turns 
And someone there is sighing 
Keepers of the flames 
Can't you hear your name? 
Can't hear your babies crying? 
But now the dreams 
And waking screams 
That everlast the night 
So build a wall 
Behind it crawl 
And hide until it's light 
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

If the effort’s too high no matter who you are 
You can’t catch the moon, or the sun or the stars 
It doesn’t matter who you are 
Iced honey 
Now me I’ve tried a million tricks 
To make life cold and make it stick 
Not running heat that flames then out 
But the proud piece of ice that always floats 
Iced honey 
If I can’t trap a butterfly or a bee 
If I can’t keep my heart where I want it to be 
If no matter how much soul and heart 
I put to the wood 
If a flaming heart is not that good 
Iced honey 
If you can’t put a butterfly in a jar 
If violence mars your final hour 
If you make others feel like jam 
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb 
If it’s all mixed up and you cannot shout 
And your oxygen starts to run out 
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong 
And instead of hello you say so long 
If your energy starts to leak out 
And people wonder what you’re all about 
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart 
The story of love gives them all a start 
And me, I’ve always been this way 
Not by choice, just this way 
I can’t put my honey pot in a jar 
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy 
If you can’t put a butterfly in a jar 
No wonder no need to wonder where you are 
It might seem like hell, the River Styx 
Your affection never sticks 
No matter what you say, no matter what you do 
A butterfly heart flies right past you 
There’s nothing to say, nothing to do 
See if the ice will melt for you

The summons bell will chime 
Tempting you and all the earth 
to join our sinful kind 
There is a job to be done and I'm the one 
You people make me do it 
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate 
to pull you down into this pit 
So come on 
Jump in the Fire 
So come on 
Jump in the Fire 
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins 
The end is closing in 
Feeding on the minds of man 
and from their souls within 
My disciples all shout to search out 
And they always shall obey 
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild 
But do just as I say 
So come on 
Jump in the Fire 
So come on 
Jump in the Fire 
Jump by your will or be taken by force 
I'll get you either way 
Trying to keep the hellfire lit 
I am stalking you as prey 
Living your life as me I am you you see 
There is a part of me in everyone 
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through 
the land 
Come home where you belong 
So come on 
Jump in the Fire 
So come on 
Jump in the Fire</field>

If I was half drowning 
An arm above the last wave 
Would you come to me 
Would you pull me up 
Would the effort really hurt you 
Is it unfair to ask you 
To help pull me up 
The window broke the silence of the matches 
The smoke effortlessly floating 
Pull me up 
Would you be my lord and savior 
Pull me up by my hair 
Now would you kiss me, on my lips 
Burning fever burning on my forehead 
The brain that once was listening now 
Shoots out its tiresome message

All drowning in the blame 
All reflections look the same 
In the shine of the midnight revolver 
All hide beneath a skin 
A hope so paper thin 
I'm at the door again 
And the shine of the midnight revolver 
Even the promise of danger has gone dull 
Staring down the barrel of a 45 
Suck on the barrel 
Suck on the barrel 
Suck it 'til it's gone dry 
For all reflections look the same 
In the shine of the midnight revolver 
Redemption purify 
Will nothing satisfy 
The scars just multiply 
In the shine of the midnight revolver 
Twisting in apocalypse 
Death upon the fingertips 
Frigid metal touches lips 
And the shine of the midnight revolver 
'Cause you lied 
Just a bullet away 
Just a bullet away from leavin' you 
Just a bullet away 
Stop the voices in my head 
Caressing death again 
Becomes the heroin 
Forbidden medicine 
Puts a shine on the midnight revolver 
Eternal borderline 
All the faces intertwine 
Oh God now I see mine 
In the shine of the midnight revolver 
Even the promise of danger has gone dull 
Staring down the barrel of a 45 
Suck on the barrel 
Suck on the barrel 
Suck, suck 'til it's dry 
For all reflections look the same 
In the shine of the midnight revolver 
Down In Misery 
Down In Misery 
Just a bullet away 
Just a bullet away from leavin' you 
Just a bullet away

And the shine of the midnight revolver 
Even the promise of danger has gone dull 
Staring down the barrel of a 45 
Suck on the barrel 
Suck on the barrel 
Suck, suck 'til it's dry 
Do all reflections look the same 
In the shine of the midnight revolver 
'Cause you lied 
Yes you lied 
Just a bullet away 
Just a bullet away from leavin' you 
Just a bullet away

Death in the air 
Strapped in the electric chair

"I'll take your life from you!" 
Flash before my eyes 
Now it's time to die 
Burning in my brain 
I can feel the flames 
No Remorse 
No mercy for what we are doing 
No thought to even what we have done 
We don't need to feel the sorrow 
No remorse for the helpless one 
War without end

No life till leather 
We are gonna kick some ass tonight 
We got the metal madness 
When our fans start screaming 
It's right well all right 
When we start to rock 
We never want to stop again 
Hit the lights 
Hit the lights 
Hit the lights 
You know our fans are insane 
We are gonna blow this place away 
With volume higher

The lines that crack you face 
Famine

Withered in every place 
Pestilence

And what you have put others through 
Death deliverance for you for sure 
There is nothing you can do 
Phantom Lord 
Sound is ripping through your ears 
The deafening waiting for his whips 
The taste of leather on you lips 
Your bodies waiting for his whips 
The taste of leather on you lips 
Hear the cry of War 
Louder than before 
With this sword in hand 
To control the land 
Crushing metal strikes 
On this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees 
For the Phantom Lord 
Victims falling under chains 
Your hear them crying death pains 
The fists of terrors breaking through 
Now there's nothing you can do 
Hear the cry of War 
Louder than before 
With this sword in hand 
To control the land 
Crushing metal strikes 
On this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees 
For the Phantom Lord 
Fight Fire with Fire 
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death 
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath 
Fight fire with fire 
Ending is near 
Fight fire with fire 
Bursting with fear 
Fight fire with fire (repeat)</field>

------------------------------------ 
(Originally recorded by The Misfits) 
I got something to say 
I killed your baby today 
Doesn't matter much to me 
As long as it's dead 
I got something to say 
I raped your mother today 
And it doesn't matter much to me 
As long as she's spread 
Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath 
Cold sweet death, one last caress 
Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath 
Cold sweet death, one last caress 
I got something to say 
I killed your baby today 
And it doesn't matter much to me 
As long as it's dead 
Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath 
Cold sweet death, one last caress 
Last caress today, yo-o-o-oh, yooo, oh 
Here in this place lies the key to your death - Touch it, see it (ooh) 
Here in this place is the means to your end - Touch it, feel it 
Green hell 
You did your best as someone could 
I bet you never knew you would 
And did you run away from me 
I bet you thought you really could 
We're gonna burn in hell - Green hell 
Like every hell but kind of green - Green hell, green hell 
Try let me get back up there - Green hell, green hell 
Feel it burning in your cereal - Green hell, green hell 
Throw your fucking friends inside - Green hell, green hell 
Gotta fucking pay and you must stay - Green hell 
Cannot refill the torch of death - Green hell, green hell 
Hell is reigning in your blood - Green hell, green hell 
Gotta burn it all 
Green hell 
You did your best as someone could 
I bet you never knew you would 
And did you run away from me 
I bet you thought you really could 
Here in this place lies the key to your death - Touch it, see it (ooh) 
Here in this place is your world that ended - Touch it, feel it 
Green hell 
You did your best as someone could 
I bet you never knew you would 
And did you run away from me 
I bet you thought you really could 
You've come to this as someone told 
I bet you never knew you would 
Gonna bring green hell

circus comes to town, you play the lead clown 
Please, please

Bow to Leper Messiah 
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix 
blind devotion came, rotting your brain 
Chain, chain 
Join the endless chain, sinking by his glamour 
Fame, Fame 
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power

Moaning at the bed side 
Moaning from each limb 
Little dog who can’t get in 
Can only cry but 
Can not swim 
Pony legs, little trot 
Little dog has to wait a lot 
The bigger dog has got his spot 
And elbowed him away 
Listen to him barking 
Listen to him call 
Little dog don’t have much at all 
A puny body and a tiny dick 
A little dog can make you sick 
If you got the money you can go to the top 
The female dog don’t care what you got 
As long as you can raise that 
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy 
You could have a taste 
A taste of what the big dog got 
A taste of what the big dog got 
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot 
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot 
Hot in trot 
Run his tongue over the hot in trot 
Money can do anything

Money can do anything 
Tell me what you want 
My small dog, he want what I got 
Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot

The little man follows his nose 
Counts his fingers and his toes 
He still got those

Following his nose 
But it needs my money to buy 
I’m an up while you’re a down 
I am an up while you’re a down 
The spring and the will follow me around 
While you sniff your shit in the wind 
Sniff your shit in the wind

At last the thawing has begun 
Come trade your darkness for the sun 
Melting the chill of winter's turn, 
So celebrate and let your fires burn 
Lords of summer have returned! 
Straight 
Light passes through, penetrate 
It's been a long lonely winter 
Illumination, bright 
Bathe in the volume and light 
Reanimated by fire 
Transformation, 
Become the nexus of the sound 
Become the shaking of the ground

My fingers seek my veins 
There's a dog at your back step 
He must come in from the rain 
I fall 'cause I let go 
The net below has rot away 
So my eyes seek reality 
And my fingers seek my veins 
The trash fire is warm 
But nowhere safe from the storm 
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn 
So as I write to you 
Of what is done and to do 
Maybe you'll understand 
And won't cry for this man 
'cause low man is due 
Please forgive me 
My eyes seek reality 
My fingers feel for faith 
Touch clean with a dirty hand 
I touched the clean to the waste 
The trash fire is warm 
But nowhere safe from the storm 
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn 
So as I write to you, yeah 
Of what is done and to do, yeah 
Maybe you'll understand 
And won't cry for this man 
'cause low man is due 
Please forgive me 
Please forgive me 
Please forgive me 
So low the sky is all I see 
All I want from you is forgive me 
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain 
Though he just wants right back out again 
And I cry to the alleyway 
Confess all to the rain 
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror 
The one I've broken to match my face 
The trash fire is warm 
But nowhere safe from the storm 
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn 
So as I write to you, yeah 
Of what is done and to do, yeah 
Maybe you'll understand 
And won't cry for this man 
'cause low man is due 
Please forgive me 
Please forgive me 
So low the sky is all I see 
All I want from you is forgive me 
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain

            <field name="lyrics">Mama, she has taught me well 
Told me when I was young 
"Son, your life's an open book 
Don't close it 'fore its done" 
"The brightest flame burns quickest" 
That's what I heard her say 
A son's heart's owned to mother 
But I must find my way 
Let my heart go 
Let your son grow 
Mama, let my heart go 
Or let this heart be still 
Yeah, still 
Rebel, my new last name 
Wild blood in my veins 
They bring strings around my neck 
The mark that still remains 
Left home at an early age 
Of what I heard was wrong 
I never asked forgiveness 
But what I said is done 
Let my heart go 
Let your son grow 
Mama, let my heart go 
Or Let this heart be still 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness l now take to my grave 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness I now take to my grave 
So let this heart be still 
Mama, now I'm coming home 
I'm not all you wished of me 
But a mother's love for her son 
Unspoken, help me be 
I took your love for granted 
And all the things you said to me 
I need your arms to welcome me 
But a cold stone's all I see 
Let my heart go 
Let your son grow 
Mama, let my heart go 
Or let this heart be still 
Let my heart go 
Mama, let my heart go 
You never let my heart go 
So let this heart be still 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness l now take to my grave 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness I now take to my grave 
So let this heart be still</field>

Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall 
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings

Pretend dead in their sleep, yeah 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes, you'll be hit and the curse is on you, yeah 
Oh, the curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly 
Or just destroying your future 
Making it all shady, yeah 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill (for the kill)

Tonight (tonight, tonight), yeah 
I'm going, I'm going 
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell 
Howl like a wolf 
And a witch will open the door 
Follow me and meet our high priestess, yeah-ee-yeah 
Come, come into my coven, yeah-ee-yeah 
And become Lucifer's child 
Undress 'til you're naked 
And put on this white coat 
Take this white cross and go to the center of the 
ring, yeah-ee-yeah 
Come, come into my coven, yeah-ee-yeah 
And become Lucifer's child 
I was born in the cemetery 
Under the sign of the moon 
Raised from my grave by the dead 
And I was made a mercenary 
In the legions of Hell 
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane, yeah 
You know my only pleasure is to hear you cry 
I'd love to hear you cry 
And I'd love to see you die 
And I'll be the first to watch your funeral 
And I'll be the last to leave 
I'd love to hear you cry 
And when you're down beyond the ground 
I'll dig up your body again 
And make love to shame 
Oh, lady cry, and say goodbye (goodbye) 
Oh, lady cry, and say goodbye 
Yeah, you gotta say goodbye 
Yeah, 'cause I will eat your mind</field>

Your snake cold lips 
Make a harsh straight line 
That echoes through my brain 
You’re perfect 
Let me lift a glass high 
Let me follow in your footsteps 
Let me follow in your sigh 
Let me follow in your sigh 
I’m a woman who likes men 
But this is something else 
I’ve never felt such stirrings 
I feel like I 
Was someone else 
I wish you’d tie me up and beat me 
Crush me like a kick 
A bleeding strap across my back 
Some blood that you could kiss 
Oh kiss away, oh kiss away 
I wish there was a strap of blood 
That you could kiss away 
I wish there was a strap of blood 
That you could kiss away 
Tie me with a scarf and jewels 
Put a bloody gag to my teeth 
I beg you to degrade me 
Is there waste that I could eat 
I am a secret lover 
I am your little girl 
Please spit into my mouth 
I’m forever in your swirl 
You’re heartless and I love that 
You have no use of me 
But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear 
And then insert a fist, an arm 
Some lost appendage 
Please open me I beg 
You are my goliath 
You are my goliath 
And I am mistress dread 
Oh I am mistress dread 
Oh I am mistress dread 
Open and release me 
I love you in my head 
Oh kiss away kiss away

All I ask my baby 
Kiss away

Pop queen, amphetamine 
The screams crashed into silence 
Tapped out 
Doused in the gasoline 
The high times going timeless 
Decadence 
Death of the innocence 
The pathway starts to spiral 
Infamy 
All for publicity 
Destruction going viral 
Light it up 
Ah, light it up 
Another hit erases all the pain 
Bulletproof 
Ah, kill the truth 
You're falling, but you think you're flying high 
High again 
Sold your soul 
Built a higher wall 
Yesterday 
Now you're thrown away 
Same rise and fall 
Who cares at all? 
Seduced by fame 
A moth into the flame 
Twisted 
Backstabbing wicked 
The delusion absolution 
Perjurer 
Fame is the murderer 
Seduce you into ruin 
Light it up 
Ah, light it up 
Another hit erases all the pain 
Bulletproof 
Ah, tell the truth 
You're falling, but you think you're flying high 
High again 
Sold your soul 
Built the higher wall 
Yesterday 
Now you're thrown away 
Same rise and fall 
Who cares at all? 
Seduced by fame 
A moth into the flame 
Burn 
Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself 
The vultures feast around you still 
Overdose on shame and insecurity 
If one won't do that fistful will 
Death scene 
Black hearse the limousine 
A grave filled with seduction 
Vaccine 
Fame does the murdering 
She builds up for destruction 
So light it up 
Ah, light it up 
Another hit erases all the pain 
Bulletproof 
Ah, no excuse 
You're falling, but you think you're flying high 
High again 
Sold your soul 
Built the higher wall 
Yesterday 
Now you're thrown away 
Same rise and fall 
Who cares at all?

Deadly vision 
Prophecy reveal 
Death magnetic 
Pulling closer still 
Fear thy name: annihilation 
Desolate inhale the fire 
So we cross that line

Go! 
Crushing metal, Ripping Skin 
Tossing body, mannequin 
Spilling Blood, Bleeding Gas 
Mangle flesh, Snapping spine 
Dripping bloody valentine 
Shatter face, spitting glass 
Split apart 
Split apart 
Split apart 
Split 
Spit it out! 
What makes me drift a litter bit closer? 
Dead man takes the steering wheel. 
What makes me know it's time to cross over? 
Born to repeat until i feel. 
See through the skin, bones they all rattle 
Future and past, they disagree. 
Flesh falls away, bones they all shatter 
I start to see the end in me 
See the end in me... 
Claustrophobic 
Climb out of this skin 
Heart explosive 
Reach in, pull that pin 
Violate, annihilate 
All wounds unto my eyes 
Obliterate, exterminate 
aAs life itself denied 
Fear thy name as hell awakens 
Destiny Inhale the Fire 
But we've crossed that line 
Into the grips 
Total eclipse 
Suffer unto my apocalypse 
Tyrant awaken my apocalypse. 
Demon awaken my apocalypse. 
Heaven awaken my apocalypse. 
Suffer forever my apocalypse.</field>

There's much more to life than what you see

You still stood there screaming 
No one caring about these words you tell 
My friend before your voice is gone 
One man's fun is another's hell 
These times are sent to try men's souls 
But something's wrong with all you see 
You, you'll take it on all yourself 
Remember, misery loves company

Heavy fog got me lost inside 
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride 
It´s my world 
You can´t have it 
It´s my world, It´s my world 
It´s my world 
I´m out of my head 
Get ´em out of my head, out of my head 
Get ´em out 
Who´s in charge of my head today 
Dancin´devils in angels way 
It´s my time now 
It´s my time now 
It´s my time, this is my time 
Look out motherfuckers, here I come 
I gonna make my head my home 
the son of a bitches are trying to take my head 
trying to make me someone else instead 
It´s my world 
You can´t have it 
It´s my world, It´s my world 
It´s my world 
I´m out of my head 
Get ´em out of my head, out of my head 
Get ´em out 
not only do I not know the answer 
I don't even know what the question is 
not only do I not know the answer 
I don't even know what the question is 
God it feels like it only rains on me (4x) 
not only do I not know the answer 
I don't even know what the question is 
not only do I not know the answer 
I don't even know what the question is 
I´m out of my head 
Get ´em out of my head, out of my head 
Get ´em out 
enough is enough</field>

On his crash course with the big time 
Pay no mind to the distant thunder 
Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy 
Says it feels right this time 
Turned it 'round and found the high lights 
"Good day to be alive, sir 
Good day to be alive," he says 
Then it comes to be that the soothing light 
at the end of your tunnel 
Was just a freight train coming your way 
Then it comes to be that the soothing light 
at the end of your tunnel 
Was just a freight train coming your way 
Don't it feel right like this? 
All the pieces fall to his wish 
"Suck up for that quick reward, boy 
Suck up for that quick reward," they say 
Then it comes to be that the soothing light 
at the end of your tunnel 
Was just a freight train coming your way 
Then it comes to be that the soothing light 
at the end of your tunnel 
Was just a freight train coming your way 
It's coming your way 
It's coming your way 
Here comes!

Attack 
Bullets are flying 
People are dying 
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose 
Soldiers are hounding 
Bodies are mounting 
cannons are shouting to take their abuse 
With war machines going 
Blood starts to flowing 
No mercy given to anyone hear 
The furious fighting 
Swords are like lighting 
It all becomes frightening to you 
Know death is near 
No remorse.</field>

Chill in the air cold as steel tonight

Nothing is real but pain now 
Hold my breath as I wish for death 
Oh please God, wake me 
Back in the womb it's much too real 
In pumps life that I must feel 
But can't look forward to reveal 
Look to the time when I'll live 
Fed through the tube that sticks in me 
Just like a wartime novelty 
Tied to machines that make me breathe 
Cut this life off from me

Now the world is gone I'm just one 
Oh God help me 
Hold my breath as I wish for death

Imprisoning me 
All that I see 
Absolute horror 
I cannot live 
I cannot die

Taken my speech 
Taken my hearing 
Taken my arms 
Taken my legs 
Taken my soul

You can never know what has happened to him 
If I have not been sure of this, I would not have permitted him to live 
Where am I? 
Father 
What happened? 
I need help 
What is democracy? 
What is democracy? 
It got something to do with young men killing each other, Arthur 
When it's comes my turn, will you want me to go? 
For democracy, any man would give his only begotten son 
It is impossible for any severed individual to experience pain 
Pleasure 
Memory 
Dreams or thought of any kind 
This young man will be as unfeeling 
As unthinking as the dead 
Until the day he joins them 
I don't know weather I'm alive or dreaming or dead or remembering 
How can you tell what's a dream and what's real 
When you can't even tell when you're awake and when you're asleep 
Where am I? 
I can't remember anything 
Can't tell if this is true or dream 
Deep down inside I feel to scream

I'm waking up, I cannot see

Hold my breath as I wish for death 
Oh please God, wake me 
They kept my head and chopped off everything 
Oh god, please make them hear me 
They won't listen, they won't hear me 
They got to wake me up I'll be like this for years 
Hear me 
Back in the womb it's much too real 
In pumps life that I must feel 
But can't look forward to reveal 
Look to the time when I'll live 
Fed through the tube that sticks in me 
Just like a wartime novelty 
Tied to machines that make me be 
Cut this life off from me 
Hold my breath as I wish for death 
Oh please God, wake me 
It's like a piece of me that keeps on living 
It won't always be like this, will it? 
I can't live like this! 
I-I can't! 
Please no 
I can't! I can't! 
Help me, help me, help me! 
Mother where are ya? 
Mommy, mother, I'm having a nightmare and I can't wake up 
Now the world is gone I'm just one 
Oh God help me 
Hold my breath as I wish for death 
Oh please God, help me 
Me lying here like, like some freak in a carnival show 
Here is the armless 
Legless 
Wonder of the twentieth century 
Death has a dignity of its own 
Father! 
I need help 
I'm in terrible trouble and I need help 
Don't you remember when you were little? 
How and you and Bill Harper use to string a wire between the two houses 
So you could telegraph to each other 
You'll remember the Morse code 
Darkness 
Imprisoning me 
All that I see 
Absolute horror 
I cannot live 
I cannot die 
Trapped in myself 
Body my holding cell 
It's Morse code 
For what? 
S.O.S. 
Help 
Landmine 
Has taken my sight 
Taken my speech 
Taken my hearing 
Taken my arms 
Taken my legs 
Taken my soul 
Left me with life in Hell 
What's he saying? 
Said kill me 
Over and over again 
Kill me 
Oh god, please make them hear me 
Don't you have any message for him Arthur? 
He's the product of your profession 
Not mine 
Kill me 
I'm asking you to kill me 
Thank you 
Save me please 
Father 
Each man faces death by himself 
Alone 
Good-bye father 
Inside me I'm screaming nobody pays any attention 
If I had arms, I could kill myself 
If I had legs, I could run away 
If I had a voice, I could talk and be some kind of company for myself 
How do I know they'll kill me? 
I could yell for help, but nobody'd help me 
I just got to do some kind of, see how I can go on like this 
S.O.S 
help me 
S.O.S

Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy 
While you yell out, “mercy” 
We grow apart 
Would you rip and cut me 
Use a knife on me 
Be shocked at the boldness 
The coldness of this little heart 
Tied up in leather 
Would you take the measure 
Of the blood that I pump 
In the manic confusion of love 
Supreme violation 
Supreme violation 
“Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you” 
“Oh Jack I beseech you” 
Supreme violation 
Blood in the foyer 
The bathroom 
The tea room 
The kitchen, with her knives splayed 
I will swallow your sharpest cutter 
Like a colored man’s dick 
Blood spurting from me 
“Oh Jack, Jack I beseech…” 
“Jack, I beseech you, I beseech…” 
In the end it was an ordinary heart 
“Oh Jack I beseech you” 
As I scream out my pain 
In the end it was an ordinary heart 
In the end, in the end, in the end 
It was an ordinary heart 
“Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you” 
Supreme violation  
 
Oh 
“Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you” 
I call out your name 
Blood in the foyer, the bathroom, 
The tea room, the kitchen 
And knives splayed 
I swallow your sharpest cutter 
Like a colored man’s dick 
Blood spurting from me 
Blood spurting from me 
“Oh Jack” 
“Oh Jack, I beseech ya” 
In the end it was an ordinary heart 
In the end it was an ordinary heart

Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,

Flash before my eyes 
Now it's time to die 
Burning in my brain 
I can feel the flame 
Wait for the sign 
To flick the switch of death 
It's the beginning of the end 
Sweat chilling cold 
As I watch death unfold 
Consiousness is my only friend 
My fingers grip with fear 
What am I doing here? 
Flash before my eyes 
Now it's time to die 
Burning in my brain 
I can feel the flame 
Someone help me 
Oh please God help me 
They are trying to take it all away 
I don't want to die 
Time moving slow 
The minutes seem like hours 
The final curtain all I see 
How true is this? 
Just get it over with 
If this is true, just let it be 
Wakened by horrid scream 
Freed from this frightening dream

Quiet town 
Small time boy 
Big time frown 
Never talks 
Never plays 
Different path 
Lost his way 
The streets are red 
Red I'm afraid 
There's no confetti 
No parade 
Nothing happens in this boring place 
But oh my god how it all dismays 
And they all pray 
Blood stain wash away 
He said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
I heard him, he said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
All things wash away 
But blood stains the sun red today 
I always said something wrong 
With little strange Ronnie Long 
Never laughed, never smiled 
Talked alone for miles and miles 
and miles 
Gallow calls, Son I say 
Keep your smile and laugh all day 
Think once again in this boring place 
For little boys how things do change 
And they all pray 
Blood stain wash away 
He said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
Yeah, I heard it 
He said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
All things wash away 
But blood stains the sun red today 
(Spoken) 
Yeah, well all the green things died 
When Ronnie moved to this place 
He said 
"Don't you dare ask 
Why I'm cursed to wear this face" 
Well, now we all know why the children called him 
Ronnie Frown 
When he pulled that gun from his pocket 
They all fall down down down 
(singing) 
He said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
Yeah, yeah, I heard him 
He screamed 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
All things wash away

All things wash away

Tarot Woman 
I don't wanna go 
Something tells me no, no, no, no 
But traces in the sand 
The lines inside my hand say go go go 
Beware of a place 
A smile on a bright shiny face 
I'll never return, how do you know 
Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know 
She can take you there 
The entrance to the fair, my, my, my 
Ride the carousel 
Cast a magic spell, you can fly, fly

High noon 
Oh I'd sell my soul for water 
Nine years' worth 
Of breakin' my back 
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard 
See how he glides 
Why he's lighter than air 
Oh I see his face 
Where is your star 
Is it far, Is it far, is it far 
When do we leave 
I believe, yes, I believe 
In the heat and the rain 
With whips and chains 
Just to see him fly 
So many die 
We built a tower of stone 
With our flesh and bone 
Just to see him fly 
Don't know why 
Now where do we go 
Kill the King 
Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill 
There's a stranger, stranger and life about to spill 
Oh no move away from harm 
I need a spell and a charm 
Fly like the wind 
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on 
Kill the king 
Tear him down 
Kill the king, yeah 
Strike him down 
Power, power happens every day 
Power, devour all along the way 
Oh no, move away from harm 
I need a spell and a charm 
And fly like the wind 
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on 
Kill the king 
Strike him down 
Treason, treason, the spectre looms again 
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then 
Oh no, move away from harm

Fly like the rainbow

Love me 'til the end of time, hey, hey-yeah

It's good to know that she's all mine 
I am the world that hides 
The universal secret of all time 
Destruction of the empty spaces 
Is my one and only crime 
I've lived a thousand times 
I found out what it means to be believed 
The thoughts and images 
The unborn child that never was conceived 
You gotta believe me 
Hey, I'm talking to you 
Well, I know, it's hard for you 
To know the reason why 
And I know you'll understand 
More when it's time to die 
Don't believe the life you have 
Will be the only one 
You have to let your body sleep 
To let your soul live on, haha

No one leaves and no one will 
Moon is full, never seems to change 
Just labeled mentally deranged 
Dream the same thing every night 
I see our freedom in my sight 
No locked doors, no windows barred 
No things to make my brain seem scarred 
Sleep, my friend, and you will see 
That dream is my reality 
They keep me locked up in this cage 
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage 
Sanitarium, leave me be 
Sanitarium, just leave me alone 
Build my fear of what's out there 
Cannot breathe the open air 
Whisper things into my brain 
Assuring me that I'm insane 
They think our heads are in their hands 
But violent use brings violent plans 
Keep him tied, it makes him well 
He's getting better, can't you tell? 
No more can they keep us in 
Listen, damn it, we will win 
They see it right, they see it well 
But they think this saves us from our hell 
Sanitarium, leave me be 
Sanitarium, just leave me alone 
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Natives getting restless now 
Mutiny in the air 
Got some death to do

Kill, it's such a friendly word 
Seems the only way

These are the hand that drop your trust 
These are the boots that kick you around 
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside 
These are the ear that ring with hate 
This is the face that'll never change 
This is the fist that grinds you down 
This is the voice of silence no more 
These are the legs in circles run 
This is the beating you'll never know 
These are the lips that taste no freedom 
This is the feel that's not so safe 
This is the face that'll never change 
This is the god that ain't so pure 
This is the got that is not pure 
This is the voice of silence no more

This is the face that stones you cold 
This is the moment that needs to breathe 
These are the clawns tha scrath these wounds 
This is the pain that never leaves 
This is the tonge that whips you down 
This is the burden of every mand 
These are the screams that pierce your skin 
This is the voice of silence no more 
This is the test of flesh and soul 
this is the trap that smells so good 
This is the flood that drains this eyes 
These are the looks that chill to the bone 
These are the fear that swing over head 
This are the weights that hold you down 
This is the end that will never end

Plug into me and dedicate 
Plug into me and I'll save you from emotion 
Plug into me and terminate 
Accelerate, utopian solution 
Finally cure the earth of man 
Exterminate, speeding up the evolution 
Set on course a master plan 
Reinvent the earth inhabitant

Spit out the bone 
The flesh betrays the flesh 
Your man has had his time 
We lay him down to rest 
Machined the new divine 
Stop breathing

Stop dreaming

I was dreaming I was Al Capone 
Rumor going 'round, gotta clear outta town 
Smelling like a dry fish bone 
Here come the Law, gonna break down the door, 
Carry me away once more 
Never, never, never want it any more 
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor 
Crazy 
Stone cold crazy, you know 
Rainy afternoon, got a killer typhoon, 
Playing on my slide trombone 
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore 
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor 
Crazy 
Stone cold crazy, you know 
Walking down the street, 
Shooting people that I meet, 
Bullet in my tommy-gun 
Here come the deputy, try fuckin' gettin' me, 
Gotta fuckin' get up and run 
They got the sirens loose 
I run right outta juice 
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven 
Let me go to hell

You're a sweet long lizard 
With a silver spoon 
You know you've never had it 
Quite so good 
And you didn't know

Your time has come to own 
Your touch turned to gold 
What ever happened to your life? 
Stone dead forever

It's been a long time 
It's been a long long wait 
And you caught your fingers 
In the pearly gates 
You better leave your number

You know your problem 
Ain't exactly new 
Your time has come today 
Your face has turned to hey

Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat, 
Like a face that learned to speak when all it knew was how to fight, 
Like a misery that keeps me focus though I've gone astray, 
Like an endless nightmare that I must awken from each day. 
Like Conviction, 
A premonition, 
Not worthy of so I deny, 
I deny. 
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place, 
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace. 
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by, 
I open just in time to say goodbye. 
Almost like your life, 
Almost like your endless fight, 
Curse the day is long, 
Realize you don't belong, 
Disconnect somehow, 
Never stop the bleeding now, 
Almost like your fight, 
And there it went, 
Almost like your life. 
Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think, 
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink, 
Like a poison that I swallow, but I want the world to die. 
Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in, 
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then, 
Like a general without a mission until the war will start again, 
Start again. 
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place, 
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace. 
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by, 
I open just in time to say goodbye. 
Almost like your life, 
Almost like your endless fight, 
Curse the day is long, 
Realize you don't belong, 
Disconnect somehow, 
Never stop the bleeding now, 
Almost like your fight, 
And there it went, 
Almost like your life. 
(Solo) 
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught, 
Like a strike from heaven turn that key, 
That brings you straight down to your knees, 
Like a touch from hell, I feel how hot that it can get if I get caught, 
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve, 
That brings you straight down to your knees. 
(Dual guitar solo) 
Almost like your life, 
Almost like your endless fight, 
Curse the day is long, 
Realize you don't belong, 
Disconnect somehow, 
Never stop the bleeding now, 
Almost like your fight, 
And there it went, 
Almost like your life. 
That was just your life.</field>

Better raise your ears 
The sound of hooves knocks at your door 
Lock up your wife and children now 
It's time to wield the blade 
For now you have got some company 
The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They have come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four Horsemen ride 
or choose your fate and die 
You have been dying since the day you were born 
You know it has all been planned 
The quartet of deliverance rides 
A sinner once a sinner twice 
No need for confession now 
Cause now you have got the fight of your life 
The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They have come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four Horsemen ride 
or choose your fate and die 
Time 
Has taken its toll on you 
The lines that crack your face 
Famine 
Your body it has torn through 
Withered in every place 
Pestilence 
For what you have had to endure 
And what you have put others through 
Death 
Deliverance for you for sure 
There is nothing you can do 
So gather round young warriors now 
and saddle up your steeds 
Killing scores with demon swords 
Now is the death of doers of wrong 
Swing the judgment hammer down 
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat 
The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They have come to take your life 
On through the dead of night

I see faith in your eyes 
Never you hear the discouraging lies 
I hear faith in your cries 
Broken is the promise, betrayal 
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail 
Follow the god that failed 
I see faith in your eyes 
Broken is the promise, betrayal 
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail 
Follow the god that failed 
Pride you took 
Pride you feel 
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel 
Trust you gave 
A child to save 
Left you cold and him in grave 
I see faith in your eyes 
Never you hear the discouraging lies 
I hear faith in your cries 
Broken is the promise, betrayal 
The healing hand held back by deepened nail 
Follow the god that failed</field>

Close my eyes find my place to hide 
And I shake as I take it in 
Let the show begin 
Open my eyes 
Just to have them close again 
Well on my way 
On my way to where I graze 
It swallows me 
As it takes me in its fold 
I twist away 
As I kill this world 
Open doors so I walk inside 
Close my eyes find my place to hide 
And I shake as I take it in 
Let the show begin 
Open my eyes 
Just to have them close once again 
Don't want control 
As It takes me down and down and down again 
Is that the moon 
Or just a light that lights this dead end street? 
Is that you there 
Or just another demon that I meet? 
The higher you are 
The farther you fall 
The longer the walk 
The farther you crawl 
My body my temple 
This temple it tilts 
Step into the house that Jack built 
The higher you are 
The farther you fall 
The longer the walk 
The farther you crawl 
My body my temple 
This temple it tilts 
Yes this is the house that Jack built 
Open doors as I walk inside 
Swallow me so the pain subsides 
And I shake as I take this in 
Let the show begin 
The higher you are 
The farther you fall 
The longer the walk 
The farther you crawl 
My body my temple 
This temple it tilts 
Yes this is the house that Jack built 
The higher you are 
The farther you fall 
The longer the walk 
The farther you crawl 
My body my temple 
This temple it tilts 
Yes I am I am I am 
Open my eyes 
It swallows me 
Is that you there 
I twist away 
Away 
Away 
Away.</field>

When the days have turned pitch black 
When the fear abducts your tongue 
When the fire's dead and gone 
So, what now? 
Where do I head? 
When you think it's all said and done. 
When you are the ostracized 
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes 
Twisting on the tourniquet 
When the pieces never fit 
So, what now? 
Where do I head? 
When you think it's all said and done. 
Bow down 
Sell your soul to me 
I will set you free 
Pacify your demons 
Bow down 
Surrender unto me 
Submit infectiously 
Sanctify your demons 
Into abyss, 
You don't exist. 
Cannot resist, 
The Judas kiss. 
When the storm has blacked your sky 
Intuition crucify 
When the ego strips your reign. 
Assassinate the living flame. 
So, what now? 
Where do I head? 
When you think it's all said and done. 
Venom of a life insane 
Bites into your fragile vein 
Internalize and decimate 
Patronize and complicate 
So, what now? 
Where doI head? 
When you think it's all said and done. 
Bow down 
Sell your soul to me 
I will set you free 
Pacify your demons 
Bow down 
Surrender unto me 
Submit infectiously 
Sanctify your demons 
Into abyss, 
You don't exist. 
Cannot resist, 
The Judas kiss. 
Judas lives, recite this vow. 
I've become your new god now. 
Followed you from dawn of time 
Whispered thoughts into your mind. 
Watched your towers hit the ground 
Lured your children never found 
Helped your kings abuse their crown 
In the heart of feeble man 
Plant the seed of my own plan 
The strong and powerful will fall 
Find a piece of me in all... 
Inside you all, 
So, bow down 
Sell your soul to me 
I will set you free 
Pacify your demons 
Bow down 
Surrender unto me 
Submit infectiously 
Sanctify your demons 
Into abyss, 
You don't exist. 
Cannot resist, 
The Judas kiss.</field>

Said you wanna get your order filled 
Made me shiver when I put it in 
Pumping just won't do ya know luckily for you 
Whoever thought you'd be better 
At turning a screw than me 
I do it for my life 
Made my drive shaft crank 
Made my pistons bulge 
Made my ball bearing melt from the heat 
We were shifting hard when we took off 
Put tonight all four on the floor 
When we hit top end you know it feels to slow 
I'm giving you my room service 
And ya know it's more than enough 
Oh one more time ya know I'm in love

Steep is the mountain which we climb.

Would change his life forever? 
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course 
By the light of golden treasure 
Was he the one causing pain 
With his careless dreaming? 
Been afraid, always afraid, 
Of the things he's feeling 
He could just be gone 
He would just sail on 
He'll just sail on 
How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go? 
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold? 
How can I be lost? In remembrance I relive 
And how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive? 
These days drift on inside a fog 
Thick and suffocating 
His sinking life, outside its hell 
Inside, intoxicating 
He's run aground Like his life, 
Water much too shallow 
Slipping fast, down with his ship, 
Fading in the shadows 
Now a castaway 
They've all gone away 
They've gone away 
How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go? 
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold? 
How can I be lost? In remembrance I relive 
And how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive? 
Forgive me 
Forgive me not 
Forgive me 
Forgive me not 
Forgive me 
Forgive me not 
Forgive me 
Forgive me not 
Why can't I forgive me? 
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course 
By the light of golden treasure 
How could he know this new dawn's light 
Would change his life forever? 
How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go? 
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold? 
How can I be lost? In remembrance I relive 
So how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive?</field>

Do I start writing all this down? 
Just let me plug you into my world 
Can´t you help me be uncrazy? 
Name this for me, heat the cold air 
Take the chill off of my life 
And if I could I´d turn my eyes 
To look inside to see what´s comin' 
It comes alive 
And I die a little more 
It comes alive 
Each moment here I die a little more 
Then the unnamed feeling 
It comes alive 
Then the unnamed feeling 
Takes me away 
I´m frantic in your soothing arms 
I can not sleep in this down filled world 
I´ve found safety in this loneliness 
But I can not stand it anymore 
Cross my heart hope not to die 
Swallow evil, ride the sky 
Lose myself in a crowded room 
Youl fool, you foll, it will be here soon 
It comes alive 
And I die a little more 
It comes alive 
Each moment here I die a little more 
The the unnamed feeling 
It comes alive 
Then the unnamed feeling 
Treats me this way 
And I wait for this train 
Toes over the line 
And then the unnamed feeling 
Takes me away 
Get the fuck out of here 
I just wanna get the fuck away from me 
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate 
I hate it all, why? why? why me? 
I cannot sleep with a head like this 
I wanna cry, I wanna scream 
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate 
I wanna hate it all away</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I am a chorus of the voices 
That gather up the magnets 
Set before me 
I attract you and repel you 
A science of the heart 
And blood and meaning 
The coldness of most beauties 
Is a challenge that our youth 
Must quickly conquer 
There is no time for guilt 
Or second guessing, second guessing 
Based on feeling 
I am the truth, the beauty 
That causes you to cross 
Your sacred boundaries 
I have no morals 
Some think me cheap 
And someone who despises 
The normalcy of heartbreak 
The purity of love 
But I worship the young 
And just formed angel 
Who sits upon the pin of lust 
Everything else 
Bores me 
I want to see your suicide 
I want to see you give it up 
Your life of reason 
I want you on the floor 
And in a coffin your soul shaking 
I want to have you doubting 
Every meaning you’ve amassed 
Like a fortune 
Oh throw it away 
For worship someone 
Who actively despises you 
For worship someone 
Who actively despises you 
I am the root 
I am the progress 
I’m the aggressor 
I am the tablet 
These ten stories 
Worship 
Worship 
Pain and evil have their place 
Sitting here beside me 
I offer them to you as servants 
Of the gold that you must give 
Pain and evil have their place 
Sitting here beside me 
And I’ll offer them, I offer them to you 
As servants of the gold 
That you must give to me 
I want to see your suicide 
I want to see you give it up, give it up 
Your your life of reason 
I want to see you on the floor 
And in a coffin, soul shaking 
Soul shaking 
I want to have you doubting 
Every meaning you’ve amassed 
Like a fortune, like a fortune 
Throw it away 
For worship of someone 
Who actively despises you

Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under the ice 
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest 
Eyes of glass stare directly at death 
From deep sleep I have broken away 
No one knows, no one hears what I say 
Freezing 
Can't move at all 
Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under the ice 
Scream from my soul 
Fate, mystified 
Hell, forever more (2x) 
No release from my cryonic state 
What is this? I've been stricken by fate 
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free 
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

You can listen to the engines Moanin' out it's one note song 
You think about the woman or the girl 
You knew the night before 
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way 
They always do 
When you're riding sixteen hours 
And there's nothing much to do 
And you don't feel much like riding 
You just wish the trip was through 
Here I am - on the road again 
There I am - up on the stage 
Here I go - playing star again 
There I go - turn the page 
So you walk into this restaurant strung out from the road 
And you feel the eyes upon you 
As you're shaking off the cold 
You pretend it doesn't bother you 
But you just want to explode 
Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk 
Other times you can 
All the same old clichés, "is it woman? is it man? " 
And you always seem outnumbered 
You don't dare make a stand 
Make your stand 
Here I am - on the road again 
There I am - up on the stage 
Here I go - playing star again 
There I go - turn the page 
Oo-ooh, out there in the spotlight 
You're a million miles away 
Every ounce of energy you try to give away 
As the sweat pours out your body 
Like the music that you play, yeah 
Later in the evening, you lie awake in bed 
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in your head 
You smoke the day's last cigarette 
Remembering what she said 
What she said 
He-ey 
Yeah 
And here I am - on the road again 
There I am - up on a stage 
Here I go - playing star again 
There I go - turn the page 
There I go - turn that page 
There I go, yeah, yeah 
There I go, yeah, yeah 
There I go, yeah

And I won't waste my hate on you 
Ain't gonna waste my hate 
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you 
I think I'll keep it for myself 
Ain't gonna kill no more 
Ain't got the time to help you score 
I think it's time you pleased yourself 
Yourself 
Good day 
How you do 
When I send a smile to you 
Don't Waste 
waste your breath, 
And I won't waste my hate on you 
And I think your working now 
You think enough to even raise the brow 
And to life that tip that you belong 
Come on 
When I see my hate I see my feet 
I feel that blood that pumps in me 
Where the hell's my mind 
Don't know 
Don't know now 
Good day 
How you do 
When I send a smile to you 
Don't Waste 
waste your breath, 
And I won't waste my hate on you 
Then I'll keep it for myself 
Hate 
Ain't gonna waste my hate 
But I don't clean it when they say 
Better to give then to receive 
Ain't gonna waste my hate 
Ain't got time to waste my hate on you 
I think I'll keep it all for myself 
For myself 
Good day 
How you do 
When I send a smile to you 
Don't Waste 
waste your breath, 
And I won't waste my hate on you 
Think I'll keep it for myself 
Yeah

No one leaves and no one will 
Moon is full, never seems to change 
Just labeled mentally deranged 
Dream the same thing every night 
I see our freedom in my sight 
No locked doors, no windows barred 
No things to make my brain seem scarred 
Sleep my friend and you will see 
That dream is my reality 
They keep me locked up in this cage 
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage 
Sanitarium, leave me be 
Sanitarium, just leave me alone 
Build my fear of what's out there 
And cannot breathe the open air 
Whisper things into my brain 
Assuring me that I'm insane 
They think our heads are in their hands 
But violent use brings violent plans 
Keep him tied, it makes him well 
He's getting better, can't you tell? 
No more can they keep us in 
Listen, damn it, we will win 
They see it right, they see it well 
But they think this saves us from our hell 
Sanitarium, leave me be 
Sanitarium, just leave me alone 
Sanitarium, just leave me alone 
Fear of living on 
Natives getting restless now 
Mutiny in the air 
Got some death to do 
Mirror stares back hard 
Kill, it's such a friendly word 
Seems the only way 
For reaching out again</field>

Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure. 
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale. 
That's when a blind man cries, 
Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale. 
Had a friend once in a room, 
had a good time but it ended much too soon. 
In a cold month in that room 
we found a reason for the things we had to do. 
I'm a blind man, 
I'm a blind man, now my room is cold. 
That's when a blind man cries, 
Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.</field>

Bang your head against the stage

Heads are bobbing all around

Here on the stage the Marshal noise 
Is piercing through your ears 
It kicks your ass kick your face

Now is the time to let it rip 
To let it fuckin' loose

The show is through the metal is gone 
It is time to hit the road

Again we will explode 
Hotel rooms and motorways 
Life out here is raw 
But we will never stop 
We will never quit

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy 
Planted on their columns now that bind me 
Or somethin' that somebody said because 
They thought we fit together walkin' 
 
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin' 
When I walk along some railroad track and find 
That you're movin' on the back roads 
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind 
 
Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards 
And the highways come between us 
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother 
'Cause she turned and I was gone 
 
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face 
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind 
But not to where I cannot see 
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind 
 
I dip my cup of soup 
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard 
My beard a roughenin' coal pile 
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face 
 
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can 
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find 
That you're wavin' from the back roads

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive. 
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried. 
Take her down now, don't want to see her face 
Blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace. 
 
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice. 
Gotta see 'em pay the price. 
See their bodies out on the ice. 
Take my time. 
 
Am I evil? Yes I am. (what is it man?) 
(Am I evil? yes I am.) 
 
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head. 
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread. 
Taking no chances, you come with me. 
I'll split you to the bone, (yeah yeah) help set you free. 
 
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice. 
Gotta see 'em pay the price.

Fully loaded Tommy gun

Told me when I was young 
Son  your life's an open book 
Don't close it 'fore its done 
 
The brightest flame burns quickest 
That's what I heard her say 
A son's heart's owed to mother 
But I must find my way 
 
Let my heart go 
Let your son grow 
Mama, let my heart go 
Or let this heart be still 
Yeah, still 
 
Rebel, my new last name 
Wild blood in my veins 
Apron strings around my neck 
 
The mark that still remains 
Left home at an early age 
Of what I heard was wrong 
I never asked forgiveness 
But what is said is done 
 
Let my heart go 
Let your son grow 
Mama, let my heart go 
Or let this heart be still 
 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness that I'll take to my grave 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness that I'll take to my grave 
So let this heart be still 
 
Mama, now I'm coming home 
I'm not all you wished of me 
A mother's love for her son 
Unspoken, and maybe 
Yeah, I took your love for granted 
And all the things you said to me 
I need your arms to welcome me 
But, a cold stone's all I see 
 
Let my heart go 
Let your son grow 
Mama, let my heart go 
Or let this heart be still 
Let my heart go 
Mama, let my heart go 
 
You never let my heart go 
So let this heart be still 
 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness that I'll take to my grave 
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave 
But you gave me your emptiness that I'll take to my grave

Quiet town 
Small time for big time crowd 
Never talks 
Never plays 
Different path 
Lost his way 
The streets are red 
Red I'm afraid 
There's no confetti 
No parade 
Nothing happens in this boring place 
But oh my god how it all dismays 
And they all pray 
Blood stain wash away 
He said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
I heard it 
He said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
Oh please wash away 
But blood stains the sun red today 
I always said 
Something wrong 
Little strange 
All day long 
Never laugh 
Never smile 
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles 
Yellow comes 
Sun I say 
Keep your smile and laugh all day 
He falls again in this foreign place 
For little boys how they do chase 
And they all pray 
Blood stain wash away 
He said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
I heard it 
He said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
Oh please wash away 
But blood stains the sun red today 
(Spoken) 
Yeah, well all the green things died 
When Ronnie moved to this place 
He said 
"Don't you dare ask 
Why I'm cursed to wear this face" 
I know why the children called him Ronnie frown 
When he pulled that gun from his pocket 
They all fall down down down 
He said 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
I heard it 
He screamed 
"Lost my way 
This bloody day 
Lost my way" 
Oh please wash away 
But blood stains the sun red today 
All things wash away 
They all fall down 
But blood stains the sun today 
All things wash away 
They all fall down

Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet. 
 
Am I evil? Yes I am. 
Am I evil? I am man. 
 
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire. 
You can come with me, sweet desire. 
My face is long forgot, my face not my own. 
Sweet and timely whore, take me home. 
 
Am I evil? Yes I am.

My soul is longing for, await my heir. 
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.

Out at you from their hiding place 
Like acid and oil on a madman's face 
His reasons tend to fly away 
Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah 
Like silver scrapes in May 
Now the sands become a crust 
And most of you have gone away (hm, yeah gone away) 
 
Come Susy dear, let's take a walk 
Just out there upon the beach 
I know you'll soon be married 
And you want to know where the winds come from 
Well it's never said at all 
On the map that Carrie reads 
Behind the clock back there you know 
At the four winds bar (hm, yeah) 
 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Four winds at the four winds bar 
Two doors locked and windows barred 
One door let to take you in 
The other one just mirrors it 
Hey, hey, yeah! hey, hey 
In hellish glare and inference 
The other one's a duplicate 
The queenly flux, eternal light 
Or the light that never warms 
Yes the light, that never, never warms 
Yes the light, that never, never warms 
Never warms, never warms 
 
The clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst 
Out at you from their hiding place 
Miss Carrie nurse and Suzy dear 
Would find themselves at the four winds bar 
It's the nexus of the crisis 
The origin of storms 
Just the place to hopelessly 
Encounter time and then came me 
 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 
Call me Desdenova, eternal light 
These gravely digs of mine 
Will surely prove a sight 
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent

Armageddon's near 
Inferno's coming

Save us from fate, save us from hate 
Save ourselves before it's too late
