/&gt;Paranoia's all I got left &lt;br /&gt;I don't know what stressed me first &lt;br /&gt;Or how the pressure was fed &lt;br /&gt;But I know just what it feels like &lt;br /&gt;To have a voice in the back of my head &lt;br /&gt;Like a face that I hold inside &lt;br /&gt;Face that awakes when I close my eyes &lt;br /&gt;Face that I watch every time I lie &lt;br /&gt;Face that laughs every time I fall &lt;br /&gt;(it watches everything) &lt;br /&gt;So I know that when it's time to sink or swim &lt;br /&gt;That the face inside is hearing me &lt;br /&gt;Right underneath my skin &lt;br /&gt;It's like I'm &lt;br /&gt;Paranoid lookin' over my back &lt;br /&gt;It's like a &lt;br /&gt;Whirlwind inside of my head &lt;br /&gt;It's like I &lt;br /&gt;Can't stop what I'm hearing within &lt;br /&gt;It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin &lt;br /&gt;Hey yo &lt;br /&gt;Here we go again &lt;br /&gt;With the pain I feel that isn't real &lt;br /&gt;But in my mind &lt;br /&gt;When I find myself in places &lt;br /&gt;With names but no faces &lt;br /&gt;My memory races at speeds &lt;br /&gt;A hundred degrees &lt;br /&gt;My soul will bleed &lt;br /&gt;Devil must've planted the seed &lt;br /&gt;Now it feels like my back's against the wall, &lt;br /&gt;I'm takin the fall &lt;br /&gt;Whenever I call nobody's responding at all &lt;br /&gt;I don't know whom I can trust, &lt;br /&gt;They're screaming my name &lt;br /&gt;I need somebody to help me out of the frame &lt;br /&gt;All I'm trying to do is just master me &lt;br /&gt;All I'm tryin to do is smoke and blast a beat &lt;br /&gt;But something keeps on talking to me conciously, &lt;br /&gt;Responsibly keeps haunting me &lt;br /&gt;From dusk til dawn everything has something for ya &lt;br /&gt;That voice has got you projecting paranoia &lt;br /&gt;Cold sweat, shining on your face exposing your purpose &lt;br /&gt;And if I ripped off your skin I'd probably find a, &lt;br /&gt;Another person &lt;br /&gt;Theres nothing worse &lt;br /&gt;Than trying to bring yourself up back from the dead &lt;br /&gt;So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head &lt;br /&gt;It's like I'm &lt;br /&gt;Paranoid lookin' over my back &lt;br /&gt;It's like a &lt;br /&gt;Whirlwind inside of my head &lt;br /&gt;It's like I &lt;br /&gt;Can't stop what I'm hearing within &lt;br /&gt;It's like the face inside is

&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don't know why &lt;br /&gt;It doesn't even matter how hard you try &lt;br /&gt;Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time &lt;br /&gt;All I know, time was just slipping way &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I watched it count down till the end of the day &lt;br /&gt;Watched it watch me and the words that I say &lt;br /&gt;The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins &lt;br /&gt;I know that I didn't look out below &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I watched the time go right out the window &lt;br /&gt;Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch &lt;br /&gt;I wasted it all on the hands of the clock &lt;br /&gt;But in the end no matter what I pretend &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;I had to fall &lt;br /&gt;To lose it all &lt;br /&gt;But in the end &lt;br /&gt;It doesn't even matter &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why &lt;br /&gt;It doesn't even matter how hard you try &lt;br /&gt;Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time &lt;br /&gt;All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All for shake and made eye contact &lt;br /&gt;Party control showing all that &lt;br /&gt;Northeast, Southwest coast &lt;br /&gt;Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder &lt;br /&gt;I brought you back of the thing &lt;br /&gt;Like the imaginary man of your dreams &lt;br /&gt;Well, you would always seem to make it worth it &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A pig skin I never nerved you &lt;br /&gt;You felt lever never pleather, real bringing the pleasure &lt;br /&gt;By any means and means of leaving you teens &lt;br /&gt;Holler for teen magazines but I tried so hard &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don't know how &lt;br /&gt;It doesn't even matter when you look at it now &lt;br /&gt;Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all &lt;br /&gt;Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I was forced to run, with you mocking me &lt;br /&gt;Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly &lt;br /&gt;Remembering all those times you fought with me &lt;br /&gt;Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And now your mouth wishes it could inhale &lt;br /&gt;Every single little thing you said and make it expel &lt;br /&gt;Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't matter to me &lt;br /&gt;Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The journey is more important than the end or the start &lt;br /&gt;And what it meant to me will eventually be &lt;br /&gt;A memory of the time when I tried so hard &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried so hard &lt;br /&gt;And got so far &lt;br /&gt;But in the end &lt;br /&gt;It doesn't even matter &lt;br /&gt;I had to fall &lt;br /&gt;
