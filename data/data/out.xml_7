Let me see them big titties, don't act saddity you

Break bread if you wanna get wit' me, all I wanna do
is dig off in them kidneys
Tell ya boyfriend he better mind his business, 'fore
he end up in the trunk of my Bentley
I am still a boss, he can't hit me, he ain't got
enough paper to deal wit' me
Baby girl wanna two step wit' me, turn around rub ya
ass up against me
Whoa, lil' mama done got tipsy, and then tonight,
tomorrow you're history
All you haters wit' that hoe sh*t miss me, I stay
strapped security don't frisk me
Set it off 'til this muthafu*ka empty, I turn around
do the same sh*t next week
Come on
[Chorus] - Timbaland and (Justin Timberlake)
Bounce (like yo' ass had the hiccups)
Bounce (like we was ridin' in my pick-up)
Bounce (why you lookin' so sad? baby girl you need to

And you on me and me on you and you on her

Yes, congratulations, you won a millionaire

Sorry I'm so demandin', but save the dancin', for back

Ain't, this money handsome? Ain't, that a panty

[Chorus] - Timbaland and (Justin Timberlake)
[Verse 3 - Missy Elliott]
Hold up! Hell naw! Like Britney Spears I wear no

In the club I drink it up, gulp gulp drink it up
Got Patron sippin' in my cup, that's ya man I bet I
can make him look
When he see the jugs he wanna rush and get a quick
touch of the big ol' butt
Mmhmm big ol' butt, thick legs, big ol' jugs, legs
stick like rims on the truck
Take him to the crib, yep, we gon' fu*k, you can call
me a freak I like to get buck
I don't have to do much to make you get it up
Some young hoe she worth two dollars, I'm worth more
dollars that make a beauty parlors
I pop collars, c-c-c-collars, I don't buy shots I only
buy the bottles
Only rich girls, we only buy the bottles
And like a porn star I'm best when I swallow

Yo yo yo yo yo yo
Ha ha
It ain't over baby
It dont stop like dat dat dat datdat dat
Wah-kump
Dat datdat dat
Wah-kump, wah-kump
Dat dat dat datdat dat
Wah-kump
Come on
One question:
Who be the thug that yall love most?
Or give a toast to this freestyle drug dose
The thug muscle
So whistle if you hear clear
Gon' get you close and yous a dead man like last year
See most fear
The marvelous, alias
You dare discuss and get yo muthafuckin head crushed
These slugs bust the most wanted when they just appointed
I stomp dogs and leave em froze because you know you fronted
Too many MC's not clearly on this hype tip
I'll fuck yo mic and catch you later on some snipe shit
extended clips I represent because my thugs trip
Easy boy, I'm stompin corners where them drugs flip
Ali Baba snakin lakin trustin north shit
You catch a grip or leave a don to climb the night hits
It's mob official
You test I'll leave you knock-knissued
Bandaged up like a snitch cuz I ain't fuckin with you
Straight up, we bringin' it
What y'all, huh huh, V-A
Know about this
What y'all in Hampton, huh huh
Know about this
What y'all in p-town
Know about this
What y'All in Hoviay
Know about this
Check it out
I'm ya p-town hit man
I'll make ya shit man
Pay my stick man to do my dirt
I'm filthy rich man
My thugs always hang around the top dog of all dogs
Make em pick locks and spit glocks until you shit rocks
I told you that I'm project strong
You took me wrong and learned that thorough cats don't last long
Alias the Don
I leave it messy like I'm Joseph Pesci
don't fuck around, you ever test me and you'll have to wet me
I'm ghetto fabulous
the mob crush the Lord just, never be discussed
When there's dirt involved, niggas leave the mouth closed to hush
I rush club scenes like, "What?"
Always carryin the bust
The reason why, these niggas that ruck ain't had enough
I hate to peel ya cabbage back, or bitch-slap
Cuz otherwise you wouldn't quit that, to kidnap
So what I'm sayin is, everybody's real within the game
Alias be the fame, so you don't know my name, NIGGA WHAT
What y'all V-A
know about this
What y'all in Hampton, what
Know about this
What y'all in Nomo
Know about this
What y'll in Chesapeake
Know about this
Bring it boy
See I told y'all motherfuckers that my clique roll deep
AK's and street sweeps gunnin down in ya peeps
44's and Calico, Pretty Ricky and Low
Thugs know
The real on how I let shit go
But if it's real, my niggas hold a forty and fill
Mass grills, body armor, niggas trained to kill
I'm at the point of no return, so I let shells spill
Vinny Rush, Crazy JJ and Mush must chill
And Killa K and Johnny Hesh steady aimin that steel
Shit's for real, my nigga P and Mike might peel
They get the gats and crazy stuff my brother love the ghetto tugs
and set on top of niggas what let's straight wet the party up
ESP was in the cut my rootin black, pull it up
Is that enough?
Y'all niggas still fail to call my bluff?
And yet I told you, when left back cain't nobody knows you
I suppose you
Woulda kept your mouth closed like I told you
What y'all in V-A
Know about this- I told you
What y'all in Nomo, what
Know about this, what</field>

Still spittin and killin 'em softly
I hear what you sayin, but overall you lost me (hu-huh)
Even though my neck and wrist all glossy
And my truck big as an armored tank, I ain't all flossy (hu-huh)
You could copy or hate on my style
Steppin it up, you been copyin or hate for a while (hu-huh)
I hit the leather, get the meters to peakin
I lay my vocals and let Jimmy D, tweak 'em and freak 'em, some like (hu-huh)
You don't think we can do it again, do ya? (hu-huh)
Did it before and we can do it again to ya (hu-huh)
You better love me, she be backin it up on me
I'm only about gettin money and stackin it up homie (hu-huh)
I'm gettin serious, go 'head I don't wanna play
And when I finished with this one, I bet you gon' wanna say (hu-huh)
The game ain't been the same since my name happened
Timbaland and Magoo and Beat Club, who ain't snappin
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Magoo]
Ew we, my pimpin is pimpalicious
I'm more than a rapper, eat my words I'm so nutritious (hu-huh)

I talk about us baby in them sheets for sweet talk (hu-huh)
But if ya feelin froggy and he leap
I fill 'em up with bullets, then the grum reaper gon' reap (hu-huh)
You think I'm puttin cover that bird shit
I have you barely breathin out your mouth on a curb bitch (hu-huh)
And if you keep talkin, then I'ma do it (hu-huh)
He fuckin playin Tim, I'ma fuckin do it (hu-huh)
I'm from the Lock West, a lot of them guns
I ain't a killer but you fuckers makin Oo into one, son (hu-huh)
So give me mine and you can take yours

When we reign, you gon' need more than a mop
[All]

(What what what what what)
Can't nobody do it like we do
(What what what what)
Can't nobody do it like we do
(What what what what what)
Can't nobody do it like y'all do
(What what what what)
When we spit, yo we never run outta rounds
This is lifeball not football, you outta bounds
Since some of you people's houses I be cruisin' around
Slow it down cuz I think that I'm losing you now
For those that's not lost, tell y'all hoe's to stop
Cuz the union is in here, toast it up
When they shoot you suppose to duck
Look at them by the bar posing drunk
(Say what?)
[Babe Blue]
We don't care who we toast in here
We get you for how much you gross this year
You not a punk, you suppose to fear
Better not come out until the coast is clear
[1 Life]
Totin' beer, you hatin', sayin' how they get a deal that fast
But even without this rap game I still have cash
My mommy wears a money wiz, I'm trickin' buying Vickey Secret
Just to cover her punani hair
Repeat 1
[Lil' Man]
Uh oh, you didn't think I was coming
My people can't stand for the little man
To rock without or with bad
I can determine what chu gon' do
Are ya gon' play it? Are ya gon' move?
The party ain't gon' start if ya don't dance
I don't care if you leave, but you still be my man
I don't get mad over silly pettyness
I say to hell with it, say oh well with it
Timbaland is known watch him make ya move ya feet
Make dope beats, rhyming sound so unique
His Beats are like Sean Archer and Caster Troy
Ya need the same identity to find how he soars
He's the wicked man, the wicked just begun
Call him Timbaland the resurrection
Clear-ese
Don't try to hide from ya fear
Clear-ese
Don't ya hear the set got in ya ear?
Clear-ese
This is the love man you're talking to
Clear-ese
His beats are dope, I try to tell you
Can't nobody see us in the nine eight
Or the nine nine
(Freaky freaky)
You're late
(Freaky) You're late
(Freaky) You're late
(Hey girls and guys)
You're late
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Like y'all, the public

This goes out to y'all
Quiet Storm, Z-man

Leave it girl…
Tim took you from ghetto to class, how to hold your glass
To Fendi's to bags, for holdin' your cash
People was seein' you pass, like right through the drapes
I brought you the private, ounce wit the gates
Thinkin' that stuff make me faint, just whistle real fast
Cougars roll in the grass, same cat on your Jag
Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for
It cost every minute, and you know I'm on tour
And I'm deeply committed, although I'm forgettin'
Sometimes while hittin' it ,different names would slip
If I been wit a chick, check me miss
Your complexion switched, honey you been on trips
But you don't appreciate this, till your back in the Jetta
No iceberg you own, just Angelica's sweaters
If the steaks ain't T-Bone, you ain't properly fed
But tonight is bet burgers, no cheese on the bread
And I say

Boy you act like I need ya, came down wit amnesia
Ran the yards and the meters, nuttin' but hating between us
Now you come poppin' this shit, nigga I made you rich
Introduce you to Cris, flipped and secured your bricks
Even though them kids ain't mine, let 'em call me mommy
I deserve them dollars, trip to the Bahamas and Porsche rotten
I washed your clothes, put up wit your hoes
Never fucked up yo dough, put the G in ya glow
So what you sweatin' me fo', I promoted them tours
I was poppin' them fours, run in and outta them stores
I cleaned up your spot, poured your brandy and scotch
Razor blades to the rocks, even lied to the cops
Played your wifey and mother, cousin, sister and brother
Accountant lawyer and lover, I'm through dealin' wit suckers
Shuttin' and lockin' the door, bout to settle the score
You wastin' my time, nigga, but what about my nigga

Frequent Coach, mink coats, cruises on ships and boats
I gave you way more, can't there bout all your bulls
Since day one it was ours it never was yours
Uh - look at the bigger picture, study the ghetto scripture
Held your back when you was broke frontin' cuz now you richer
No frontin' in that there, Ms
Jade is everywhere
Enough talkin' I'm through, my lawyer will be callin' you
[Nelly Furtado]
All this money that he's spendin', you owe me everything
I wanna tell him it's not his money, he tell me to go away, baby
Wish he'd only give me a chance to show him that I'm alive

See them other crews could not figure me
It's the mag and double ooh got that fat cd
Buck a crystal hit a nigga with my blunt philly
Fake mc's getting assed like they eatin chili
Only way they seem to rap is if they got a philly
Maybe i'm nicole brown cause you really kill me
Got away with hittin me but you ain't o.j.
I'm bout to shake up the world like cassius clay
When i bumble watch your back cause i sting like bee
This ain't the wild wild west and you ain't kool moe dee
Watch a movie now you think that you really joe pesci
You don't want beef with me, like a diaper i'm messy
[timbaland]
I'm that laid back brother they call timbaland
I drive a 850 sometimes a 3-2 mazda van
You can catch me standin in my b-boy stance
Or catch me at home watchin who's the man?
They call robber, cause i pack much heat
Don't call me now, because they dig the way i speaks
I'm like a genie, because i've been trapped in a bottle
I've got more stunts, than that nigga desperado
Come follow, a mad brother where'll there be no sun
No sun tomorrow, you be sayin, when can we meet? uhh uhh
My offices hours are nine to five
Ain't that right maganoo, maganoo? right..
right
Chorus: magoo

[magoo]
Yo i'm bout to get it started like i'm hammer then i farted
You retarded if you thinkin brandy really broken hearted
I departed doin dirt, lookin up your girl's skirt
Keep it steve martin style, bustin loose like jerk
I get up like -town, gimme don't say no more
Got them scars on my face cause my health be poor
You milli vanilli, i'm kurtis blow like eighty-fo'
No i don't want your girl she be suckin my big toe
You get death like row, i take a beanie then i jet
Peace to tupac, cause he was dope as it get
Twisted but you ain't keith sweat and shit got hot
Make a block then make a circle then i rock that spot
The rappin don, i make a dyke go straight
If you think i'm cute, then you up too late
Make no mistake, i'm a question with no answer
Riddle me like the joker get burnt like jojo dancer

All The Hoes Love A Nigga, They be Backing It Up
But Me I Love Money I Be Stacking It Up
When My Bandwagon Pull Up They Hop On Board
They Hop Right On Mine and Hop Right Off Yours
I Get Respect Homie All Across The Board
I Get A Quarter Mill A Track Without An Award

In The Street I Hold My Ground Like I'm Concrete
I Know Shit Aint Sweet so When Shit Get Deep
I'm Rich I Can Pay To Have You Six Feet Deep

DJ's in the mix shows you better go to the record store and
COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
And to the bootleggers giving em bootlegs
We breaking off both of ya legs, COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
Stop burnin' CD's for ya friend and I'ma say it again, nucca
COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
'Cause this the hot shit, out on the streets
So when you hear this CD go and COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes into my head as just chit-chatter
You may think I'm egotistical or just very free
Won'tcha say I go tell it to, TIMOTHY!
People say I'm whack, but they don't tell me so
Let them pretend to be me, then they know
I hate when one, pretend to fantasize
Fact I despise, those who even try
Sweat between my thighs {*sniff*} never stinking
Yo dream is over, career sinking
I told all of you, like I told all of them
Whatcha say to me be, DICK TO YA CHIN!
In one ear and right out the other
"Ayyio Missy you ugly!" yeah ya mother
I don't pay attention, I don't concentrate
You ain't got the bait, that it takes to hook this, huh
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Magoo]
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I do look up to Vagil
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing, being from them VA streets
I talk sense condensed in the form of a poem
If I wasn't writing rhymes I'd be breaking in homes
I'm kinda young, so my gun's my security
I'm not afraid nucca do what you gon do to me
I get paid when your record is played
To put it short, heh I got it made
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
My uppercut boy that'll get ya lifted
You got cash? man stop frontin
Living off damn every record that you cutting
My name Magoo and I roll wit two stars
Every CD we split 48 bars
My name Magoo and I'm a supadupa star
Every other month I get a brand new car!

On the back two steps ahead of me
Pressure time is wasting
Happy boy you'd better be
Trust me it's amazing
But I got it wrong, how you should be with me
I'm stuck in the sea how in need we are
Reach the sky will be touching the moon
But somebody is on the eye but he ain't you
As the lucky lady night lost in the crowd
I said you did you when the lights go down wow
Too late to stop girl you know what to do
Baby don't waste my time, hurry up
Don't wait no more
It's getting hot girl got to keep it cool
Gotta stay from behind too pressure cover's blown

You're tryin to stack, you can slide out girl

Hey Baby, Chill out, chill out, chill out
Hey baby, chill out, chill out, chill out
Girl in chain, woke up in the morning
And already knowing ain't no telling what you might do
When I am gone, you give me that crazy town
And you want to know why I want to get so far away
from you
I guess it's safe to say the the thrill is gone,
You think you know but it is not true
It would be best if I left you alone,
I think your head is missing something to wishes come true
Used to think I want that, I want that
But now I am saying I want that, want that
And all the time I want that, I want that
So baby I am going to ball back and tell you, tell
you
[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]
I have seen a lot of things but I have never seen
hey!
I never seen a girl as crazy as you
Seen alot of crazy places and crazy faces
But never seen a girl as crazy as you
Now your style must have lost your mind
Wish I could press you a while
And figure out what did I do
I have seen a lot of things but
I haven't seen, hey!
I never has seen a girl as crazy as you, as you, as you
I never has seen a girl as crazy as you, as you, as you
I never has seen a girl as crazy as you
[Timbaland]
Hey baby you got going here
You could drive those places up my dear
We both know your head ain't right
I wake up and you're standing over me while I sleep at night
Now tell me what you are going to tell our friends
When I change those locks and you can't get in
And it when it talks while I sing this song,
And I don't need a doc to tell me you're gone
And happens every time every thing you say you lie
Every time I try
I don't need it no more
You on the other side
You so schizophrenic and
Just made me realize that
I need to tell ya ya
[Justin]
I have seen a lot of things but I have never seen
hey!
I never seen a girl as crazy as you
Seen alot of crazy places and crazy faces

I never has seen a girl as crazy as you, as you, as you

Shit she took the key to the drivers side door of my car
Just because she said she had a dream that she saw me with some other broad
Now I am standing on the front lawn and gun and my
hand shaking how did I get this far
But I know who you really are, and I have never seen a girl as crazy as you

Uh Check out the flava
I got you strung out like Kayta
Catch me on ???
Just can not fate her
Later for all you whack MC's
Claim to be my friend
But really my enemy (me me me)
Why you want to mess with me
Cus I got Mentalor
I'll mess you up like that lady in Mallas
Thats childish
Cus I'm on another level
Uh universal-cology on the f-in-devel
Uh bring the shovel
Cus I'm bout to dig your grave
Not a lady but I call Mad Rage
On stage
Stick of you like ....
Dan Cage
Cus I'm doin this my way

About that funk

[Verse 2]
Magoo whats up my nigga
Do you want this girl with this fine figure
Get with her
After that then we trick her
Then get her drunk off the Thunderbird Liquor
Then video tape her like that man did on Slipper
If she acts up dismiss her (what what what)
I hope she don't think we acting hard
Cus we in with the mayor and that big boy Sarge
Ain't that large
They will say it will be that
With Timberland and that Maganoo sound now
You must go through initiation
Bad situation

Time is wasting
Catch me on location
on your funky radio station
Da Funk Da Funk

1,2 1,2 where ya gonna run to
When I come through when you start acting brand new
I'm like a maniac when I do my track
I doubt it if my beats will be whack
Play like Sylvester and leave me Stallone
Cus I'm gonna find your girl and make her moan (what)
Make her get on and on (on and on on on on and on)
Now I got this far
I'm a smooth black brother so I paid off the star
Hot now I'm gone with the quickness
It's a damn shame I am so relentless
I'm the crazy thriller
I slap the F off Farina and then took his Miller
I like (I like)
Cus I'm right
Old tight (wont tight)
Riight

Whas happenin dude?
Whatchu thinkin about there?
What's goin on? Talk to me
I know you're thinkin
What? Must be a lot on your mind
Express yourself fool
Tell me what you thinkin about, nigga
[Magoo]
Who why whatever, any puzzle I put it together
With any stress I'm copin like a flesh wound I'm open
Still got balls after vasectomies
My anatomy is strictly scientifical your life is pitiful
I got no relationships, just hit and then dismiss
My sex is strictly fuck, no man, I do not kiss
Keep my shirt on, I'm quick to dress back up
I'm chargin girls for dick, my dick you stick up
Butt naked, like Adam and Eve on Christmas Eve
Who is God? White the Devil, do you believe?
Scratch your head and think about it for a minute
Is my life a dream and y'all playin parts in it?
You talkin like you drunken, but you flunkin
Classes you be takin, let me bring home the bacon
We been hoodwinked, bamboozled
Led astray, til all our business on rent in late
Somewhere in your mind
And real deep in your memory
You try to hide away
Your true feelings
(repeat 2X)
Am I underrated? Thinkin bout it get me frustrated
I'm elated, that keep it real is outdated
Graduated, from PG now I'm X-Rated
Glad I made it, left you behind, and you hate it
Look into my eyes, do you see a nigga or a person
See I worsen, section eight got to be flirtin
Fuck workin, for eighty-five who you jivin?
Still survivin, lock your fuckin door when I'm arrivin
Surprisin realizin magnetisin
This rhyme bend how I'm risin, hypnotizin
Got comments, put replies in
No lies in, if you do your life will need revivin
When I'm sleep I die, when I wake up I'm born
I leave the Earth each day to get my soul reborn
So to God I pray, I make it through this day
This must be Deja Vu, cause I relive this day
Somewhere in your mind
And real deep in your memory
You try to hide away
Your true feelings
(repeat 2X)
[Timbaland]
Bring it on it, freak it on it
[Magoo]
Child abused, as a child
Child Magoo, buck-wild
Wel-fare, met the cake
Too much sugar, in the Kool-Aid
Mis-fit, un-til
I fucked Jiil, on the hill
Look, out, heads, up
To the girls, let's buck
Like, night-shade, grows
Workin dope, mind, flows
But, please, I'm on hot
I cook, non-stop
Stick a pin, in some paper
Take notes, play ya later
Praise, God, he, made ya
No, man, but, praiser
Somewhere in your mind
When you think deep in your memory
You try to hide away
Your true feelings

Yau [echo 2x Yau]
They still won't give me my props
Now I'm pissed off
Y'all will see the other side of me
Come on
Like this
I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be
If a nigga didn't make his entry
Niggaz would be making them same ol' beats
Waiting on my arrivlary
Y'all niggaz gonna learn to appreciate me
Instead of always comparin' me
If I hear one more remark about me
I guess I gotta ride on my enemies
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho - What I will nigga
What the fuck would the music be, if it wasn't for Timothy
When the game is feverish, then I create the remedies
And crumble leads until I'm buzz and I'm laxed
And them hoes show me love in every club that I'm at
For every hood got' get back, what another nigga envy
But I swear I ain't no killer, but y'all niggaz 'bout to tempt me
To the point there the barrels empty until you gon' recent me
When Morpheus missing the desert of the real he meant me
Like a monster I am simply, do the records into three
Let my music not really be confused with anybody
'cause there's something like Mister Mohammed Ali in his prime
then I float like a butterfly and sting with the rhyme
and the mic happens ring with the nine
if it's drama let these niggaz tryin' to bring to my mind
I seem to remind that Thomas Crown is spoke
and if you don't love it you can shove a dick down your throat
I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be
If a nigga didn't make his entry
Niggaz would be making them same ol' beats
Waiting on my arrivlary
Y'all niggaz gonna learn to appreciate me
Instead of always comparin' me
If I hear one more remark about me
I guess I gotta ride on my enemies
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho - What I will nigga
Look at my eyes nigga, wakin' up early in the morning to the sun rise nigga
Momma yelling rise nigga get up out that bed snoarin'
if you want it go get it fuck havin' to beg for it
Even if you gotta break your neck I'm a releg for it
I said listen to behind a hot roller bread for it
Contemplating know how to work my math and bred story
I don't work my fingers to the bone until they bled storin'
So you can say that I'm a giant a preacher of habit
walking over these watches squaking the reach in the head with
niggaz watching me go free not just a week in my marriage
with the game in the cabbage with my name and my status
but I remain as the baddest motherfucker 's established
and I 'm still at it grounding that Hennessey straight popping that still mad at
Down at my enemies' face and you're like a kill habit
In front of my enemies' face I shit like a steal rabbit
To show I'm his real static and hold me ideal at it
With my poker face until I at least make a mil at it
At least make a meal love it I'm hungry and still clutch it
All for that mil ticket outta that steal lovin'
[Frank Lee White]
Well I was riding 95 to Virginia the other day
And I thought to myself ain't this where Timbaland used to stay
I heard he moved to New York City but he work in Miami
Only time he back round here is when he visit his granny
Now ain't it funny how the money make a man change
But shit Timmy I don't think he changed a damn things
'xcept the rap game and bust the track game
shit he be gobbeling the grammies like he pac-man
can you get with that man let's gone take it back to the roots
before them backpacking rappers with them hoodies and boots
before Sam Goddie and MTV
before these killers and these hundred dollar billars feeling making MC
before the white rap explosion before the corrosion
when we was just getting started and them doo's wouldn't open
it was people like Timmy who was kickin' them in
shit whatcha cookin' in that kitchen again
some shit like that

I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be

Shorty got both broke can't see what's comin'
Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey
Dolce and Gabbana and she get it from her mommy
Louis bags, rich, Gucci, Fendi and Armani
See the carrots on her wrist now she pimps Bugs Bunny
Used to date Kanye now she want me
While I got my juice wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday but her name on the cake
If I ever play for booty grade A
Got you stuck on my

Stuck on my elevator, she on the second floor
Now I want you to break it down, DJ turn it up some more
Hey, dime piece girl; True Religion, Ed Hardy
Little mama twerk that top model body
South Beach piece on the back of that Ducati

Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo type, bump the low ring tone
Bending Ghetto booty, playing the ghetto booty on her.
Roll up machilles don't smoke arizona
One night stand one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off 10 grand.
Project all the way gutta all day
Pure uncut stay home with a J

Three stories while them hood rats beg

Verse:
Just lookin' at you shorty lights a flame inside (inside),
I'm wonderin if you can come and help put out the fire (fire),
That you create in me, baby, tell me what you like
Cause I can be your all boy, I can be your love toy
If you ain't busy baby, I'm all yours tonight (tonight),
Let imagination take us for a further than the mind
Travellin' in a dream (dream) we can bring something to life,
That no ones ever seen yet, can I....

Cuz think of all the tasty things that we can try (try),
The karma you can have will be more than Money can buy
(ho ho ho ho)
We aint even gotta keep it quiet, boy all my walls are sound proof,

My entire house, we will not disturb,
None of these old neighbors, you'll get all that you deserve,
boy I got it somewhere if you can conjure up the nerve,
to come see what if feels like, can I ...

Verse:
Touch it, touch it, feel it, Roll around in it, if you like,
Taste it, taste it, and Embrace it again a second time,
Don't you waste it, you'll regret it, Cause I can satisfy,
any fantasy that you can come with, can I ....

Here we go now
Dont stop the music
(Michelle)
Monday comes like a loaded gun
And I'm trying to escape
Want to run, wanna chase this sun
Let it walk the world away
Looking on at the empty streets
These are changes what I need
I feel snow and there is open road
and I feel sweet relieve
I-I-I wanna getaway gotta getaway
Going by the loop beneath these skies
Cuz I need a change yeah I need a change
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Sleepless nights cuz the city lights
Makes the moon so hard to see
Take a ride to the other side
Give me room where I could breathe
Shout it out to the breaking dawn
Feel the earth under your feet
Open door what you waiting for
Let the rain come down on me
I-I-I wanna getaway gotta getaway
Going by the loop beneath these skies
Cuz I need a change yeah I need a change
I-I-I wanna getaway gotta getaway
Going by the loop beneath these skies
Cuz I need a change yeah I need a change
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

Could you speak up and stop the mumbling
I don't think you came in clear.
Sitting on the top it's hard to hear you from way up here.
I saw you tryin to act cute on tv just let me clear the air.
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn that's right, you wasn't there.
If sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shi it it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it.
So if you see us in the club go on and walk the other way

Hey ah midnight cowboy

You can have it all

What you get is exactly what you give
Never really know until you try
We're so ahead of this
Got this she wolf appetite that keeps me up all night
You know the way it works don't be afraid to ask
Aim high when the target is low
FYI I am ready to go
People say men are just like kids
Never saw a kid behave like this
What you give is exactly what you receive
So put me in a cage and lock me away
and i'll play the games that you want me to play
You can have it all

High heels standin' on them soft couch cushions
Careful not to break your concentration
Maintain sexy as she maintains balance, balance
Balance, if you fall, baby girl it won't be cute at all
Drink in your left hand, girlfriend in your right
On the couch dancin', holdin' on for dear life
Thump of the music, plus, flash of the lights, plus
Long legs and a short skirt
Equal one hell of a night, I'm talking about
Such a beautiful crowd, level's on ten
They're standin' on chairs wit' their hands up in the air
Girls gettin' real wild
Hair blowin' in the wind
Girls standin' on chairs wit' their hands up in the air
Wit' their hands up in the air

I got my eyes closed
Jumpin' up and down, baby I'm on ten
I got my eyes closed
Listenin' to the sounds so hypnotizin'
And I bet before the night ends
I'm gon' find one that I'm likin'
Take her home, get on, next mornin'
Baby girl, give me that mo' gin' before ya go
I got my eyes closed
I got my eyes closed
I got my eyes closed
Such a beautiful crowd, level's on ten
They're standin' on chairs wit' their hands up in the air
Girls gettin' real wild
Hair blowin' in the wind
Girls standin' on chairs wit' their hands up in the air
Wit' their hands up in the air

Magic's all around

Lord have mercy! If the broad is thirsty
I'll have her man reimburse me
The part that hurts me, is when they try to work me
But I could never let ya jerk me
Steady sticking to the wall, give it up
Sneaking through the back door live it up
Got the champagne, pour me a cup
Got the girls looking raw in the front
Got a call your man's in town
Tell the bar, a-nother round
Got all my mans holding me down
Kinda thick ma, let's get down, so get wit it

Got playas on the grind, wanna skip wit it
Backstage you mine, I'm a spit wit it, hey!

1 - Here we go so wave your hands
For Missy, Maganoo, and Timbaland
We gon' show you how to party right
So pass the Uhh and get the hype
Alright, we gon' party tonight
[Magoo]
If you're livin' for love, start livin' for life
If you're having a baby, then make her your wife
If you're up in the club where the dub
It's like a bank sell to the highest bid
Put the cash in your bank
Girl I'm lovin' your booty, you can "hoo" to my blow
Then fish but please honey child, don't kiss
All I want is a freak when I'm up in the club
Maybe after the dance, dinner sharp, then the tub
I'm a nigga wit' class, you're a girl with a job
Taste of my neck like corn on the cob
I'm second to none, I'm freaky as ever
Go downtown, "Well I never"
[Timbaland]
Uh, uh
Well I'm the man, that they call Timbaland
Now he the bir-ba-bir-ba-bird, understand?
We gon' party, until the sun comes up
Bartender, you forgot to fill up my cup, uh
Ain't no stoppin' until your draws start floppin'
There won't be no beef unless the disc stop jockin' (what?)
She said this, and he said that
And he said that Timbaland can't rap
But I don't care because I make dope tracks
I make you bounce and wiggle, and do this and that
Timbaland, where you live at?
Va baby, believe dat
[Missy]
Aiyyo, aiyyo
Now I'm rich, I once was poor
If you're late with my dough, then there's no show
I grease my hair and it still won't grow
If you feel my butt, boy you gotta go
Out the back for touchin' my back
For trying to jack every Timbaland track
Maganoo, where you was?
They been bitin' our style, those silly bugs
Where's the spray? I'ma spray 'em good
So the next time they bite they die like "Ugh"
I'ma roll up the biggest dutchie
Get some sweets cuz I got the munchies
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
[Magoo]
He he
Girl, when the bar open up five rum
Everybody wanna get a buzz, get some
9 out of 10, all girls gonna freak
Just gon' depend on who they gonna freak
Don't gotta floss, all girls know they name
Only near, chillin' in the club, no game
Brotha mad at me cuz I got cheddar cheese
When the club close got his girl on her knees
Oh man please, learn the two degrees
Degree number one, keep your hon off trees
Degree number two, keep your girl 'round you
Never trust a girl, Lord knows what she do
[Timbaland]
Uh huh
Tricks - is what I got in my bag
Hits - is what I make out the lab
Ritz - is the crackers that I eat
Bitch - is what a man don't need
Rubber - shows I'm a careful lover
Stutter - is what I do in trouble, what?
[Missy]
My man, Timbaland
He make beats for the streets
See, me and Maganoo
In the back rollin' trees
Gettin' high off the phone
Tell a nigga what chu want, Hey!
[Missy]
Now, I'm in the S-L-K
I roll up the window, so the 'doo won't sway
Spray my hairspray so the waves obey
So when I say stay, them bitches stay
Oh by the way
Me and Timbaland, we got the beats to make you dance
Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Oh!
You know what?
(Wyclef: good good good)
I go through a lot, since my baby girl's not here
Life ain't been the same for me
Lately I miss you very much
I want you to hear my pain that I go through (go through ...)
[Verse 1 - Timbaland] + (Wyclef Jean)
It's been three years (AH!), livin this fast life
I think on it, I know one day I won't have life
People don't know me over the time B
They don't wanna know me, they wanna know my G's
Le I quit, things ain't the same no more
But I'ma do my thing 'til there ain't no more (yeah)
I got a plan, I wonder how far I can go
I demand the best for myself, that's all I know
I, done seen the world become
Products of a revolution that we begun (yeah)
Make me wanna split a swisher, I need me one
They keep on copying what we done done
That's why I say ..
[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)
A life full of money and a life full of girls
But a heart that's really in deep (feel my pain)
A lot of people yellin ("we love ya Timbaland")
But I know y'all really in need (ooo)
I don't know who's in my corner, don't know where is my corner
But I gotta grab all these leaves
So I must ..
[Chorus - Wyclef Jean]
Hey, Timbaland you gotta hold on (hold on)
But you got to be strong
Though the pain almost over
(Timbaland: My pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah
(Timbaland: I can't quit yet), you can't quit
You gotta hold on, you got to be strong
(Timbaland: Uh, my pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah
[Verse 2 - Magoo] + (Wyclef Jean)
Pain, can't you see the pain in my eyes?
The lie behind my cries, don't you sympathize with me
You don't have to wonder when I come
You label me a bum, you fake it ain't suprisin me (yeah)
Funny how Oo got money, people come around
Soon as Oo fail, kick 'em to the ground (yeah)
Not just neighbors, the whole damn town
Own flesh and blood, said I was a clown
But as the world turns, my life can too
And like a gun kills, a knife can too (yeah)
I was stabbed thrice, how 'bout you?
Once by my mom, pops the other two
Child abuse kid, ward of the state
I know it was the past, but I just can't shake
How you had a kid, beat me like a slave
I was only three, how could I misbehave?
I didn't know better, you could teach me first
You said fuck that, then you beat me worse
It's pain in this verse, hard to go on (yeah)
Oo is a man, so I must hold on
[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)
(Wyclef: yeah)
A life full of money and a life full of girls
But a heart that's really in deep (feel my pain)
A lot of people yellin ("we love ya Maganoo")
But I know y'all really in need (ooo)
I don't know who's in my corner, don't know where is my corner
(Wyclef: yeah)
But I gotta grab all these leaves, uh huh
So I must ..
[Chorus - Wyclef Jean]
You gotta hold on (hold on)
But you got to be strong
Though the pain almost over
(Timbaland: my pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah
(Timbaland: I can't quit yet), can't quit
You gotta hold on (yeah)
You got to be strong (yeah)
(Timbaland: my pain almost over)
Yeah, look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah (yeah)
[Verse 3 - Wyclef Jean]
Yeah, yo, I seen Brooklyn turn into Crook-lyn
The youngn's they spend their life in central Crook-lyn (yeah)
I've seen prom queens, turn into prom fiends
Sometime I ask myself what happen to Dr
King's "Dream" (yeah)
I've seen best friends, turn to enemies
What made it sad, I had to sing at the eulogy
So hard for us to say goodbye
So I puff the lye and stay high (yeah)
The man you said was your fam in the park (yeah)
Saw your face spark when you found out he was a Narc (yeah)
Cause everybody wanna be Nino Brown
They wanna be Nino Brown, they wanna be Nino Brown (yeah)
And the girls they love the Nino Brown
They hug they Nino Brown, they lust for Nino Brown (yeah)
And the fiends they want the Nino Brown
The way he hold you down, when he comes around (yeah) (*echo*)
[Outro - Timbland - talking]
The pain never stops baby
Lele, I hope ya hear us
Cause life will never be the same without you girl
(Wyclef: yeah)
Timbaland talkin to you
(Wyclef: yeah, yo, yo)
We ain't used to nothin
This music industry, will never be the same without you
Nothin but pain, hard struggle
But me and Jimmy D, we're gonna keep ridin for ya
Cause life must go on
You must live on
So we gotta hold on, c'mon
(Hold on) uh, (hold on)
My pain almost over (hold on, hold on)
I can't quit yet (hold on, hold on)
My pain almost over (hold on, hold on)

I'm burnin' up, ya'll can't stop my dough
Im burnin' up, up top and down south they know
When it come to these beats I don't play, yo

[Lil' Man]
Can I get it on? (Um hmm)
Are ya hands up? (Um hmm)
Where all the playa haters at? (Um hmm)

Where all the playa haters at? (Um hmm)
Now point 'em out (Um hmm)

[Bassey]
I come sweeter than a two seater Benz
Have your pockets wide open, have you spendin' on friends
It never ends, expensive indeed
Without the C's, lavish habits love the carats
Nigga's with mad weaves
Spendin' money ain't nuthin'
Nigga's who style frontin'
And then pretend ya gettin' old
Nigga, we let you know, diamond district
Platinum Rolex's with the chips in it
Money to burn, nigga when will you learn
It's automatic, now I realize I gotta have
Lifestyles of the rich, that fly assed bitch
There's a track to be ripped, I got the hot shit
Check the whip, I'm banging from my land to my six
Had you screamin' at the show saying Bassey's a hit
I got the gift and nigga's know I'm ready for this
Eyes closed, lips sealed, and prepare for the kiss
[Timb and Lil' Man]
And I told ya'll we won't miss, what?
[Lil Man]
Did she get it on? (Um hmm)
Are ya hands up? (Um hmm)
Where all the playa haters at? (Um hmm)
Now point 'em out (Um hmm)
Point 'em out, what?
Did she get it on? (Um hmm)
Are ya hands up? (Um hmm)
Where all the playa haters at? (Um hmm)
Now point 'em out, yeah (Um hmm)
Can I get it on? (Um hmm)

It's Tim and Maganoo again, uh
It's Tim and Maganoo again, ah, ah
It's Tim and Maganoo again
Let me talk to ya
[Verse 1 - Timbaland]
I remember those days when I was holdin back
When Star Crunch was a popular snack
Would you buy you that, sneak the rest in my nuts
You know that Johnny Appleseed and that frozen cup
We grew up, but ain't you sister Jean cousin (cousin)
Just cause we older that don't mean nothin (nothin)
We still could hit the beacon, a couple of Bible meetings
Live right just like the deacons and backslide on the weekend
Now things change, not just your new love
See you never used to trip off material stuff
So I ain't mad at dude cause he rimmed up his truck
Just mad at you, you clumsy klutz
And it's no suprise how I'm feelin inside
So the only thing you ever probably did for my eye
Used to tears in the bucket, I hope you dummies loved it
Although it's over, you still my soldier (my soldier)
[Chorus - Timbaland]
Cause I got love for ya
Can I get a hug from ya?
I'm not tryna point the finger and judge ya
Cause I make mistakes like you
I forgive ya boo
You can keep the things that I brought ya
I'm not tryna play correctional officer
I'm just tryna take them burdens off of ya
Cause I make mistakes like you
I forgive ya boo
[Verse 2 - Magoo]
I first met ya at the strip club
Instead of one, had to give ya two dubs
Right from sight baby, I was past love
It must be the fact, opposites attract
Do the addition, it's a one on one thing, and I'ma lace you with bling
Cause the way you make me feel is an incredible thing
But you had to hurt me, made love to my best friend
But just like "Chucky" I'ma stay 'til the very end
On top of that, you was usin crack and cocaine
You had oomph, had to throw my towel in mayn
I can't judge cause I cheated, you ain't hold no grudge
I had a child with her, baby it's warm in love
Then Christmas Eve we was playin two hand spades
You rolled on up, Ace I'm sorry but I have AIDS
But I'ma ride with you, until your death
And I'ma stay by your side, last heartbeat, last breath
[Chorus]
[Break - Timbaland]
I hope ya forgive me too, uh
I hope ya forgive me too (too), uh
I hope ya forgive me too (too)
Be adults about the situation baby, c'mon
[Chorus]
[Timbaland - talking over Chorus]
Can I?
Go head
Uh uh
[Break - Timbaland]
I hope ya forgive me too, uh
I hope ya forgive me too (too), uh
I hope ya forgive me too (too)
Two wrongs don't make a right, girl, uh
Two wrongs don't make a right, girlll
Oo, oo, let's ride out
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk about it
Heavy T, Oo we right, we out</field>

Hey, you said we'd grow old and we'd start us a family
And, you said, we'd be in love we'd live ever after happily
And, got a call from fortune and fame
They said that they wanna change your name
But i care for you
Cause i still hear your voice,
Said i still hear your voice
Now think about the lie that you fell in
Now it feels like you're about to give in

Yo (yo), yo, ay yo
Timabaland's flow infamous
Allow me to assemble this flow with limitless style
For all man, woman and innocent child
I have no perimeter
Break all barriers in various areas
My sound is mimicked
Track prime minister, some say sinister
None stoppin the groove until when it's
The climax, some niggas is bitin my hot hats
And followed my drum pattern, but i done that
It's time to change, get more deranged
Feels more strange (doooodooooo)
Follow me through gravel and shallow trees
From mountains to flat plain, to thunder and black rain
Through the dream state of utopia
Woke up to the sounds of that man timbaland
Five mexican bitches scopin us
Belly dancin, sayin hell, he's handsome in spanish
We was fine until the subtitles vanished
Then and open fire, totin opium
Higher than i ever been in my life
Heard cries throughout the night like
[chorus: static]
Let's get 'em started
While they dance on, indian carpet
C'mon, uh
Niggas act retarded
While they dance on, indian carpet
C'mon, uh
Let's get 'em started

[timbaland]
Ay yo, i woke up to a bowl of rice like the golden child
T.v
playin like the poltergeist, must been on overnight
I saw a strong beam of light, decided to walk to it
Could it be the son of christ, i decided to talk to it
In the halls i heard music shoutin beautiful calls
And i swore i heard a voice say:
It's yours my, gift to you, to do what you choose
But i suggest you do what you do to make the spirits move
I hear ya dude, and me bein a barrel of fruit
But your ears heavenly, when i sit in this chair and produce
Then my hallway darkened
I felt a power surge rush throughout my apartment
And the glance callin like
[chorus]
[magoo]
Mag spit with a sense of purpose on purpose
When you was eatin collard greens i was eatin these dreams
I stepped in dog shit and bit skid row twice
Only ice i had put it in my orange slice
What you know about livin in a jail when it ain't no bars
Handcuffed with no key, world denyin your plea
A third-degree charge when it ain't no crime
Twenty-six years old and i got more time
Phone overdue, baby on the way, low pay
Low rent for your mom, gotta get away
Smoke, hate now, then you wanna talk about the ghetto
I'm tenth generation of that, came out the womb with a hat
Polo on and nikes with a gold tooth
I'm superman, i can spit from any phone booth
You and your cold ass crew do what you do
Just remember mag never feel good, i am the flu

Ahh! Whoa! Feel it? Ugh!
This here is one of those joints you just ride out
Get your thoughts together
"GG" talk to me
[Candice "Gg" Nelson]
I like you cuz you are above average
So I might do things you don't understand
But I like to correct your bad habits
Cuz I want to make you an honest man
[Timbaland]
Huh! I got some precise questions bout my past life
Wondering why we so close to buildings on this last flight
Pray at night and keep my "Run" posted by the door
DMC above like Jason falling to the floor
My mind can carry of a picture perfect
Of my Aunt Mary
Her face in the mirror like she wasn't burried
I drink Hypnotiq let my conscience go (go)
[Magoo]
Tim you need to take it slow (slow)
[Timbaland]
These endless songs got me waking up in cold sweats
What gets the real time wondering where Aaliyah at
I got a wife that watch another girl give me neck
Fix my lunch with plastic wrap up on my pita bread
I'll bite my tongue but she's so outspoken
To that box of Saran bust her head wide open
Handcuffs open my fists go up for Eminem
And when he's walking out his courtcase
I'll be walking in
(Chorus)
I know you're safe (Whoooooo)
You're gonna stay (Whoooooo)
But your mind could change (Whoooooo)
I'm going insane (Whoooooo)
I'm going crazy!
(Repeat)
[Magoo]
You know them days when you troubled inside
All you think about fuck paying bills
You ignore em' you gone drink it out
That's the way that I feel as I am writing this
Sit back roll up a blunt take some delight in this
You been invited to a piece of my sanity
And vanity is absent does that weaken the man in me
My fantasy on side man reality bites
Who can't believe all these rappers let alone what he writes
I wasn't forced to lie to yall but I did
I don't own a plane or yacht or eat squid but
I'm entertaining there will be no explaining
I'm criticized for having fun
Killings more enovating they say
But anyway however ignorance chooses food
Its rude to tell you how you have been screwed
And I'm a part of the problem
And its racking my brain
Excuse me miss I'm half fool half insane
(Chorus)
[Timbaland]
I can't believe that the world is so cold
That's why I keep a runny nose
And I wish my problems would go (Oh)
People don't know me
People don't ask me no questions
Bris Sparky D was an injustice
The greatest rappers man suffered depressions
So I'm signing niggas while Whodini's taking the publishing
My mind state is like the crime rate
A high percentage of your royalties is in my bank
New artists when you're trying to break
I'm prewarning you before you even hand me your tape (Let's go!)

I'm comin straight outta VA (oh)
A nigga named Timbo, growin up a nigga never had cash flow

Little Ceasar's pieces motherfuckers ain't tryin
To go against (what), probably three (uh huh)
Keep talkin nigga you'll get found in that creek (oh)
And that's how we do it in the V (oh)
I can't forget my nigga Pharrell and Camsky (oh)
Y'all remember them house parties (oh)

Got da, ha ha, he he, hay
I got more women that Willy Wonka got choco-late
My pocket gets fatter than Jacob on twenty Ladders
All that matters is my rhyme style gets fatter
As the, jam, goes
Three years I waited, my rhyme style got constipated
It finally came in, F'd around and got debated
Glad I made it, out of the ghetto
My rhyme style is heavy, it comes out smooth, and kind of subtle
Whaaat??

[Sebastian]
From the corner to the dice where we rollin at
For all my homies gettin nice off that cognac
To ghetto chicks who appreciate the Cadillac
When it flip to the normal color like Mike was back
Nike hats, slightly above your nose and neck
Chucks and slacks, seperated from Gores and Tecs
Chicks in packs, please, let your weave relax
I'm so gangster with this rap bouncers hold me back
(Timbaland)
Hey G, I feel you black
But let me get up in this club and show you how I act
I'm a fool when it comes to these party girls
I'm a fool when it comes to this party world
Now ask yourself, now who do beats like me?
I was the one that gave you "Hey Papi"
I'm like Tupac, all eyes on me
Got niggas messed up in the industry, but it's ok
[Chorus: Storm and Shelby (Timbaland)]
It's your night (yeah), no need to act uptight (uh)
Go and grab somebody (go 'head), go and grab somebody
And be real
(And just dance a bit, c'mon and just dance a bit)
Do what you feel
(Uh huh, and just dance a bit, c'mon and just dance a bit
(Magoo)
Must be the first of the month
Mag get up on the track and I'm rappin drunk
Y'all wanna battle we can spit for days
Let up sixteen bars like mayo-naise
Swisher in my mouth, shower cap on my dome
Ain't in the studio, little shorty I'm home
Pass the phone, I'm a call all VA
Tell Sin, call Brooke and bring some Alize
(Sin)
Got in the game like what, it's over man (say what?)
I spit vodka, ain't sober man (say what?)
I'm a bigger guy, need extra pay
Give me a bed so I can lay in my Escalade
You could be black, Puerto Rican or Dominican
Room 219, I don't care, send it in
I'm a jiggy guy, ride one plus the five
Make it a six, big bad son of a bitch
[Chorus] 2x
(Magoo)
Sin got the Alize from home
Give me Lifestyles, put 'em on my jimmy, it's on
And peep out my manuscript
Mag and Tim party hoes so you gots to strip
And I ain't playin games when I heart
And leave Mag hangin hard suit with Christopher Darden
I take about a hour to bust
Chickens wanna get with Mag so they makin a fuss
Told 'em, "simmer down, you're next
Take my headphones, listen to Funkmaster Flex
I'll be about a minute or less
Stop sittin clothes on, take off your dress"

Hey hey, oh
You put your hand on my hand
And you lead me to dance on the floor
It was like we were both in a trance, like it felt
Something more than you could disguise
But behind your smile
There was fear in your eyes
Did someone hurt you?
Did they break you heart?
Are the wounds still fresh?
Do you heal the scars?
Cause I just turn around
And you disappeared, oh
Were you even here?
Or was it my imagination?
So real I can't believe this wasn't true
Or was it my imagination?
It put me in a time or place with you
Tell me girl what you are you running from
(Running from, Running from)
I can't help wondering where you've gone
{Where you've gone, Where you've gone)
I'm thinkin' maybe I got it wrong
(Got it wrong, Got it wrong)
God damn i should have known that
You were just a fantasy
Was it my imagination?
Though I tried my best
I still couldn't forget
So I drive every night
Past the spot where we met
And I hope one day
That I'll see your face
But you're never here
Or was it my imagination?
So real I can't believe this wasn't true
Or was it my imagination?
It put me in a time or place with you
Tell me girl what you are you running from
(Running from, Running from)
I can't help wondering where you've gone
{Where you've gone, Where you've gone)
I'm thinkin' maybe I got it wrong
(Got it wrong, Got it wrong)
God damn i should have known that
You were just a fantasy
Was it my imagination?
Imagine, you and me together
And a love that will last forever
Imagine, that it's late December
Been a year but i still remember
Imagine, Meeting you meant to much to me
Imagine, Oh no
Or was it my imagination?
So real I can't believe this wasn't true
Or was it my imagination?
It put me in a time or place with you
Tell me girl what you are you running from
(Running from, Running from)
I can't help wondering where you've gone

You can't fool me girl
I know you well
What's on your mind
It ain't hard to tell
Don't leave me now
Don't play wit' me
You think I'm blind
But baby I can see

Don't say I'm wrong (what)
Don't mind those eyes
I'ma call your bluff

Tell me what's on your mind (tell me am I wasting my time)
I gotta know, baby let me know

Could you have told me girl
Is what I said
You can tell the truth
I'm all in your hand
And what's wrong wit' that
Are you ashamed of me?
You can fool your girls
But you can't fool G
I saw your eyes, from across the room
You was checkin' me out, I was scopin' you too

Got impeccable timing
If they forgot about my worth
I got a check to remind 'em
Got some things on the wrist

Uh, what's up girl
Why you trippin on me?
I thought we was past that
Feel me?
Alright let me talk to ya, uh
[Chorus - Timbaland] - w/ ad libs
C'mon baby what's the hold up
You carryin me like your school folder
I want your dinner, not your cold cuts
Why you keep givin me the cold shoulder?
(Shorty)
C'mon baby what's the hold up
You carryin me like your school folder
I want your dinner, not your cold cuts
Why you keep givin me the cold shoulder?
(Cause I'm that fly)
[Verse 1 - Magoo]
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
And I think of them times when you was lickin my balls
I never came in your face, you said you hated the taste
That's a disgrace, I'd rather put my cum inside your weight plate
You comfortable now? You need your toes massaged
I'm oblaged to rub 'em down, first I put on da barges
With your favorite song, you need to take off the thong
Go head, nibble on my neck, your doin it wrong
We could be doin it, and doin it, and doin it wild
I wanna lick on you and lick on you, I like when you smile
I'll be in town next week, can I keep an erection?
Twelve pack of Lifestyles is my choice of protection
See I'm more than pimperific, let me be more specific
On a scale of one to ten, my sex is so terrific
It's like I'm Rick James "Superfreaky" things
I put a hot dog in your bum that sure to make you cum
[Chorus]
[Verse 2 - Timbaland]
Uh, it was a teenage love, a, a, a teenage love
And I told her, don't hurt me again
Actin like the vaughn a vo in my living room den
Like it never took much to really get you back then
Just some college ruled paper and my ball point pen
Crackers, pimp juice, and my cranberry Benz
We circle my block and we do it again
Now let's fast forward to my living room flo'
Where we was freakin and she speakin gettin about to go
I slap broke my watch cause this raggedy ho
She like the time wasn't right, then she hugged me slow
Uh, it was a teenage love, a, a, a teenage love
And I told her, don't hurt me again
Can't we live like The Ropers, "Three's Company" man, huh?
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Magoo]
Tell me if she like it and if not
Girl is this your spot?
I never cum in second, some reppin for camel lot
And when I was a kid, I used to fuck in the bushes
Only time I turn it down is when you don't use dush
You got the "Eye of a Tiger" and your pussy is fly
It's a Hall of Fame booty baby, gonna retire
And I aspire to be penis of convenience for you
But we fuckin in the bed, let's cut in the living room
You likin my pimperation, do I calm your frustration?
Never bein pleased, so you settle with masturbation
I got a 'C' on my chest cause I'm super when cuttin
Give me fifteen minutes, guarantee you'll be comin and cummin
[Chorus]</field>

[Verse: Timbaland]
Hey yall, it's Timbaland with the jump off
I only got forty eight hours before my plane takes off
I got this girl ready to give me some face off
I think I need seven just to make the playoff
But I ain't gonna hit tonight, I'ma leave a good impression before I catch my flight (come on)
How I'm wrong when you ain't right?
When your dumbass will be right on my flight (stupid)
There goes my shenanigans, laugh with me
There ain't no need for panicking
Chill out, you on a private plane
Just lay your head back to this kirkle bang
Eat some peanuts, sip on some champagne
Your fly mileage go up as you give me brain
This is what Thomas do, piss on my mark then I get back to you
[Chorus] x2
Cause I'm leaving on the next plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Why don't you just call up all your friends
And let's get something started
[Verse: Attitude]
I'm only in town for two days, two nights only
I'm hoping that you wanna spend these two nights on me
I like your home girls you like my homies
We ain't really tryna spend these two night lonely
Shawty, really ain't much I'm asking for
A little conversation, a nice piece of ass to go
I like penetration, how you like it fast or slow?
Only a hip, nobody has to know
She looking at me, weighing up her options
She ready to leave, and go get it poppin'
What could be the fact that I got there
Drop top Benz or that single in the top 10?
I dunno but whatever it is gotta……crunk
She grabbing her liquor, coming out of Prada
I told her I'ma pimp it, I ain't coming out a dollar
Let's go! I'm leaving gonna be out of here tomorrow
[Chorus] x2
[Verse: Magoo]
Girl you lookin' right in those jeans
You been eating colligreens?
That's obscene, your man don't help you make beans?
You have a house, 2 kids, and he working
There's rumors, he and your best friend been flirting
But I ain't tryna fuck you tonight
Your ass big, but your face hmmmm that look alright
I tell you what, I'ma make an exception
Clothes off, that's the truth
Clothes on is deception
Aw, yea, a macilent conception
Front or the back, hit in any direction
And baby you the cause of my erection
Stop at Wal-Greens I'ma buy some protection
Fuck that, go and put it in my face girl
I really have a need to give you face girl
You said you dreamed if sex with a star
Make up your mind, Oo be on a jet tomorrow

You never know where the open road will lead you to
I crawl before I walk, still got nowhere fast
The other side still has the greener grass
Oh, you win some and you loose some yeah

I hear it's such a long way down
And the climb back up ain't as easy as it sounds
I hear it's such a long way down
And the climb back up is just something I can do without
Something I can do without
I walked until I didn't have no energy
I bought until I didn't have no bite left in me
I died so that I didn't have to live in the past

            <field name="lyrics">For those days we felt like a mistake,
Those times when love's what you hate
Somehow
We keep marchin' on
For those nights that I couldn't be there,
I've made it harder to know that you know
That somehow
We'll keep movin' on
There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
For all of the plans we made
There isn't a flag I'd wave
Don't care where we've been
I'd sink us to swim
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
For those doubts that swirl all around us
For those lives that tear at the seams
We know
Were not what we've seen
Oh
For this dance we move with each other
There ain't no other step
Than one foot
Right in front of the other
Oh
There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
For all of the plans we made
There isn't a flag I'd wave
Don't care where we've been
I'd sink us to swim
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
Right Right Right Right Left
Right Right Right Right Left
Right Right Right Marchin' On
We'll have the days we break
And we'll have the scars to prove it
We'll have the bomb that we saved
And we'll have the heart
Not to lose it
For all of the times we fought
For all of the things I'm not
Oh!
You put one foot in front of the other
We go where we go we're marchin' on
Marchin' on
There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
Right Right Right Right Left
Right Right Right Right Left
Marchin' On
Marchin' on</field>

I aint perfect but Imma do my thing

you here im there, tell me whats the sence in me trying if you dont care?
this relationship is heading to who knows where
that means one of us got to chose, because
you hurt me, and I hurt you, you complain about the things that I dont do
I dont wanna take the blame niether do you, because we got too much to loose
we gotta meet in the middle

We got somethin we can't enjoy
im sick of you trynin to play with me like I'm your toy
hm,
you tried to run game I saw,
we gotta lotta issues you got yours, we gotta meet in the middle
you cant talk that shit, you cant travel to the future if you walk backwards
once you walk out the door, you cant walk back in
we gotta find a way to solve it, think about our kids
cos they in the middle
you wanna sing that song?
you want me to cop that plead and say ok im wrong?
things are gettin heavy but I gotta stay strong
I try to talk it over with you when I coulda been gone because
you hurt me, and I hurt you, you complain about the things that I dont do
and I dont wanna take the blame niether do you because we got too much to loose
we gotta meet in the middle

we need to see eye to eye
so lets meet in the middle
I told you once, I told you twice
and now my shoulders cold, like a block of ice
you playin games like you rollin dice
hey what you know about sacrifice?
baby ive been in the middle..
ive been givin you more than a little
had the ball then you double dribble
I guess that love is a riddle..
you never listen I dont ever get my point across
I washed ya dirty draws, you out with dirty broads
you did me dirty dawg, cos yous a dirty dog,
its a quit n call, and I aint mad at all
I gave you more than you deserve, I was worth it all
bottom line I hope you find what your searchin for
you hurt me, said I hurt you
and I complain about the things that you dont do
and I dont wanna take the blame niether do you
we got too much to lose...
we gotta meet in the middle

You do this every time
You be M.I.A.* every single time
The part that kills me
You rather chill with your friends instead of me huh.
But I ain't gon' be no clown
I guess I call you next time I'm in your town
Then you say to me
Keri:
So what, I was out with my friends
I'm a grown woman
It's the weekend, oh
So what if I don't answer my phone
What if I'm not alone
I'm with him
What's it to you?
I need to get out
You you you you you

and that there ain't never cool
getting on my nerves
I think it's time you knew
only gave you my number cause, drinks made you cuter,

Sebastian:

it's the second time I'm callin' your number
I ain't chasin' I ain't even no runner
don't you know I push the Hummer in the summer, huh
how you hard to be reached?
I can put you where you hard to be reached
black sand on the balls of your feet
You can scream, ain't nobody gon' be sleep,
this your own private beach, haha
and when it comes to sex,
just a little bit of love and little bit of that
maybe push your back where your ribs is at
share a bowl of crunch berries, how real is that?
haha
I'm just jokin', of course,
I'm trying to put your sex game back on course
if you feelin' dry, like you don't get moist
if you ever get a minute holla at yo' boy

Mosley
I’m glad you’re my maker
My Loyalty lies in your hands, you’re my breath taker
Your body, your kiss is in unknown demand
So take command, go Timbo
I be the same when it all goes up
I be the same when it all goes down
Not the first one, open it up
I be the last one closin it out
Don’t know if I’ll give you a shot yet
Lil Mama I’m peepin your style
Do I think you’re dope enough, yup
One way of findin it out
The way you came at me, boo
Don’t care, not afraid I’m like Wild
Really want it from head to toe
Question if she gon let it out
Anyway the hour glass go
I don’t worry anyhow
Why don’t we see where it go
Let’s figure it out
[Chorus]
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh

When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh

In the morning after Dark
Owww, Oooohhh Owww
Come on SoShy
[SoShy]
I got a little secret for ya
I never sleep when comes the night
But everytime I smack my fingers
I switch back into the light
My moon belong to your sun
Your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust
Something that I just can’t describe (ah)
Am I the one and only (ah)
Cause you’re the only one (ah)
It felt so long and lonely (ah)
Waiting for you to come
It’s lookin bright and early
I’m willing to close my eyes
This is the unusual story
Timbo and SoShy

Heyy, Heyy, (ay) Heyy, Timbo!
You talk about takin it slow
I’m talkin about takin it Wild
Don’t wanna be too up front no
Baby you know it’s my style
I’m talkin about lightin it up
You talkin about dimmin it down
Don’t think about lettin it go
But I’ve never seen no king that bows
Yes I’m the one and only
You know I see right through ya
I get it your magnetic
So you draw me right to ya
Maybe I give you a shot yup
Maybe you deserve the crown
Won’t give you a treasure map yet
Cause you’ll figure it out

If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me (what would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular (tell me, would you?)
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (say "I do")
[Chorus]
Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take
your spot, my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take
your spot, my love
Ooooh, girl
My love
My love
Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote (what would you do?)
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team (tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point of waiting anymore?
Cause girl I've never been more sure (that baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for (just say "I do")
[Chorus]
Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

[T.I.'s rap]
Shorty, cool as a fan
On the new once again
Still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
If you got a man, try to lose him if you can
Cause the girls real wild throw their hands up high
Wanna come kick it with a stand up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
Because you ain't been seen wit a man so fly
Friend so fly i can go fly
Private, cause I handle mine
Call me candle guy, simply because I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't
deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it with an ace so high
Baby, you decide that I ain't your guy
Ain't gon lie, Me in your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me a pair, I will
[Chorus]
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

What we got right here
Is that feel good music y'all
Uh, (*harmonizing*), c'mon
[Break - Brandy] - w/ ad libs
When I'm chillin in my neighbor's shade
Watchin the ocean from a balcony
And I love the sound of the waves
And I love it like that, cause to me this is how I get away
[Timbaland]
Ha, so what you gonna do girl, what you gonna do
[Chorus - Brandy] - w/ ad libs
Outside with my TV on, cell phone on, the radio on
Cause I wanna get into the music
(Timbaland: I get into the music) (ho)
Outside with my TV on, cell phone on, the radio on
Cause I wanna get into the music
(Timbaland: I get into the music) (c'mon)
And it feel so good
It's like blood flowin to my veins
(Timbaland: It's like blood flowin to my veins)
And it feel so good
It's like blood flowing to my veins
[Timbaland]
Alright now, let's take it to the bridge (*echo*)
[Verse 1 - Timbaland]
(Ho) It's Timbaland I'm back (uh huh ...)
with another one you can dance, so you can relax (woo, woo ...)
My music moves you wherever you at
I play it loud, to move the crowd, I like it like that (c'mon, c'mon ...)
I know you feel the vibe, from the club to your clothes
and you'll still decide I love it
Everytime I get 'em a ride
I drop the top, turn the volume up and put it in drive
Me and Aaliyah did +One In A Million+
When Ginuwine dropped +Pony+ was the one that I'm feelin
Hey, we havin a party, come through with your crew
Turn up the feel good, do what you do
[Chorus] - w/ ad libs
[Verse 2 - Magoo]
Yeah, when I'm feelin lost and hurt, you can soothe my soul
You was there for me, music
I was goin out of control, 'til I heard Marvin Gaye
"Now it ain't a mountain high enough, when time is rough"
I turn to you, yeah
Believe it or not, I learned from you, yeah
All of my soul, I bear to you
Your not a painkiller, but I think a snare'll do the trick
And I just wanna lose myself in you
I gained all my health and my wealth from you
I started thinkin me and you was just a phase
Now I can't count the days

People know me, As "The Great Timbaland" (Timbaland)
Been brought in the Slums, But I ranned (But I ranned)
Been boning girls in the Scooby Doo Van ( Doo Van)
Chicks been missing since the Summer Of Sam (Of Sam)
Oh, I get'em all from ya hood clubs (Clubs)
Blue Magic, Be floating in my black Cup (Cup)
Mack mold, spit the game and make'em feel good (Feel Good)
Eyes closed like they gone off that backwood (Backwood)
(Ahhhh) Go on girllll, do ya damn thang
Booty poppin, Spell my name with ya tongue rang
Banana Dodge ain't a damn thang
Sitting in the bucket, like a Champagne
This for my ghetto people (People)

[Chorus 2X: Timbaland] and (Raje)

Sucking on ya thumb like a pacifier (Na Raje, Nu Fire)
Must mean you wanna get naughty right

[Second Verse: Magoo]
I want you bitches to calm down
I'm Yao Ming with mines, a player in each town
I know you mad when I come around
I Lex coupe to woman, tops they come down (Oh)
You wanna see what can Magoo do
Be in V.I.P
with my hands up ya Tu-Tu
Boo, get you and Sue, Tisha and Lu Lu
Get a twelve pack of skins, so I can run through ya whole crew
Look ma, I know I was the one that you wanted
You gave me Naughty Eye, Seen you in the club but you fronted
You got mad blunted, Then Mag became the Hunted
It was fourth down, would've made a pass, but I punted
I got more woman than ye, You just Flea
Give'em crackers an cheese, Then give'em some tea
You want some money hoe, Go catch a bee
Cause the pussy in ya pants bitch smell like a sea

[Bridge 2X: Raje Shwari]
Ohh mede do ooh aje
Tuu mede do ooh aje
Bu mede do ooh aje
(Sebastian) Ha Ha, Ha Ha
[Third Verse: Sebastian] + (Timbaland)
Sebastian be quicker
More proof than my daddy's old E liquor
I like'em Trina size, but if they ever be bigger
I put the sheets to the ground
Act bigger, make the shake stick her, so they can at least figure
Then we hit the slopes
Same amount of snow, that Johnny would it nose
No chain and ropes, I don't chestize my hoes
Just release the low, and put little me's on clothes
But still though I got (love for you)
Single mothers I got (love for you)
Fuck niggaz who hatin I got (love for you)
Middle fingers I keep'em (up for you)
Couple bottles with models
That would swallow you whole
If I vanish tommorrow, niggaz will follow the flow
See a hundred like towers, watch me pull in the load
When I come to ya clubs, niggaz will be stare at the doors

that I really can't deal with
I wanna block her out my mind
but I really can't do it
I tell myself this the last time
I'ma let her do this to me
Whenever we do spend time I realize
that I can't get enough of you.
Wipe that smile off your fucking face,
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your face.
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your fucking face,
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your face.
Refrão:
To be despised, to be loved.
To be dreamt of, to be sought
On the inside I don't care
Right in the middle,
I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
On the inside I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my only.
I wear scarves and hoods cause it's the only poker
face that I've got left
And everything I love about you is a mess
Smash the mirror and break the palm reader's hands
I want to be better than I am
Wipe that smile off your fucking face,
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your face.
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your fucking face,
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your face.

Girl, just look what you done,
How could you do this to me?
I gotta put my foot down,
I can't let you do this to me.
I can't forget those good old times,
and all those things you were doing to me.
I wanna hit that one more time,
I'm in love with what you're doin' to me.
I'ma say it loud
right, right, left, up in this crowd
Why we arguin'?
I thought me and you were suposta be friends.
Let's chill for a minute,
Better yet, we need ta heal for a minute.
Baby, put down the knife,

Yo.

Turn this up.

When the war's on, the 4's are drawn like pictures
The niggaz is all gone when these triggers get witcha
Nigga before long you need stitches in your longjohns
A.K., t-t-t-t, heartbeat, t-t-t-t
Eight figures you fake twitchy niggaz can't stop (that)
Jigga, Twista my nigga Timb on the hot track
How you gon' stop that? We can't be slowed
Niggaz (?), look at your clothes
When I'm in crazy mode, three-eighty blows like
Maceo, leave acey holes
That's just Jay-Z doe, crazy flow
Rhyme great, dominate your radio
C'mon, get your gun, your mask and gloves
I don't ask for love, I blast 'em up
Respect my gangsta dude, or your life's in danger dude
Doctors pushin on your chest tryin to bring you through
[Chorus: Timbaland] + (Twista)
All my party people gon' do what? (Gonna get buck)
Get some liquor in the gut (So whassup?)
(Get them lighters lit up, make them get up
with somethin the East and West gon' bump)
All my party people gon' do what? (Get crunk)
Get some liquor in the gut (So whassup?)
(Get them lighters lit up, T got some gangsta shit
that's beatin in yo' trunk)
[Magoo]
Fuckin with Mag, nigga end up in a hospital
Sittin on the corner of the bed, sick cause of what I said to him
On a track star beef take it in the kitchen
Cookin MC's all niggaz taste like chicken
Hittin 'em high, bitin they ear
Tyson on a muh'fucker vampire style, I'm a bloodsucker
You turnin into a mad ducker, tellin ya dog
I'm at the Rucker with a bad Puerto Rican chick
Fat as my cash and she a dick sucker, get up outcha car
You ain't goin real far, see the chainsaw?
Breakin the law, like turnin a dyke
when it come to that man that just like Mike
I don't care what you like, I'll make you run in outer space
If you go to court man, only wish you got a case
For real, I'm fuckin faced on a hill of ice
Mag hot now nigga 50 G's the price
[Timbaland]
Timbaland good for that - {*beat plays, he scats*}
{*scatting*} - I invented that
Hear the hi-hat, hear the bassline on the track
Remember "One in a Million" when I left ya back
Producers sayin, "How you get your sound like that?"
I don't know playa, I'm a creative cat
Got party people dancin to dis and dat
Got party people sayin, "This a dope-ass track!"
[Chorus]
[Twista]
Timbaland hit 'em with the um, ah-um, ah-um-ahh, you gon' do what?
Stop frontin you bumpin the new cut
like a shoe ah, um ah-um ah, hit 'em in the gut
Twitchin and itchin to get up, I hit 'em up
With some skanless to vibe to and ride to
with the stanky inside you - listen to while a freak lickin you
Go on a bogus mission to, somethin you crip-walk in the kitchen to
Somethin you bump on the porch or the park
Or pump it while you displayin yo' heart when you flex on a mark
You can play it to clear your head from drama with the feds
and all the homies like down for when they in the dark
Used to rock up at the block club, players wasn't ridin slick
You can let your mind cruise for miles
They can't tell no sucker who's allowed, with a strap on the mic
I'm thinkin how can I move the crowd, move the crowd
[Chorus] - repeat 2X
[Timbaland]

Ow ow ow-ow ah, shake wit me, shake wit me, shake wit me, shake..

Shake wit me, shake wit me
Ow, one time, bounce wit me, bounce wit me
Yo, ahh
Remember when you first found me?
I was workin at Burger King
Now take a good look around me
Look at all these cars, look at all these girls
Why you always tryin to put down me?
Why you always tryin to put down me?
You get 'round your friends and try to clown me
Why you always tryin to pull that boo-boo?
I'm gettin tired of all that bullshit
Always talkin dis and dat
Your girls screamin, "We looove him!"
See girls, they LOVE me
Girl that's just, only Tim
Yes, it's only Tim
Whatchu talkin 'bout that's only Tim?
Yeah whatchu talkin 'bout that's only Tim?

[Timbaland: repeat 2X]

We listen to cover girls
And now I mess with cover girls of magazines
You can catch me on the cover, girl
I created my own planet, I hover the Earth
And cover the world
I spit so thick ?
I see you tryna claim her now I play with her pearls
?
...but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
? she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50, what a working girl
Now work it, girl! Like..
Hey girl, I like what you're doing
What are you doing?
Hey girl, I like what you're doing
What are you doing?
Oh my God

I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I love when I see you break it down like you in control
I gotta jump through my ?
And I cover my ? til I ran out of breath
I got girls on my right, I got girls on my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breasts
Hey girl, I like what you're doing
What are you doing?

Another Timbaland master piece
Uh
I dont think they ready
Verse 1: Timbaland
Uh, Timbaland the funky beat maka
I can rock the U.S
and all of Jamaica
I can make you dance, and shake your butt, and wiggle
When it's hot outside I eat popsicles
Check it, do you want to get freaky tonight?
I'm throwin a house party and the stars at night
All the ladies gonna be there in they tight skirts
I'm gonna mingle a little and start to flirt
Baby, don't get an attitude
Or I have to throw your silly ass in the pool
I ain't got no time for the silly game
Timb and Maganoo, I got all the game
Chorus:
Now that you are peepin my style
My kind of style
That make you buck wild
Throw your hands up in the sky
Pass me something so we all get high
Now that you are peepin my style
My kind of style
That make you buck wild
Throw your hands up in the sky
Pass me something so we all get high
Verse 2: Timbaland
Check it, let's take it to another level
One of my fantasies, it is love in pebble
I want to take her on a cruise around the block
And make her say "Don't stop the body rock"
I want to take her on a cruise around the block
And make her say "Don't stop the body rock"
I want to take her on a cruise around the block
And make her say "Don't stop the body rock"
Check it, now I'm back to my basic rhythme
Check out ill ass flow I'm about to give him
I'm a make him dance and make em shake they ass
But not to slow and not to fast
Timbaland ain't got nuthin to prove
I done did five years and pay my due
I got my mine Big E and Big Rodney
Coming strong like the freaky freaky freaky on me
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But I got baking me some of that good french toast
Let me take it to another level, I'm the host
As I can get freaky, fre-freaky-fre-freaky
Ooooooh

All y'all wanna talk like we used to hang
Cause i'm doin my thang, now you wanna bask in my fame
That's why i stay out the club, be in the crib
Smokin a dub, countin my cash, over the phone
And i'm sellin cell phones, all with chips
My nine to bloods, my glock to crips, who want war?
You and your boys can bring the noise
But i'ma bring hand grenades, now you're laid!
Pull out my dick, piss on your bitch-ass
Sit on your face, now you gotta kiss ass
Who fiend for fame life belong to your fans
And haters and thugs that wanna end your lifespan

So for rememdy i pound niggaz

Confirmed by people that she can blow
Convinced booker t she's the next to go
Now i'm checkin every joint and every unit i sold
Once i'm deep in the dough, i'm deep with a crew
In the 80's y'all screamed like the movie is through
Y'all screamin this is nutty professor: part ii
To eyes wide shut to whoever i choose
I can appreciate a kidman to a, tom cruise
To a, fast food, i'm strictly drive-through
The money i gave dudes i basically raised fools

Even the phone spit it, god know what i'm thinkin
I'm drinkin and smokin and stressin, go to church for confession
Down on my knees, beggin to god, show me the path
My label is jerkin me workin me so the devil can lurk in me
Sick of niggaz bitchin, wishin i'd fail
Tell 'em mag be the rap effin kenan and kel
I'm spittin the version of verses curses over the churches
Rappin mo' iller than thriller manila and give you salmonella

Stop, the press!
Bitch, you can't afford that dress, you can't afford that hairdo
I don't want your sex, here take your fast food
Tim you're dead wrong, tim you're dead rude!
Hey girl, i don't even know you

And if you love what you do, do what you feel
Then I know you gonna mark my words
Yall drop shit like birds
Then it's about the time for yo ass to get served
Just lay it on down
Just lay it on down
While we relax to the tight raps
And the phat tracks
That that nigga Timbaland put down
Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit
Don't have no time for the patient
Cuz I got more dick than a lil' bit
And time flies, when I'm havin' fun
I can make a hoe get like Forrest Gump and just "run baby run"
I guess that they can't handle this
Brothers just to scandalous
If you don't wanna get freaked
then get out my way like an ambulance (say what)
Gitty up gitty up ride up on the real, let death to the fake
And tell you boyfriend just to chill, don't playa hate
Kick back relax, and just take off yo shoes
Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)

Why you standin there wit yo' butt out (whoo)
And it's always in the back of my mind
Wherever the place, whenever the time
Even in College Park, after dark, I'ma get my sunshine
Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya
Beginner, give me a thigh, breast, and wing like Ms
Winner
And let dinner be served
Can I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder
and put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter
The wetta the betta, I'm ready to get ya
Gotta have rabbit like that cheddar
So I can freak ya like I just met ya

Kinda like that coochie
You wanna be my hoochie
Better than my advesary
Don't be so scary
I, never thought that you could act up
Make a nigga wanna back up
Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up
So we can slip and slide
Make you wanna dip and dive
Trippin' while we rip and ride
Til I get to the coming side
Got you where I want yo ass
In the case of an emergency, break the glass
Keep yo eyes on the President, erase the past
We be happy if we had more blunts to pass
Get done up and run up
And the guts of yo butt don't shake like they used to
I wake 'em up like a rooster
Take it slow, not faster than a turbo rooster
No worry, no hurry
No pain, no gain
Keep yo eyes on strain
Cuz ain't a damn thing changed
Kick back, relax and take off yo shoes
Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)

You don’t have a player about the choke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke
N:If you looking for a girl that’ll treat you right
If you lookin’ for her in the day time with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
N: You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What’s the problem I don’t see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it, I’m curious about you, you seem so innocent

To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
N: Hey is that the truth or are you talking trash
Is your game M.V.P
like Steve Nash
Chorus-
Promiscuous Girl
Wherever you are
I’m all alone
And its you that I want
N: Promiscuous Boy
I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy
The way you're making me wait
Promiscuous Girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
N: Promiscuous Boy
We're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more

[Timb]
It's a hot Saturday
My little sister's outside
Playin' patty cake (patty cake)
My momma's in the kitchen (kitchen)
Wit' the Shake 'n Bake
Magoo got on the stockin' cap
Tryin' to pick this way
I'm (I'm) in the back with the play sta'
A little boy (boy) came and gave me an invitation
Said there's a party and ya gotta wear your suit
And ain't no time (time) for the D-Q
I say who-dee-who
[Static]
Pass me the courvoisier
It's a party-yea, it's time to play
I see today is a good day
I'm out for gleem, plus play it then finally hit your screen
I may not be the giant but I want that jolly green
I got tomorrow's dreams baby, don't share the turf (what?)
Maybe I'll tap your glass, I got some cheers for you
For they yak can't hold me back
So baby, whassup with that? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me where the party at
[Timb]
Pick it pick it pick it up
[Yoshamine]
You and I goin' do that damn thing, make it bang
You went out to the room in the back
Bring me in a Henney and a pack
Give a blunt to that fact suicide
State of mind, do or die, anytime
We can bang in the back of the 'Lac
Any damn thing bang
Do the thing in the back of the 'Lac
In the car, at the bar, gettin' high, wanna try
You went out with the heels on the block
Get the nine's all coughin'
And nigga's gon' run in our spot
Wonder why hypnotize, on my eyes and thighs
You ain't heard of me yet
But I betcha ain't met another one yet
Who do it like this
It's on, put yo hands in the air
We got you in the zone, get yo hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
See I'm keepin' all the party people in the place
And I'll pull another playa's parts bags
Send searchin' for sex for six packs,
See I'm Simpsoning them all to the back
She even knows I'm hellerin
So they'll move till they pickin low, go over really
If I say hit his head and then hang another round
I'm showing 'em, knowing if it's a drag
That you hit it from the back and stroke
Left to the right keep it right on time
One time, two time for your mind
Better get soft layers and go over mine
Come about two chairs and go here's an ear if it's on tonight
Then this is the word I speak
Shit don't quicks mo' too tight
[Static]
I come clear to your mouth and spit many a spouse and get
Civil cuz riddles can sizzle picks it a foul out
Package your rap attack, it's for presses and stash
They catch your track by the tail and smack they head on the nail
Factoring the jam made by Timbaland givin' fans something
Bumpin' (bumpin') and scrumpin' for your consumption
Listen close to the slick and those quick quotes
Keep gettin' dope shit, fuck with this, it'll get you so most
[Yoshamine]
When she get crucial forget about what chu used to
Cuz I'm here to pay dues too, nigga put it to the back sayin'
I'mma school you on the rules to how to tell who's who
On a cruise to who's tryin' to use you
In the same sentence demention that will lose your attention
So pull mad intentions like Mag'
Lot of people gonna wanna see me stand stagnant, but it ain't gonna happen
Sound completely like Twista, or get mean like Mista'
For they feel the purple from the first time
The first rhyme that they first heard
First word, nigga's know that I'm a gold mine
Come on nigga's now lets go a time
Tell I'm in a power mood, the party groove records tour if I move it
I'mma support their dues or loose it

It's on, put yo hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, get yo hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on

I be creepin' in backyards, dippin in alley ways
My brother in the 360, i'm in a escalade
We piled ride high, sittin' on low pros
Petey in the back of us, with his range rov
Bold ladies sittin' in back, one ridin' in the front
No smokin' in here, so put out your freakin' blunt
This how we gon' do it, so pay attention to the rules
Women in sexy gear, draws down and no shoes
That's why we keep it live, cuz we keep ours alive
For that alcohol is full of, full of surprise
That's how we're gonna ball, walk before we crawl
This here, this here, is that party y'all
[chorus]
Roll out (roll!)
Get the cars (roll!)
Get your girls (roll!)
Get your boys (roll!)
Hit the switches (roll!)
Bring the noise (roll!)

[petey pablo]
Roughest, toughest, fastest, one of the baddest
Rappin' asses, tickin' on a timbaland classic
Layin' in traffic, shiftin gears in the automatic
Tryin' to get past this old couple in a maverick
Beepin' my horn at 'em, flickin' on my hazards
G
callin' me, on his cell phone laughin'
Thinkin' his chick hang out the sunroof flashin'
I done went in the grass, like to kill a rabbit
Swerve back into traffic, radio blastin'
Slammed on the brakes [skrut!], ya old bastard
Tim zig-zaggin', hell, he in the back and
Girls sittin' on the trunk, droppin' wine glasses
Wind blowin' dresses up, showin off the pad and
Polka dot scripe long cramed in their phanies
Whoop! you could be ms
barry, fine as you is
Tim, pull it over, let 'em ride in here
[repeat chorus]
[smokey]
Catch me in a chick, and her name is kim
Tryna tell you who i hit cuz i ran out of bim
Fast food so dangerous that i'm crackin' my rim
Like why taco bell drive-thru so damn slim
I'm out north too, no top on the benz
Big body, too, just like i walked out the gym
Man, i'm sppeding through, not just feeling the wind
Look, the needle to the gas tank is right at the end
Now, i'm needing to sin, lying again
Pumpin' gas in the benz, with no money to spend
And every kid that walk in, cashier turning again
So it's a good thing that lady walked in her twins
[repeat chorus]
[magoo]
All i do is listen to eightball, with the hoes on call
High dank in my gas tank and eat raw franks
Grill in my bed and serve 2 steak and siemen
And i'm scheming on your daughter with on condom and clairborne
Don't get it twisted, i'm gold-toothed and two-fisted
Both arms ready to roll, chrome-wristed
I'm past being beserk, i go to work
Tell the boss go 'head give me some sugars and hot sauce
With an atrack of diana ross playing
And drunk off some moonshine, i passed out and woke up at noontime
Thought it was crack of dawn, but ass was in my face
Said them draws was versache, i thought she had versace

but I'm not the kind of girl who'll ask ya business
i'll be about mine so don't listen to the rumours,

cos they keep spreading like the walls keep spinning,
and they keep watching while the windows tinted,
and they keep talking but we just don't listen to the
rumours,
rumours, ru rumours,
let em talk, let em watch, take a pic, let it click,
they can say what they want but it don't mean sh-t,
let em talk, let em watch, take a pic, let it click,
they can say what they want but it don't mean sh-t,
it just a rumour (x8)
so do everyone jocking like this,
what it is, where you miss with all that sh-t cos,
what it look like not's what it look like,
might what it look like but your whom I don't like,
cos you say it like you know that its true,
tryna mess it up with me and my boo,

Its funny how someone else?s success brings pain,
When ya no longer involved that person has it all,

Killing sh-t the ever so talented mr ripley,
How I go from being the man that you argue with,
To me and dwayne carter putting out
The hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
But I'm addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit,
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,

You niggaz ain't even try I know you niggaz don't spray
UHH - put me on the corner liquor store with whores
A slice of white bread and a Mary Jane warehouse
I know I spit on the track, walk around a pimp fox
One all in my cash, rubbin on my fuckin socks
[Chorus]
[Timbaland]
Timbaland! I'm that man!
Watch that man! Stop that man!
Bitch, don't you dare grin
No favors, you been what I been
I'm a hot tomale no you a hot tomale
Don't give a hell what they say or read about me
I'm a rich man, invest in stock man
I buy land from the (freaky-freaky) white man
I move to Atlanta with Country Grammar
and move to 'bama with nails and hammers
to put the posters on Havannah
Move to China to move through miners
Then move to shirts, drawers, pants, and to the panty-liners
I got them cars, I got them thangs
I got them planes, I got a whole squad entertained
Timbaland, I'm the man
So ladies.
wave ya hands, what!

Baby, you nasty boy
(it's been a minute)
And I could say my life has changed
(since you hit it, hit)
This is your strongest trait
(you work the middle)
While they say I'm spring
(I'll say, maybe a little)
Keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
He keeps me shakin'
(Keep you shakin')
Your love makin'
(My love makin')
It keeps me shakin'

Got me chasin'

He must be taken
(You know, you know)
I ain't hatin'
(I ain't hatin')
Cause I like shakin'
(I like shakin')
I like, move it to the left a little bit
Like getting to the middle baby
Oh, do you see me coming?
I don't want you to see me coming
I want to be up on the sneak attack
Cause I want to hit it from the back
Baby I like shakin', ooh
Baby I got you shakin'
Keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
He keeps me shakin'

She said they all just the same when she loving them
Not me, living out of pocket, I'm so done of it
The quick fix to all her broken promises
7-11 in that thing, thank you come again
All night, all pipe, she alright
I hit it once, she called twice, that's called life
That hotline bling and I'm fire slinging
She's telling all her homegirl 'bout it
It ain't no secret
Hard to shake it off when I keep shakin' babe
And I'm the man, pay per view where your patience baby?
Go rider around piper without your pipe
I kinda like her so it's a must that I change her life
Keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
He keeps me shakin'
(Keep you shakin')
Your love makin'
(My love makin')
It keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
Got me chasin'

Timbaland done lost his mind (mind)
I think I'm about to cross the line (line)
And find me somethin that soft to find (find)
And hit it cause she swing right off the vine (oh)
You better hold me back, I told you that
I got enough heat to take your corners back
And I done took your freak, you want her back
(Well you can have that hooker, hooker, hooker) (c'mon)
I'm a dirty south nigga from the VA streets (oh)
And this is how I represent over this here beat (uh huh)
And y'all don't really wanna fuck with me
I don't care what y'all say, y'all stuck with me (alright now)
Now I got the place panicin (oh)

And I might put two in the sky (uh huh)

You better hold me back (oh)
You better hold me back
Cause I'm full of shenanigans
(Oh) You better hold me back (oh)
You better hold me back (oh)
You better hold me back
Cause I'm full of shenanigans
[Verse 2 - Magoo]
Hold me back, cause rap sell more than crack
Stack my funds, my guns, take my quarters back
Don't resist I will put heat on the track
Matter of fact, we can take it off of wax
You and your team was livin the dream, somebody shake 'em
I can't hold on these dreams they won't wake 'em
Fuck face, the street is a car chase
Ew dead set, do what it take, to win the race
I erase my fear and don't reappear
I'ma go to the bar and take your beer, bitch
Nigga, I must make shit clear
Fuck around with Oo, I'll bite off your ear
You better do the same, I fight 'til your slain
On right just to bite, I'm tryna sever a vein
And I might put two in the sky
Like (da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Sucker live in fear of the day that I'm focused
Slow as he appear, it's clear I own this
Realm of Southern rap that despise to be competitive
North or northfolk, they jokes is our negligence
Sure they bounce to 112, I make a note of what sells
Down here the sign men don't promote it, look at us fail
Fuck it, I'ma just tell the truth as I perceive it
Most of them think our shit is useless, believe it
But me I got a love affair with all things Southern
The dirty is a territory y'all can't govern
We all ain't brothers, but this ain't the bitches neither
And all our rap songs ain't for bouncers drinkin either
Let me hit the reefer, 'fore I forgot to be the
Little old country white boy, get to spittin ether
Don't let this shit deceive ya, that cracker there crafty
I know you only heard me cause you have to stare at me (BITCH)

Two niggas want to smoke
So you got two lies
Think you see two hoes
Cause hoes got to smoke too
Hope you got ten yards
Cause this blunt will never due
See I remain true

No shake with my damn fries
Open your freakin' eyes

Hey, I was mean(mean)
Before I became a feen
I took over the world when they gave me a beep machine
And then I made my city jump(jump)
It's your favorite producer, come on baby let it bump(bump)
I'm like a music cyclone when I'm in the zone
I typhoon everytime I get on a song
I *tie coo?* I just went and brought another home
Who you stuntin on?
I'm never off, I set it off, and you were never on
What's there to care about? People know my whereabouts
Anywhere I want, private jet in and out
Whip brand new, you know what Tim about
Ferrari 5-99 Windows Tinted out
I-I-I'm the man m-my beats is crazy
You want my sounds, you gotta pay me
But don't get it confused, never had no silver spoon
But you got a long walk, tryna fit Timbaland's shoes
And next up(I believe that's me)
And what's your name(D.O.E
on the M-I-C)
And where you from(NYC, we up in here G)
Why don't you get on the mic for the symphony?
(D.O.E.)
Ok, ok when you see me roll through(Yup)
Got the whole crew Timbaland he produce
If you a fruit, Produce
Riding in a old school(pimpen) like I'm poss to
She french kiss my d*** and then I told her Merci buques
(Put it in the bag) Nah baby I ain't Fab
When I f*** ya it's a wrap, I'ma put you in the cab
Better be happy I rap, if I wasn't I'd be strapped with the(mass)
and I..and I'm coming for your stash
When I find out where you at I'll be(shimmying ya lock)
Get the f*** up outta ya baby, you betta(gimme what you got)
Wit you **** money **** money ****money ****money
Lying like there's no money(Uhhh) Gotta go money
Pockets feeling drained then it's back to snatching chains and I
(Wish a n***a run up on me, he gon find the heat, and make the wrong move)
I ain't changed, still the same
D.O.E be the name, I'm from North Side Queens
Next up(Ha, hey I believe that's me)
And what's ya name(Bran' Nu a.k.a Brandy)
And where you from(Mississippi but was raised in Cali)
Why don't you get on the mic for the symphony?
(Bran' Nu)
I got it, I got it(Ha)
It's been a long time comin'
I'm back like I forgot something important
Can't have a problem with me
I fade it to black like church slacks
Now I'm in the Range, no Cadillac
So you don't want it with me
I'm on the tip of your tongue like bubble gum
I got your head sprung
It's my return(Like the Kingdom Come)
I'm taking off like a rocket
I got this beat in my pocket
I keep your heart droppin(and you...)
Never gonna hold me back, Timbo put me on the map
Now you wanna say I act(Brand New)
Just like my Proda boots, struttin like a model do
Don't you wish you had another(Chance to)
Get up under my skin, frontin' like you g-g-g-get it
You keep runnin ya mouth like them broads do
I gotta learn you, like a school do
Cuz clearly you don't have a clue
So next up(Yeah, hey I believe that's me)
And what's ya name(Attitude on the M-I-C)
And where you from(Alabama we up in here G)
Why don't you get on the mic for the symphony...
(Attitude)
Ok, ****(not understandable)
Never mediocre
Plenty bread so you know I gotta keep a toasta
On my side b***h ride unless she a Oprah
B***h I'm too fly to drive, I'ma need a chauffeur
I get a whole lot of h*** like a G supposed ta
They could put me in the FED for what's in my sofa
Rap **** wack slap em if they say ya hard
Diss me, I'll up the ratchet on you and your AandR
I know they mad never thought that it could happen
Got my **** on then I hopped in a Austan
Every check I cash in, bigger than the last one
Met a new freak, she thicker than the last one
Nah, I don't love her homey, MUSIC is my passion
I don't show compassion
And all my B***hs yellin I'm the s***, even when nobodies askin
Boy I'm on fire like the **** at the ****in
That's why I stay so gone playa
F*** *****in up the ozone laya
I drop a hit everytime I got some s*** to say,

Why you always askin' me why I talk like that?
What, you think you betta, nigga, cuz your pockets are fat?
Excuse me? But wasn't I the one that you meant?
You talkin' trash to these niggas about to dent up they whip
You know me and I don't think I have to explain
You that same crotty nigga that fucked that bitch in my Range
It was the same, life, it was talked up a good game
Between that money and that pussy that she claim to fame
[Timbaland]
Look at you, talkin'-tellin' all the bullcrap lies
It was you who made me put my hands on your thighs
Never ever was the one that humped that girl on your Rover
You forgot your baby cousin humped that girl on your Rover
It's Timbaland, baby, I don't get down like that
Don't try to explain, get yo ass to the back
Never ever disrepsect the man that put you on his team
Now baby dove, get the keys to your Beem'
[1: Timbaland]
Why you talkin' big trash to me?
[Bassy]
Cuz you always playin' games, Timothy
[Timbaland]
Why you tryin' to make me mad, ba-be
[Bassy]
Cuz you always playin' games, Timothy
[Timbaland]
Why you talkin' big trash to me?
[Bassey]
Cuz you always playin' games, Timothy
[Timbaland]
Why you tryin' to make me mad, ba-be
[Bassey]
Because you always playin' games with Bassy
[Bassey]
I done met many players that act like you
Think because they spend some money that I'm ready to screw
Instead of talkin' 'Hit me up around the 1st and the 5th'
Cuz you rot in a crumbed out six, you think I'm whipped
Got numerous niggas that be rottin' my shit
And the last thing I need is a nigga for kicks
I stay dibbed and forever spend the louchie on Gucci
Fuck the money and diamonds cuz nigga, I'm still shinin'
[Timbaland]
Look at you, girl, talkin' trash
Talkin' trash, actin' grown, show your ass
Don't try to get on my track and clown
You my queen, my mistress, my Jackie Brown
Why you tryin' to start trouble in my can?
Now hot and angry and I'm getting amped
Keep on givin' me the cold shoulder
Now I got to get the keys to the Roller
You gone
[1]
[Bassey]
It was all for the paper, that's right, all for the love
Only wanted most what ghetto girls dream of
I need the Hummers and the yachts, Don P on the rocks
Cardierre wrist wear with the shivel on top
Then you lace me, now you hate me, now you tryin' to replace me
Had a woman when you dated me, I guess I was crazy (know you was crazy)
Tried to play me but your game's a little lazy
Cuz I hooked up and got with your man, nigga scrammed
[Timbaland]
Girl, what you know about Cardi and wrist wear?
When you don't even wear Vic's Underwear
Think before you start talkin' shit
Remember, I'm the man with the diamonds and whips
I ain't tryin' to beg, but a legend like those speedos
I ain't gon get mad if you hump one of my people
I keep tellin' you this is me you talkin' to
Talkin' trash won't get you nowhere, baby boo

I shoulda known she liked him all along (yo)

[Chorus]
Talking on the phone (talking on the phone)
Gotta get your own (you gotta get your own man)
Leave my man alone (and leave my man alone)
Callin' him on the phone
[Kelly - Verse Two]
Don't hate a girl, cuz they too slick
They smile in my face, all on my man's (ohh...ficky ficky)
You don't know what, what I've been through

To come meet me in space
Now could yall sing that for me again
That first verse
[Kelly]

[Alien voice]
How do yall like space? (wah wah wah wah)

If you can feel me
So I need Kelly to sing the second verse for me
[Kelly]
Don't hate a girl, cuz they too slick
They smile in my face, all on my man's (ohh...ficky ficky)
You don't know what, what I've been through
I get it first, then I do it (what she doin' girl)
You
Talking on the phone (say what)

Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-talking on the phone (say what, yea)
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-talking on the phone (yea, say what, yo yo yo yo yo)
Talking on the phone (I'm feeling quite good right now)
Talking on the phone (but it's time for me to take my spaceship to another
level)
Talking on the phone (cuz right now I dont think the world is ready for
Timbaland)
Ta-ta-talking on the phone (I'm on that next level, can you dig it)
Ta-ta-talking on the phone (can you dig it)
Ta-ta-talking on the phone (I don't think so)

(Timbaland)
Everyone know I'm a beast when it comes to these beats you can copy me but

You can sample my drum kicks and my snare, make yo beat and it compares
(nigga, that shit ain't gone work)
You can borrow my MP even hire Jimmy D to engineer for you
(nigga, that shit ain't gone work)
You can get to CD to Bill if you get any kinda deal still
(nigga, that shit ain't gone work)
I been makin that fire before some of you was alive check the archive
(nigga, that shit ain't gone work)
Forget it if I did a beat and let it come out wit yo name on the credits
(nigga, that shit ain't gone work)

I'm tired of folks takin me for a joke, I'm bout to get my duct tape and my rope
Don't be surprised if somebody get choked

Keep on playin them games, we gone start sprayin them thangs
We ain't comin to complain somebody gone get hurt

(nigga, that shit ain't gone work)
I hate to repeat myself, you look like you need a lil' help but even when you get it

(nigga, that shit ain't gone work)
(CHORUS)
(Magoo)
You can pay a hooker money put a gun to her head for the pussy but

You can take a time machine to my past kill my mom before my birth

If you know I'm finna kill ya get the F-B-I for protection
(nigga, that shit ain't gone work)
Get a face job, that'll make you look like me but you can't write like me

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh, yeah
Yo, uh, yeah, yo...
Aiyyo, this I'll make ya head hurt
When the hawk take the day off
I make the lead work, I'll put you in the red dirt
Ice make 'em look like stars, they comin' through
On the bikes, but they look like cars, it's somethin' new
and Jada talk soo good, but 'cha brain is
Nowhere next to ready for this stainless
It's no helpin' you when them thangs melt in you
and way down in Athens, Jada's a bell ringer
I'ma bring the hood to the farm
Bless 'em with some purple hay
Remove the wood from the barn
Introduce them to the yak and cranberry
and make sure Bubba Spark good, then I'm gone
Even if we run the war, I'ma still run the raw
You can come and see me, I got 'em for twenty-four
Double R and Beat Club, who hard as us?
R3: In The "R" We Trust, c'mon

Uh, uh...
Boy, silly if you saw them crackers ridin' with them pigs
and thought I might would hit this robe for less than twenty-five a gig
Doin' sixty-five, I sled off acid and shitty bourbon
Took a minute to adjust, but right now this big shit is workin'
I'm white just by chance, but I'm country by God's graces
Nowadays I find myself doin' laundry in odd places
But still, I keep it Bubba even into Mr
Kiss and them
Brought 'em down to Athens, let 'em cut with my sister's friend
Now we gettin' blist again, back on the block in Yonkers
and Tim done laced a track, man this shit is hot as bonkers
Kiss, not to flaunt ya, but just tell 'em Bed has come here
I'm doin' for my family, but y'all are really done here
But Bubba is the truth and perhaps this is discussion
Of wither I'm that deal or a product of Tim's percussion
Y'all know to him is bustin', so just dap me up and frown on
Me and Kiss is necessary, that much you can count on, yeah
[Timbaland]
Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready
They don't know know

[Bubba Sparxxx]
How did him and Bubba rise from this dirt and this cow feces?
To show you folks the hope for this changin' shall be me
Notice how he see, the picture for it's painting
and poured you up of this mixture before it was tainted
See I was rydin' ruff only when me and D became aquatinted
and I pledge to maintain it, be damned if I'ma change it
This shit is anus, ain't it? Fuck 'em, Kiss bring it home
I ryde or die with Beat Club, won't bend for the sake of this song
[Jadakiss]
The streets is still mine, I stay with the still nine
and it's still long and if I'm stronger than corn like I pinkeyed
Niggaz pretend to be weeded, that's what the industry needed
Kiss flippin' his flow, enemies heated
But we gon' let the gats pop
From the old rifles on the dirt road to the handguns on the blacktop
Don't get the plot wrong, this ain't a black or white politic thing
Cocksucker, it's a hot song
[Timbaland]
Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready

Time has come
hey girl
Take it to the back of the club
don't take it the wrong way
I've been checking that ass
and if you give me the chance
I ain't gon' play
I really wanna getta know ya
that's what I told ya
girl you know I don't play
I wanna put it in ya Ow!
You better do what the song say
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Move that ass before you throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Move that ass before you throw it on me
I got so many broads
Like cars different two or three in the same day
I wanna park my
Walk in the park with a spark
With the same damn thing
So many chickens
And they callin' my name all night

God damn baby
Niggas just hate me
cause the girls wanna throw they thing on me
like it's okay!
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Move that ass before you throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Move that ass before you throw it on me
From the look at that ass
you probably a gold digger
but I ain't Kanye
Babygirl you on the right track
but you goin' the wrong way
And when we're through with the party
girl I got a game that we gon' play
And by tomorrow I'll be on the highway
Hey!
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Move that ass before you throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Ah just throw it on me
Move that ass before you throw it on me</field>

(*female voice - moaning*)
Yeah (*echo*)
[Verse 1 - Timbaland]
Now here I go, Timbaland will never bring the same old flow
When the game was mold
I'ma hold my own, look at these women they wanna sing my song
While they sing my song
And they say my name, look at they ready to go and play my games
I'ma pick the one and say it ain't no thing
I'ma get the one that wanna drop that thing
Can you top that thing?
I'ma ride or die, ride through the corners like who am I
Shorty I'm the one with the pump on five (*gunshot*)
This is America, can you jump that high?
Girl show it to me ...
[Chorus - Timbaland] + (Female voice)
I see you backside, pokin through your coat
Come here girl let me take your coat
Now I want you drop it to the floor
And she say
(I'm genuine baby)
Go head baby
(I'm genuine baby)
Go head baby, OH, let me see that throwback baby
OH, let me see that throwback baby
(I'm genuine baby)
Go head baby
(I'm genuine baby)
Go head baby, OH, let me see that throwback baby
OH, let me see that throwback baby
[Verse 2 - Timbaland]
Now shorty take your time
I'ma sip Hennessey while you taste that wine
'Til we both feel fine
Well I, I think I really wanna stay for a while
Bring some of your friends and we can play for a while
Like hide and go get, and when I get you deny
Make you turn around and put them hips in the sky
Fucklin the ways I wanna hit 'til I'm tired
And you could stick around, we can dip for the night
Timbaland, just a man on the go
When we gonna meet again, I just don't know
But I'ma have to stay for the show
I think I wanna see you take the stage once mo'
While I say (say ...)
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Magoo]
I knew I cut real hard, this the fifteenth song
And your man pagin you, he know you doin somethin wrong
Girl take a X pill, drink a little yak
Eat two power bars, I'ma hit it from the back
My dick is like a Tech 9, you gon' respect mine
I need some top piece, blow me 'til that head shine
Oo never cums, that's why she must fuck me
I hit it 49 states, next Kentucky
So take off your coat, take off your throwback
I ordered some ooze and ate of your toe back
Make your ass clap, make your pussy snap
So deep, so wet, my dick's swimmin laps
Make your ass clap, make your pussy snap
So deep, so wet, my dick's swimmin laps
Perhaps we can menage to jazz
I like blonde hair chicks, like candy ass
[Chorus]

I gotta get keep my eye on her, she ain't no walk in the park
I offered this but she want that, she she - she want it all
You see she wanted to paint the picture and say she my broad
I got a little tip from the word on the block, People saying i shouldn't get involved,
But i didn't judge or try to change it, Cause you are who you are...
I'm like the drug she's addicted to me, She can't leave me now
she always making plans to date, Come and find me tomorrow - goodbye girl...
-Chorus-
She's too invested in the hours that pass her by,
I'd pay attention if i thought it was worth the time,
I tell her easy but her hands they find a way,
Confusing passion for the love we never gave,
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance,
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past,
I tell her easy but her hands they find a way,
Confusing passion for the love we never gave...
I couldn't get rid of shorty if i wanted, 'Cause she was down but
i was tired of playin' the role, like i ain't know that she get around, Something 'bout this girl fascinates me,
She's the type that like to hang with the stars,
The way she makes me feel it sedates me,
Who knew we would take it this far...
Everywhere that i try to go, she got a wanted poster with my face on it,
Soon as i walk out the door, there it is, Wanted poster up with my face on it,
Can't blame myself when it's not - my fault,Cause nothing is
promised - at least i can say i was honest..
Goodbye girl

Timothy cuz such a waste
Timothy we found your spaceship
Timothy it's the farthest you've ever flown
Put your lighters up
Put your lighters up ya'll (ya'll)
Put your lighters up
This the Timothy song if ya don't bout me
Ya they call me Tim
Va's phenomenon
I kill em all winter
Until the summer come
From just another name
All the way to number one
And I'm simply the best
When it's all said and done
Remember when me and Magoo
Was tryin to make a meal
Well we did
And years later we got it still
Gave you my bio
Under construction 1 and 2
Hundred percent genuine
That was from me to you
I'm makin moves while they ridicule
I'm like a warm summer breeze in the swimmin pool
I'm cool
I never kept it basic
I been so many places
Been gettin money
Since them honeys had them small faces
So many little me's
I can hear small traces
But I just ignore it
Cuz I'm too big for it
And I can hear 'em screamin (screamin)
Timothy where have you been
It's not what it seems but it is
Timothy where have you been
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy where have you been
I been in Athens, Georgia by way of Bubba Sparxx
When the nights was bright
And all the days was dark
But now they all bright
Everything is all right
If you assumin life was wonderful
Then you alright
I got a bad wife
3 beautiful kids
I make the world dance
Ya look what I done did
Here's for Jay-Z
Nelly Furtado
Catch up
Ya'll slow
Escargot
Nelly your 14 mil
Where's Fargo?
I brought a airplane
F*ck I need a car for?
Ask Justin Timberlake is Timbaland great
Ya'll gotta deal wit me
No handshake
Stand up N*gga
Rather have a stand off
Wit the law before I let 'em say I ran off
And I can hear 'em screamin
Timothy where have you been
Its not what it seems but it is
Timothy where have you been
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy where have you been
Hey some say I run away
But really I never left
They wonder where I been
But they can never guess
I been around the world
Here to the other side
And I successfully achieved
What all those others tried
Carry my city on my back
Like a crucifix
For more than a decade
Cuz I can do this sh*t
A lot of people want my spot
But I don't hesitate
The track label by legacy
Won't appreciate
I stand strong
Everything I put my hands on
Me and Mr
I-Be
Cuz ain't no I in team
Cuz I can hear 'em sayin
Timothy where have you been
Its not what it seems but it is
Timothy where have you been
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy where have you been
Timothy where have you been
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Where have you been
Timothy where have you been</field>

[Nas] Yea yea, Brave-hearts
[Tim] Guess what y'all? Check it
Verse One: Nas
I, splash y'all dudes with gats I use
Ice dangle off my chest cause my cash improve
Nice knuckle game, chip-toothed, way of buck and change
I want the dough, fuck the fame
Already made history, y'all can have that, that ain't shit to me
About to have my own Ascap, and that's that
And plus a rotisserie, instead of Kenny Rogers
and Benihana's, y'all can eat, plenty at Nas'
Buffet of lobsters, dressed in Esco' boxers
With honies that sex so proper, best flow since Rakim
Liver, personification of drama
Describe my, characteristics, murder co-signer
Some will smoke embalmin fluid and vomit to it
I'm straight chronic, yo it's atomic how I blew up
Same ol' G, since I rocked Kangol's, Lee's
Nothin changed but my bankroll, still jig to the ankles
Chorus: Nas
Please, to my niggaz
To my bitches, to my gangsters
To my riders, to my niggaz
To my bitches, to my niggaz
To my riders, to my gangsters
To my bitches, to my niggaz
And fly assholes, to my niggaz
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'
[Mad Skillz]
Yo, yo, we rippin tracks, it's like beatin beats with bats
Watchin crews change the views when the heat in they back
If you hear a click, trust me, you wouldn't hear clack
If you push it up front, I got no choice, but to pull it back
Your rhymes don't faze me, I'm above em; half y'all raps is
born retarded, now you out here tryin to get rid of em
You should be sick of it, I posess no flaws
That's from the man that made your Head Nod til you Lick-ed his Balls
Verses I spit em, when it's my turn to get em, I got hot flows
I only do shows for burn victims
So cock this mic, and bust out your back, kill you
And then they gonna blame me for fuckin up rap
Who's fuckin with that? Skillz and Esco', it's on
When you speak in my direction, watch your tone
From Q-B to V-A, can't count the blocks we own
It's locked and sewn I repeat nigga, watch your tone
Chorus
[Timbaland]
Yo commmmmme see
The big man with the diamonds and the fly Bentleys
Ladies loooooovve me; niggaz say
"Timbaland's really rappin, what the fuck is up B?"
Jeallllllousy
I kill niggaz with seven thangs, most they jackin beats
I'm a eight digit niiggy
Maybe I just rebuild Titanic and send that out to see
What?

(Timbaland)
Broken promises, broken weddin vows
It's hard looking down, no not even
(Crack a smile 2x)
How can I support a child? Last time I had a job
It's been awhile, the questions that remains so
freely
Why does that (happen to me 2x)
To wash away the pain, (I'm drinking 2x)
(Chad)
I waited for the that day, together we can find
another way back
But everything we've got at stake, let's worry about today and put tomorrow in the bottle.
If there's some way that we can take back, the wrong that we've created
We can change that, don't turn your head the other
way
You're gonna save today, but tomorrow in the bottle
Let's put tomorrow in the bottle (8x)
Pack it up, seal it up, close (the deal 2x)
(Timbaland)
Girl you ain't right, I apologize
Don't be satisfied, to what we had was gone away
Every other day we cuss we fight and two wrongs don't make right
You had my head gone, I did you dead wrong
Singin that same old song, wonderin why you mad (at me 2x)
Now you understand my lingo, we still gon'be people
Baby this is how it should be, I knew you'd be like that
You was sposed to have my back
Now we both don't know how to act, Once I leave the door at my baby back
(Chad)
I waited for the that day, together we can find
another way back
But everything we've got at stake, let's worry about today and put tomorrow in the bottle.
If there's some way that we can take back, the wrong that we've created
We can change that, don't turn your head the other
way
You're gonna save today, but tomorrow in the bottle..
Let's put tomorrow in the bottle (8x)
Pack it up, seal it up, close (the deal 2x)
All I Wanna do is makeup
(Timbaland)
Said I never thought that all that the love we had
would go away
Now there's nothing left that you can say
That's the way shit gonna be the same
Cuz my back against the wall
Now the conclusion to the story is the same
I was your bread and butter, like I put you on
Now that I want that loving back,
Why's relationship so gone like we estabilished the fact
That you was wrong from the get, how am I sposed to fly in my ex
From Tallahasee and back, when a girl is scared of
heights
Said have you seen them jets, now put her in the back
When the first class got delayed the snacks, people can blame my past
People can kiss my ass, I'm at a loss for words
Chad gon' singin the rest
(Chad)
I waited for the that day, together we can find
another way back
But everything we've got at stake, let's worry about today and put tomorrow in the bottle.

Don't know why, but girl
I'm feeling close to you
Maybe is this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these stars been dancing on my head
Too long, too long, too long
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong
Didn't I seem like I'm catching something?
That's because it's true
I can't deny it and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by you
And I won't hide it anymore
A crowded room everywhere
A million people around all I see is you
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in the crowded room
But my camera lenses
Only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear
It becomes so clear, it becomes so clear

Now that I know the truth, what am I suppose to do?
Changing up and breaking all my rules
Ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything is extra in the background
Just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun
Didn't I seem like I'm catching something?
That's because it's true
I can't deny it and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
'Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore
A crowded room anyywhere
A million people around, all I see is you
And that everything just disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lenses
Only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear
Becomes so clear, becomes so clear

even though you think it wont
So why rock a boat and make waves
And everything,s coming okay
So why am I confused if you love me
Thought this would be smooth sailing
Cause I don,t wanna let you go
and we,re caught in the undertow
Cause I ain,t losing my control
And we,re caught in the undertow
I hold the prayer is all our own
but we need air we go alone
cause I don,t wanna let you go
til we,re caught in the undertow
I don,t wanna cry every time we try it never fails
Change the illusion wanna be close set for sail
My hearts in your hand don,t you go hurt me again
all we got is one chance and its sink or swim
So why rock a boat and make waves

why am I confused if you love me

We gone show you how we party
[Timberland] Up jumps the boogie (repeat 3X)
(repeat 4X)
Verse One: Magoo
I feel for all beats like girls jump for tricks
Don't sult the next man, keep that Lindberg hit
Up in the cut, like barbers in hair cut
I'm black with Indian, my race should be mut
I cut wit razorblades play spades wit unvenus
A value with this rap take heed a freakin genious
Up in tha sky, up high, don't puff lie
Do you smoke crack Sam prepare you gonna die
Bump Crazy Joe, my name is Crazy Flow
You thought I had eight, but I got ten mo'
Off beat and on beat, old school like Beat Street
I stink like Pop's feet, make sweat wit no heat
Verse Two: Timberland
I'm up on this track like Pam Grier in movies
I heats up the beat like water in a jacuzzi
I fly to L.A
then come back to Virginia
Then call Maganoo to see he's got some indo
Then back to the crib to pick up my brother, G
G don't forget to bring the house keys
Hops in the jeep, five-o now here we go
Please, please brother don't slam my car doe
It costs too much money to get that shit fixed
I need all my money to pay my bills with
Don't have no time, for the shuckin and jivin
Peep my rhyme, cut that ass off timin
Verse Three: Missy
I'm in the Marriott, the place to get dot
After I smoke pot, he sticks me like shots
Funky like farts, connect tongues like dots
Lick his lollipop, this kid named Scott
Me my hot self, my self be so hot
Touch my hot spot, I scream till I can't stop
Uhhhhhhhhhhhh (What, what?)
Give it to me daddy and
Uhhhhhhhhhhhh (What, what?)
Yup, yup like Teddy
Teddy ready with tha one two checka
No diggity, Missy be tha bedroom recka
Double decka, make you wanna beat your pecker
And then leave yo bitch, cuz this uhhhh be betta
Chorus: everybody
Keep it up
Up jumps the boogie the boogie jumps the beat
Up jumps the boogie the boogie jumps the beat
(repeat 3X)
We gone show you how we party
(repeat 2X)
Verse Four: Magoo
Prepare to get wet like Jheri curl juice
You short can't reach the top, I might give you a boost
I bump like acne, take honey from a bee
My style is like a safe, I swallowed the master key
I gas, cause I'ma fart, don't paint, but make art
Like black and white people, I'm splittin rap apart
So sit you bleadin dog and bow to my hit
Nitwit you stupid, I'm butter don't need grit
Make fits like seizure, my knowledge feeds a
study then read a, follow the leader
Like Jews n' Chinese, I own your rap lease
The wackness must cease, prepare for yo' release
Verse Five: Timberland
I'm up in these labels tryin to handle my business
Been makin more beats before Jehovah had witness
Up jumps da boogie da boogie jumps the beat
Brother, brother please, turn on the TV
See a black man dead from a white man's powder
See a white man scared from a black man's power
Back to reality, please don't freakin smile at me
This is a stick-up, so give up yo' wallet please
Verse Six: Missy
I'm tha best and that's me and I'm capital
I hang on like testicles
MC's wanna copy these many flows, hoe, betta back up
Foe you get slapped up, back up and go tell mommy
that I backed up you, you you you you and yo whole crew
What whatcha whatcha gone do
Uhhhhhhhh what whatcha gone do, to me
The M-I-double S-Y-E
Run it back to me
It's gonna be some tragedy

I had to have him when he walked through the door
(Wait a minute)
She was 'bout to drive me insane
She come with drama while I'm giving her chains
(Wait a minute)
I'm focused but I'm losing control
He only wants me for my body zone
(Wait a minute)
Girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money
Can't even call a player back
(Wait a minute)
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking you get it just like that?
(Wait a minute)
Minding my business, I was doing my thing
Got my attention, so I gave him a chance
(Wait a minute)
Did I mention he was buying a bar?
Gave him my number, he was trying so hard
(Wait a minute)
Bought me some things I didn't want, didn't need
Dropped down his jeans like I'm supposed to drop to my knees
(Wait a minute)
He been blowing up my phone like he know me
Been leaving messages "You know what you owe me"
(Wait a minute)
Girl, why you do me like that?

Why you be bugging?
Like I'm some kind of hoe
Got no more questions and I want you to go
So break (Break)
Hey, let me talk to you for a minute
Shut up...shut up
I love the way you strut
Girl, you already know
But, I'm feeling like you don't want me
You just after my dough
Baby, please, I'm fine

Chasing dreams not diamond rings
So don't call me no more

Timbaland never walk in a place
He can’t walk out of
Gettin’ rude in the place
With a gun in my waist
I just might pop out slugs
With a straight arm
Bullets stomp through your phat farm till the animals jump out of
No justifications
While my song question like that jigga what?
I’m the cause that the thugs gon’ fight
In the club so tight, y’all ky’d up
Sometimes I fall, on cars I just hop right up
With the drop top and the top dropped
And your mouth drops like
"what the {fuck? }"
Only deal with conjunction chicks
When I’m looking to hit
They give me butt
Now who da man, say timbaland!

Jack your car, jack your ice
Jack your house, jack your life
Rock ma with a bud tonight
You can have the fame, gimme your loot
All your tools, all your jewels
Mag a fool

High from penicillin
Not willing to pass out till y’all cash out
With a mask out man i’mma break the bank
Drive through town in an army tank

Sebastian so south that my house got candy doors
Man I’ll pop a grown chick to mandy moore
Far from a 6-1 clique dropping yours
Slowmo, chrome wheels still riding fourth
Keep chicks stationary like I’m leaving on tour
Palms grip a snub nose I ain’t leaving poor
(whoa! boy give me more)
See I be dippin’ and poppin’ the top and
These fools clockin’ and blockin’
These ladies lovin’ the dough
My youngins lovin’ the flow
South boys back on the roll
Ladies get back on the floor
Fellas keep throwin’ them bowls
This how a party should go

[Timbaland]
You see? I think it's time for me put it down..
.
for my females, hahah
I'ma let my females shine on this track
You see? I ain't biased
I ain't racist either
So I'ma let uhh.
Mocha bring it in
[Mocha]
The one boss bitch, not on that horse shit
Honey I wanna score with, money, I'm all for it
Speak the raw shit, they on the floor quick
Prepare to be surprised, if you think I'm a poor chick
Got off the wall shit, who could be more thick?
Plus I can flip, rough-up, or flatten out, four bricks
As for the mic, I can break flow out, or either bless em
My style is my own, and a shorty, can't test it
So y'all - ramble on, I'ma get my gamble on
Ceram' handle-arm, while y'all scramble on
Want to battle? It's on, I'll take you on anywhere
I'll take you on a bus, on a boat, or up in the air
I'll take you on with the gat, I'll take you on on the track
I'll take yo' ass on a trip, and you never come back
Though this a freestyle, these styles ain't free
When I'm done, better believe, they got a PILE for me
Chorus: Timbaland and Babe Blue (repeat 2X)
What cha know about this, ha? You don't know
Lemme show you bout this, ha? We gon' blow
We don't go without hits, ha? Get the dough
You can never doubt this, ha? Ha?
[Mocha]
Y'all go 'head and yap on, I'ma keep rap strong
Talk but don't act on what you rap on (say what?)
I speak facts to beat clacks, and lead tracks
Heed that, relax, feedback? Keep that
Bet-ta ease back, never see me slack
Break your kneecaps - then, have you do three laps
Tryin to see this half a mil, y'all - dingy stacks
for - weed in sacks, tote - ki's to crack
Wonder why they can't keep they eyes off me?
Y'all chicks ain't 8, I'm a dime plus 3
Got a 6? I got a stack
Got a whip? I got a jet
Got a clip? I got a tec
That's why you not a threat
Wanna know how you could be down too?
Can not do, make em say "ahhh, oohh"
Been through it, put too much into it
And writin so long, I ran out of pen fluid
Chorus {except last line}
[Timbaland] Babe Blue
[Babe Blue]
Y'all chicks assed out, Babe Blue's here
Shook out your mind, cause my debut's near
All y'all demo chicks see me when you master yours
I surpass you whores, then I smash your broads
Shorty, don't get your hopes high, praise the most high
Babe Blue, livin loca
I crush all those, small hoes, what?
My go-to-the-store clothes is better than your wardrobe
You ain't seein mine, I walk right in the club
You one of them chicks that be in line
Me? Studded out, ice flooded out
Bitch you ain't nice - please, cut it out
Bronx to the death, we gon' spit raw
Timbaland got beats, what you talkin shit for?
Forget yours, Moch' and Blue, comin through
Bystorm, Z Man, tell me what you gon' do?
Chorus
[Timbaland] It ain't over!
[Babe Blue]
Y'all chicks talk a lot, now you wanna hate me?
Moch' and Blue, Cagney and Lacey
Start the biddin wars at 1.2
We gonna show all of y'all what one joint do
You wanna get the third degree, cause you never heard of me?
See thugs murder me, deep blood burgundy?
Hell nah, see I'm tryin to get my mail ma
But y'all chicks didn't know, so I had to tell y'all
Chorus

I'm the Lil' Man, join with the Timbaland
People walkin' around sayin' to theyself "Damn!"
People can't realize who the fuck who I am
I'm like the VCR tech they call bad
People don't know what they gonna see next
They might see Timbaland with Funkmaster Flex
Or doin' a duet with the group called Beck
Or back in the studio gettin', gettin' sex
[Timb] I'm the ill nigga that loves Chips Ahoy
[Lil' Man] Timbaland where you at?
[Timb]
Here I go boy, I got yo' back with a Tec 9
You see them niggas creepin', what?

Never, ever step over my toe (nah nah)
I got that nigga (what what)
>From the "V", Static, where you at?
[Static]
Here I go, if ya pearlin' in a 'lac, then turn that shit up
If ya chillin' at the club, then tear the party up
And if you got shove, let it bump bump
Not speakin' for yo' cheddah, but I keep mine in lumps
Nigga, my momma taught me that, can't sneak me from the back
So I found her chasing cheese, so I watch for dirty rats
See I'm wise like the guys, and smart like the streets
See I be rollin' blunts while Timb' be makin' them beats, Timbaland

Come on Timbaland, and gimme some of that liquor

Are you drunk? (Yes, I'm drunk)
Are you pump? (Yes, I'm pump)
Do you wanna see the party get chrump?
(Yes, I pump)
This ain't nuthin' but a party (Say what?)
After the party (Where ya goin'?)
Hearty, I gotta make my way back to the crib
I forgot I was on probation (Yeah that shit is real)
But ain't nuthin' gon' happen to me
Magoo, finish it baby
[Magoo]
Ha ha, yeah
One more again from VA
Yes, your southern representative
Keep two Tecs in my Lex, cuz I'm sensitive
All my competition stop wishin' for my demise
Cuz I'm hard like my dick, we'll ever be on the rise
Get between some thighs, and fuck until I'm stuck
Order the main course, four bitches, I'm serving duck
How da fuck you payin' a bitch just to fuck?
If a bitch want money for me, pray for luck
Only thing I love is weed and big cash
If yo' ass ain't a check, nigga kiss my ass
Leavin' freaky bitches in stitches, cuz hoe's be envious
Me and Timbaland still friends and will continuous
Oh, what a web we weave
When I achieved to fuck the baddest bitch you niggaz them ever seen
Possible, if you got game they blaze a zing
Pockets of rubbers, bitches go rump with just my name
Repeat 1
Repeat 1

This is how we do it
We make it ride on through

Putta dick on tha lips top it doggie style, she my homie gal

Keep you lookin jig', your nails to precision
Got your girls jealous, to be you them chicks wishin

Chorus: Timbaland (repeat 2X)

Now what you want? Prada, Escada, you got that
The way the one's stack ain't no way that you can stop that
You in the way girl? Boom when I block that
Treated your physique like a beat and I rock that
You got your Hustle? I ain't tryin to Knock that
Drop carats and the ring, make sure the rock's fat
You can rise, but you ain't tryin to stop that
You'd think I had the keys Boo the way I locked that
Oh that's your man? I think it's time to drop that
Lay it off, play it off, yeah you get the props back
You get the dress, I get the cane and the top hat
After we done Boo, I let you run the clock back
Fallin in love? Oh never not that
Who you know who control where they gettin jocked at?
And in Vegas I'm hittin it up like a slot rack
If you think you runnin game girl you need to botch that
Chorus
[Mad Skillz]
Now when you came in the door, I seen you before
A dime, fine all the way to the core
Thick enough to make a nigga drop to the floor
Talked in your ear til my throat got sore
Lames, she could see my game was straight raw
Specially since she bought my tape right out the store
She was like, "Ain't you 'sposed to be out on tour?"
"Since you ain't tryin to go Boo, what you askin for?"
Need I say more, from the 8-oh-4
If you placin bets girl, then you best be sure
Slick, if you sick, then I got the cure
Chrome spinnin, we winnin Boo, check the score
Filthy rich, I like to dress like I'm four
Have the chicks fightin like the next World War
Sure, yo you never treat em like a whore
Like Jay said, "Love it or hate it, eith-er or"
Chorus
[Timbaland]
Uhh, what, uh huh
What, like that, what
Timbaland, what
Mad Skillz, uhh
Collabo', what
Don't go, baby
Don't go, baby baby
Don't go

Come on

One question,
Who be the thug that y'all love most?
Or give a toast to this freestyle drug dose
The thug muscle
So whistle if you hear clear
Gon' get you close and yous a dead man like last year
See most fear
The marvelous, alias
You dare discuss and get yo muthafuckin' head crushed
These slugs bust the most wanted when they just appointed
I stomp dogs and leave em froze because you know you fronted
Too many MC's not clearly on this hype tip
I'll fuck yo mic and catch you later on some snipe shit
Extended clips I represent because my thugs trip
Easy boy, I'm stompin' corners where them drugs flip
Ali Baba snakin' lakin' trustin' north shit
You catch a grip or leave a don to climb the night hits
It's mob official
You test I'll leave you knock-knissued
Bandaged up like a snitch 'cause I ain't fuckin' with you
Straight up, we bringin' it

What y'all, huh huh, V-A
Know about this
What y'all in Hampton, huh huh
Know about this
What y'all in p-town
Know about this
What y'all in Hoviay
Know about this

Check it out
I'm ya p-town hit man
I'll make ya shit man
Pay my stick man to do my dirt
I'm filthy rich man
My thugs always hang around the top dog of all dogs
Make em pick locks and spit glocks until you shit rocks
I told you that I'm project strong
You took me wrong and learned that thorough cats don't last long
Alias the Don
I leave it messy like I'm Joseph Pesci
Don't fuck around, you ever test me and you'll have to wet me
I'm ghetto fabulous
The mob crush the Lord just, never be discussed
When there's dirt involved, niggas leave the mouth closed to hush
I rush club scenes like, "What?"
Always carryin' the bust
The reason why, these niggas that ruck ain't had enough
I hate to peel ya cabbage back, or bitch-slap
'Cause otherwise you wouldn't quit that, to kidnap
So what I'm sayin' is, everybody's real within the game
Alias be the fame, so you don't know my name, nigga what

What y'all V-A
Know about this
What y'all in Hampton, what
Know about this
What y'all in Nomo
Know about this
What y'all in Chesapeake
Know about this
Bring it boy

See I told y'all motherfuckers that my clique roll deep
AK's and street sweeps gunnin' down in ya peeps
44's and Calico, Pretty Ricky and Low
Thugs know
The real on how I let shit go
But if it's real, my niggas hold a forty and fill
Mass grills, body armor, niggas trained to kill
I'm at the point of no return, so I let shells spill
Vinny Rush, Crazy JJ and Mush must chill
And Killa K and Johnny Hesh steady aimin' that steel
Shit's for real, my nigga P and Mike might peel
They get the gats and crazy stuff my brother love the ghetto tugs
And set on top of niggas what let's straight wet the party up
ESP was in the cut my rootin black, pull it up
Is that enough?
Y'all niggas still fail to call my bluff?
And yet I told you, when left back can't nobody knows you
I suppose you
Woulda kept your mouth closed like I told you

What y'all in V-A
Know about this- I told you
What y'all in Nomo, what
Know about this, what</field>

You can't fool me girl 
I know you well 
What's on your mind 
It ain't hard to tell 
Don't leave me now 
Don't play wit' me 
You think I'm blind 
But baby I can see 

I saw your eyes  from across the room 
You was checkin' me out  and I was scopin' you too 

Don't say I'm wrong (what) 
Don't mind those eyes 
I'ma call your bluff 
So baby tell me why 

[Chorus: x2] 
Tell me standing here (tell me baby am I gettin' on your nerves) 
Baby keep it real (why don't you tell me how you feel) 
Tell me what's on your mind (tell me am I wasting my time) 
I gotta know, baby let me know 

Could you have told me girl 
Is what I said 
You can tell the truth 
I'm all in your hand 
And what's wrong wit' that 
Are you ashamed of me? 
You can fool your girls 
But you can't fool G 

I saw your eyes, from across the room 
You was checkin' me out, I was scopin' you too 

Oh I'll turn and walk away 
If you deny (I) 
But before I go 
Could you tell me why 

[Chorus: x2] 

Baby baby 
Baby baby 
What's yo name 
What's yo name 
How bout you

Come play our game 
Come play our game

If you hear a click, trust me, you wouldn't hear clack 
If you push it up front, I got no choice, but to pull it back 
Your rhymes don't faze me, I'm above em, half y'all raps is 
Born retarded, now you out here tryin' to get rid of em 
You should be sick of it, I possess no flaws 
That's from the man that made your Head Nod til you Lick-ed his Balls 
Verses I spit em, when it's my turn to get em, I got hot flows 
I only do shows for burn victims 
So cock this mic, and bust out your back, kill you 
And then they gonna blame me for fuckin' up rap 
Who's fuckin with that? Skillz and Esco', it's on 
When you speak in my direction, watch your tone 
From Q-B to V-A, can't count the blocks we own 
It's locked and sewn I repeat nigga, watch your tone 

[Chorus] 

Yo come see 
The big man with the diamonds and the fly Bentleys 
Ladies love me, niggas say 
"Timbaland's really rappin', what the fuck is up be?" 
Jealousy 
I kill niggas with seven thangs, most they jackin' beats 
I'm a eight digit niggy 
Maybe I just rebuild Titanic and send that out to see 
What?

Thank you, thank you, thank you

[Laughing] 

Uh right now, Ima bring a special guest in
He gon' rip it for me, like this, check it out

[Twista]
Who am I, N**** wid tha blunt, steady trippin, sippin on the concoction,
with tha gun c***tin
Drum knockin, gotta get off
B****es and killas in the front watchin

Flowin with like a finna studda some
Betta come off a butta ton, brotha run, I hope he said he were
I'm a flow until my belly hurt
Pimp n**** rockin on tha stage an rock on in the petty shirt

Let it rough, ooh
Feels like anotha one
Who you be? Mr. Shystie
The one who make you frown up like the lemon in my ice tea

The muthaf***a most likely
To get a tuba with the opposition in my position 
I break em off when I give em tha heat
Steady re' for rollin

Bullets body decomposion
I dismember the weak on the Timbaland beat
You remember the beat
Conversation we had

When my adrinallin was rushin
Check yo brakes and knee pads
When the twis to get tha bus in
Bodys gon' get rushed in

I can make em hit tha dance flo
Brothas, b****es, and hustlers
I get up in the guts homie, never phoney
Hitta wigga when he run up on me

Y'all muthaf***as still don't know me
Let em' learn slowly

[Chorus: x2]
Who you be?
I'm the one that stay high
Center make up the party, rockin' bodie
With tha thugga hands up in the sky

Never shy he's fly
Who am I, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck
T-straight from the Chi

Ribal, homosydal, everybody duck
With tha party up and pimp struck
T-N-T now I say who am I

Who you be? Who am I?
The one who's surrounded by the wood
500 with the ribs stickin' through the hood
Up to no good that's why'd stay they misunderstood

And I'm always in the mix of some s***s
Scoop a shawty an she thick
And tha b**** gets grip in them hips
Put a dick on the lips top it doggie style, she my homie gal

So I tricked on that b****
Now who you be?
The one who's on the dance floor
Sex goin' be one of the ma** hoes

Freak on a bad hoe
You's could really want to flash gold
Turn a hater to a sa** hoe
Play an ballin' up at Cape Town, strippin went down

Study, tippin' off of CD's an Tapes
Though see n****s see Gs to take
Run up to the car, got no things
They got CD's to break, no easy pace

Who you be?
The crime cause other obituary an uligy
Photo stank and y'all be who to see
Only smokin' it with you and me

Lets go hang out where the booty be
I was on sumthin, no frontin'
Yello wide ol' belly in the po funkin'
Grinnin while up in the curb

Want to journey for herb
Always tellin' somebody to smoke somethin'
True indeed

[Chorus: x2]
The one that's flowin' fluently
Make yo baby say goo to me
What you did to her
Didn't ask why I hit her for

'Cause the game like literature
Get it Get it girl
I don't know what you was waitin' on
But if you ain't with a partner

This young monsters a fly guy
Shake a lil' bit of that body
We goin' party till we sky high
To my players an soldiers, shady n****s, young thugs and strap hoes,

Pimps strikin' fees and red bones
Ghetto fees and Gs an MC's for the rifols
The one that be kickin' off air time
From sunrise ta bedtime

All of y'all need ta know me, the one an only
Pimp slap tingin' twista from the Chi
Makin' competition die slowly
Who am I?

[Chorus: x2]

[Timbaland]
Ha ha ha ha
Y'all didn't think that I would do it again twice did ya
Ha ha
I do it like that, I put it down

For the 98 or TNT 
Thing ya know what I'm sayin'
Timbaland and Twista
Y'all fools couldn't recognize could ya?

I put it down for all parts of the area

Still dreaming up ways to help you niggas die quicker

Hypnotized the masses behind Versace glasses
Coogi sweaters, Pelle leathers
I been doing this for forever, so whatever
However, wherever, whenever
Why ever I back down never (I'll never)
Actions speak louder than words
You ain't heard it from me I'm a motherfucking verb

Ray-ban shades, warheads laid
Babies born in air raids
My girls run the everglades
Indian tribesmen gamble spades
Indian chicks, they get men laid
Milk and honey, smoke high-grade
Gold and diamond, gems and jade
Ride up on our tanks, invade
Blow up thing to save our name
Mina, rina, Tina, Sabrina
Being a super Indian babe
We black market, we black made
We hit shit out when it rains
Would you come down and catch my train?
Would you run down and play this game?

Baby, I know you see me.
Put a hump or two on your back
Just like that
Oh girl you're on fire.
I don't wanna be in love with you
Imma just break you off and say goodbye
The night is young
Don't make me wait,
You just might miss your chance.
I'm gon' tell you the truth
Timbaland, I'm the motherfuckin' man.
Today's the day, girl, let me get that
Don't get mad
In fact, let me hit that
I've been overkilling them, I break backs
Come down, run down

And you on me, and me on you, and you on her
Then her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me
Then me on y'all, and y'all on me
Menage a trois, menage a tr-uh-uh)

Oh! There she go, just what the Doc's been lookin' fo'
She just what I need, black and Chinese like some young ho
I got a bungalow; we can disappear for a week or so (yeah)
I got a steady young flow, super bowl wit' it like I'm Dungy, yo (oh)
Yes, congratulations
You won a millionaire invitation
Sorry I'm so demandin'
But save the dancin' for back at the mansion, and
Ain't this money handsome?
Ain't, that a panty anthem?
I kill me, just like you
From the back you'll see

Bounce (like yo' ass had the hiccups)
Bounce (like we was ridin' in my pick-up)
Bounce (Why you lookin' so sad? Baby girl, you need to cheer up)
Bounce (I got the remedy: it's you on me, and me on you
And you on me, and me on you, and you on her
Then her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me
Then me on y'all, and y'all on me
Menage a trois, menage a tr-uh-uh)

Hold up! Hell naw!
Like Britney Spears, I wear no drawers
In the club I drink it up, gulp, gulp, drink it up
Got Patron sippin' in my cup
That's ya man; I bet I can make him look
When he see the jugs, he wanna rush and get a quick touch of the big ol' butt
Mhm, big ol' butt, thick legs, big ol' jugs
Legs stick like rims on the truck
Take him to the crib; yep, we gon' fuck
You can call me a freak; I like to get buck
I don't have to do much to make you get it up
Some young ho - she worth two dollars
I'm worth more dollars than major beauty parlors
I pop collars, c-c-c-collars
I don't buy shots, I only buy the bottles
Only rich girls - we only buy the bottles
And, like a porn star, I'm best when I swallow

Bounce (like yo' ass had the hiccups)
Bounce (like we was ridin' in my pick-up)
Bounce (Why you lookin' so sad? Baby girl, you need to cheer up)
Bounce (I got the remedy: it's you on me, and me on you
And you on me, and me on you, and you on her
Then her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me
Then me on y'all, and y'all on me

I knew you niggas was dumb, but how dumb is you?
Thinkin' you can see the king when you unofficial
You don't wanna go to war 'cause I'll launch these missiles
I'm a ride-or-die nigga; I be tearin' shit up
We ain't like them other fools who don't compare to us
All the hos love a nigga; they be backing it up
But me - I love money; I be stacking it up
When my bandwagon pull up, they hop on board
They hop right on mine and hop right off yours
I get respect, homey, all across the board
I get a quarter mill' a track without an award
Ever wanna test a nigga, then come see me
In the street I hold my ground like I'm concrete
I know shit ain't sweet so when shit get deep
I'm rich, I can pay to have you six feet deep
(Nigga)

[Chorus]
I give it to whoever want it
If you want it, come see me
You know where I'm at 
If you, if you want it, come get me
If you, if you want it, come get me

[50 Cent]
Nigga, you violate, I regulate, rat-tat-tat
Bigger shells - they fit in that banana clip tech
Run, and a bullseye form on your back
It's hard to miss wit' a full clip in the mac
I got ammo; ammo I unload; reload cut a nigga quick
Yeah, my knife game lethal - that tough guy shit
Nigga, that's what I see through
You like a three course meal, motherfucker, I eat you
You food, and I'm in the mood; so front, I let the hammer fly
Nigga, you can duck, run for cover, or die
Your choice; you choose
I Pop, you move, like you in shock: you been shot
Nigga, your blood on the street, you up shit's creek
You can hardly speak, startin' to get weak, your eyes close
Your life flash, your heart slow, your heart stop
Your ass dead, you fucked, kid

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
I'm like Nicholas Cage: Yeah, it's the Ghost Rider
P89, yeah, I let my toast slide, Costa Rica To Brazil
I got my hos in the lamb; why your bitch bald headed?
Like Britney Spears; I'm in the projects gettin' dope and piff money
Two more flips; that's Anna Nicole Smith money; fuck a G4
I'm in a G-500, G-450, G-550; that's airplane talk
I'm the aviator man, baby; AR shoot your baby out your hands
Spaghetti and corn bread; mix got me blunted
There's no talk abouts; you don't fuck on an empty stomach
Buy out the mall, then hug the block; hundred-thou wood grain
In a phantom drop; then I cruise in the club
Got my ruge in the club; pay a bouncer a buck
Now my uz in the club, yeah, nigga

Ha, are you ready?

Fantasy (oh) 
It could be, (oh), good and we
(I was just thinkin' about you)
Wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed, (boy)
(So, what will it be?)

Just lookin' at you, shorty, lights a flame inside (inside)
I'm wondering if you can come and help put out the fire (fire)
But you can get at me, baby; tell me what you like
'Cause I can be your all-boy, I can be your love toy
If you ain't busy, baby, I'm all yours tonight (tonight)
Let imagination take us for a field in mines
Travelin' in a dream (dream) we can bring something to life
That no one's ever seen yet, can I?

[Chorus]
Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy (oh)
It could be (so) good, and we
Might just get it hot up in the
Wildest thang (you have) ever dreamed, boy
Let me show you what it's like beyond your fantasy
It could be (so) good, and we
Might just get it hot up in the
Wildest thang (you have) ever dreamed, boy

'Cause think of all the tasty things that we can try (try)
The karma you can have being within, Money can buy
(Ho, ho, ho, ho)
We ain't even gotta keep it quiet, boy; all my walls are sound proof
I can scream your name, boo (oh)
Let me tell ya house (how) we will not disturb
I found a place; our Neighbors - you get all that you deserve
Boy, I got it somewhere if you can conjure up the nerve
To come see what if feels like, can I?

[Chorus]

Touch it, touch it, feel it, roll around it; and, if you like
Taste it, taste it, and embrace it again a second time
Don't you waste it; you'll regret it 'cause I can satisfy
Any fantasy that you can come with, can I?

Let me show you what it's like beyond your fantasy (oh)
It could be (so) good, and we
Might just get it hot up in the
Wildest thang (you have) ever dreamed, boy

Let me show you what it's like beyond your fantasy
It could be (so) good, and we
Might just get it hot up in the
Wildest thang (you have) ever dreamed, boy

Let me show you what it's like beyond your fantasy
It could be (so) good, and we

Seen ya try to switch it up, but, girl, you ain't got to
I'm the Wonder Woman; let me go get my ropes
I'm a supermodel, and, mummy, si mummy
Amnesty International got bankrupt (I'm on top, on lock)
You love my ass, and my abs, and the video called Promiscuous
My style is meticulous

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

When Timbo is in the party, everybody put up their hands
I get a half a mill for my beats, you get a couple grand
Never gonna see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-i-a way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just the piano man
Your song gonna top the charts; I heard 'em; I'm not a fan
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em they can't do it like I can

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

Could you speak up and stop the mumbling?
I don't think you came in clear
Sitting on the top; it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV; just let me clear the air
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over; not at least until we say

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body

You have to get out
I implore you 
Please
Please
You're all going to die down here

[Timbaland]
It's life or death
Either one
The king is back
Take heed and run
I piss and take a shit on your beat for fun
I killed the game
I ain't even use a gun
Who better than me?
Don't make me laugh
I run this shit; they just chase my ass
I ain't talkin' shit, nigga
Just tellin' the facts
I think all the tracks I'm hearin' from niggas is whack
I be hearin' these niggas
What they say in they rhymes
I took my spot; nobody gave me mine
I make the beats that boom boom boom in they trunks
You disagree, homey? Then go on and jump
You can bump your gum
You can say what you want
That's all you gon' do 'cause you niggas is punks
I'm number one; you ain't nothin' but shit
When they need a hit, I would become to get
Talk to me

[Chorus]
If you got love for me, I got love for you
If you don't fuck wit' me, I won't fuck wit' you
We can do it however you wanna do
Nigga, if you don't fuck wit' me, I won't fuck wit' you
Go on ahead
Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go on, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself 
Go on, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself 
Go on, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself

I'm tired of niggas
Niggas is tired
You ain't a G
I see bitch in your eyes
If you close to me
You supposed to be
But most of you rap niggas is hos to me
Wherever you from
The question I ask
Is do you think I give a fuck?
Riddle me that
'Cause in my hood, and you jump into hell and back
This industry shit - to hell wit' that
I seen 'em come, I seen 'em go
I doubt if you can show me somethin' I ain't seen before
Who supposed to be in charge? I need to know
When I shake your hand, I'm a step on your toe
Go get ya gun, go get ya click
I'm a be right here chillin' wit' yo' bitch
You mad at me 'cause I'm gettin' rich
Well, put the pistol to your head and empty the clip
Pop, nigga!

[Chorus]

See my heart
Feel my pain
Some is stars, some is lames
How they follow little trends to get they fame
I ain't snappin' my damn fingers to get in the game
You claim you rich
Show me, son
If you got so many dollas, then loan me one
Fools think they killas - they own a gun
When you know you 'bout as sweet as a honey bun
Trash your broads behind a bar
Like you dat dude frontin' hard
VIP bands don't make you a star
Like we really still don't know who the fuck you are
Don't talk behind my back, just call me nigga
Move my heart to the side
Make room to forgive ya
If you still wanna hang
We'll come to get ya
Put the rope around your neck and jump, my nigga!

You're all going to die down here
Get out 
Get out
You can't be in here
You're all going to die down here</field>

What?

I'm in your part of town
I call your phone, and you're no where to be found
You do this every time
You be M.I.A. every single time

The part that kills me
You rather chill with your friends instead of me, huh
But I ain't gon' be no clown
I guess I call you next time I'm in your town
And you say to me...

So what, I was out with my friends
I'm a grown woman
It's the weekend, oh
So what if I don't answer my phone
What if I'm not alone
I'm with him
What's it to you?

I need to get out
You, you, you, you, you
Are killing me; you're killing me, you're killing me
And I
Just wanna get out
You, you, you, you, you
Are killing me; you're killing me, you're...
What ya wanna do, do, do?
What ya wanna do, do, do?

I cannot escape
No matter what I do
Can't get away from you, oh
Call me everyday
And that there ain't never cool
Getting on my nerves
I think it's time you knew
Only gave you my number 'cause drinks made you cuter, plus
You were looking sad and lonely, ooo
But that's all it was
Just put you in the game
And here you go complainin'
What's up with you?

I need to get out
You, you, you, you, you
Are killing me; you're killing me, you're killing me
And I
Just wanna get out
You, you, you, you, you
Are killing me; you're killing me, you're...
What ya wanna do, do, do?
What ya wanna do, do, do?

Like, whoa, lil' mama, it's the second time I'm callin' your number
I ain't chasin'; I ain't even no runner
Don't you know I push the Hummer in the summer, huh?
How you hard to be reached?
I can put you where you hard to be reached
Black sand on the balls of your feet
You can scream, ain't no body gon' be asleep
This your own private beach, ha ha
And when it comes to sex
Just a little bit of love and little bit of that
Maybe push it back where your ribs is at
Share a bowl of crunch berries, how real is that? ha ha
I'm just jokin' of course
I'm trying to put your sex game back on course
If you feelin' dry, like you don't get moist
If you ever get a minute, holla at yo' boy</field>

I'm a one man game
Don't take this lightly
If I want you dead and gone
I can make that happen because
Nigga, my bread is long

Can't do it like me, dog
Your kick drum ain't got enough bass
Don't ever talk bad about me
You just might make me mad
And I just might see you somewhere
And break your ass in half

This not the Timbaland you used to
Now I'm in a whole 'nother zone
You can let me do me
You can do you
Or get popped in ya door
Hit love on the verge to the block
So recognize the game
Timbaland ain't gonna run nowhere, baby
Timbaland got private planes

Sometime long ago

Don't act like you ain't seen it before

You ain't sayin' shit
You can keep on wishin'
You never make a hit
Yeah, I got money
Take it all from me
I'm a gon' be the same
You can get a few whips
You can get a few chips
You still gon' be lame
We ain't the same, my nigga
I'm on some other shit
I'm a say this plain and simple
Nigga, take this punishment
I'm a take y'all on a trip
I'm a take y'all on a ride
And one day I'm gon' dip
But I won't be hard to find

Oh, you like my swagger?
You like how I changed it up?
I like it too baby
But for now
I think the beat is going a little bit too long
Oh, you like it this long? Hmm!
That means you like to make love long, yeah
I feel that
I like how you shaking your hips to it, uh
It's about to end baby but don't you stop
Keep it going
Keep it going
Keep it going
And bring it over here
Sit on my lap
Kiss me
No no no, right here, yeah, ha

The time has come!

Take it to the back of the club
Fast talkin' don't take this the wrong way

And if you give me my chance I ain't gon' play
I really want to get to know ya
That's what I told ya girl you know I don't play

You better do what the song say

Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me

Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me
Uh, just throw it on me,
(Wiggle that ass before ya throw it on me)

I got so many broads
White cars I can jump in two or three in the same day
And when I park my car
Soon as I walk in the spot women say (Ow!)
They showin' me titties
And they callin' my name and all night goddamn babe (shut up!)
Niggas is hatin' me
'Cause they girl wanna throw that thang on me like it's okay, girl!

Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me

Girl, now, look at that ass
You probably a gold digger but I ain't Kanye
Baby girl you on the right track
But 'cha goin' the wrong way
And when we leave out the party baby girl
I got the game that they gon' play
And when ya wake up tomorrow
I'll be on the highway (peace!)

Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me

I gotta get keep my eye on her; she ain't no walk in the park
I offered this, but she want that; she, she, she want it all
You see, she wanted to paint the picture and say she my broad
I got a little tip from the word on the block
People saying I shouldn't get involved
But I didn't judge or try to change it
'Cause you are who you are
I'm like the drug; she's addicted to me
She can't leave me now
She always making plans to date
Come and find me tomorrow 
Goodbye, girl

[Chorus]
She's too invested in the hours that pass her by
I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time
I tell her easy, but her hands - they find a way
Confusing passion for the love we never gave
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
I tell her easy, but her hands - they find a way
Confusing passion for the love we never gave

I couldn't get rid of shorty if I wanted
'Cause she was down, but I was tired of playin' the role
Like I ain't know that she get around
Something 'bout this girl fascinates me
She's the type that like to hang with the stars
The way she makes me feel, it sedates me
Who knew we would take it this far?
Everywhere that I try to go, she got a wanted poster with my face on it
Soon as I walk out the door, there it is
Wanted poster up with my face on it
Can't blame myself when it's not my fault 
'Cause nothing is promised 
At least I can say I was honest
Goodbye, girl

I'm glad you're my maker
My Loyalty lies in your hands, you're my breath taker
Your body, your kiss is in unknown demand
So take command, go Timbo

I be the same when it all goes up
I be the same when it all goes down
Not the first one, open it up
I be the last one closin' it out
Don't know if I'll give you a shot yet
Lil Mama I'm peepin' your style
Do I think you're dope enough, yup
One way of findin' it out
The way you came at me, boo
Don't care, not afraid I'm like Wild
Really want it from head to toe
Question if she gon let it out
Anyway the hour glass go
I don't worry anyhow
Why don't we see where it go
Let's figure it out

When the cats come out the vamps come out to playy yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy yeahh

I got a little secret for ya
I never sleep when comes the night
But every time I snap my fingers
I switch back into the light
My moon belong to your sun
Your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust
Something that I just can't describe (ah)
Am I the one and only (ah)
Cause you're the only one (ah)
It felt so long and lonely (ah)
Waiting for you to come
It's lookin' bright and early
I'm willing to close my eyes
This is the unusual story
Timbo and SoShy

Don't wanna be too up front no
Baby you know it's my style
I'm talkin' about lightin' it up
You talkin' about dimmin' it down
Don't think about lettin' it go
But I've never seen no king that bows
Yes I'm the one and only
You know I see right through ya
I get it your magnetic
So you draw me right to ya
Maybe I give you a shot yup
Maybe you deserve the crown
Won't give you a treasure map yet
Cause you'll figure it out

Oh she's a crazy girl,
Somebody come get the girl,

Easy she's bout to drown,
Easy she's outta bounds,
Easy come save the girl,
Easy she's about to growl,
Do you love that, another round
Was it all that? another round
You enjoy that? another round
Girl you all that but ease off the liquor
Little mama you off the Richter
Ease off the liquor
Little mama you off the Richter
Ease off the liquor
Little mama you off the Richter
Ease off the liquor

Why? my tolerance is high
Four shots don't do nothing to me I'm fine.
Can you hold your liquor cause I can hold mine.
And if I get pulled over, I can walk a straight line.
Talk to me.

She can hardly walk
Lets go lets go lets go
Can't drink no more
Would you cut down and lets go
Don't need no more
Would you cut down and lets go
Don't need oh no
Now she taking off her clothes.

Hey lady
My love is always on the grind
Hey lady
How far I gotta go to reach you

You're all mine
You're alright
I don't mind, no
When I stand
By your side, oh

Talkin' bout my baby
Cause we always breakin' the mold
Talkin' bout my baby
We don't need no,
The way you love me down
Got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me down
Got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me, eh eh
The way you love me, eh eh
The way you love me, eh eh
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control

I have a bad day
I don't act right
Get up under your skin
I know it ain't right
How I ask you
To give up everything
Boy just stop what you're doin and come and follow me around
Baby, thank you for the second chances

And everything you did to help advance at this
You put up with my shit
How can you be my best?
Boy you really got it goin' on

You're all mine
You're alright
I don't mind, no
When I stand
By your side, oh

Talkin' bout my baby
Cause we always breakin' the mold
Talkin' bout my baby
We don't need no
The way you love me down
Got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me down

I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me, eh eh
The way you love me, eh eh
The way you love me, eh eh
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control

You know my girl get the keys with the em's on it
She have the range night, I'm in a Benz mornin'
Bought plenty of ice for them shinin' on your friends moments
I'll give her anything she want if it look good on her
And we be chillin' like a bottle sittin' on the rocks
Shoppin' bags full of cartier forget-me-nots
But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact
But you can rent some love with a couple stacks
Man I gotta lease nothin', I own one
And every time I hit, she say it's a home run
When asked how can we be serious at so young
I just say I'm in it for the long run

We're talkin' bout my baby
Cause we always breakin' the mold
Talkin' bout my baby
We don't need no
The way you love me down
Got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me down
Got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me, eh eh
The way you love me, eh eh

            <field name="lyrics">For those days we felt like a mistake
Those times when loves what you hate
Somehow,
We keep marching on

For those nights that I couldn't be there,
I've made it harder to know that you know
That somehow
We'll keep movin' on

There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that,
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on

There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that,
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on

So many hills we had to climb
Almost without our strength
But we kept,
Slowly marchin' on

Time heals the wounds we couldn't close
Blood, sweat and tears dried up
We're okay
We kept marchin' on

There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that,
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on

There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that,
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on

Get your legs and walk
'Cause we're not too far
A little more to go
But we're marchin' on
We marchin' on
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
We marchin'

If we lose the sun, we couldn't deny that
If we go the wind, we gotta fight back
But we marchin' on
We marchin' on
We're marchin' on
We're marchin'

The bridges are gone
And we're almost home
The end is close

There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that,
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on

There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that,
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on</field>

            <field name="lyrics">We fuss we fight your fault my fault 
We was on the same team least that's what I thought 
We both participated only I got caught 
Now we hardly conversation baby, we don,t talk 
It was fun at first, you can,t say I'm wrong 
Now you wanna talk about it? too late, I'm gone 
Your mad at me cos I don't wanna play your games 
I ain't perfect but I'm a do my thing 
We gotta meet in the middle 

You here I'm there, tell me whats the sense in me trying if you don't care? 
This relationship is heading to who knows where 
That means one of us got to chose, because 
You hurt me, and I hurt you, you complain about the things that I don't do 
I don't wanna take the blame neither do you, because we got too much to loose 

We gotta meet in the middle 
Meet in the middle 
We gotta gotta meet in the middle 
Gotta compromise 
Baby don,t analyze 
We need to see eye to eye, so lets meet in the middle 
We gotta meet in the middle 
We gotta gotta meet in the middle 
We gotta compromise 
We gotta work it out this time 
We need to see eye to eye 
So lets meet in the middle 

We got somethin' we can,t enjoy 
I'm sick of you trynin' to play with me like I,m your toy 
Hm, 
You tried to run game I saw, 
We gotta lotta issues you got yours, we gotta meet in the middle 
You cant talk that shit, you cant travel to the future if you walk backwards 
Once you walk out the door, you cant walk back in 
We gotta find a way to solve it, think about our kids 
Cos they in the middle 
You wanna sing that song? 
You want me to cop that plead and say OK I'm wrong? 
Things are gettin' heavy but I gotta stay strong 
I try to talk it over with you when I coulda been gone because 
You hurt me, and I hurt you, you complain about the things that I don't do 
And I don't wanna take the blame neither do you because we got too much to loose 

We gotta meet in the middle 
Meet in the middle 
We gotta gotta meet in the middle 
Gotta compromise 
Baby don,t analyze 
We need to see eye to eye, so lets meet in the middle 
We gotta meet in the middle 
We gotta gotta meet in the middle 
We gotta compromise 
We gotta work it out this time 
We need to see eye to eye 
So lets meet in the middle 

I told you once, I told you twice 
And now my shoulders cold, like a block of ice 
You playin' games like you rollin' dice 
Hey what you know about sacrifice? 
Baby I've been in the middle
I've been givin' you more than a little 
Had the ball then you double dribble 
I guess that love is a riddle
You never listen I don't ever get my point across 
I washed ya dirty draws, you out with dirty broads 
You did me dirty dawg, cos yous a dirty dog, 
Its a quit n call, and I ain't mad at all 
I gave you more than you deserve, I was worth it all 
Bottom line I hope you find what your searchin' for 

You hurt me, said I hurt you 
And I complain about the things that you don't do 
And I don't wanna take the blame neither do you 
We got too much to lose

We gotta meet in the middle 
Meet in the middle 
We gotta gotta meet in the middle 
Gotta compromise 
Baby don,t analyze 
We need to see eye to eye, so lets meet in the middle 
We gotta meet in the middle 
We gotta gotta meet in the middle 
We gotta compromise 
We gotta work it out this time 
We need to see eye to eye 
So lets meet in the middle.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Aye, I was mean 
Before I became a feign
I took over the world
When they gave me a beat machine
And then I made my city jump, jump
Who's your favorite producer?
Come on baby, let it bump, bump
I'm like a music cyclone when I'm in the zone
A typhoon every time I can hold a song
A tycoon, I just went and brought another home
Who you stunting on? I'm never off
I set it off like you was never home
Was dedicated, bop bop
Lit up my way, bounce bounce
Anyway I want, private jet, get it out
Will bread do? You know what Tim about?
Ferrari 599, windows tinted out
I, I, I'm the man, my, my beats is crazy
You want the sound, freaky freaky you gotta pay me 
But don't get it confused
Never had no silver spoon
But you gotta long walk
Try and fit Timbaland's shoes
And next up

I'm a lead that's me (ay, what's your name?)
D.O.E on the M.I.C (and where you from?)
N.Y.C, make a billion G 

Why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (Okay, okay)

When you see me walk through, got the whole crew
Timbaland, he produced, if you're a fruit, produce
Riding it in the old school
Living like I'm old school
She french kissed my neck 
And then I told her merci voux cou
Put it in your bag, no baby I ain't fat
When I fuck you it's a wrap
I'm a put you in the cab
Better be happy I rap
If I wasn't I'd be trapped with the mass
And I, and I'm coming for your stash
When I find out where you at
I'll be shimmying your lock
Get the fuck up out your bed
You better give me what you got
Want your money, money, money, money
Blind like there's no money, oh gotta go money
And his pocket's fully drained
And he's back to nothing change

And I'd wish he'd come run up on me
He gone find that he'd done made the wrong move

I ain't changed, still the same
D.O.E be the name
I'm from north side queens
Next up

Ha, ay yo, believe that's me 
(And what's your name?) Bran'Nu A.K.A Brandy
(And where you from?) Mississippi 
But was raised in Cali

Why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (I got it, I got it ha)

It's been a long time coming, I'm back
Like I forgot something important
Hey, have a problem with me?
I've faded to black like church slacks
Now I'm in a range, no Cadillac
So you don't want it with me
I'm on the tip of your tongue like bubble gum
I got you head strung
It's my return like the kingdom come
I'm taking off like a rocket
I got this beat in my pocket
I keep your heart dropping (Bran'Nu)
Never gonna hold me back
Timbo put me on the map
Now you wanna say I act brand new
Just like my Pradda boots
Strutting like a model do
Don't you wish you had another chance to
Get up under my skin
Fronting like you getting in it
You keep running your mouth like them frogs do
I gotta learn, you like a school dude
Cause clearly you don't have a clue
So next up

Yeah, ay yo believe that's me
(And what's your name?) Attitude on the M.I.C
(And where you from?) Alabama be the bigger G

And why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (okay)

All this dope shit never mediocre
Plenty bread so you know I gotta keep a toaster
On my side, pride leashing, it's over
Come to fly to drive, I'm a need a chauffeur
I get a whole lot of, like a G's supposed to
They can put me in the fed for what's in my sofa
Rap, wait, smack 'em if they say a part
Diss me, I'll put the ratchet
On you and your fading heart
I know that man never thought that it could happen
Got my shit on and then I hoped in the Aspen
Every chick I cash in, bigger pain in the ass and
Better new freak, she thicker then the last one
Naw I ain't never homie, music is my passion
I ain't show compassion at all, I be fucking
Yelling I'm the shit, if you with nobody's asking
Oh I'm on fire like the shit in the ass man
That's why I stay soaked on player
Like how we are fucking up the ozone layer
I drop a hit every time I got some shit to say
And If I miss I come back like a ricochet</field>

Timothy, cause such a waste (cause such a waste)
Timothy, we found your spaceship
Timothy, it's the farthest you've ever flown-own-own
Own-own-own-own-own

Hey! Put your lighters up
Put your lighters up y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all
Y'all put your lighters up
This the Timothy song if you don't know about me

Yeah they call me Tim, V-A's phenomenon
I kill 'em all winter, until the summer come
From just another name, all the way to number one
And I'm simply the best when it's all said and done
Remember when me and Magoo was tryin to make a mill'?
Well we did and years later we got it still
Gave you my bio, "Under Construction 1 and 2"
Hundred percent, Ginuwine, that was from me to you
I'm makin moves while they ridicule
I'm like a warm summer breeze in the swimmin pool - I'm cool
I never kept it basic, I been so many places
Been gettin money since them honies had them small faces
So many little me's, I can hear small traces
But I just ignore it, cause I'm too big for it
And I can hear 'em screamin {*echoes*}

[Chorus]
Timothy, where have you been?
It's not what it seems but it is
Timothy, where have you been?
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy, where have you been?

I been in Athens, Georgia by way of Bubba Sparxxx
When the +Nights+ were +Bright+ and all the +Days+ was +Dark+
But now they all bright, everything is all right
If you assume my life is wonderful then y'all right
I got a bad wife, three beautiful kids
I make the world dance, yeah look what I done did
Hits for Jay-Z, Nelly Furtado
Catch up, y'all slow, escargot
Nelly did fourteen mill', where's Fargo?
I brought a airplane, fuck I need a car fo'?
Ask Justin Timberlake is Timbaland great?
Y'all gotta deal with me, no handshake
Stand up nigga, rather have a stand off
With the law before I let 'em say I ran off
And I can hear 'em screamin'

[Chorus]

Ay, some say I went away but really I never left
They wonder where I been, but they can never guess
I been around the world here to the other side
And I successfully achieved what all those others tried
Carry my city on my back like a crucifix
For more than a decade cause I can do this shit
A lot of people want my spot but I don't hesitate
The track label my legacy won't appreciate
I stand strong, everything I put my hands on
Me and Mr. I be, cause ain't no I in team
Cause I can hear 'em sayin'

[Chorus]

Timothy, where have you been?
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Where have you been?

Timothy, where have you been?</field>

The clock is ticking down
Hoping daddy'll crack a smile
How can I support a child
Last time I had a job, It's been a while
The question remain so freely
Why does it have to happen to me?
To wash away the pain of drinking, I'm thinking

I'm waiting for the day that, together we could find another way back, 
Put everything we've got in stake lets worry about today 
And put tomorrow in a bottle. (bottle)

Wont be satisfied till what we had was gone away
Hey, Hey every other day we doesn't fight
And I take it two wrongs don't make a right
You had my head gone
I had you dead wrong
Thinking that same old song
Wondering why you mad at me, me
Now you gotta understand my lingo

Baby This is how it should be (hey!)
Are you gonna do me like that?
Your both supposed to have my back, back 
Your both supposed to have my back, back

And we both don't know how to act
Wasn't a lead by the door

I wont go spreading my ex
From Tallahassee and back

Chad gonna sing the rest!

I don't wanna hear you scream no more
Want somebody to save me
Everything I do feels like its wrong
All we do is fall down
Even though we try to stay afloat
I swear its gonna kill me
Even though you think it wont
So why rock a boat and make waves
And everything's coming okay
So why am I confused if you love me
Thought this would be smooth sailing

Cause I don't wanna let you go
And we're caught in the undertow
Cause I ain't losing my control
And we're caught in the undertow
I hold a prayer is all our own
But we need air we go alone
Cause I don't wanna let you go
Til we're caught in the undertow

I don't wanna cry every time we try it never fails
Change the illusion wanna be close set for sail
My hearts in your hand don't you go hurt me again
All we got is one chance and its sink or swim
So why rock a boat and make waves
And everything's coming okay
Why am I confused if you love me

I hold the prayer is all our own

Cause I don't wanna let you go
Til we're caught in the undertow

And the waters rising
And the waters rising
And the waters rising
And the waters rising

Cause I don't wanna let you go
Through the crowd in the undertow
And I'm losing my control
Through the crowd in the undertow
And I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
And I'm losing my control
Though we're caught in the undertow

Our only prayer is all our own
We both need air we go alone
Our only prayer is on our own
We both need air we go alone

Cause I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
Cause we're caught in the undertow

You gonna like this outfit

No need for you to go anywhere
Turn it up until you can't rock anymore

Everybody goes dance floor and give it up
Baby put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up

Everybody goes dance floor and give it up
Baby put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up

So listen a couple girls
Who was in and now I mess with cover girls
Of magazines, you can catch me on a cover, girl
I created my own planet to hover the earth and cover the world
I spit so sick, I'm calling the world
I see you tryna claim her now I play with her pearls
They try to come at me but all of 'em sterile
Life's a bitch, but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
No she's not religious but she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50
What a working girl!
Now work it, girl! Like

Uh uh uh, ah ah
Uh uh uh, ah ah
Like uh uh uh, ah ah
Uh uh uh, ah ah

Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Oh oh my God, oh oh my God, oh oh my God, I like to do it
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me

I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I like when I see you break it down like you in control

I've got a cup to my right and a cup to my left
I'm stumbling and I'm out of breath
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
I got a girl to my right and a girl to my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breasts
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone

Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Oh oh my God, oh oh my God, oh oh my God, I like to do it
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me

You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Bye Bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
(Oh, Oh)
Just hit me with the truth
Now, girl you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby come on
I live for you and me
And now I really come to see

When the visions around you, bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrond you, are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope, keeping your faith when its gone
The one you should call, was standing here all along
And I will take you in my arms, and hold you right where you belong
'Til the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you
I've loved you forever, in lifetimes before
And I promise you never, will you hurt anymore
I give you my word, I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow forever has now begun
Just close your eyes, each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away, nooo
'Til the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you
Over and over I fall, when I hear you call
Without you in my life baby
I just wouldn't be living at all
And I will take, (I will take you in my arms), you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong)
'Til the day my life is through, this I promise you baby
Just close your eyes, each loving day(each loving day)
And know this feeling won't go away, (no)

I'm sick and tired of hearin' all these people talk about...
What's the deal with this pop life and when is it gonna fade out?
The thing you've got to realize what we're doin' is not a trend
We got the gift of melody, we're gonna bring it 'till the end
It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive, or what I wear around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about respect
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear and where I go and why
All that matters
Is that you get hype and we'll do it to you everytime
Chorus
Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high
It's takes you on a ride
Feel it when your
Body starts to rock
And baby you can't stop
And the music's all you got
This must be POP!
Dirty pop
Baby, baby you can't stop
I know you like this
Dirty pop
This must be...
Now why you want to try to classify the type of thing we do?
'Cause we're just fine doin' what we like can we say the same for you
I'm tired of feelin' all around me animosity
Just worry 'bout yours 'cause I'm a get mine now people can't you see
It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive or the ice around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize thats it's just about respect
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear and where I go and why
All that matters
Is that you get hype and we'll give it to you everytime

Seems so long ago you walked away,
Left me alone.
And I remember what you said to me,
You were acting so strange

And maybe I was too blind to see,
that you needed a change.
Was it something I said,
to make you turn away,
to make you walk out and leave me cold.
If I could just find a way...
to make it so that you were right here,
Right now

I've been sitting here,
Can't get you off my mind,
I'm trying my best to be a man and be strong

Baby, you're gone,
You're, Gone,
Baby Girl, you're gone,
Gone,
You're...
Now I don't want to make excuses baby,
won't change the fact that you're gone (oh no)
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know,
The time is passing so slowly now,
Guess that's my life without you
(Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my everyday,
But baby, I don't want to.
So I'll just hang around, and find some things to do,
To take my mind off missing you.
(Take my mind off missing you)
And I know in my heart,
You can't say that you don't love me to,
Please say you do...
(Yeah)

You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile
The heart of a child
That's deep inside
Makes me purified

Fantasy, it gets the best of me

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

            <field name="lyrics">I just don't understand,
Why you're running from a good man baby,
Why you wanna turn your back on love,
Why you've already given up,
See I know you've been hurt before,
But I swear I'll give you so much more,
I swear I'll never let you down,
Cause I swear it's you that I adore,
And I can't help myself babe,
Cause I think about you constantly,
And my heart gets no rest over you...
(CHORUS)
You can call me selfish,
But all I want is your love,
you can call me hopeless, baby,
Cause I'm hopelessly in love,
You can call me unperfect,
But who's perfect?
Tell me what do I gotta do,
To prove that I'm the only one for you,
So what's wrong with being selfish?
I'll be taking up your time,
Till the day I make you realize,
That for you there could be no one else,
I've just gotta have you for myself,
Baby, I would take good care of you,
No matter what it is you're going through,
I'll be there for you when you're in need,
Baby, believe in me.
Cause if love is a crime,(hey, yeah)
Then punish me,
I would die for you,
Cause I don't want to live without you,
What can I do?
(CHORUS)
Why do you keep us apart,
Why won't you give up your heart,
You know that we're meant to be together.
(doo be doo)
Why do you push me away,
All that I want is to give you love,
Forever, and ever, and ever...
(CHORUS)
Selfishly I'm in love with you,
Cause I've searched my soul,
I know that it's you
(3X)
I'll prove that I'm the only one for you,
So what's wrong with being selfish?.</field>

Didn't know just what I had.
Now I toss and turn, cause I'm without you,
How I'm missing you so bad.
Where was my head?
Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark.
CHORUS:
I lie awake I drive myself crazy,
Drive myself crazy, thinking of you.
Made a mistake when I let you go baby.
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)
I was such a fool, I couldn't see it.
Just how good you were to me
You confessed your love, and dying devotion.
I confessed my need to be free.
And now I'm left with all this pain,
I've only got my self to blame.
Chorus
Why didn't I know how much I loved you baby?
Why didn't I show it? If only I showed it baby
Oh I had a chance!
Oh I had a chance!
La La La La La La La La La La La La
I Drive myself Crazy Ohhhhhhhh
Oh so crazy La La La La
Oh Oh Oh Oh...
I lie awake I drive myself crazy,
Drive myself crazy, thinkin' of you
Made a mistake when I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I drive myself (CRAZY,CRAZY,CRAZY,YEAH)
Made a mistake when I let you go baby I drive myself crazy,
Wanting you the way that I do,
Wanting you the way that I do.
Drive myself Crazy wanting you the way that I do.</field>

But you're not strong enough, or smart enough at all
But what seems right to them ,quite often might be wrong foryou
So be sure you try to climb before you get to scare you'll fall
You can be what you wanna be
Learn what you wanna learn
Believe in yourself, just believe in yourself
You can try what you need to try
No one should question why
Believe in yourself, just belive in yourself
Folks may say you're different
That you've gone and lost your senses
But the world is your to walk
Go ahead and leave the fences
And you'll see( and you'll see)
Belive in yourself
And the world belongs to you
You and me
And the world belongs to you and me</field>

Oh
Hey yeah yeah
Girl when we started baby we were friends
But that's not how this fairy tale is gonna end
See I was thinking then it clicked one day
(clicked one day)
That no one else has ever made me feel this way
Next time I saw you girl I knew I had to try
To tell you everything that I was feeling deep inside
And listen good 'cause what I say is from my heart
So if you're ready
You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (ooh) 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute (ooh) baby I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us, the two of us
'Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there telling you I care
This I swear
Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us
Baby I wonder if you feel the same as I do
I wonder if you're going through the things I'm going through
I sent you flowers on a Saturday (Saturday)
Inside's a letter with a message and no name
See I just love the feeling, knowing that I can make you smile
And I haven't felt that way about someone in quite a while
Just listen to these words I have to say (ooh)
Just take a chance (take a chance)
You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (ooh) 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute (ooh) baby I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us, the two of us
'Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there telling you I care
This I swear
Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us
It just gets better with each day (maybe someday)
I always wanted to tell you
But I was so afraid
You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (waiting for your call)
(ooh) 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
(gonna do it all)
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind

I wanna yell, somebody help
Is there a cure for what I've got
Somebody tell me
I need your lovin' face
I need your sweet embrace
'Cause you are my only medicine
U drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind
U drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies
U drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
U drive me crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free
You're on my mind I'm so uptight
I feel sensation in my head down to my spine
Going insane, can't stand the pain
Is my condition permanent, somebody tell me
I need your lovin' face
I need your sweet embrace
'Cause you are my only medicine
U drive me crazy

You are the cure and you know but you don't care
Girl you driving me insane
You can say what you want to
Do what you wanna do
As long as you love me, girl, I won't front you
You're the sweetest thing
Let me be your man
Let me hold your hand
Or let me be your friend
Meanwhile I will set the house
Up on hill
Girl as you know it's all about the dollar-bill
Gonna treat you like a queen
Like a lady
Chica, chico, you drive me crazy
You're always on my mind
Need you all the time
So come and get with me
'Cause darlin' you're the one I need
Someone to hold me tight
'Cause I can't sleep at night
You are my fantasy
Girl you drive me crazy
U drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind
U drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies
U drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
U drive me crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free.</field>

You kept me warm, you kept me warm
And You gave my life to me,
You set me free, you set me free
The finest years I ever knew
For all the years I had with you
(Chorus)
And I would give anything I own,
I'd Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again
You taught me how to love,
What a time, what a time
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you,
Nobody else could ever know
(Nobody else could ever know)
The part of me that can't let go
(Chorus)
And I would give everything I own,
I'd Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Is there someone you know,
You Loving them so,
But taking them all for granted.
You may lose them one day,
Someone takes them away,
And they don't hear the words you long to say (long to say )
Ev-ry-thing I own..
(Repeat about 2x)
You know baby my love For you
Always the truth, that's right
Cause there's no me without you
I would give anything I own,
Everything I own, Nobidy can love love love like I do
(Chorus)
And I would give everything I own,
I'd Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to have you back again</field>

Where it's warm here by the fire
Here with you, I have all that I desire
It's been a long year
But somehow we got by
Now it's Christmas Eve
And love is on our side
I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas
Children sing Christmas carols at our door
Spreading joy
That's what Christmas time is for
Though we don't have much
You've got me and I've got you
And with a little faith miracles come true
I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas
I don't want the love of any other girl
I want only one thing in this whole wide world
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas
Cheek to cheek
The lights are low
A kiss beneath the mistletoe
Your face lit by the fire's glow
That's all I want tonight
I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas.</field>

Would your arms lift me up to higher ground
With just the strength of your love
When I was lost
Would I find something in your eyes to lead me home
And if it all went wrong

But when the times get hard
Would you stay or walk away
(Chorus:)
Are you gonna be there when the rain comes
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch
Can you say you'll be there with a real love
Are you gonna be there
Will you stand by my side through the bad times
Through whatever we'll be will you still be mine
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime
Are you gonna be there
When I need someone to hold
Someone there for me
Are you gonna be there
In all my world
If it should all fall down
Will you be there
Be there to turn it around
Will you still care
Can I depend on you to see me through this life
If it all goes wrong
Will you still make it right
It's easy to be there through the good times
But when the times get hard
Will you still be on my side
(Chorus)
When I need someone beside me
Someone there for me
Are you gonna be
There with the arms to hold me
There with the love I need
Then will you be there
Will you be there
Heart and soul
I need to know
Are you gonna be there
Are you gonna still care
(Are you gonna still care)
Are you gonna be there
Will you stand by my side
(Stand by my side)
Are you gonna be mine
Are you gonna be there

When the night has come,
and the land is dark.
And the moon,
is the only light we'll see.
(Tim McGraw and JC)
No, I won't, be afraid
Oh I won't
Be afraid
Just as long as you
stand, stand by me.
(All)
So darlin', darlin'
stand...by me
Ohhhh stand by me (x2)
Stand by me,
Stand by me.
(Joey)
If the sky
that we look upon,
Should tumble and fall.
or the mountain,
Should crumble to the sea.
(Chris)
I won't cry, I won't cry.
No I won't shed a tear.
Just as long
As you stand
Stand by me.
(All)
So darlin', darlin'
Stand, by me.
Ohhhh stand by me.
Woahh stand now,
Stand by me.
Stand by me.
Stand by me.
Fire and Rain
(Tim McGraw)
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
(All)
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
(Justin)
Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You got to help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way.
oh yea
(All)
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby just one more time
Lean On Me
(Lance)
Sometimes in our lives
we all have pain
we all have sorrow
but if we are wise
we know that there's always tomorrow
(All)
Lean on me
when you're not strong
and i'll be your friend
i'll help you carry on
for it won't be long
till i'm gonna need
somebody to lean on
(Tim McGraw)

I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to love
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
And they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
Do, do, do, do

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk
Music's loud and feeling's warm
I've been doing it right since I was born
But that's all right
That's OK
We can look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
People stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
Yeah

So be sure you try to climb before you get to scare you'll fall
You can be what you wanna be
Learn what you wanna learn
Believe in yourself, just believe in yourself
You can try what you need to try
No one should question why
Believe in yourself, just belive in yourself
Folks may say you're different
That you've gone and lost your senses
But the world is your to walk
Go ahead and leave the fences
And you'll see( and you'll see)

Hey baby come on

When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie

It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie

Would you be so nice to me?
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me?
If I wasn't a celebrity
(Lately)
Ive been doing a little thinking
'Bout the things
That satisfy you
It's making me wonder
'Bout the things that
You see in me
I hate the way
You like to say your
Man's a celebrity
Baby what's the deal?
I thought you wanted me for me
You gotta say what you mean
You gotta mean what you say
Cause you keep pushing me away
'Cause I ain't got
No time to play
So I say
If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me?
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
Baby, if I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me?
If I wasn't a celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
I'm glad you're having a good time
Living the life that
I laid out for me
Constantly splurging
Spending my money
On everything you see
It would be different
If you had something,
Maybe like a
J-O-B
You need to
Get your thing together, yeah
You gotta stop running games
It ain't about my fame
Cause you know if things weren't this way
You'd be gone a long time ago, so I say
If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me?
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me?
If I wasn't a celebrity
If you really loved me
You'd try and show me
That it ain't even about my name
But you tried to use me
And lied to fool me
So it can never be the same
So now, I'm, leaving you behind
I've found somebody
Who can love me for me
And that's all I need, yeah, oh
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me?
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me?
If I wasn't a celebrity
If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me?
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me?

Can you imagine what it's like to always live without love
I need to have you in my life
I think I know that now
My open heart (open heart)
Make you a part (make you apart)
A part of this lovin I've been keepin (i've been keeping for you)
And I might just give it all to you
Oh ho

Every girl I meet
Though they might be sweet
They can't compare to you

Body starts to rock
And baby you can't stop
And the music's all you got
This must be Pop
Dirty Pop
Baby, baby you can't stop

Hesitating for somebody else to run and pass you by

Someone takes them away,
And they don't hear the words you long to say (long to say )

Yeah, 'N Sync, giddy up
(Gotta giddy up)
Like this, come on
Tried to get a hold of you last night
(Called you on the phone)
Thinking to myself something ain't right
(Girl were you alone)
Letting little things come between us
(All we do is fuss)
When all I wanna do is show you love
So I say
(Hold up) I'm tired of all these lies, yeah yeah
(Hold up) And if you wanna make things right, that's right
(Hold up) I'm tired of all these lies
(Hold up) 'Cause if you wanna make things right
You've got to giddy up
(Giddy up, giddy up) Giddy up now
(Giddy up, giddy up)
I gotta giddy up, giddy up
(Giddy up, giddy up) Giddy up now, yeah
(Giddy up, giddy up, gotta giddy up)
Remembering the way we used to be
(Everything was cool)
And now you've gone and done all this to me, babe (to me)
Maybe we can turn this love around
(Give it one more try)
You see, every time you're thinking about saying goodbye
I gotta say
(Hold up) I'm tired of all these lies
(Hold up) And if you wanna make things right, that's right
(Hold up) I'm tired of all these lies
(Hold up) 'Cause if you wanna make things right
You've got to
(Giddy up, giddy up) Giddy up now
(Giddy up, giddy up)
I gotta giddy up

Yeah, ride...giddy up, giddy up yeah
Ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it
Ride it, ride it, ride it
Giddy up, giddy up
You got to, you got to
You got to giddy giddy up
You got to, you got to

Tell me can this be real?
How can I put into words how I feel?
My life was complete

Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me?
Theres an angel
It's a miracle
CHORUS
Your love is like a river,
Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that its true,
God must have spent a little more time on you
In all of creations all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile
The heart of a child
That's deep inside
Makes me purified
CHORUS
Your love is like a river,
Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep

Seems so long ago you walked away,
Left me alone.
And I remember what you said to me,
You were acting so strange

And maybe I was too blind to see,
that you needed a change.
Was it something I said,
to make you turn away,
to make you walk out and leave me cold.
If I could just find a way...
to make it so that you were right here,
Right now

Now I don't want to make excuses baby,
won't change the fact that you're gone (oh no)
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know,
The time is passing so slowly now,
Guess that's my life without you
(Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my everyday,
But baby, I don't want to.
So I'll just hang around, and find some things to do,
To take my mind off missing you.
(Take my mind off missing you)
And I know in my heart,
You can't say that you don't love me to,
Please say you do...

Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day.
Come sit beside me in your way.
HA HA HA..
uh.
uh...
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
(Where would I be without my woman?)
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend a this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.
How deep is your love
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
breaking us down when they all should let us be
we belong to you and me.
Da DA Da....
How deep is your love
(beat box)
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk.
Music loud and women warm,
I've been kicked around since I was born.
And now it's all right, it's okay,
you may look the other way.
We can try to understand
the New York Times' effect on man.
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
and you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,
ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.

Thinking of the time I spent with you.
And I close my eyes,
I see the family,
Making out their wish list,
All dressed up for Christmas.
On my own for too many years,
I miss the happiness.
I miss the tears.
When I close my eyes,
and I'm all alone.
I think of all the love we shared.
When I need a friend,
Or a helping hand,
I know that you will all be there.
I've been gone for so many holidays.
But you can light the fire,
Cause this year, (this year)
I'll be home for Christmas Day.
I see the children playing in the snow,
Precious memories I used to know.
Then I see the love in a mother's eyes,
Always there to teach us,
The real meaning of Christmas.
On my own for too many years,
I miss the happiness.
I miss the tears.
When I close my eyes,
and I'm all alone.
I think of all the love we shared.
When I need a friend,
Or a helping hand,
I know that you will all be there.
I've been gone for too many holidays.
But you can light the fire,
Cause this year, (this year)
I'll be home for Christmas.
It doesn't matter how old you think you are.
Something happens to you,
When you see that shining star.
When I close my eyes,
and I'm all alone.
I think of all the love we shared.
When I need a friend,
Or a helping hand,
I know that you will all be there.
I've been gone for so many holidays.
But you can light the fire,
Cause this year, (this year)
I'll be home for Christmas.
When I close my eyes,
and I'm all alone.
I think of all the love we shared.
When I need a friend,
Or a helping hand,
I know that you will all be there.
I've been gone for so many holidays.
But you can light the fire,
I'm sending out a wire,
That this year,
I'll be home for Christmas Day.

            <field name="lyrics">How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cuz we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
Do, do, do, do
How deep is your love
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show
CHORUS:
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cuz we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest darkest doubt
You're my saviour when I fall
And you may not think
I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do
And it's me you need to show

            <field name="lyrics">I never believed in dreaming
It never got me very far
I never believed that love could find me
Like an arrow through the heart
I never believed in miracles
Or building castles in the air
Not until that day I found you
I turned around and you were there
From the day you came you gave me
A whole new point of view
I've been touched by an angel
It's impossible but true
(CHORUS)
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love will last always
I never believed in fairytales
Though sometimes I wish I could
I never believed that golden slippers
Could ever find the perfect foot
I never believed in magic
Or that wishes could come true
But your very first kiss
Changed all this something only you could do
You made me a believer
You made me trust again
You showed me there's a pot of gold
At every rainbow's end
(CHORUS)
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love will last always
Only love set you free
And if you serve to fate
Then you're my destiny
Now I know
Now I see
Anything can happen
If you just believe
(CHORUS)
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love will last always.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">This is the time of year, that we learn to give
And the greatest gift is learning to forgive.
We will have the best that time we ever knew
If you forgive me and I forgive you
I don't want to light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you
It's so hard to believe
We're staring at the end
When all we think about is starting up again
Whatever we lost, when we were apart
We'll find it all alone in the dark
I don't wanna light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you
There's nothing more that I want from you
Then to lie here together
And stay here forever with you
There's no one I ever knew
That I wanted to spend Christmas with, more than you....
I don't want to light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you
I don't want to light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you.</field>

Didn't know just what I had.
Now I toss and turn, cause I'm without you,
How I'm missing you so bad.
Where was my head?
Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark.
CHORUS:
I lie awake I drive myself crazy,
Drive myself crazy, thinking of you.
Made a mistake when I let you go baby.
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)
I was such a fool, I couldn't see it.
Just how good you were to me
You confessed your love, and dying devotion.
I confessed my need to be free.
And now I'm left with all this pain,
I've only got my self to blame.
Chorus
Why didn't I know how much I loved you baby?
Why didn't I show it? If only I showed it baby
Oh I had a chance!
Oh I had a chance!
La La La La La La La La La La La La
I Drive myself Crazy Ohhhhhhhh
Oh so crazy La La La La
Oh Oh Oh Oh...
I lie awake I drive myself crazy,
Drive myself crazy, thinkin' of you
Made a mistake when I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I drive myself (CRAZY,CRAZY,CRAZY,YEAH)
Made a mistake when I let you go baby I drive myself crazy,
Wanting you the way that I do,
Wanting you the way that I do.
Drive myself Crazy wanting you the way that I do.</field>

It's you I'm longing for
So girl don't stop

Keep going
Don't you konw that I
You couldn't comprehend
Me being just a friend
So you
Took it upon yourself
To make me yours
And not no one else, baby
So girl don't stop
What you're doing
Keep going
Cause you know that I
And all alone
I didn't have a clue
You wanted me to be the one
To have and to hold for your own
So now I know
That it's for real
Because I feel

Somethin about this special time of year
A blanket of snow falls down from the sky
Voices of angels
Open our hearts so we can open our arms

And we'll all join hands
To celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone
It must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time
Seein the face of the little boys and girls
Singing their First Noel
A sweet refrain heard all around the world
A song of forgiveness, comforting peace
A time to remember what life really means
(Life really means)
The important things (Important things)
(Chorus)
Guess it's Christmas time
Open our hearts so we can open our arms

Must have been a part of some great design

Lookin back on childhood days
I can't believe my foolish ways
Thought that Christmas only came from the stores
And to know what was there for me,
Underneath the Christmas tree
Didn't know that there could be so much more
But in all of the rush
I was missin so much
Girl, you make me finally see
(Chorus:)
I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Till you came into my life
I was lost in the dark
Till you opened my heart
Like an angel shining bright
I wished on a star
And girl here you are
Suddenly I realize
That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Until I looked into your eyes
Comin home for the Holidays
Seein friends from around the way
There was always something missin for me
On a sleigh ride caroling
Did it really mean anything?
Without that someone who can make it complete
While the snow's fallin down,
There was joy all around
Cuz girl, your love has shown me the way
(Chorus)
Fa la la Fa la la Fa la la la la la
Singin la la la la la la la la la la la la
Fa la la Fa la la Fa la la la la la
Singin la la la la la la la la la la la la
But in all of the rush
I was missin so much
Girl you make me finally see

That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Till I looked into your eyes</field>

Ooo..
yeah...
I'll (I'll)
I'll never stop
I don't know
Do you believe me
After all that's said and done
All the lies
How I regret them baby now
I am the loser
And you're shining like the sun
Tell me why can't I still be the one
Alright...
(chorus)
I will never stop until you're mine
I can wait forever 'til the end of time
'cause my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop
I'll never stop
How could I ever when my heart is in your hands
And I know baby there is no turning back
You Say that I'm crazy and I kind of understand
How I wish for this nightmare to end (oh yes)
I will never stop until you're mine
I can wait forever 'til the end of time
'cause my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop
I'll never stop
Ooo....
Do you believe me
When my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop
I will never stop (Ooh)
'til the end of time (I can wait forever)
(Heart is in your hands) My heart is in your hands
I'll never stop (I will never stop)
until you're mine
I can wait forever 'til the end of time
'cause my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop</field>

            <field name="lyrics">If I'm not the one you want
Take your time to figure out
Yeah
I'm staring at your picture every night
The scent of you still lingers in my mind
I wonder if you're alone and feel alright
and the sun has come out of the clouds
And sometimes when I listen to our song
The nights seem so cold and far too long
I wanna call you up cuz in the end
I keep writing letters to my garbage can
Lately, feels like I'm goin' crazy
And baby, come and lay down beside me
Chorus:
If I'm not the one you want (than who's he)
Take your time to figure out (and you'll see)
If I'm not the one you want (than maybe)
I'll be the one you need
I feel like it's on you I can depend
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Lived enough of building castles in the sand
Why can't we be forever
Lately, feels like I'm goin' crazy
And baby, come and lay down beside me
Chorus x2
Somewhere in the back of my mind
I know that you will be mine
And somehow, wish i could rewind
And leave all the worries behind
If I'm not the one you want
I'll be the one you need
(I'll be the one you need)
Take your time to figure out
I'll be the one you need
(I'll be the one you need)

            <field name="lyrics">I never thought you were a fair-weather friend
You never let me down, you're true to the end
For in the darkest hour when all was lost
Somehow you left the light on
You faced the wrong and showed the world a thing or two
Stood up for me and for you
And you should know
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you (losingyou)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday)Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's...
I still remember the things that you said
I keep your words alive, I could never forget
Cause in the final hour you made me proud
So proud that I could know you
Told the world it's time that they believed in you
You stood for right and truth
And you should know
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you(losing you)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday)Someday you'll see
If on ly through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's eyes
And so we can't forget
We've got to keep remembering
Them all(them all)
The ones who took the fall
They did it for us all
And we should learn from it
Stand up if you believe in it
You've got to face the world, be strong
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through ( things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you ( losing you )
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday)Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's...
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you (losing you)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday) Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes

Jingle all the way
(X4)
Christmas time is so special (special, special)
When you're kissing me (under the, under the)
Under the mistletoe
Exchanging loving gifts
Sitting in front of the tree
Me holding you and you holding me
(Chorus:)
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas
Last year, Christmas
It happened without us (out us out us)
I was all mixed up and confused
I didn't know what to do baby (What to do babe)
I never thought I'd feel this way
I always thought that Christmas was a happy day
I always prayed that Santa'd pack love on his sleigh
and send it my way
(Chorus)
What a beautiful time
(oh what a beautiful time it is)
Time it is
A time to open gifts, and play with all the kids
Yes, it's Christmas
(Yes, it's Christmas)
Yes, it's Christmas time again
(Christmas time again)
Girl I love you
(girl I love u baby)
Yes, I love you
(yes I love u baby)
It's Christmas time again (oh)
To be in love on Christmas
(girl I love u baby, yes I love you baby)
What a beautiful time it is
Happy time to open gifts
Yes now it's Christmas time
And I am yours
And you are mine
Oh when you're kissin' me
Right under my Christmas tree
Baby come close to me
Cuz this is how it should be!
(Chorus)
(Grandmamma, with my granddaddy, and my momma and my
daddy I'm with you on Christmas)</field>

I was hanging with the fellas
Saw you with your new boyfriend, it made me jealous
I was hoping that I'd never see you with him
But it's all good, 'cause I'm glad that I met him
Heh
'Cause now I know the competition's very slim to none
And I can tell by looking that he's not the one
He's not the type you said you liked
His style is wack, clothes are bad
Come on, girl, let him go
I want you back
JC:
Call me a hater, if you want to
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you
You could say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right
You can say I'm crazy, if you want to
That's true-- I'm crazy 'bout you
You could say I'm breakin' down inside
'Cause I can't see you with another guy
Chorus:
It makes me ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him
Oh, it makes me ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him
JC:
Girl I know that we broke up
But that doesn't mean you should give the cold shoulder
'Cause you know that I truly do adore ya
And that other guy can't do nothin' for ya
Uh
See
I can tell that you don't really love that guy
But there's no need for you to go and waste your time
I think you know I love ya more
Girl you gotta let him go
I want you so just give him the boot
Justin:
Call me a hater, if you want to
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you
You can say I'm trippin' if you feel like

You've got no choice babe

There ain't no time to waste,
You're just too blind to see
In the end you know it's gonna be me and
You can't deny
So just tell me why

I'm sick and tired hearing all these people study about
What's the deal with this school life and when is it gonna fade out?
The thing you've got to realise what we're doing is James Ruse trend
We've got the books ‘til insanity, we're gonna study to the end
C’mon now...
It doesn't matter
'Bout the textbooks that I balance on my head
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about results
It doesn't matter
'Bout the books I read, or what I learn and why
All that matters
Is that we're the best and we top you every time
C’mon now...
Do you every wonder why
The study gets you high?
It takes you on a ride
You feel it when your
Brain starts to fry
Your social life will die
And the books' are all you've got
This must be...RUSE!
Techy Ruse
Nerd, nerd you can't stop
I know you love this
Techy Ruse
This must be...
Now, why is the highest UAI your passion through and through?
Why can't you chill and do the things you once used to do?
If a day without your math book will cut like a knife,
Drop your pens and burn your notes and go and get a life...
It doesn't matter
That I don't need a calculator
All that matters
Is that you recognize it's just about results
It doesn't matter
'Bout the news I watch, or news I read, and why
All that matters
Is that we're the best and we'll top you anytime
C’mon
Do you every wonder why (why?)
The study gets you high? (gets you high)
It takes you on a ride
You feel it when your
Brain starts to fry (brain starts to fry)
Your social life will die (life will die)
And the books’ are all you got (nerd, c'mon!)
This must be...
Oooooh, I'll never get tired of study
Techy, techy, techy
Techy Ruse
Do you ever wonder wonder wonder why
Do you every wonder why (ever wonder why?)
The study gets you high? (study gets you high)
It takes you on a ride
You feel it when your
Brain starts to fry (brains start to fry)
Your social life will die (life will die)
And the books’ are all you got (c'mon now)

Do you every wonder why (every wonder why?)

I kind of noticed, from one night
>From the club, your front face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face will change
If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber
If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
People are so phony
Nosy coz they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin
When it doesn't matter anyway
Coz we're here tonight
If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Baby just remember
Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance
To be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance
To be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket
And then ...
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl ...
[RAP]
Ma, what chu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
>From them you heard "wow, it's the same glow"
Look at me, I say "yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my air of life
You have sleepin in the same bed, er'night
Go rock with me, you deserve the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumpin N.E.R.D
in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play this free, joint called "brain"
Ma, take a hint
Make me suerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J
Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl ...
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
Break this down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a
little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, [drums]
It's kind of special right? yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance.</field>

I know great distance still remains between us
But there's good reason to hold on
It's the happiest time of the year
Filled with laughter and good cheer
As you watch the snow
Sweet love, you'll hear me say
Chorus:
You've got my heart on Christmas
Inside my soul, your love remains
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day
The days and weeks and months go by so slowly
We are both wishing it would fly oh
As the night begins to fall
Twilight drowns the bedroom cheer
Such a rush with joy (rush with joy)
And love, it comforts me
And I do believe
Chorus 2:
Love's in our hearts on Christmas
Though far apart
As one we pray
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day
A snowflake melts
In your eye it turns to a tear
But your cheek, it stays dry
With your warm smile so near
I have no fear
We're gonna make it
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo

When the snow is glistening on the trees outside

Waiting for Santa to arrive

The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of year for the family

Feel the love in the room from the floor to the ceiling

With a message from above
God sends you His love and
Everything's OK

When I'm tired and I think I'm cold
I hide in my music and forget the day
And dream of a girl that I used to know
Close my eyes and she slipped away
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby you're not the only one
Ooh yeah, hey yeah
I see the things he does to you
All the pain that he puts you through
And I see what's really going on
Staying out at night while you're by the phone
Take it from me, it's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me, see I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of
Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it here's my heart
No Strings Attached
He doesn't give you the kind of attention
That a girl like you needs (that a girl like you needs)
'Cause he always looks around, his eyes wander round
He doesn't see you like I see, yeah
Take it from me, it's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me, see I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of
Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love

If you take a chance with me
I'll be everything you need (everything you need)

On the line to show you
I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
Another dead-end street, another love gone wrong
Another shattered dream, always the same old song
I started thinking that, you'll never come along
I got all this love inside, that so low was denied
I wish you knew what I've been through to get to you
I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
When you smile, I feel my heart open
And I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
I'm layin' it
On the line this time
Just to be with you
After everything my heart's been through
I treasure every moment I spend with you
for me to feel this way is something new
Now it's got ahold of me, it's making me believe
That what we've got is something unlike any other
I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
I'll never let you go
On the line for your love

Just to be with you
* If you're thinking what I'm thinking
* All you gotta do is say the word (say the word)
* If you tell me what you're needing
* I can give you what you're asking for (asking for)
Well I didn't have a prayer, I thought nobody cared
Turned around and you were there
I have been waiting for you (waiting for you baby)
And I want you to know (I want you to know)
On the line to show you
That I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more

And I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do (nothing that I wouldn't

I'm sick and tired of hearin' all these people talk about...
What's the deal with this pop life and when is it gonna fade out?
The thing you've got to realize what we're doin' is not a trend
We got the gift of melody, we're gonna bring it 'till the end
It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive, or what I wear around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about respect
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear and where I go and why
All that matters
Is that you get hype and we'll do it to you everytime
Chorus
Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high
It's takes you on a ride
Feel it when your
Body starts to rock
And baby you can't stop
And the music's all you got
This must be POP!
Dirty pop
Baby, baby you can't stop
I know you like this
Dirty pop
This must be...
Now why you want to try to classify the type of thing we do?
'Cause we're just fine doin' what we like can we say the same for you
I'm tired of feelin' all around me animosity
Just worry 'bout yours 'cause I'm a get mine now people can't you see
It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive or the ice around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize thats it's just about respect
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear and where I go and why
All that matters
Is that you get hype and we'll give it to you everytime

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free
Fantasy, it gets the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?
Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free
Well it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me

Why you wanna turn your back on love,
Why you've already given up,
See I know you've been hurt before,
But I swear I'll give you so much more,
I swear I'll never let you down,
Cause I swear it's you that I adore,
And I can't help myself babe,
Cause I think about you constantly,
And my heart gets no rest over you...
(CHORUS)
You can call me selfish,
But all I want is your love,
you can call me hopeless, baby,
Cause I'm hopelessly in love,
You can call me unperfect,
But who's perfect?
Tell me what do I gotta do,
To prove that I'm the only one for you,
So what's wrong with being selfish?
I'll be taking up your time,
Till the day I make you realize,
That for you there could be no one else,
I've just gotta have you for myself,
Baby, I would take good care of you,
No matter what it is you're going through,
I'll be there for you when you're in need,
Baby, believe in me.
Cause if love is a crime,(hey, yeah)
Then punish me,
I would die for you,
Cause I don't want to live without you,
What can I do?
(CHORUS)
Why do you keep us apart,
Why won't you give up your heart,
You know that we're meant to be together.
(doo be doo)
Why do you push me away,
All that I want is to give you love,
Forever, and ever, and ever...
(CHORUS)
Selfishly I'm in love with you,
Cause I've searched my soul,
I know that it's you
(3X)
I'll prove that I'm the only one for you,
So what's wrong with being selfish?.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">She stood out just like a diamond lady
Amongst the tourists in a crowded room
I took her walking on the sandy beaches
Under a silver Carribean moon
That's when she promised that
And I promised this
And till this day I can still picture it
She took my hand
And I took her kiss
So temporary these moments of bliss
CHORUS:
Some dreams just fade away
Like yesterday's sunset
Some dreams are made to stay
She's one dream I'll never forget
Everyday just seemed to go too quickly
And ever night just passed us in a blur
I never noticed the blue skies and waters
Because I only had eyes for her
And so when she promised that
And I promised this
And to this day I can still picture it
She took my hand
And I took her kiss
So temporary these moments of bliss
REPEAT CHORUS
Roll back
Those crazy summer days
Stroll back
I'll find you through the haze

I thought I held it in my hands
But just like grains of sand
Love slipped through my fingers
So many nights
I asked the Lord above
Please make me lucky enough
To find a love that lingers
Something keeps telling me
You could be my answer prayer
You must be heaven sent
I swear
(Chorus)
Cause something happens when you look at me
I forget to speak
Something happens when you kiss my mouth
My knees get so weak
Could it be true this is what God has meant for me
Cause baby I can't believe something like you
Could happen to me
Girl in your eyes
I feel your fire burn (feel your fire)
All your secrets I will learn
Even if it takes forever
With you by my side
I can do anything(can't do anything)
I don't care what tommorrow brings
As long as we're together
My heart is telling me
That you could be my meant to be
I know it more each time
We touch

Something magical(something magical)
Something spiritual(something spiritual)
Something stronger than the two of us alone( yea)
Something physical
Something undeniable
Nothing like anything(nothing like anything)

Come in, over
Yo, turn me up
I wanna be heard
See I'm talkin' about the future ya'll
And the future looks bright
'specially when we rip it in half
Here it comes (Millennium)
And everybody's talkin 'bout Jerusalem
Is this the beginning or beginning of the end
Well, I've got other thoughts my friend
See I've got my eyes on the skies
The heavenly bodies up high
And if you're in the mood to take a ride
The strap on a suit and get inside
Chorus
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby

Whi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo
We don't need all these prophecies
Tellin' us what's a sign, what's a sign
'Cause paranoia ain't the way to live your life from day to day
So leave your doubts and fears behind
Don't be afraid at all
'Cause up in outer space there's no gravity to fall
Put your mind and body to the test
'Cause up in outer space it's like the wild wild west
Chorus-repeat
Boom and never let you try and stop me
Born to fly sky high, up to the top see
Nothing to fear, no doubts and no tears
Millennium sound to motivate the future years
And you can either be scared or get prepared
Against all odds I bet you never would've dared
To make these moves and take a flight like me
To come through for the world prophecy
Space connect to overthrow your interception,
Ready or not, make it hot
That ain't no question
Get *NSYNC and put your head to the sky
Keep the faith
One love from Left Eye (Left Eye)

We were born the same day
We even think the same way
It couldn't be more right
We are what they call a perfect match

There's just one thing
A part that is missing
You don't seem to care at all

Tell me, tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you
Tell me, tell me, just how

Why-y, tell me, my baby
Now from the moment we met
I thought that I was all set
How could I be so wrong
Now I'm hearing that you're seeing someone new
And I wanna know who
But does he love you like I do my baby
But I promise you this one thing
Whatever that's missing
I will make it up to you
So tell me baby
CHORUS - Repeat
For getting under my skin
For messing up my mind
For never letting me into your life
Tell me baby how come you don't wanna love me
And am how am I supposed to live without
If there is no way to make you feel the same way too
F*%$ you...
Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me
We were born the same day

We are what they all call a perfect match
Tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me

Why can't you love me?

First time
I saw her at the front door
That girl
Her face on every billboard
Hands down
You won't believe the way she laid her eyes on me
Six feet
What was I thought I got I'd get for
So fly
We got into a small talk
Too bad
She had to move along
One smile and she was gone
Can't explain
I never thought that I was gonna lose my head
Call me insane
There's got to be a way
How can I get next to her?
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done
Will I win or lose this one?
Don't care about the fact
She's in a different league
They say it's no use that I try
That girl will never be mine
Next thing
She's livin' in my TV
And that girl
Is stealin' every daydream
Tough love
She had to be the one for me
When I just sing away
Last night ran into a big thing
Guess what
She didn't wanna see me
They said I was outta line
Who's wrong, who's right this time?
Can't explain
I never thought that I was gonna lose my head
Call me insane
There's got to be a way
How can I get next to her?
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done
Will I win or lose this one?
Don't care about the fact
She's in a different league
They say it's no use that I try
That girl will never be mine
That girl
Is freakin' me out
Don't care about the fact
That she's all that
That girl
Is pullin' out the down
There's no way for me to stop
That girl
Tearin' up the big screen
That girl
Stealin' every daydream
Tough love
She had to be the one for me
She will be mine
No matter what they try to say
There's got to be a way
How can I get next to her?
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done
Will I win or lose this one?

Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Born is the King of Israel
The first noel
The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
(Chorus)
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the herd
It gave grand light
And so it continued both day and night
(Chorus)
They spied, the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a king was their intent and
To follow that star where ever it went

I was checkin it twice
In the middle of this, I got tears in my eyes
For in my foolish heart, there was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you
I was trimming the tree
I was stringing the lights
While the radio played "Silent Night"
There were presents you sent
Though there were quite a few
The only gift I wanted was you
(Chorus:)
You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles glow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you
As the bitter-sweet night had come to an end
I was saying goodbye to our family and friends
And they all wished me well
And I knew that I knew
The only gift I wanted was you
(Chorus)
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la la
Ohhhhh, Ohhhhh
The only gift I wanted was you
(Chorus)
I was makin my list
I was checkin it twice
In the middle of this, I got tears in my eyes
For in my wishful heart, there was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you
For in my wishful heart, there was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you</field>

Oh
Hey yeah yeah
Girl when we started baby we were friends
But that's not how this fairy tale is gonna end
See I was thinking then it clicked one day
(clicked one day)
That no one else has ever made me feel this way
Next time I saw you girl I knew I had to try
To tell you everything that I was feeling deep inside
And listen good 'cause what I say is from my heart
So if you're ready
You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (ooh) 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute (ooh) baby I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us, the two of us
'Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there telling you I care
This I swear
Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us
Baby I wonder if you feel the same as I do
I wonder if you're going through the things I'm going through
I sent you flowers on a Saturday (Saturday)
Inside's a letter with a message and no name
See I just love the feeling, knowing that I can make you smile
And I haven't felt that way about someone in quite a while
Just listen to these words I have to say (ooh)
Just take a chance (take a chance)
You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (ooh) 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind

Baby I'll be there telling you I care
This I swear
Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us
It just gets better with each day (maybe someday)
I always wanted to tell you
But I was so afraid
You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (waiting for your call)

(Nowles/Rich/Shipley)
(1st verse sung by Chris)
Ohhh..oh...
Lying in your arms
So close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn
Cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad
Where was my head?
Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark
I lie awake
I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you...
Made a mistake
When I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
Wanting you the way that I do
I was such a fool
I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me (Just how good you were to me)
You confessed your love (you confessed your love)
Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free...
And now I'm left
With all this pain
I've only got myself to blame...yeah...
I lie awake
I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you...
Made a mistake
Let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do (wanting you the way that I do)
Why...didn't I know it
How much I loved you baby?
Why couldn't I show it
If I had only told you
When I had the chance
Oh I had the chance...
(guitar break)
Wanting you the way that I do...
I lie awake
I drive myself crazy
I drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake (made a mistake)
Let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I lie awake
I drive myself crazy (I drive, myself crazy, crazy, crazy...yeah)
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake
Let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I drive myself crazy.</field>

When the visions around you, bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrond you, are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope, keeping your faith when its gone
The one you should call, was standing here all along
And I will take you in my arms, and hold you right where you belong
'Til the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you
I've loved you forever, in lifetimes before
And I promise you never, will you hurt anymore
I give you my word, I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow forever has now begun
Just close your eyes, each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away, nooo
'Til the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you
Over and over I fall, when I hear you call
Without you in my life baby
I just wouldn't be living at all
And I will take, (I will take you in my arms), you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong)
'Til the day my life is through, this I promise you baby
Just close your eyes, each loving day(each loving day)
And know this feeling won't go away, (no)
Every word I say is true, this I promise you
Every word I say is true, this I promise you

I promise the best part is

slow dance together
two become one
that's what we've waited all day for
no one else but me and you
nothin i would rather do
than hold you all through the night under my tree
bring along the mistle toe
keep the music nice and low
i'll show how good it could be
i wish that santa could be here to see
it's beautiful under my tree
the fire's aglow
we've got Nat King Cole
singing us a song from his heart
sleigh bells and snow
makes us feel close
to the stars
when the carols are sung
and the fire has died
the amber stills burns with the love in our eyes
cherish the moment
savor the night
that's what we've waited all day for
No one else but me and you
Nothin i would rather do
than hold you all through the night uunder my tree
bring along the mistletoe
keep the music nice and low
i'll show you how good it could be
i wish that santa could be here to see

no one but you
sweet rendevous

            <field name="lyrics">You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see you up, up against the wall
Two step
I was just doin' my thing
Hanging out at the spot
You know the place we go
The music's John Blaze hot
And everybody was feeling the DJ
Smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady
The lights went low and the disco ball came down
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now
The girl was fine and she knew she had game
What more do I have to say
CHORUS
She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grinding
She already had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
You know we don't care at all
(Just get caught up when you're up against the wall)
(We don't, we don't care at all)
You know we don't care at all, let, let me see up, up against the wall
It's almost 2 o'clock
It's time to make my move
The after hours spot
Is where I'm going to
'Cause I gotta have some more
Looking for somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me I see a fine young lady's eyeing me
The lights are low and her friends were all around
I walked up to her so and you know what happens now
She turned around and she worked it the worst way
What more do I have to say
She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grinding
She already had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
She already had me up against the wall
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the cutest one you saw?
She's underneath the disco ball
The disco ball? The disco ball.
Standing next to strobe lights, dancin' hot, lookin' tight
The freaks sure do come out at night, out at night, night, night, night
What more (whoo) do I have to say
Two step
She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grinding
She already had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grinding
She already had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
I just got caught up when you had me up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see you up, up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see you up, up against the wall.</field>

They just like us 'cause they think that we are fine and good looking
But we know is not true
We really don't care, all we want is there money
Our fans don't like us but we threaten them anyway!
We wanted to become more depedent by ourselves
That's why we copy Backstreet and sued Lou Pearlman
After we layed in bed with him we didn't like his sex and ideas
So that's why we decided to sue him.
Because it's all for the money not the career
Yeah

Ahh what's going on
Ja Rule:
What's going on in a world filled with pain
Where's the love for which we pray

When our children can't play
Homeless can't eat
There's got to be a better way
What's going on
When we politically blind
Can't see the signs of endangered times
What's going on

Nelly:
What's going on 'cross seas
Every minute a child dies by this disease
In record numbers indeed
Got momma's crying out please
My baby hold on
My child ain't done nothing wrong
Still I want to holler
Ask them why they don't bother
Oh no, oh no
Make me turn to my father
And ask him why they all got a trapped soul, trapped soul
Nas:
I can feel what was bothering Marvin
Why his words forever remain
Dealing with these modern day problems
'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents
Too many infected
Too many lives diminishing
Nobody say Protestants, Jews, Blacks, and Whites, Latinos andAsians
Pray together
Less fight
We better unite
As genocide chemical war
And the rich and the poor
Know that God delivers a cure
Eve:
It's a shame our reality is devastating
People praying for a cure
Dying while they're waiting
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it
All the kids with dreams
Won't get the chance to chase it
Makes me sad
Think about the lives they would've had
Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads
How can we sit back and not try to make it right
We gotta come together
We gotta fight for life
Fred Durst:
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
We got human beings using humans for a bomb
But everyone wanna live
Don't nobody really want to die
You feeling me right
I can't be watching people die
(die)
And watching people cry
Let me break it down for a minute
If there's enough room here for you and me
There's plenty of room for some humanity
Somebody tell me what's going on

Somebody tell me what's going on

Somebody tell me what's going on

The love that we had was like a work of art
I used to see heaven in your eyes
Now angels are falling from your skies
The things we said were so wrong
And I haven?t held you for so long
My foolish pride turns me inside
Why did we tell all those lies
If you can reach for the phone
You don?t have to be alone
Outside the wind it seems so cold
Your heart is frozen like the snow (snow)
And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm
Your eyes are red because you?ve cried (cried)
You fell asleep by the fireside (fireside)
but there?s one thing you should know
On this Christmas baby, you don?t have to be alone
And I had only one wish on my list
For me you would be the perfect gift
There?s nothing colder than an empty home
(empty home)
And holidays were never meant to be alone
(to be alone)
The smiles we gave when our hearts were saved
By each others? love and warmth
That's subsided now no happiness around
If I can only find a way to your heart
Outside the wind it seems so cold
Your heart is frozen like the snow
And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm
Your eyes are red because you?ve cried
You fell asleep by the fireside
but there?s one thing you should know
on this Christmas baby, you don?t have to be alone
(Bridge:)
You don?t have to be alone
You don?t have to be all alone (at Christmas)
You don?t have to be alone
You don?t have to be all alone
Outside the wind it seems so cold
Your heart is frozen like the snow
And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm
Your eyes are red because you?ve cried
You fell asleep by the fireside
but there?s one thing you should know
on this Christmas baby, you don?t have to be alone</field>

I'm feeling weak, I cannot sleep
My head is burning, I feel cold down to my feet
I wanna yell, somebody help
Is there a cure for what I've got
Somebody tell me

I need your sweet embrace
'Cause you are my only medicine

Do what you wanna do
As long as you love me, girl, I won't front you
You're the sweetest thing
Let me be your man
Let me hold your hand
Or let me be your friend
Meanwhile I will set the house
Up on hill

Gonna treat you like a queen
Like a lady
Chica, chico, you drive me crazy
You're always on my mind
Need you all the time
So come and get with me
'Cause darlin' you're the one I need
Someone to hold me tight
'Cause I can't sleep at night
You are my fantasy
Girl you drive me crazy

Why are you tellin' all these lies

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burnin and then you're gone
Lookin' out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive

About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's a destiny
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all.
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain.
Why should I complain.
But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all...
So the winner...
Takes it all...
And the loser...
Has to fall...
Throw a dice...
Cold as ice...
Way down here...
Someone dear...
Takes it all...
Has to fall...</field>

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring

Bye bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever

I remember long ago
another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself
and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life
and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night
we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were
to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again

Yes, if I had to do the same again

You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more
like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you

Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before

A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark
And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end
Masters of the scene
We've done it all before and now we're back to get
some more
You know what I mean
Voulez-vous
Take it now or leave it
Now is all we get
Nothing promised, no regrets
Voulez-vous
Ain't no big decision
You know what to do
La question c'est voulez-vous

I know what you think
The girl means business so I'll offer her a drink
Looking mighty proud
I see you leave your table, pushing through the crowd
I'm really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game

But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the
Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
(Super Trouper)
Smiling, having fun
(Super Trouper)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Super Trouper)
Like I always do
(Super Trouper)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
(Still I'm thinking about you only)
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be alright
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the
Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
(Super Trouper)
Smiling, having fun
(Super Trouper)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Super Trouper)
Like I always do
(Super Trouper)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the
Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
(Super Trouper)
Smiling, having fun
(Super Trouper)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue

And I'm watching the late show
in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T
V
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day</field>

Written by: Benny Andersson,
Stig Anderson,
Björn Ulvaeus
Recording began 23rd March 1976
at Metronome Studio
No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house,
tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends,
this is goodbye
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it,
this time we're through
(This time we're through,
this time we're through
This time we're through,
we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy,
I know but I have to go
(I have to go this time
I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
Mem'ries (mem'ries),
good days (good days),
bad days (bad days)
They'll be (they'll be),
with me (with me) always (always)
In these old familiar rooms children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it,
this time we're through
(This time we're through,
this time we're through
This time we're through,
we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy,
I know but I have to go
(I have to go this time
I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do</field>

they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
SOS
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
SOS
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on
You seemed so far away though you were standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
SOS
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
SOS
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on

Honey I'm still free

If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me
(That's all I ask of you honey)
Take a chance on me
We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're
together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know
you better
'Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone
with you
It's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love
affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling

If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me
(Come on, give me a break will you)
Take a chance on me
Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know
I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't
gonna let you
Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough to last when
things are rough
It's magic
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off
my mind
No I can't let go
'Cos I love you so
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling
down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds
have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me

So stay on the ground girl
You better not get too high

You'll never get rid of me

I want you to know
One of us is crying
one of us is lying
in her lonely bed
staring at the ceiling
wishing she was
somewhere else instead
one of us is lonely
one of us is only
waiting for a call
sorry for herself
feeling stupid feeling small
wishing she had never left at all
I saw myself
as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
from the heat and the action
just like a child
stubborn and misconceiving
that's how I started the show
one of us had to go
now I've changed and
I want you to know

Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me</field>

Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time

I was an impossible case
No-one ever could reach me

There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know
What's the name of the game
Does it mean anything to you
What's the name of the game
Can you feel it the way I do
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow
And you make me talk
And you make me feel

What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down
Would you laugh at me
If I said I care for you
Could you feel the same way too

What's the name of the game
I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited

Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me

            <field name="lyrics">Last night I was taking
A walk along the river
And I saw him
Together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her
Made me shiver
'cause he always used to
Look at me that way
And I thought
Maybe I should walk
Right up to her and say
It's a game he likes to play
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
Sometimes when I'm lonely
I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember
All the good times
When I thought I
Could never live without him
And I wonder
Does it have to be the same
Every time
When I see him
Will it bring back all the pain
How can I forget that name
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
He took my heart
And now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
(keep thinking
Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
Keep thinking
Keep thinking I had to pay the price)</field>

Like an image passing by, my love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
(See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely
(Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only
I've watched you look away
Tell me is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through
Like an image passing by, my love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
(See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely
(Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Yes I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only</field>

Ain't it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams
I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave
I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa
All the things

If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still, strange as it seems to me
You brought it back to me
That old feeling
I, I don't know what you do
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me
You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
I, I'm gonna make you mine
You're gonna feel so fine
You'll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
Please, believe me
You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be

And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die.</field>

A walk along the river
And I saw him
Together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her
Made me shiver
'cause he always used to
Look at me that way
And I thought
Maybe I should walk
Right up to her and say
It's a game he likes to play
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
Sometimes when I'm lonely
I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember
All the good times
When I thought I
Could never live without him
And I wonder
Does it have to be the same
Every time
When I see him
Will it bring back all the pain
How can I forget that name
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
He took my heart
And now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
(keep thinking
Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
Keep thinking
Keep thinking I had to pay the price)</field>

I just have to move along
Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
When you wake I know you'll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
For a no-good bum like me
To live is to be free
Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations.</field>

Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma

Gotta have you near

And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep
How could I make such a dumb mistake
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive
'Cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma

And the memories filled with tears
And I feel my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees
The rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
The rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
The rain fell softly on your face

Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it but you know you're fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
I watched the ship leaving harbour at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
I'm sorry Cassandra.</field>

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go

You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving

But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more
like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it

Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cos I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before
And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl
And I realise
It's a crazy world
As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever dreamed
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about
And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl
And I realise
It's a crazy world
Baby, how could you do it
You just told me lies
Had you been behind my back with other guys
Baby how could you tell me
There was only me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see
Then you smiled and you took my hand
There is something, you said, that you may not know
There's a couple of men in my life,
And one of them is my brother Joe
He's been gone for a long long time
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way
And I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
And I realise
It's a crazy world
So I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl

            <field name="lyrics">Oh, my love it makes me sad
Why did things turn out so bad
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had
Baby, give me one more dance
While the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye
Yes, all we have to do is
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye
Yet it seems to make me sad
Why did things turn out so bad
Was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had
Baby, give me one last dance
While the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away
You tell me it's over, what more can I say
So dance while the music still goes on
It's gonna be our last goodbye
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying

Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burnin and then you're gone
Lookin' out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene

I can see your face in all of my dreams
Smiling, laughing from the shadows
When I hear your voice I know what it means
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try
You're all the reason for my life
Disillusion, disillusion is all you left for me
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have
Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd
Thinking, wondering, what you're doing
I can't stop myself from crying out loud
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
But then, they never shared our love
Disillusion, disillusion is all you left for me
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have</field>

Are driving you wild
Ah, but girl you're only a child
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching
For that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me
A flash of that smile (smile)

You've been living in a dream world
Trust me
You just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we've gotta make it together
And we've made it so far, so it can only get better
When you reach out
And you say to me
How I love you girl
When I hold you
Baby can't you see
It's a real dream world
You had your hopes and your high expectations
Somehow it doesn't seem right
I'm getting fed up with your accusations
I'm not your angel in white
Dream world
You've been living in a dream world

When you play your violin
Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Wish I was, dum-dum-diddle, your darling fiddle
But I think you don't know that I exist
I'm the quiet kind, woah-oh
From the day when I first listened to you
You've been on my mind, woah-oh
You don't care
It's not fair
And you're only smiling

They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I?m an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flyin? high, high
I?m a bird in the sky
I?m an eagle that rides on the breeze high, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There?s no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreamin? or is it all real
Is it true I?m an eagle
Is it true I can spread my wings
Flyin? high, high
I?m a bird in the sky
I?m an eagle that rides on the breeze high, high

I remember long ago
another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself
and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life
and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night
we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were
to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando</field>

Take a sip from

Free as a bumble bee
While away each lazy hour
What a good life
Lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life

Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend
Sleep is waiting round the bend
While you travel through the milky way
From a far
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.
Raindrops on a window pane
Stillness of a summer rain
Silently the haze drifts through the trees
Slowly dawn is breaking through
Yet a morning without you
Curtins rustling in the breeze
I'm still trapped within my dreams
Daylight makes it's way into my mind
Coming through
Yet another morning without you.
Finally when darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes backs to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew
Half awake in half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room.
I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room</field>

And I'm watching the late show
in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T
V
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Then you say you'll be patient
Still I see that she makes you blue
Come on, I'll give you consolation
Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna bring you some light
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna make it all right
You're all I ever need, my darling
Just to be where you wanna be
So much fun we could have then
To be yours for eternity
What a miracle to happen
Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Wanna sing you my lovesong, when I think about you
I know she doesn't make it easy
'Cause you don't please her like you please me
You're my love, you're my angel
You're my first, you're my last
Would she care if you lingered
For another night
Wanna hold you tight
We could make it right
Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna bring you some light
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna make it all right
I know she doesn't make it easy
Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Wanna sing you my lovesong, when I think about you
You're all I ever need, my darling
And I would love to sing my lovesong.</field>

When the air gets cold then I think of us
Of you and I
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears
And I feel my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees
The rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
The rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced.</field>

Out to the airport to get on the plane
Hey Honolulu, we're going to happy Hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii
After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans oh-ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance
Guess I've been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii
It's so exciting, why should I pretend
In a few hours the plane will descend
Hey Honolulu, we're going to happy Hawaii
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey Honolulu, we're going to happy Hawaii
After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans oh-ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance,
Ummm
I've got a feeling the dream will come true
Somebody's waiting and I'll forget you

And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die.</field>

and my life was so empty
there was nothing left to live for
but then it happened one night
as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying
as though he was praying: “ah –
Treat him well, he is your brother
you might need his help one day
we depend on one another
love him that’s the only way
on the road that we’re going
we all need words of comfort and compassion
treat him well, he is your brother
love him that’s the only way”
I was a woman never thinking of others
and my life was so lonely
didn’t care for anybody
but then I happened to meet
a begging man in the street
as I turned down his praying
I heard someone saying: “ah –
Treat him well, he is your brother
you might need his help one day
we depend on one another
love him that’s the only way
on the road that we’re going

The kind of girl
Who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it
Others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She?s a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation
She keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown
Jungles every day
She?s a girl
With a taste for the world
(the world is like a playing-ground
Where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet
In a whirl of lace
She?s extreme
If you know what I mean
Her man is one I admire
He?s so courageous
But he?s constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says
?that?s all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you?re alone
Now we?d better hurry?
And with no trace of hesitation
She keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown
Jungles every day
She?s a girl

Likes to do whatever she feels)
And she goes

And you lift me up in a wave of love...
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth ?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
When I feel alone
I reach for you
And you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice
And it carries me
In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth ?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth

We'll make heaven a place on earth

A friendly old man
His hair is just a little grey
Below his hat's red band
With shiny buttons on his coat
And a cash-box in his hand
He seems to know quite well
What we are asking for sometimes
Hello old man
Can you show us the way we have to go?
So we can reach where we're wanting to
Hello old man
Maybe it's folk like us that get things wrong sometimes
You have got all the things we find hard to get
Although he seems quite tired sometimes
Out there, he'll always be
To light a way for someone
Who could not otherwise see
But although he has been standing there
For many years, each day
It seems as if he had just arrived yesterday
Hello old man
Can you show us the way we have to go?
So we can reach where we're wanting to

When it's bad, worse, worst

Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose
It's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool
But on all weekends
(Together again)
When I meet my friends
(I'm gonna see them now)
And we're lookin' 'round for the action we sure play it cool
It's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
You paint your world and use all colours
And then you find it all comes out too bright
You know it's only a lie
The songs you sing are too romantic
And when you want the truth
They only spit in your eye
Oh yeah, they're only tellin' you lies
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, way down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst

Independent and free
And ambitious, that's me
Fighting for fame and success
And I'm tough too, you see
No she's not, just ask me
Singing and dancing
Is what like best
I am an A
I'm a B

Don't like to spend every dime
But I love my guitar
And I drive in my car
Scares me to death every time
And I don't like to shave
You should live in a cave
No, I feel more at home on the stage

With my group it's ok
You're group? You're kidding?

I am gentle and mild
Underneath it I'm wild
Craziest woman I've met
I'm romantic they say
But it's not quite that way
I'm down to earth, yes indeed
And I like early nights
So I turn off the lights
And I never get any chances to read
I am an A
I'm a B
He is ok

And I'm living quite fast
I like to travel and sea
I can play day and night
If the feeling's all right
And it's sometimes a problem for me
I can play 'In The Mood'
I like wine, I like food
Now that's something
He just can't deny
But I'm the talented one
With a place in the sun
When he's not bragging
He's quite a nice guy
I am an A
I'm a B
He is ok
So is she
Singing together in harmony
I am an A
I'm a B
He is okay
So is she
Singing together in harmony

I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he says he loves you, and life has just begun
It's so much more than any words can say
I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true

And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size
And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified
Welcome to me here I am, my arms are open wide
Somewhere in the middle of the neverending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets
People come and take their chances
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil, the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me
Yes I am the city you let me be
People feed me with their lives I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil, the cars and the people
The parks and the squares that you see
All the sounds that you hear
And the air that you're breathing is me
Yes, I am the city you let me be
I am the city
You let me be
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil, the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me
Coming through a cloud
You're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
I'm the street you walk

I am the city
You let me be
Somewhere in the middle of the neverending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
Yes I am the city you let me be
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city.</field>

A song to sing
To help me cope
With anything
If you see the wonder
Of a fairy tale
You can take the future
Even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in
Everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time
Is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I have a dream
A fantasy
To help me through
Reality
And my destination
Makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness
Still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in
Everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time
Is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day
Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way
Into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak</field>

It doesn't really bother you if this boy cries

I never thought I could cry for you

Never expecting surprises

Leaving now, is that the right thing
I wonder, it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I don't even try
I'm not a coward
Oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong
My friends and my family, this dull little town
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar
I wonder, it's frightening
Leaving now, is that the right thing
I wonder, it scares me

I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, 'round and 'round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown
Like a doll, like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk, how to walk, how to fall
Can't complain, I've got no-one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control, lost my hold, it's insane
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, 'round and 'round

Look this way, just a little smile, is what they say
You look better on the photograph if you laugh, that's okay!!

I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing

I cried a sea of tears

How I could stand the fears
I think of all the nights
I lay alone and scared
All shattered, and cryin'

Manage to hit the ceiling

That old feeling
I, I don't know what you do
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me
You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
I, I'm gonna make you mine
You're gonna feel so fine
You'll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
Please, believe me
You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me

I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights

Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall

Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights

I was not prepared for something like this
Now I see them clearly, the things that I miss
Oh baby, I feel so bad, I know I'm never gonna make it
I got my business to help me through the day
People I must write to, bills I must pay
But everything's so different when night's on its way
It's bad, oh, so bad
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights

Why did you leave
Still I've got your white sombrero
In your eyes
I believed I'd found my hero
But I know some day you'll regret
You'll return to your seorita
Happy as you can be in the arms of Rosalita
Oh, Alfredo
Give me the truth
Go and find my darling Pedro
I'm your friend
You're the one - my caballero
Pedro's never sure of himself
- where to find a sweet seorita
Saddle your horse my dear
bring him back to Rosalita
Oh, my Pedro
You and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
and the scars they're leavin'
We'll be dancin' once again
and the pain will end
There will be no time for grievin'
Oh, my Pedro
No, I won't cry 'cause the sun is still in the sky
and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more
like you did before
in the arms of Rosalita
Sing once more
Like you did before
in the arms of Rosalita
Then the walls came tumblin' down
when Alfredo blew the candle All is gone but it's not too hard to handle
Oh, my Pedro
Tell me the truth
Rosalita won't be a feather
I see
you're so happy gay together
Oh, my Pedro
No, I won't cry 'cause the sun is still in the sky
and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more
like you did before
in the arms of Rosalita
Sing once more
Like you did before

In a while
And you smile and say hello
Then we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on
Must be right
Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
If it's our destiny there's nothing we can do
But tonight is very special
It's the night for me and you</field>

My life had been a river
Following the same, pre-destinated course,
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising force.
My strongholds broke down all too easily;
I remember well,
How it did embarrass me;
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style
Just like that...
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that...
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on,
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that...
As though he only stopped awhile for a chat;
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
And once again, the river's flowing slowly,
Following the same and uneventful course.
Now the tears have dried,
it's become a pleasant break,
I recall without remorse.
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit,
he had something that I miss.
I guess he was a rolling stone;
The only one I've known.
Just like that...
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that...
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on,
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that...
As though he only stopped awhile for a chat;
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned</field>

I really had to write a song about it

And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah
I know that everybody's gonna shout it
And what a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla
We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song
Now we can make the jungle out of any old place
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah
Well who can tell a monkey from a monkey?
So people get together, gonna have a good time
Everybody listen to the music, yeah
'Cause what we're gonna sing is kinda funky
So let your arms hang down
And waddle all around
Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla
We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you is a nightmare fate and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions

Written by: Benny Andersson,
Stig Anderson,
Björn Ulvaeus
Recording began 23rd March 1976
at Metronome Studio
No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house,
tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends,
this is goodbye
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it,
this time we're through
(This time we're through,
this time we're through
This time we're through,
we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy,
I know but I have to go
(I have to go this time
I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
Mem'ries (mem'ries),
good days (good days),
bad days (bad days)
They'll be (they'll be),
with me (with me) always (always)
In these old familiar rooms children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it,
this time we're through
(This time we're through,
this time we're through
This time we're through,
we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy,
I know but I have to go
(I have to go this time
I have to go, this time I know)

            <field name="lyrics">I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged good-bye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room</field>

And all of your sweet, sweet talk?
Ain?t heard it a lot since then, love?

He leaves every morning
And he hardly says goodbye?
But if I would have to choose
I wouldn?t let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see our love will grow
Darling, I know
We gotta have patience
Love isn?t just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn?t easy but it sure is hard enough
(sweet sweet our love is bitter sweet)
Giving love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn?t easy but it sure is hard enough

?From the first moment I saw you
I?ve treated you like a queen
I?ve given you lots of presents?
?Now listen to that
Just look at that cat
You?d think he was an angel
But he?s talking through his hat?
But if I would have to choose

Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight
How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight
And I feel so good
And I feel so right
And I know that you must have a lovelight
You've got lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You've got lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight
Everything about you is right
Let it glow and let it be bright
I don't want to lose your lovelight
Shining like a star in the night

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring

With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill
Did you see that man with a fat cigar
He just left his lovers with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
Where the rest of the street can peer
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle...)
But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy the lot, his friend
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience

I wanted to
Though we quarrelled at times
And had a few fights
We were the best of friends
We found a place in the sun
To have enough fun
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climbing the apple tree
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days
They would take me out for football games and such
They liked to play
And I guess I didn't like it very much
But anyway
I was happy and proud to be with the boys
Being a little girl
I found a place in the sun
To have enough fun
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother

Yes, I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde
We're like sun and rainy weather

Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
We're a funny combination
Me and I
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
Everyone's a freak
Sometimes I have toyed
With ideas that I got from good old Dr Freud
Nothing new of course
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors
Oh no, oh no

On top of old Smokey
all covered with snow
I lost my true lover
by courting so slow
For courting's a pleasure
And parting is brief
and a false-hearted lover
is worse than a thief
On top of old Smokey
all covered with snow
I lost my true lover
by courting so slow
Well, you wake up in the morning
Hear the ding dong ring
You go marching to the table
See the same old thing
See the fork on the table
Nothing in your pan
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the man
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me
If you ever go to Houston
Well you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me (on me, on me)
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me (on me, on me).</field>

Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it, being in it
With the urge to move on
I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive
Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion
Move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it
Being in it
With the urge to move on
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain
Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion
Move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning
Move on

            <field name="lyrics">Nina, Pretty Ballerina
Every day in the morning
on her way to the office
you can see her as she catches a train
just a face among a million faces
just another woman with no name
not the girl you’d remember
but she’s still something special
if you knew her I am sure you’d agree
’cause I know she’s got a little secret
Friday evening she turns out to be:
Nina, pretty ballerina
now she is the queen of the dancing floor
this is the moment she’s waited for
just like Cinderella
Nina, pretty ballerina
who would ever think she could be this way
this is the part that she likes to play
but she knows the fun would go away
if she would play it every day
So she’s back every morning
to her work at the office
and another week to live in a dream
and another row of early mornings
in an almost never-ending stream
doesn’t talk very often
kind of shy and uncertain
everybody seems to think she’s a bore
but they wouldn’t know her little secret
what her Friday night would have in store
Nina, pretty ballerina
now she is the queen of the dancing floor
this is the moment she’s waited for
just like Cinderella
Nina, pretty ballerina
who would ever think she could be this way
this is the part that she likes to play
she would like to play it every day</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I was at a party and this fella said to me:
"Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights"
I said: "Who are you to talk about impending doom?"
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said: "I'm a minister, a big shot in the state"
I said "I just can't believe it, boy, I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?"
He said: "Keep on rocking baby 'til the night is gone"
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'til the night is gone
(Doo doo doo)
On and on and on
Doo doo doo
'till the night is gone
(Doo doo doo)
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'till the night is gone
(Doo doo doo)
On and on and on
Doo doo doo
'Till the night is gone
Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said: "Who am I? And who are you? And who are we?
What's our situation? Do we have some time for us?"
I said: "I was not exactly waiting for the bus"
He said: "If you're going somewhere can I come along?"
I said: "Keep on rocking baby 'til the night is gone"
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'til the night is gone
(Doo doo doo)
On and on and on
Doo doo doo
'till the night is gone
(Doo doo doo)
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'till the night is gone
(Doo doo doo)
On and on and on
Doo doo doo
'Till the night is gone
Standing up is scary if you think you're gonna fall
Like a humpty-dumpty 'fraid of falling off the wall
I say: "If you ever wanna know what's going on
Gotta keep on rockin', baby, 'til the night is gone"
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'til the night is gone
(Doo doo doo)
On and on and on
Doo doo doo
'till the night is gone
(Doo doo doo)
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'till the night is gone

            <field name="lyrics">No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table
Though I would have liked to begin
So much that I wanna say, but I feel unable
You leave and slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end
Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up
The sound of a key in the door
You smile and I realise that we need a shake-up
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end.</field>

you were, I felt
robbing me of my rightful chances
my picture clear

one of us had to go

I want you to know
One of us is crying
one of us is lying
in her lonely bed
staring at the ceiling
wishing she was
somewhere else instead
one of us is lonely
one of us is only
waiting for a call
sorry for herself
feeling stupid feeling small
wishing she had never left at all
I saw myself
as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
from the heat and the action
just like a child
stubborn and misconceiving
that's how I started the show
one of us had to go
now I've changed and

The feeling right, the Paris night
Did it's best to please us
And strolling down the Elysee
We had a drink in each cafe
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy and I
Smiled like Mona Lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play
And now you're working in a bank
The family man, the football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
We were living for the day, worries far away...

People need hope, people need lovin’
people need trust from a fellow man
people need love to make a good livin’
people need faith in a helping hand
Man has always wanted a woman by his side
to keep him company
women always knew that it takes a man
to get matrimonial harmony
everybody knows that a man who’s feeling down
wants some female sympathy
gotta have love to carry on living
gotta have love ’til eternity
People need hope, people need lovin’
people need trust from a fellow man
people need love to make a good livin’
people need faith in a helping hand
Flowers in a desert need a drop of rain
like a woman needs her man
if a man’s in love
and his woman wants the moon
then he’ll take it down if he can
somebody who loves you
and somebody who cares
isn’t that what you call a friend
gotta have love to carry on living
isn’t it easy to understand
People need hope, people need lovin’

I live and feel
And I can do, without you
Put on your white sombrero
Your red bandana too
Think of this day as a showdown
Goodbye my friend
This is the end
For me and you
Now be a bold vaquero
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing
Into the night
All dressed in white
Unchained and free, without me
Put on your white sombrero
Like all the comboys do
Go find a sweet senorita
Somebody meek
Who'll never speak
Harshly to you
You're such a caballero
Proud, never bending
I want someone who will take me
Just as I am
I need a man
Who is in rhyme
With his time
You'll never take me
Just as I am
I need a man
Who is in rhyme

Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please

I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
See me sitting in the palmtree
Waiting for those little words from you
People laugh and point their fingers
Like I was a monkey at the zoo
But I will stay here, among my coconuts
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please
See me sitting in the palmtree
Feeling angry at the silly crowd
No-one else but you can calm me
You should know by now I'm far too proud
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too
You shouldn't treat me like you always do
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please

She leaves home
In the early morning
Waving goodbye
With an absent-minded smile
I watch her go
With a surge of
That well known sadness
And I have to sit down
For a while
The feeling that I'm
Losing her forever
And without really
Entering her world
I'm glad whenever I
Can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
I try to capture
Every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
Do I really see what's
In her mind
Each time I think
I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
Sleep in our eyes
Her and me
At the breakfast table
Barely awake I
Let precious time go by
Then when she's gone
There's that odd
Melancholy feeling
And a a sense of
Guilt I can't deny
What happened to the
Wonderful adventures
The places I had
Planned for us to go
Well some of that we did
But most we didn't
And why I just don't know
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
I try to capture
Every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
Do I really see what's
In her mind
Each time I think
I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
Sometimes I wish
That I could freeze
The picture
And save it from
The funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers
Schoolbag in hand
She leaves home
In the early morning
Waving goodbye
With an absent-minded smile</field>

With your fancy car, ahaha
But I can tell you all your tricks
Ain't gonna get you far, ahaha
They say that money's got a magic touch
But not to me it doesn't mean that much
You won't have me tonight
Alright, alright, alright, alright
So long, see you honey
Can't buy me with your money
Tracy, Daisy, they may be crazy
But I'll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
Can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth tryin'
So long, so long, so long
You didn't have to send me flowers
Like you did today, ahaha
I wouldn't keep a thing from you
I gave them all away, ahaha
The girls might fall for everything you've got
But I'm not one of them, you know I'm not
You won't have me tonight
Alright, alright, alright, alright

Do i see the signs i think i see
Or is this just fantasy
Is it true that the beast is waking
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight
In the pale moonlight
In the grip of this cold december
You and i have reason to remember
Soldiers write the songs
That soldiers sing
The songs that you and i don’t sing
They blow their horns
And march along
They drum their drums
And look so strong
You’d think that nothing
In the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs
That soldiers sing
The songs that you and i won’t sing
Let’s not look the other way
Taking a chance
’cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance
What’s that sound
What’s that dreadful rumble
Won’t somebody tell me what i hear
In the distance but drawing near
Is it only a storm approaching
All that thunder and the blinding light
In the winter night
In the grip of this cold december
You and i have reason to remember
Soldiers write the songs
That soldiers sing
The songs that you and i don’t sing
They blow their horns
And march along
They drum their drums
And look so strong
You’d think that nothing

they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
SOS
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
SOS
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on
You seemed so far away though you were standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me

summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise
soul dancin? in the dark
summer night city
walkin? in the moonlight
love-makin? in a park
summer night city
In the sun I feel like sleepin?
I can?t take it for too long
my impatience slowly creepin?
up my spine and growin? strong
I know what?s waiting there for me
tonight I?m loose and fancy free
ah
When the night comes with the action
I just know it?s time to go
can?t resist the strange attraction
from that giant dynamo
lots to take and lots to give
time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise
soul dancin? in the dark
summer night city
walkin? in the moonlight
love-makin? in a park
summer night city
It?s elusive call it glitter
somehow something turns me on
some folks only see the litter
we don?t miss ?em when they?re gone
I love the feeling in the air
my kind of people everywhere
ah
When the night comes with the action
I just know it?s time to go
can?t resist the strange attraction
from that giant dynamo
and tomorrow when it?s dawning
and the first birds start to sing
in the pale light of the morning
nothing?s worth remembering
it?s a dream, it?s out of reach
scattered driftwood on a beach
Waiting for the sunrise
soul dancin? in the dark
summer night city
walkin? in the moonlight
love-makin? in a park
summer night city</field>

But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the
Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
(Super Trouper)
Smiling, having fun
(Super Trouper)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Super Trouper)
Like I always do
(Super Trouper)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
(Still I'm thinking about you only)
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be alright
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the
Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun

Smiling, having fun
(Super Trouper)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Super Trouper)
Like I always do

'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the
Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
(Super Trouper)
Smiling, having fun
(Super Trouper)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the

Right at the time when boys like to think they're men
She used to follow us from school
We really thought that she was a little fool
And one day we said to her
"we don't want to hurt you girl
But you'd better
Look for a friend of your own
Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown
Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around"
Suzy ran home to mama's arms
Mama said "look, she's never done you no harm
So get off her back and let her be
Why can't you play together in harmony?"
We really didn't know what to say
But as soon as she went away
We laughed and said
"look for a friend of your own
Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown
Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away

We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're
together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know
you better
'Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone
with you
It's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love
affair
But I think you know

Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know
I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't
gonna let you
Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough to last when
things are rough
It's magic
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off
my mind
No I can't let go
'Cos I love you so

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we

because I always do
my train, I'm certain
left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper
going into town
and having gotten through the editorial
no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk
around a quarter after nine
with letters to be read
and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
at half past twelve or so
the usual place, the usual bunch
and still on top of this
I'm pretty sure it must have rained
the day before you came
I must have lit my seventh
cigarette at half past two
and at the time I never
even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging
through the business of the day
without really knowing anything
I hid a part of me away
at five I must have left
there's no exception to the rule
a matter of routine
I've done it ever since I finished school
the train back home again
undoubtedly I must have
read the evening paper then
oh yes, I'm sure my life was
well within its usual frame
the day before you came
I must have opened my front door
at eight o'clock or so
and stopped along the way
to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner
watching something on TV
there's not, I think, a single
episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed
around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so
I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
the latest one by Marilyn French
or something in that style
it's funny, but I had no sense
of living without aim
the day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and
cuddled up for yet another night
and rattling on the roof
I must have heard the sound of rain
the day before you came</field>

There's a lot you can teach me

Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow

And you make me feel

What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down
Would you laugh at me
If I said I care for you
Could you feel the same way too
I wanna know

I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited

From the west and the north and from the east
They waited for the man
Like a parish is waiting for the priest
Longed to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

He seduced everybody in the land

And the fear was a weapon in his hand

And suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously
Tearing through the silence
I cannot move I'm standing numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me
The signal's sounding once again
And someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices smiling
Now I hear them moving, muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm crackin' up voices growing louder
Irritation building and I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now
I'm in here trembling in a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling going crazy
There is no escaping now
I'm crackin' up
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me
Now I hear them moving, muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm crackin' up voices growing louder
Irritation building and I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now
I'm in here trembling in a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling going crazy
There is no escaping now
I'm crackin' up</field>

Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together

            <field name="lyrics">I don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's a destiny
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all.
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain.
Why should I complain.
But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all...
So the winner...
Takes it all...
And the loser...
Has to fall...
Throw a dice...
Cold as ice...
Way down here...
Someone dear...
Takes it all...
Has to fall...</field>

Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe it you better beware
Of me
I am behind you, I always find you, I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner and try not to scream
It's me
I am behind you, I always find you, I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you, I always find you, I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger
The city is a prison, you never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows and you'll see the shape
Of me
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger
And if I meet you, what if I eat you, I am the tiger

Over the rainbow, under the moon
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon
Just take my hand, I'll show you everything
The secrets that my paradise can bring

            <field name="lyrics">He had what you might call a trivial occupation
he cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
with no romance in his life - sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
the cries for help from different people, different ages
but they had nothing to say, at least not until the day,
when something special he read, this is what it said
If you dream, of the girl for you, then call us and get
two for the price of one
We're the answer, if you feel blue, so call us and get
two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with the two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't call us and you'll get two)
He called the number and a voice said "Alice Whiting"
the voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
he was amazed at his luck, the purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said, I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
why don't we meet for a chat, the three of us in my flat
I can't forget what I read
this is what it said
If you dream, of the girl for you, then call us and get
two for the price of one
We're the answer, if you feel blue, so call us and get
two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with the two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't call us and you'll get two)
She said I'm sure we must be perfect for each other
And if you doubt it, you'll be certain
When you meet my mother"</field>

Just a feeling that you’re watching me
Aah, every move I’m making
Am I reading your mind
’cause it’s almost like your touching me
Aah, there is no mistaking
Just a notion
That you’ll be walking up to me in a while
And you smile and say: hello and
We’ll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on must be right
Just a notion
But somehow I know I’m not wrong
If it’s our destiny
There’s nothing we can do
And tonight is very special
It’s the night for me and you

And I’ve always been under your heel
Holy christ what a lousy deal
Now I’m sick and tired of your tedious ways
And I ain’t gonna take it no more
Oh, no no, walking out that door
Burning my bridges, cuttin’ my tie
Once again oughta look into the eye
Being myself, having my pride
No one, baby, is gonna take me for a ride
Burning my bridges, moving at last
Girl I’m leaving and I’m burying the past
Wanna have peace now, we can be free
No one here will make a sucker out of me

Jandaumlvla otandaumlck situation
Hamlet iii part 1
(instrumental)
Hamlet iii part 2
When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold
Then I think of us, of you and i
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears
And I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake
Autumn’s chilling winds were blowing through the trees
And rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
And rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days
Det randaumlcker dandaumlr
Ja
Nu handoumlr jag alltså vandaumlldigt lite frida!
Free as a bumble bee
I’m down
And I feel depressed
Sitting here
Just waiting
For next bus traveling
Down town
It’s a cry and a shame
Isn’t it
A beautiful weather?
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this
I know what I like to be
As free
As a bumble bee
Take a zip of
Every flower
Free
As a bumble bee
What a way
Each lazy hour
What a good life
Lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life
Living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw
Rubber ball man
A poster on the wall
Of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free
The hero of them all
You’re a legend
I guess I never get a chance to know you
Still you’re close as can be
Make the band stand
To a dream land, rubber ball man
Clapping your hands
And your feet dance, rubber ball man
When you’re jumping up and down, nobody’s standing still
Some of us screaming
Some of us dreaming
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man
Crying over you
I’m waiting for you, baby
I’m sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you’d leave me
But now I know it’s true
Oh, lord I’m blue
I’m crying over you
I’m waiting for you, baby
I’m sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you’d leave me
But now I know it’s true
Oh, lord I’m blue
I’m crying over you
Crying over you
I’m crying over you
Crying over
Little memories
Of things we used to do
Oh, lord I’m blue
I’m crying over you
Oh, lord I’m blue
I’m crying over you
Oh, lord I’m blue
I’m crying over you
Handaumlrligt!

Just like that
Just like that
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I lead him on
Knowing that someday soon he’d be gone
Just like that
As though he’d only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
Just like that
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
As though he’d only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
Just like that
Då kandoumlr vi då
Gandaringr bandet?
Givin’ a little bit more
There’s a gentleness to everything you do
And it’s rubbing off on me, I feel it too
I’m a victim of my loneliness, I guess
When you call me on the phone
And I’m feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over, baby
You know I will
I could never stay on my own
Givin’ it all I got to give
I’ve never done that before
I’m always givin’ a little more
When I’m with you
Givin’ it all I got to give
I’ve never done that before
I’m always givin’ a little more
When I’m with you
And I’m always givin’ a little more
When I’m with you
Givin’ it all I got to give
I’ve never done that before
I’m always givin’ a little more
When I’m with you
Givin’ it all I got to give
I’ve never done that before
I’m always givin’ a little more
Thank you for the music

I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of certain that's the truth)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where I'd be if I fell
Under attack, I'm being taken

Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

            <field name="lyrics">Went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand
And then I heard them laugh and say
Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now
Hey, what's it good for anyway
So I said
Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may
What about Livingstone
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest
Wasn't it worth it then
What about Livingstone
And all of those fellas at the local news-stand
Didn't know what to answer or what to say
So I told them about him, that he was just like
One of those spacemen in his way
And if you laugh at them
Then there's only a thing I can say
What about Livingstone
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest
Wasn't it worth it then
What about Livingstone
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he)
What about all those men
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he)
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he)
Travelling up the Nile
(Didn't he do it)
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest
(Didn't that help them, well, didn't it)
Wasn't it worth it then
What about Livingstone

Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cos he was taken by surprise
When I kissed the teacher
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher
Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher.</field>

Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me
Men are toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw them away
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me.</field>

Yes I really do
Aha
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun
Baby you owe me one
Aha
My turn to run
A chance to feel the sun
Baby you owe me one
I wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion
I was taken by surprise
Now both of us are in a state of confusion
Hesitation in our eyes
Something unwanted has entered our existence
I think it's better to view it from a distance
Yes I really do
Aha
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me
It isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said:
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
You'd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said:
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bitter-sweet
This would taste?
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said:
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg

            <field name="lyrics">Hello
It's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over
Everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello
Can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger
And free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference
Between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello
How are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry, I hope
That you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore
Oohh, anymore
Oohh, anymore
Oohh, anymore
Anymore
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
It was dark and I was over,
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet,
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,
But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
When I lay with you I could stay there,
Close my eyes,
Feel you here forever,
You and me together, nothing is better,
'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,
But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames,
Well, It felt something died,
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught, must be waiting for you,
Even now when we're already over,
I can't help myself from looking for ya,
I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touch your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames,
Well, I felt something died,
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh,
Oh, no,
Let it burn, oh,
Let it burn,
Let it burn.</field>

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it
With the beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind
And reap just what you sow
We could've had it all
We could've had it all
It all, it all it all,
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it,you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat</field>

From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young</field>

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know
But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
I hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me
Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all
Together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all

Let the sky fall

We will stand tall
And face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
At skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Where you go, I go
What you see, I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all
Together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all

We will stand tall

Haven't made
Your mind up yet

Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong
I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change
Are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing
Like me yet
I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love</field>

I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I want to teach you things you never knew baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight don't let go
Baby give me light
Baby give me light
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do baby
Bring your heart I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I want to step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight don't let go
Baby give me light
Baby give me light
We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living world's apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby
Harder baby
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight don't let go
Baby give me light
Baby give me light
I miss you</field>

All that I have is on the floor,
God only knows what we're fighting for,
All that I say, you always say more,
I can't keep up with your turning tables,
Under your thumb, I can't breathe,
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me,
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,
I cant give you what you think you gave me,
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,
To turning tables,
Under hardest disguise I see, ooh,
Where love is lost, your ghost is found,
I braved a hundred storms to leave you,
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down,
I can't keep up with your turning tables,
Under your thumb, I can't breathe,
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me,
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,
I cant give you what you think you gave me,
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,
Turning tables,
Next time I'll be braver,
I'll be my own savior,
When the thunder calls for me,
Next time I'll be braver,
I'll be my own savior,
Standing on my own two feet,
I won't let you close enough to hurt me,
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,
I can't give you what you think you gave me,
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,
To turning tables,
Turning tables, yeah,
Turning, oh.</field>

Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow, oh
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that's mattered,
tell me who do I run to?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want it to be cruel or unjust
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just your friend
Give me a memory that I can use
Take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?</field>

Oh and if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woaah, woaaah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently

This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated

She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want?
Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore
Rumour has it (rumour)

But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Ohh
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you, love you

And bear my soul
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I had grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when

I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

I put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,

I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go
Ooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Ooh I thought I died in your arms
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go
Hope you know, I won't let go</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea

I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But your love was the key to peace my mind
You make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman, yeah
When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm looking for
Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more
Cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman
Oh, baby, look you've done to me
makes me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
You make me feel so alive
Cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow, oh
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that's mattered,
tell me who do I run to?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want it to be cruel or unjust
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just your friend
Give me a memory that I can use
Take me by the hand

My heart on my sleeve?
It's been there
For days on end and
It's been waiting for you
To open up
Just you baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words
Roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me
This made you fell the way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you
You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me
Why is it everytime
I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
Cause you're still
Not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do
To make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances
And getting away
And though I'm trying
My hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say
I make you feel the way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you
You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me
But, despite
The truth that I know
I find it hard to let go
And give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me
The more eager I am
To persist
With this heartbreak
And running around
And I will do unitl i
Find myself with you
And make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And be all you need
So that you never want more
Then we'll say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
And you'll be the one for me
And me the one for you</field>

And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
Now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
I looked up into the grey sky
And see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel a way of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here

I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

You grace me
With your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me
I wish I was her
You shower me with words
Made of knives
Whenever you look at me
I wish I was her
These days when I see you
You make it look
Like see-through
Do tell me why
You waste our time
When your heart
Ain't admitting
You're not satisfied
You know I know
Just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself
Feeling that way too
(Chorus)
Time and time again
I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight
When you
(I see you)
Try to look for things
I hear
But our eyes never find
'Though I do know how you play

Sitting in the dark
Wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you
Who makes me
Lose my head
And every time
I'm meant to be
Acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me
Into a crumbling fool
Tell me to run
And I'll race
If you want me
To stop I'll freeze
And if you are me
Gonna leave
Just hold me
Closer, baby
And make me
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Lately with this state
I'm in I can't help
Myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning
Closer to you
My oh, my
How my blood boils
It's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me
Into my favourite mood
I keep on trying
Fighting
These feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into
Pacing floors
And opening doors
Hoping
You'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too
Crazy for you
Crazy for you</field>

Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past

Like he's never felt her figure before
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back
You can find him
Sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
And he will feel like
He's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then see's you through
There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

I need to get away
To feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close
To change my mind
Please wipe that look
Out of your eyes
It's bribing me
To doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring
This love has dried up
And stayed behind
And if I stay
I'll be a lie
Then choke on words
I'd always hide
Excuse me first love
But we're through
I need to taste the kiss
From someone new
Forgive me first love
But I'm too tired
I'm bored to say

I lack desire

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So, darling, darling, darling,
This is goodbye.
But I still care, but I still care,
And oh, fool that I am.
Oh, but I still care,
Fool that I am.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Some say I'll be better without you,
But they don't know you like I do,
Or at least the sides I thought I knew,
I can't bear this time,
It drags on as I lose my mind,
Reminded by things I find,
Like notes and clothes you've left behind,
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done,
I won't rise until this battle's won,
My dignity's become undone,
But I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride,
What if I lose my heart and fail, declined,
I won't forgive me if I give up trying,
I heard his voice today,
I didn't know a single word he said,
Not one resemblance to the man I met,
Just a vacant broken boy instead,
But I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I am willing to take the risk,
There will be times, we'll try and give it up,
Bursting at the seams, no doubt,
We'll almost fall apart, then burn to pieces,
So watch them turn to dust,
But nothing will ever taint us,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I am willing to take the risk,
Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place
Where he will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday,
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait,
I'll be home so soon, I won't be late,
He won't go,
He can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk,
So I won't go,
He can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,
'Cause he won't go,
He can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk.</field>

I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over
Everything

But I ain't done much healing
Hello
Can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger
And free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference
Between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello
How are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry, I hope
That you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry

            <field name="lyrics">This is how the story went
I met someone by accident,
That blew me away
That blew me away
It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave
watched you wave
Then I went home to my skyscrapers,
Neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call it home
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I woke up feeling heavy hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain
The morning rain
And though I wish that you were near
That same old road that brought me here
Is calling me home
Is calling me home
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
And I can('t) spend my whole life hiding my heart away</field>

"No and thank you, please Madam
I ain't lost, just
wandering"
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of this world
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met

Don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cuz I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
Here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I'll feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't
I close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel

Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true!
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer,
closer in here,
Like a fool for fire I fall,
With my pride and all!
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call?
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.
(Chorus:)
But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!
So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you calling back to me
To whisper will you leave your man??
Cause you sweared that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you!
(Chorus:)
Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!
I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right
(Chorus:)
Well I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me
Now that I don't need you!</field>

Your body standing over me
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight don't let go
Baby give me light
Baby give me light
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do baby
Bring your heart I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I want to step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down
I miss you when the lights go out

Pull me in hold me tight don't let go
Baby give me light
Baby give me light
We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living world's apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby
Harder baby

It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight don't let go

You know my heart more than I do,
We were the greatest, me and you,

And miles between us,
The heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,
Let me stay here for just one more night,
Build your world around me,
And pull me to the light,
So I can tell you that I was wrong,
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn,

Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
I know I left you speechless,
I'll be waiting,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,

Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights
Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)

I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me</field>

Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you
Haven't made
Your mind up yet
But I would never
Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong
I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change
Are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing
Like me yet
I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love</field>

Made of bricks
Pulls me down
Turns me weak
For you
I find myself
Repeating like
A broken tune
And I'm forever
Excusing
Your intentions
And I give in
To my pretendings
Which forgive you
Each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart
To stone
And I hear your words
That I made up
You say my name
Like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head
I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love
Each and every time
I turn around to leave
I feel my heart
Begin to burst
And bleed
So desperately
I try to link it
With my head
But instead
I fall back
To my knees
As you tear your way
Right through me
I forgive you
Once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt
My heart to stone
And I hear your words
That I made up
You say my name
Like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head
I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love
Why do you
Steal my hand
Whenever
I'm standing
My own ground
You build me up
Then leave me dead
Well
I hear your words
You made up
So I say your name
Like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head
I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love</field>

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I had grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when

Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore.

Said I wouldn't call
but I lost all control and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now.
Another shot of whisky,
can't stop looking at the door.
Wishing you'd come sweeping
in the way you did before.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me it happens all the time.
It's a quarter after one,
I'm a little drunk,
And I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call

And I don't know how I can do without,

Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.

You hold me alright

Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want

When we'll try to give it up
Bursting at the seams
No doubt that will almost fall apart
Then burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other
Nothing is easy enough
So let's go back there, back to the start

'Cause you're the only one I want

If you don't then let me go
[Tyga - verse 1]
The memories soon fade, why couldn't they be erased
You hoping it's just a phase, your heart'll heal within days
Some people think it's wrong, being single isn't right
But you hurt the right person you'll be wrong all your life
Inevitable to let you go, separate the sexual
Feelings when I'm close to you, f-cking til' the sky is blue
Morning time, home fries, cooking with your t-shirt on
Panties, bra, damn I eat you good when you take it off
Ha, damn I'm nasty, I mean you make me nasty
Going the extra mile flying just to make me happy
Did it all, too much wasn't enough
Now it's gone but sometimes I sit and hope
[Adele]
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
[Tyga - verse 2]
Whatever ever happened to love and being happy
Infatuated with lust, I loved you and now I'm backwards
Time is of the essence, I broke it, took it for granted
Love is like art, heartbroken on the canvas
Painted the perfect picture, you seemed to never get it
Colors prevail and you turn into a f-cking monster
Schizophrenic, nicknames Bonnie and Clyde
Now doctors calling us Mr
and Mrs
Hyde
How do you manage but still do you
Can't compromise, we all equal opportunists
It's when I'm level headed they aiming to take my head off
Birds flock together, tell bitches I'm throwing bread off
Cold, women, fall in love getting splintered?
Strictly plutonic, only thing she want is dinner
I can't fuck with her, get her some tonic, gin, liquor
She might let me lick her, now she miss me sayin
[Adele]
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
[Tyga]
Angels in the a.m., sin on my flesh
Girls in the p.m., excuses PMS
They all wanna love em, call em Ms
Next
Spirit of a hustler, I only chase checks
Go home
I ain't tryna do you wrong
I'd rather be alone
Just sittin on the throne</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Who wants to be right as rain
It's better
When something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes
And your all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who want to be right as rain
It's harder when your on top
Cause when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble
Back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least
When your at your worst
You know how to feel things
See when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love
Go ahead and steal my heart
To make me cry again
Cause it will never hurt
as much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game
Cause who wants
To be right as rain
It's better
When something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even thought
Everything's a strain
When night comes
And I'm all on my own
You should know
I chose to be alone
So who want to be
Right as rain
It's harder
When your on top
Cause when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea

River Lea, River Lea

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it
With the beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind
And reap just what you sow
We could've had it all
We could've had it all
It all, it all it all,
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it,you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat</field>

Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you

You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me

Okay, cool
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting, you and me
Mm, that was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all

To stand in your arms without falling to your feet,
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,
But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
When I lay with you I could stay there,
Close my eyes,
Feel you here forever,
You and me together, nothing is better,

Well, It felt something died,
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught, must be waiting for you,
Even now when we're already over,
I can't help myself from looking for ya,
I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touch your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,

Let the sky fall

We will stand tall

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

I know I'd never be me
Without the security

Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

That tears down my walls
I wasn't ready then; I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known
I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone
I wasn't ready then; I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you

In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

With my love,
I will change if I must,
Slow it down and bring it home,
I will adjust,
Oh, if only,
If only you knew,
Everything I do is for you,
But go on, go on and take it,
Take it all with you,
Don't look back,
At this crumbling fool,
Just take it,
Take it all with you,
Don't look back,
At this crumbling fool,
Just take it all,
With my love,
Take it all,
With my love,
Take it all,
With my love.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem o care
You close the door and leave me standing there
Oh, honey that's not fair
That?s it, I quit, I'm movin' on
The other night we had a date
An you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face
Oh, they smeared it every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on
Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all
Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses thrill me
So if you got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on
Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all
Baby I can take a lot cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses fill me
So if you got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that?s it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on</field>

While you cut me down
It had only just begun
But now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments
With your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
In my eyes
Your were smiling
In the spotlight dancing
With the night
The night fell off your mind
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing it ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her
Chorus:
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I dont get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
(I should have known)
Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help
Believe the trick me
Back into them
Even though
(chorus)
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired</field>

All that I have is on the floor,
God only knows what we're fighting for,
All that I say, you always say more,
I can't keep up with your turning tables,
Under your thumb, I can't breathe,
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me,
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,
I cant give you what you think you gave me,
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,
To turning tables,
Under hardest disguise I see, ooh,
Where love is lost, your ghost is found,
I braved a hundred storms to leave you,
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down,
I can't keep up with your turning tables,
Under your thumb, I can't breathe,
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me,
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,
I cant give you what you think you gave me,
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,
Turning tables,
Next time I'll be braver,
I'll be my own savior,
When the thunder calls for me,
Next time I'll be braver,
I'll be my own savior,
Standing on my own two feet,
I won't let you close enough to hurt me,
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,
I can't give you what you think you gave me,
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,
To turning tables,
Turning tables, yeah,
Turning, oh.</field>

Seven days has gone so fast
I really thought the pain would pass
It's been nearly an hour
Since I thought of you
But you're not answering the phone
I'd settle for a busy tone
At least that I'd know that you're okay
A girl like you ain't meant to go away
Oh...
Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done
Looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame...
[Adele:]
I'm tired of this empty house
I need a drink to get me out
A cup more till I forget your name
I saw a boy that looked like you
I didn't know quite what to do
It took a power of will to break my stare
I realized what I wanted wasn't there
Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done
Looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame...
[Daniel:]
If you see me coming...
[Adele:]
I look away, I look away...
[Daniel:]
And if your mind is made up...
[Adele:]
I look away, I will look away...
[Daniel:]
If your worry bound
[Adele:]
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am
[Daniel:]
All this sorrow and this pain
is going to go away

Now you're gone

Then how come I can bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh and if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woaah, woaaah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woaah, woaaah

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so

From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless

How do you keep me coming back for more

I can't decide if I should run and hide

Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I bleed
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and dark of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready
It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't barely see the light, I
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again, I'll be better
In time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again
At the dawning of the day
I can't barely see the light, I
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again, I'll be better
In time
Let the eaves take me under
I know I'll survive
Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you, now
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now
You'll never see me again, I'll be better
In time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on

It's been there for days on end and It's been waiting for you to open up Yours too baby, come on now I'm trying to tell you just how I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before And I'm all you need and that you never want more Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue But you'd save the best for last Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest It turns out it ain't enough You're still not mentioning love What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly? I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her And I think that I know things may never change I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before And I'm all you need and that you never want more Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue But you'd save the best for last Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know I find it hard to let go and give up on you Seems I love the things you do Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am To persist with this heartbreak and running around And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before And be all you need so that you never want more And you'll say all of the right things without a clue And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you</field>

I hid it in the seam of your coat It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2] Why were you so cold, let the truth be told Tell me was it all for the thrill? What was I thinking, I gave you everything But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus] I gave you heaven on a platter baby I gave you everything you never gave me I never lied and I never faked it Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus] Did you find the note that I wrote?

Am I being too open?
Cause I told you everything I have to say

There ain't no place, ain't no place like you

You're my Memphis, New York
New Orleans all rolled into one
In the city, the country, the mountains or sea

Days all feel the same
Still numb from you
First step off of this plane I knew
I suffocate without you
Heart beats for two
It was good
What we had
If that was paradise
Can somebody take me back
And it hurts
Looking back
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad
Don't let go
When the daylight's gone
Cus its always darkest before dawn
I breathe
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs
When I hate the things that I've become
I breathe
Ohoh ohoh
Regrets dancing around my head
Everything I never said
Still numb from you
Secrets sleeping all over this bed
Memories of what we did
Come into view
And it hurts
Looking back
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad
Don't let go
When the daylight's gone
Cus its always darkest before dawn
I breathe
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs
When I hate the things that I've become
I breathe
Oh, oh, I breathe
Breathe
Oh, oh, I breathe
Breathe

I made a map, every photo
And the details on the frames
And just last night we spilled red wine
How it stained the floor
And though I know
That nothing ever really stays the same, no
Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
Never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
Even though it's selfish
I don't wanna share you with no one else
No one else
I can't compare you to no one else
No one else
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else?
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else
Nobody else
Torn by the way of us changing on the phone
All this space in between us
makes it hard to feel close to you
And just last night I had some red wine
and it brought me back
No matter, will I remember you forever like that?
You know
Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
Never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
That even though it's selfish, oh

Callin' but your phone is off
You go and blame it all on your friends, not that again

Sure, I'm not the only one, yeah

You changed your hair, I like it now
And baby, your body still feels the same
And soon I'll be lying on the floor
Picking up the pieces
Drinking it away
Pretending I don't need ya
But right now, I'ma hold you like nothing has changed
I'm going crazy over you (Ha, ha, ha, ha, over you)
Over you again (Over you)
It's never gonna be the way it was (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was
And it's so crazy, what you do (Ha, ha, ha, ha, what you do)
What you do to me (What you do)
This isn't how I remember us (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh
It's a shot to my veins, lying in your bed
Never thought I'd be back with you again
So, do your worst, 'cause you know that I'll always forgive you
Guess I will, guess I will
I'm going crazy over you (Ha, ha, ha, ha, over you)
Over you again, yeah (Over you)
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was

You look happy, happier than I do
Your hair's a little longer
Am I crazy, is it blonder than it was then?
When you walked down on my house
I didn't say a thing, now
It's funny how a year can fill you head with should've, would've, could've been
Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out
And now there's only five left to tell you
Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back
Would you meet me at the chateau?
At a table, I'd get your favorite chardonnay, yeah
'Cause babe, you know, a bottle is a little bit too much to drink alone
We could catch up, make out, make up
'Cause I don't wanna go
Another day without you, come on
Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?

It's only been a month since I met you
I gotta say that was my favorite June
And I knew, from that night
That I would be alright
If I
I only knew that one day I would find
Someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted
Looking for the right one at the wrong door
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Baby, I'm all in it
Just tell me you were on in it
People wanna talk, shut 'em all off
And tell 'em all to mind their business
Will for the grumps and cynics
Been that way from the beginning
People see what they don't have
They get sad and act out 'cause they're winning
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me too
Ooh, eh, eh
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok

I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby
It's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake
I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete
I don't mean to drag it on, but I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go alone

Even forever don't seem like long enough

Everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love

You keep me drowning in your love
Maybe I'm a drifter
Maybe not
'Cause I long for the safety
Of flowing freely in your arms
I don't need another lifeline
It's not for me

Does his gifts come from the heart - I don't know...

I'd make it so we'd never be apart.

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you..

Love is all I have to give.
When you talk - does it seem like he's not
even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away...
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please..
I'm on my knees
praying for the day that you'll be mine!!

Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love
There's no control
Are you with me now
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Is this the feeling I need to walk with ?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you're asking me
to feel the things you never show ?
You are missing in my heart ...
Tell me why can't I be there where you are .

I climb the walls
I can see the edge but I can't take the fall, no.

So why can't I make the call?
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me

Wherever you are is home
Without your lips on mine
No, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No, I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I walked by the store
And we sat on the floor
And we ate like kids
Then someone said hey
We're locking the door
No time to play
And I never knew alone
Wherever you are is home
Without your lips on mine
No, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No, I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
We're not over
We're not over
Without your lips on mine
No, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't, no I can't breathe, yeah
You know I can't breathe
Without your lips on mine
No, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe (it's not, it's not over)
Oh you are, you are my lover
Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Yeah
We're not over</field>

Let it take control of me
A couple drinks had me zone in
Might have said a couple things
That I didn't mean to say, I probably should explain
So, you don't think it's just the liquor talking?
Yeah, you give me feels, but you should know the real
I hope you don't get mad when I say I
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
You're so much more than that
You got me bad in the worst way
And it never felt so good
I'm so attached, I'm beggin' mercy
I wouldn't stop it if I could
I don't wanna change, I probably should explain
So, you don't think it's just the liquor talking?
Yeah, you give me feels, but you should know the real

I'd make it so we'd never be apart.

even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away...

Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please..
I'm on my knees
praying for the day that you'll be mine!!

Feel like leaving
But I don't really want to
But I feel so misled,
A kiss through the phone just won't do no
Because from my point of view
I gotta say
There's something about you
So tell me baby
Somewhere down the road
Somewhere down the road
I think you lost it all
Now it's all in my head yeah, yeah(4x)
You know it's not my style
To start a fight and make a scene
But I'm different this time
I am not a drama fiend no
And maybe it's just me
But this is how I feel
And this can't simply be
Another case of jealousy
Chorus
I mean we can talk it out
pretend that it's alright
But alright just won't do anymore
I mean we can kiss and make up
pretend that it's enough
But enough just won't do anymore
Maybe it's all in my head,
Feel like leaving
But I don't really want to
But I feel so misled,
A kiss through the phone just won't do

Apathy is all around and on the rise
We channel so much energy through our greed
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need
Let me tell you
Money can't buy lifes
Sunny days for you
Living is more than profits accrued
We need to love and be loved
And brough in the things we are thankful of
Remember your brothers and sisters
Because we are all in this together
Its funny how we took a prayer out of schools
After the 9-11 scare that's all we do
We compromise our liberties for security
We can become so self in dosed that we can?t see
Let me tell you
Money can?t buy lifes
Sunny days for you
Living is more than profits accrued
We need to love and be loved
And brough in the things we are thankful of
Remember your brothers and sisters
Because we are all in this together
Don?t throw in the towel
Let?s overcome the test for now
Together we last, divided we fall
Love will conquer all
Money can?t buy lifes
Sunny days for you
Living is more than profits accrued (We gotta change
right now we gotta change right now)
We need to love and be loved
And brough in the things we are thankful of
Remember your brothers and sisters

We need to love and be loved

I feel (tell) my heart but
I can't seem to comprehend
A day without you.
Now you're gone
Got a life
But I wear the scars
Reminding me by the hour
But its time to accept its the way the things are
I wish I could but...
Can't imagine it any other way
a world without you it's only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.
Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel
It's like I'm living in somebody else's life
Tell me it's not real..
I can't imagine it any other way
a world without you it's only wasted space
you're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.
Like we never had a falling out
Like the tears, they never hit the ground
Like you're still here, you're still here
Since you drained all the color out of the sky
I cant imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way

From this moment til the very end
I'm gonna love you (gonna love you) the best that I can
The best that I can
It's ok if you close your eyes
I'll be standing by your side
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
You're my heart and you're my best friend
And I promise til the end (yeah)
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you the best that I can</field>

I'm no one to count on at all
Add on that I'm a coward
Too scared to return your call

You keep sticking around

You're bigger

Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger

Often they're blacker than white
Add on my uncanny ego
No one's as humbled than I

Yeah, I swear I make them up to you
Before you go and have enough (enough)
Just let me make it better
I'll try to measure up
I'll try to measure up to you
Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah

Slowly are fading to gray
Your coat on the chair
And the scent of your hair I miss
The Clock on the wall
It reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park
And we whispered in the dark
And we laughed and cried
And I never knew alone
Wherever you are is home
Without your lips on mine
No, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No, I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I walked by the store
And we sat on the floor
And we ate like kids
Then someone said hey
We're locking the door
No time to play
And I never knew alone
Wherever you are is home
Without your lips on mine
No, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No, I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
We're not over
We're not over
Without your lips on mine
No, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't, no I can't breathe, yeah
You know I can't breathe
Without your lips on mine
No, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe (it's not, it's not over)
Oh you are, you are my lover
Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Yeah
We're not over</field>

Days all feel the same
Still numb from you
First step off of this plane I knew
I suffocate without you
Heart beats for two
It was good
What we had
If that was paradise
Can somebody take me back
And it hurts
Looking back
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad
Don't let go
When the daylight's gone
Cus its always darkest before dawn
I breathe
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs
When I hate the things that I've become
I breathe
Ohoh ohoh
Regrets dancing around my head
Everything I never said
Still numb from you
Secrets sleeping all over this bed
Memories of what we did
Come into view
And it hurts
Looking back
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad
Don't let go
When the daylight's gone
Cus its always darkest before dawn
I breathe
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs
When I hate the things that I've become
I breathe
Oh, oh, I breathe
Breathe
Oh, oh, I breathe
Breathe
Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
Days all feel the same
Still numb from you</field>

Smile within my own
Reflection oh you looked
So beautiful
A tear ran down my face
And all my memories erased
Oh why did ya have to leave my side
Oh why do all the rivers flow to the ocean
And why does all the love in the world come from the heart
And why does all the pain I feel come from deep inside
Oh all these questions I could have answered
If you were by my side
Chorus:
Something made me look at you
Something made me do what I had to do, girl
Somethind made me talk to you
Something made me do what I should
I want you by my side
I want you by my side
I want you by my side
Now every day the pain I feel
Slowly fades away
And all the memories of you and me
Are always here to stay
Oh what I'm asking girl
Is one more chance
To let me in your life
Oh girl if you give me one more chance
Then I could be right by your side
Chorus:
Something made me look at you
Something made me do what I had to do, girl
Something made me talk to you

You could be right here getting best of me
But baby you decided he was your man
And now that you found out

You say you want me around
But I`m not sure now if I wanna be down?
So,I think I wanna stay single
Baby we're better apart
See I don`t wanna a girl that
Only wanna come back cuz
Some other man broke her heart
So bye bye love, bye love (2x)
Crazy how the tables turned
It wasn't long ago that you turned your back..
no
Saying there`s no way that we can work
And you were quick on move on to the next thing
And now that you found now
He's playing little games
You call me again
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down
So, I think I wanna stay single
Baby we`re better apart
See I don`t wanna a girl that

So bye bye love,bye love (2x)
I can't take you back when I know
I'm not the one you really wanted before
But sorry girl I'll let you go
This time I think is best to do it around
Uhhh, huhuuuh, yeahh,(say goodbye to me love?2x)
Bye bye, bye bye love

Can't think of nothing but you
You are the reason i wake up in the morning
Lately i'm sleeping till two
Sometimes i swear that you are lying beside me
I reach for you girl and you are not there
Still got this smell of your body on the pillow
Still finding strings of your hair
Tell me can we try baby
Can we get back to love again
Seems like i'm loosing my best friend
Can you rescue me from the rain
And be my sunshine again
Can i make it up to you
Ill promise that i'll do anything for us
Cuz baby i love you baby i mean it
I need you
Let's go back to love again
I don't wanna go on without you
Baby don't wanna hurt anymore
Aint nothing right in my world
Everything is goin crazy
Aint nothing left to live for
And i try but i can't stop loving you
Wishing you were here, baby you are my life
I just want my baby girl
So can we get back to love again
Seems like i'm loosing my best friend
Can you rescue me from the rain
And be my sunshine again
Can i make it up to you
Ill promise that i'll do anything for us
Cuz baby i love you i mean it

Let's get back to love again
Give me one more night to change your mind
And girl i swear tonight is the night i'll take you there
I have to risk my last chance girl
I don't care if i die trying to get you back
Baby i love you, you are my lady
Ill be there daily, weekly

It seems that everything we've been through
Has been in vain

And I can't stop thinking of you
And I wouldn't if I could
But I can't keep waking up
With dreams of you
You should have known when you told me
You loved me, that you were deceived, babe
It seem that the hurt that I feel deep inside
Will soon be real, baby
But now I'm all alone, and I
Can't stop thinking of you
Hold you in my arms once again
Is all I wanna do

What are the odds
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this
Could have just walked by
Who would've thought
What are the chances

Like two in a million
Like once in a life
That I could have found you
Put my arms around you
Like two in a million
Like once in a life

Aand time hadn't stopped when you said it to me

Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep

In a crowded room

Put my arms around you
Like two in a million
Like once in a life
What are the chances
Is it love
Is it fate
Where it leads who can say
Don't know exactly what it means
Is it love
Is it fate
Where it leads who can say
Maybe you and I were meant to be
What are the chances
That we'd end up dancing
Like two in a million
Once in a life
That I could have found you
Put my arms around you
Like two in a million
Once in a life
What are the chances
What are the chances
Like two in a million

Your hair's a little longer
Am I crazy, is it blonder than it was then?
When you walked down on my house
I didn't say a thing, now
It's funny how a year can fill you head with should've, would've, could've been
Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out
And now there's only five left to tell you
Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back
Would you meet me at the chateau?
At a table, I'd get your favorite chardonnay, yeah
'Cause babe, you know, a bottle is a little bit too much to drink alone
We could catch up, make out, make up
'Cause I don't wanna go
Another day without you, come on
Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed

I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?

That love is alive
Children need a helping hand
Children are so innocent
Make this world a wonderland
So give us a sign
So give us a sign
Children have a heart of gold
Sometimes they feel alone and sold
They need someone to be around
Reach out, a helping hand
So many children don't
Know what to do
'Cause no one's there
To guide them through
We're living in a world so cold
Don't make them sad and sold
They need a helping hand
Children need a helping hand
Children need a promise land
Let the children feel again
That love is alive
That love is alive
Children need a helping hand
Day by day
Children are so innocent
Show them the way
Make this world a wonderland
Join us and stay
So give us a sign
So give us a sign
Children need a helping hand
We are all called to change
Into a world of hope
Without war and without pain
Children do have fantasies
The thoughts of far away and free
Dreamin' of a wonderland
They live
In a children's world
We could live in perfect harmony
Wonderland could be reality
Without war and without pain
And no one dies in pain
That's the promised land
Children need a helping hand
Children need a promise land
Let the children feel again
That love is alive
That love is alive
Children need a helping hand
Day by day
Children are so innocent
Show them the way
Make this world a wonderland
Join us and stay
So give us a sign
Children wanna find their own way
Gettin' stronger day by day
Children have a heart and soul
Don't let them live without a goal
Children make the world go round
Don't destroy what they have found
Set an example be consequent
Be confident with a helping hand
Children need a helping hand
Children need a promise land
Let the children feel again
That love is alive
Children need a helping hand
Children are so innocent
Make this world a wonderland

There is something special
About this time of year
The Christmas felling`s everywhere
I just got home
To join you
I`ve been away too long (been away too long)
But now I`m back to share my love
Friends are reunited
One big family
Filled with love to last
Throughout the year
(Chorus)
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come and joy
The tiding`s to the world
Christmas time
The best time of the year
Yes, it`s Christmas time
You and me together
A sleigh ride in the park
A loving kiss straight from my heart
(Straight from the heart)
Snowflakes are falling gently
The smell of chestnuts in the air
And Christmas lights they gleam
Across the sky (ohohoh, it`s Christmas time)
(chorus)
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come and joy
The tiding`s to the world
Christmas time
The best time of the year
Yes, it`s Christmas time
Do you remember? (do you remember)
Everything felt so right
When I held you close to me
Do you remember?
Those cold Christmas nights
When we sawed the world in harmony
(Chorus)
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come and joy
The tiding`s to the world
Christmas time
The best time of the year
Yes, it`s Christmas time

Come and joy

Close your eyes, make a wish
This could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is that keeps us from each other now
Yeah, its coming to get me
You're under my skin
(Chorus)
No I can't ever let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cuz I miss you
Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside (ohh yeah)
There's gotta be a way you and I together now
Yeah it's comin' to get me
You're under my skin
(Chorus)
No I can't ever let you go
Your a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know the reason why I can't stay forever like this

It's an illusion how can I feel this way
(if I can't have you)
It's an illusion nothing is real this way
(if I can't have you)

No I can't let you go
Your a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss (I don't want to know)
And I don't want to know
The reason why I can't stay forever like this (I am climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls cuz I miss you (oooooooohhhhhhh)
I can't let you go no
And I don't wanna know the reason why
I can't stay forever like this (no no)
Now I'm climbing the walls cuz I miss (I miss you) you</field>

But I can''t run
Drowning the noise inside my head
Who is this man that I''ve become?
It''s killing me to see myself
How do you know how to forgive?
When deep down inside you can't forget
With all that I regret
I pray for the first time in a long time
The lies fade away
Finally I''m waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I''m okay with being alone
When I close my eyes
When I close my eyes
I''m alive
I never was sure
But now I am
This was the choice I had to make
Maybe I''ll never understand
Sometimes you gotta make mistakes
Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
Finally I''m facing up
I feel like I can let it show
I know I can walk away
I'm okay with being alone
When I close my eyes (close my eyes, close my eyes)
When I close my eyes (close my eyes, close my eyes)
When I close my eyes
How do you know where to go when you're going?
How do you know that you know when it''s over?
I see for the first time
In a long time
Believe me when I say
Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
Finally I''m facing up
I feel like I can let it show
I know I can walk away
I''m okay with being alone
When I close my eyes (close my eyes, close my eyes)
When I close my eyes (close my eyes, close my eyes)
I''m alive
I''m alive...</field>

But baby I was wrong
And yeah I know I said
We'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart
I didn't mean to break your heart
But baby, here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth
And now I'm crawling back to you
I know you're in there
And you can make me wait
But I'm not going away
It's the least that I can do
just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself
Now I'm dying in this hell
Girl, I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad
But baby, here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And now I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth
And now I'm crawling back to you
If you could see
these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands
that can't stop shaking
Heal my heart
that's heavily bleeding
You would see a different man
But baby, here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?

I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same

I know you still care

If your words have meaning
If you really care about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you are my lover
Or come as a friend to me
Tell me why would you turn away from my love
Chorus:
So darlin' tell me what to do
To make things right (3x)

If your words have reasons
Then they would turn away from me
Trying hard to hide all truth that you might say
If you listen to me girl
If you know how I'm feeling inside
Then maybe,
You wouldn't shut me out of your life, baby
Chorus
All I'm asking for is a chance
To let me love you
Girl you know,
With me is where you should be
And if I change that we should find

I've tried, oh baby

Give anything for your love to be
How can I make you mine

Hey you're my favorite girl
Excuse me for a moment
I'm in another world
On a mountain by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With venus and with cupid
The picture's very clear
Chorus:
Hang the sign up on the door
I say don't disturb this groove
(all I need is just me and you)
Just a way to tell you that I'm so into you(just someone who understood)
And the feeling's so real
Don't disturb this groove
Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for a moment
I'm at a loss for words
By election,you're perfection
And as if these eyes would care
Your heart is in the right place
So don't you go and change
Baby over and over
The passion start again
You're my lolipops and everything
With a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
And this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from heaven
And the day the Earth stands still
Chorus 2:
Hang the sign up on the door
It says don't disturb this groove(all I need is just me and you)
Just a way to say that I'm so into you(just someone who understood)
And the feeling so real
Don't disturb this groove(all I need is just me and you)
'Cause I want to tell you that I'm so into you(just someone who understood)
And the feeling's so real
Don't disturb this groove
Close your eyes and let the music
Put you in the mood
Oooh baby
Just lock the door and turn the phone off
It's time for me and you

It's the feeling girl
It's the feeling girl
It's the feeling girl

Just another storm

It's a day of war
It's the sound of ground
It's another vein
I was wrong about
But I'll never learn
To look crash and burn
Just another text book caser

Playing with fire
Maybe I should let love alone
Baby I shouldn't listen when they say
Don't try this at home (Don't try this at home)

Guess what I am now
I can't live without
All the foolest love
People talk about
There about myself
No one around
And that's what I'm saying now
But the such lie
Cause I know it once
Looking at us
Forbidden love
Case I'll never learn
To look crash and burn
Just another text book caser

Call me crazy but I'd been here before
And I promised myself that I wouldn't fall
But look me now so lost
I guess I'm gonna have to learn the hard way because
I have a problem with one things that shouldn't touch
I know that love is dangerous but I can't keep
falling

So let the moon shine softly on
The boy I long to see
And maybe when he dreams
He?ll dream of me
I hide beneath the clouds
And whisper to the evening star
They tell me love is just a dream away, dream away,
dream away, dream away
I?ll dream away
So let the moon shine softly on

And maybe when he dreams
He?ll dream of me

You keep me drowning in your love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
You got me drowning
You keep me drowning in your love
Baby I can't help it
(I can't help it, can't help it, no no)
Everytime I breathe I take you in
(yeah I do)
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
(baby I can't help it)
You keep me drowning in your love
And everytime I try to rise above
(everytime I try to rise, rise above)
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love</field>

Girl you know
We belong together
I have no time for
You to be playing
With my heart like this
You'll be mine forever
Baby, you just see
We belong together
And you that I'm right
Why do you play
With my heart,
Why do you play
With my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me
And leave me
And never say goodbye?
When I can't sleep at night
Without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try
I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh
I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around
CHORUS:
Although we've come to
The end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the
End of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Girl, I know you
Really love me,
You just don't realize
You've never
Been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be
Happy together
Forever, you and I
Can you love me again
Like you loved me before
This time I want you
To love me much more
This time instead
Just come to my bed
And baby just
Don't let me
Don't let me down
Repeat chorus
(Spoken:)
Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night
When you just hurt me
And just run out
With that other fella
Baby I knew about it
I just didn't care
You just don't understand
How much I love you do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and
Cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby
But that's all right
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna
Be here for you
Till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in
So much pain baby
'Cause you just won't
Come back to me
Will you?
Just come back to me
(Lonely)
Yes baby my
Heart is lonely
(Lonely)
My heart hurts baby
(Lonely)
Yes I feel pain too
Baby please
This time instead
Just come to my bed
And baby just
Don't let me go

Yeah, I wanna know [I wanna know (4x)]
I wanna know
You had me fooled
You were so good at that
I'm so unglued
Too many pieces
To put back
You were the best by far
How did we end up like this
And even though who you are
I can't believe it's like this
I wanna know
Chorus:
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Your wings are lying on the ground
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Forever is a long way down
You're everything that thought I wanted to be
But everything is disappeared for me
So how does it feel
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Of love
I wanna know (8x)
I followed you
To the deepest part of love (of love)
And how do you
Destroy the life you built for us
This is a mystery
You played the part so well, yeah
Now this is history
Was I the last to tell
I wanna know
Repeat Chorus
The only thing that's worst than emptiness
Is when your heart's lost
And the only thing that's worth the pain
Is the price of what love costs
It's when you think its all in your hands
That's when it's gone
And you think you're invincible
Believe me you're so wrong
Tell me how does it feel</field>

Where the girls are homegrown
That southern dame's so
Sexy how they talk slow
And something happens in the woods of Kentucky
Drinking moonshine, bonfire, pour the gasoline
Farther south
Where the sweet tequila flows
Tiny clothes
Yo te amo Mexico
Señoritas, we are sippin' margaritas on the beach
They got something you can't teach
I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
Rock out in Bangkok, where the party, don't stop
Eyes open, blood shot
Seeing things I'd never thought
Sweating in the heat
God I love the way they speak
Burning up the streets, dancing like a freak
I've been all around, all around the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
So many things to see
So many eyes to meet
I couldn't count them all if I had eternity
So I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
I take a piece with me
Beijing, Stockholm, Buenos Aires, to tango
Moscow, Cape Town, showed us hot to get down
London, Berlin, this is where it all began
San Juan, Sydney, can't forget the NYC
I've been all around, all around the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home</field>

Some people got to have it
Some people really need it
Listen to me y'all, do things, do things, do bad things with it
You wanna do things, do things, do things, good things with it
Talk about cash money, money
Talk about cash money- dollar bills, yall
For the love of money
People will steal from their mother
For the love of money
People will rob their own brother
For the love of money
People can't even walk the street
Because they never know who in the world they're gonna beat
For that lean, mean, mean green
Almighty dollar, money
For the love of money
People will lie, Lord, they will cheat
For the love of money
People don't care who they hurt or beat
For the love of money
A woman will sell her precious body
For a small piece of paper it carries a lot of weight
Call it lean, mean, mean green
Almighty dollar
I know money is the root of all evil
Do funny things to some people
Give me a nickel, brother can you spare a dime
Money can drive some people out of their minds
Got to have it, I really need it
How many things have I heard you say
Some people really need it
How many things have I heard you say
Got to have it, I really need it
How many things have I heard you say
Lay down, lay down, a woman will lay down
For the love of money
All for the love of money
Don't let, don't let, don't let money rule you
For the love of money
Money can change people sometimes
Don't let, don't let, don't let money fool you
Money can fool people sometimes
People! Don't let money, dont let money change you,
it will keep on changing, changing up your mind.</field>

Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Still we are, have always been
Will ever be, ask one
What is done has been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and tought me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide

The same joy the same sadness each step of the way

You gotta hear me out
Do you really wanna be the last to know
What it's all about
Let's talk about two, you say
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't wanna know
I'm telling you, he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't wanna know
Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another player, playing in the name of love
I've seen enough, now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend
Let's talk about what he's done
To become your number one
Or was it all the promises of
Diamonds, pearls and party dresses that turned you on'
I've seen it before, don't take anymore
Free too, you're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up
I'm telling you go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up.
Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another player, playing in the name of love

Brian:
(Ooooo, yeah)
"I don't think I want this anymore,"
As she drops the ring to the floor.
She says to herself, "You've left before," (yeah)
"This time you will stay gone, that's for sure." (yeah)
Nick:
And he shouted something as,
She dragged her suitcase down the path,
to the driveway.
She had never gone that far.
Normally this would be
the time that she
would let him talk her out of leaving,
But this time, without crying,
as she got into her car, she said,
Chorus:
"No
'Happily Never After'
That just ain't for me.
Because finally,
I know
I deserve better, after all (ooooh)
I'll never let another teardrop fall."
(AJ: Faaaaaaallll)
AJ:
As she drove away she starts to smile, (yeah)
Realized she hadn't for a while.
No destination, she drove for miles
Wondering why she stayed in such denial.
Nick:
She was laughing about the way he shouted something as
(shouted something as)
she dragged her suitcase down the path
to the driveway (to the driveway),
she had never gone that far (oh, no)
Normally this would be, the time that she (yeah)

I'm done, I'm done, said I'm so done, so done.
I'm free, I'm free, so free
Free to feel the way I feel, yeah.
Howie:
She inhales a breath she'd never breathed before
Don't want no drama no more.
Brian:
'Cause she says "No

That just ain't for me" (oh, oh)

From each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other
Hold me now

After all that we've been through,
I will make it up to you
I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day
From your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away from the one that I love
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry

lying right beside me it fills the space
in my heart
I can't live without you
don't wanna figure right how to

the emptiness inside of me starts to beat
so loud
I can't hear the sound
do you hear it?
for you
Refrão
I fall in love all over again
each time
I lay my eyes on you
I pretend
I feel so helpless
without you
feel so helpless
without you
It takes a piece of me
each time you leave
I feel it in my chest
so hard to breathe
I feel so helpless
without you
I feel so helpless
without you
I witness every trick you got up your sleeve
but still somehow you keep on surprising me
I’m yours
I can’t live without you
Don’t wanna figure right how to
Every time I see you I feel like I
could be the luckiest man in the world
Why try to fight it
There’s no need to hide it
because
you know
Refrão
I fall in love all over again

I pretend

I feel so helpless
without you
I feel so helpless
without you
Feels like
I fall apart
every time
Where do I start
I’m so helpless
without you
without you
Pitbull:
Everytime I close my eyes
you’re the first thing that runs to my mind
Everywhere I go
I see you
hear you
feel you
I just wanna be near you
and heal? you
Last thing you said is how dare you
First thing I said is I’m sorry
Now I’m sitting here
helpless
man
Same old story
Now she's brokenhearted
Time heals all the wounds
She said
Not this time
It's true
Everyone plays a fool
And that fool is me
Because I foolishly
took advantage of a woman who loved me

Just when I can't say

She comes to me
And leads me back to paradise

But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards
in a hurricane
A reckless fire
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She'll dance away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles
Oh, when she smiles..
(She smiles...)

Maybe I'd fight it if I could
(Maybe I'd fight it if I could...)
It hurts so bad
But feels so good
She opens up just like
A rose to me
When she's close to me
Anything she'd ask me to
I would
It's out of control
But I can't let go

Oh, Yeah....when she smiles
When she looks at me
(When she looks at me)
I get so weak

I'm a house of cards

A reckless fire
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain

Ooh, ooh (2X)

I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
And about by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There were some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me (leading me) to you (to you)
So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Hey Mr

Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr

DJ
Will you play it for me?
Ooh, ooh (2X) (yes yes y'all)
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last?
Make it (make it) last (last, so long)
As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotised
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
Ooh, ooh...
Chorus
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
And just imagine this alone
Let the music put you in a zone
Are you lost in, lost inside of, lost inside of me
Why do you do the dance you do
Come on and work your body, work your body
Hey Mr
DJ, jam all night long
Hey Mr
DJ play that song for me

There's something I would like to say
The way that your body moves is crazy
It drives me insane!
When you lick your lips you got me wishing
Could I be your fantasy?
The thought of you and me together
Oh, is like a dream to me!
You got me running for cover
Looking over my shoulder
Jumping in an ice cold bath
Thinking of something entirely different
Other than your fine
You got me looking for the exit
'Cause there's no way to fake this
You've got me tripping and falling all over myself
'Cause you're so
Hot hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot
I said baby you're so
Hot hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot
Sweeter than candy in the kitchen
You're the dessert I'd like to taste
I know I don't know that much about you
But you got me in love with you, babe
You got me running for cover
Looking over my shoulder
Jumping in an ice cold bath
Thinking of something entirely different
Other than your fine
You got me looking for the exit
'Cause there's no way to fake this
You've got me tripping and falling all over myself
'Cause you're so
Hot hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot
I said baby you're so
Hot hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot
I know it's gonna hurt me, the heat from your love
But I'd rather burn from you
Than die of a lonely heart
My undivided attention is almost through
My best ain't good enough
It's got me acting like a fool
You got me running for cover
Looking over my shoulder
Jumping in an ice cold bath
Thinking of something entirely different

You've got me tripping and falling all over myself

Hot hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot

Oh, you got it going on, you got it going on
Baby you're so hot hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot
Hot hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot

Brings back the child that I resemble
I cannot pretend that we can still be friends
Don't wanna be alone tonight

Just need you to know
I don't wanna live this life

How did I fall in love with you?.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Last night on the road with my head spin-spinning
(last night on road)
Speeding headin' for a dead end but I turned it around
You
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you
Never thought for once that it would end up like this before
Always thought I'll be the one driving
Pay no attention to caution signs
I'm runnin' through traffic lights
Completely out of control
I put my hands on the steering wheel proceeded to give it gas
That's when I ran into you (you)
And girl you turned my life around
I know I was going South
Where would I be without you?
Probably lost
Last night on the road with my head spin-spinning
(last night on road)
Speeding headin' for a dead end but I turned it around
You
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you...
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you
I had my bags packed thinkin' that life wasn't fair
I drove so far 'till nothing' was there
I swear this pain is killing me
Like no one's in love with me
I had to take a backseat down a backstreet
Just to realize the world didn't revolve around me
I was a speed demon how could you ever love a speed demon?
Girl I was so lost...
Last night on the road with my head spin-spinning
(last night on road)
Speeding headin' for a dead end but I turned it around
You
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you...
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you
Girl I know that everything is true, (you)
It's all about you (you), it's all about you, (last night on road)
Be honest I just couldn't breathe I had to turn around
Be honest I just couldn't breathe I had to turn around
Girl I know that everything is true, (you)
It's all about you (you), it's all about you, (last night on road)
Be honest I just couldn't breathe I had to turn around
Be honest I just couldn't breathe I had to turn around (turn around)
(turn around)
Last night on the road with my head spin-spinning
(Last night on road)
Speeding headin' for a dead end but I turned it around
You
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you...
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you (you)
I did it for you</field>

The words you never say

I promise you
From the bottom of my heart
I will love you 'til death do us part
I promise you
As a lover and a friend
I will love you like I'll never love again
With everything I am
I see you look at me
When you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues
Of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue?
The ocean's wide?
All I know is what I feel
When I look into your eyes
CHORUS - repeat
Oh there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch, baby
And what I'm trying to say to you
I never said to anyone
CHORUS - repeat x2
You're everything I am
Oh

Do do do do

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go
I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you
Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
Yeah, I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last
I've tried to fight it, can't deny it
You don't even know that
I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you
No, No...
I wish I could find you
Just like you found me, then I
Would never let you go

Though everything's been said and done, yeah
I still feel you (I still feel you)

You said no, but I found out

Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie (2x)
As time goes by
You will get to know me a little more better
Girl that's the way love goes
And I know you're afraid
To let you're feelings show
And I understand, but girl it's time to let go

Shuffle the deck and start over
It should be just like driving in your car
Get lost and your navigation system
Gets you closer
But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go
If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now
Life should come with remote controls
Then I could rewind it
To time it was better
It should have a restart button
So, I could travel right back
To the day that I met her
But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause when you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go
If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now
Cause there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
See once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go
(2x)
If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best

Wondering if the thoughts I'm feeling, you're feeling too
Like a new born child - soft to the touch
Baby is it possible to love someone so much?
[mm, mmm]
I wish I may,
I wish I might
Be that certain someone
You wish for every night
CHORUS
If you knew what I knew,
You wouldn't say what you said
(say what you said)
If you knew what I knew,
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
(breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady, yes
(my lady, yes my lady)
If you knew what I knew
(ahh, ahhh, ahhh .ahhhhh-ahhhhh, aaahhhhhhhhh)
Time passes by
The only tears I cry
Are filled with disillusion and fears I have inside
Like a lost soul...I feel like I'm all alone
(all alone)
If only I could feel your pain within your heart of stone...
REFRAIN
I wish I may,
I wish I might
Be that certain someone

Right by my side

To be happy
You are all I need to make me happy
Coz everytime you’re near
All the tears inside are raindrops
All the sadness in my lifetime goes away
Just believe in me
All I need is someone who believes in me
You’re the good luck charm
You’re the reason for the rainbows
God knows I’d hate to see you go away
Baby don’t leave me this way
(If you stay)
If you stay I’ll give you what you want
(I’ll show you)

I pray for this heart to be unbroken

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby
It's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake
I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete
I don't mean to drag it on, but I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone

A thousand more regrets unraveling, ohh
If you were here right now, I swear,
I'd tell you this
Chorus:
Baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside it's killing me
Cause all i ever want, it comes right down to you
I'm wishing I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable
I climb the walls
I can see the edge but I can't take the fall, no.
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call?
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibilities
Chorus:
Baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside it's killing me
Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you
I'm wishing I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable
I don't want to be like this,
I just want to let you know,
Everything that I'm holding,
Is everything I can't let go, can't let go.
Chorus:
Cause Baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside it's killing me
Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you
I'm wishing I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable
Don't you know it baby
I don't want to waste another day

You're like the perfect girl with the perfect skin, so...
I'm just too scared to know that I'm gonna live
without you girl (??)
You can call me a man
(Bridge 1:)
Because I know
That this ain't the kind of love that could just take
One night and then it's over
Girl I know
I ain't never fell in love so quickly
Baby please come with me
All you need is my love in a bag
(Chorus)
Girl I can think of only one and no one else and dance to you
We're like the perfect team
No matter where I go you gotta roll
I bet they know about you and
I'm not leaving without you girl (??)
And I don't need to read your mind
Bridge 2:
Because I know
That you want to see the world
And I could say that all I need is
One night and then we'll be closer
And I know
I ain't never fell in love so quickly
Baby please come with me
All you need is my love in a bag

With over-overthinking us
Feelin' like it's nowhere to go, it's taking a toll
I don't wanna give you up
But we used to be, used to be better
Is it just me?
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me?
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing
Is it just, just me? Ooh
Is it just, just me? Ooh
It's two AM, you're not even home, I'm here alone
Callin' but your phone is off
You go and blame it all on your friends, not that again
Need to know what's going on, 'cause
The more I think about what we were, the more that I'm sure
Sure, I'm not the only one, yeah
We used to be, used to be better
Never forget, back when we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one
Is it just me?
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?

You feel my feelings one by one
Can't see the world I'm walking through

Like any other
Fall out and lose his mind
And I'm sorry for the things I did
For your teardrops over words I said
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again?
It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart
Whatever happened
I know that I was wrong, oh yes
Can you believe me
Maybe your faith is gone, but is it?
But I love you and I always will
So I wonder if you want me still
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again, oh yeah
It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart
I'd do anything to make it up to you
So please understand
And open your heart once again
It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah it's true
Without you I would fall apart
It's true
I mean it

You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night
Wrapped around your finger
Always in my mind
The days they went cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me
I just want you to know that
I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I'll make it through,
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say
I would do it all again
Just want you to know
All the doors are closing
I'm trying to move ahead
And deep inside I wish to meet you instead
My dreams are empty from the day
The day you slipped away
And I just want you to know that
I’ve been fighting to let you go
Some days I’ll make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there’s a day you’ll come back to me

I know I can't fake it, there's no one else

Too late to call, this is not like me
But i'm still lifted from the tattoo on the small of
your back
The angle of your chin when you were looking back
Say, "god, you're beautiful" and i'm still calming
down
Like a one night stand that had to stick around
But i'm still floating from the perfume you left on my
sheets
I haven't changed a thing since your goodbye to me
Tonight i stare out the window knowing I'll never
again be alone
Chorus
Last night you changed my life
And i'm stuck in the moment that you kissed me the
first time
Last night you saved my life with your love, saved my
life
Last night you saved my life
Your fingernails running down my spine
All i day i hear your voice like velvet in my mind
It's like i knew you all my life even though we just
met
My children in your eyes, something you don't expect
I had to stop myself from calling all day long
I'm glad you called me first, i wanted to be strong
But you were laughing i cause i answered after just
one ring
I tried to play it off, but you knew everything
Repeat chorus
With your love
Last night you saved my life
Last night you saved my life
I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun
I can't wait to tell you're the only one
Last night you saved my life
And i'm stuck in the moment that you kissed me the
first time
Last night you saved my life with your love, saved my
life
Last night you changed my life
And i'm stuck in the moment that you kissed me the
first time
Last night you saved my life with your love, saved my

A love just like this

You can get all inside me

Baby we will discover
We can be more than lovers
I give what you need
Just come to me and get it
Baby you wont regret it

I wanna feel your body next to mine
And before night is over you will know
Just what it means
To be loved until you scream

Find just what we've looking for
Good, good lovin and a whole lot more so
Hold on, real tight

When I’m lost all the way and I can’t face another day
And if I stumble on the road and if I can’t get the load
If I loose my faith, kindness, generosity

You caught me on the blind, blind side
You didn't even stop once to think twice!
Drove through the pouring rain
We better know the pain
Wanted to turn around, turn around!
We shout it, 'turn it down! '
I still remember how we left it that night
Said it was better if we all just moved along
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
I'll be polite; I'll leave the light, light on!
Leave the light on
I'll leave the light on!
My light on!
Leave the light on
I'll leave the light on!
And never lose the beat, beat in your heart
After falling in so deep, so hard
So if you're running bound, bound, bound in the dark
I'll find a way to recognize the spark!

Jump in your car and just drive back to me!
Wherever you are, I will always leave the light on!
Leave the light, leave the light on!
Leave the light, leave the light on!
I need you, baby!
Leave the light, leave the light on!
Leave the light, leave the light on!
Leave the light, leave the light on!
Leave the light, leave the light on!
I need the light on!
I still remember how we left it that night
Said it was better if we all just moved along
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
I'll be polite; I'll leave the light, light on!
Leave the light on
I'll leave the light on!
My light on!
Leave the light on
I'll leave the light on!
My light on!
Leave the light on!</field>

girl would you promise not to say good-bye
'cause I'm holding on
With A Love so strong
And I can't take a day without you by my side
Girl If I could change
if I could change your mind
Baby you could help me wipe these tears from my eyes
CHORUS
Girl Don't stop
the sun from shining down on me
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child
Girl I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me ( oh back to me)
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
that there's a broken heart that lies within your hands
So If I could change (So if i could change)
And it won't hurt your pride ( and it wont hurt your pride)
Baby you can help stops these tears that i cry
CHORUS
Extended Chorus
Like a child
Just like a child
With the spirits running free
She showed me why
Oh, she did
Like a child (oh baby)
Just like a child
think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

If I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall
Cause knowing you are out there breathing
Is so wonderful
It's a chance I'll take
Even if I break and
I lose it all
If I lose it all
It wouldn't matter anyway
Don't change a thing
You're perfect as you are
Time has a way
And time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
There'll be one less thing I'd have to prove
Chorus
Heaven will be waiting
When I fall into your open arms
I believe you'll find me there
Find me there

Let the beat go down, down, down
Can we stay up all night
Cuz we can sleep all day
Everybody come out to play
Let me hear you say yay, yay, yay
How did we get here
It feels like I'm floating off the ground
Love is the only place
Now I'm getting scared of looking down
Let's go
Ah, ah
I got so hot that I don't feel anything baby
Aah, aah
And get this spot, let me get you by my side
Aah, aah
It's about to get crazy I wanna get crazy with me
Hold on, time
As the world goes round, round, round
Let the beat go down, down, down
Can we stay up all night
Cuz we can sleep all day
Everybody come out to play
Let me hear you say yay, yay, yay
We get lost in space
We don't need no rocket
To get lost in space
Show me how you rock it, baby
Lost in space, we don't need no rocket
To get lost in space
Lost, lost
It feels like I'm crushin'
I crash slowly into you
I love the attraction
I'm loving everything you do
Aah, aah
I got so hot that I don't wanna feel anything baby

It was just a myth
It just wasn't for real
It didn't exist
Till the day you came into my life
And forced me to think twice
I didn't have too much
No, I wasn't rich
You made believe someday
I'd be more than this
That's why I'm to this day,
I'm still your man
'cause you made me understand that
Love is
Kisses in the bean bag chair
The two of us, but no one else
Love is
The moment that I climb the stairs
To hold you in my arms
After we made love
Love is
Waking up to see your face
Or kissing in the morning rain
Love is
The only thing that keeps me sane
At the end of the day is that I've got you
Love is
You're my secret place
Where I can be myself
You connect with me
Like nobody else
Even though our circunstances changed
Our love still remains
Sit me on the ground
Still you help me fly
You got me to be patient
I'll teach you to rely
So no matter what tomorrow brings
We got the simple things 'cause
Love is
A sunday morning with the blanket
Wrapped around your waist
Love is
The way your lips seem to curve
When you say my name
Love is
And when I'm stressing like the world
Is turning upside down
It all make sense when you're around
Love is
Waking up to see your face
(it's that I've got you)
Or kissing in the morning rain
At the end of the day is that I've got you...</field>

You make me say it 25 times a day
You make me feel you don't believe the words I say
What is a man to do to prove his love for you?
You make me feel like i'm just givin' free love away
I can send flowers tomorrow
But it doesn't mean a thing
If your heart rejects the message from mine
It's a waste of time
Baby love knows I love you
Baby love knows the truth
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you
Yeah, I look at you and know I never loved anyone more
You make me feel like a child in a candy store
What can I do to prove
That you're a dream come true
And in this dream there's a pulse from my heart to yours
I can send daisies daily
But it never will penetrate
If your heart if rejects the best from mine
It's a waste of time
Baby love knows I love you (I really do)
Baby love knows the truth
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you (I really do, babe)
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you
Baby I'm lookin for cupid
Can I tie him in a ball and chain
To see if he can say to you
The words that make you feel my love is real, oh
Baby love knows I love you
(That's right you know I love you, baby girl)
Baby love knows the truth
(Hey gotta know the truth, you know I love you)
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here
Resting in my heart
(In my heart)
From the very start
I loved you
(Yeah, that's right)
Resting in my heart

I loved you, yeah</field>

Is it too much
To ask for one minute to breathe
'Cause you take my breath away like I never seen
You're the reason why cave men
Drew on the walls
The reason why after every summer we fall
You're the reason I never wanna sleep at night
'Cause nothing that I dream
It's better than you by my side
You know that I
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
I'm so in love
I can die right now and be fine
I need you tonight
You know that I
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
Love somebody, love somebody
When you wake up with no make up
You try hiding your face
(You-you, you know that I)
And it's so cute, you don't even know
How beautiful you are to me
You're the reason why cave men
Drew on the walls
The reason why after every summer we fall
And the way that you look in those purple jeans
It's still the sexiest thing that I've ever seen
You know that I
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
I'm so in love
I can die right now and be fine
I need you tonight
You know that I
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
When the game?s on
You wear the jersey of my favorite team
I yell at the tv, knock over your beer
You?re not even mad at me
You know I love you baby
Love somebody, love somebody
I know that
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
I'm so in love
I can die right now and be fine
I need you tonight
You know that I
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
I'm gonna love you, gonna love you, gonna love girl

I won't tell nobody
I'll just scream it in my mind
Nothing good in life is scripted
It's not like we predicted
That the one you want
Is going to be the one you thought
Nick:
I won't tell nobody
But I won't live like a prisoner
Nothing has to be so perfect
Can you tell me was it worth it
Because her heart can't lie
And even though her face may try
Love can keep you up all night
Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something that you can't decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You gotta taste the sweet divine
To get to the other side
Love will keep you up all night
Brian:
If I don't tell a living soul
Still everyone would know
Yes, they would
It's always 3 am somewhere
You know it when you get there
Aj:
Some people try to cover it up
Some people think it's never enough
Ooooh, love will keep you up all night
It's not somenthing that you can't decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You gotta taste the sweet divine
To get to the other side
Oh, Love will keep you up all night, Ooh
Nick:
I don't mean to scare you
But everybody has a first time
One day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should have tried
Stayed up all night
Love will keep you up all night
It's something that you can't decide
Aj:
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying (crying, you're crying) on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You gotta taste the sweet divine
It took you to the other side
All:
Love will keep you up all night
Love will keep you up all night

And i love how loving you feels so real
Through the good through the bad
When i'm happy you are sad
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world
Ohoooh loving you than anything else
All my life i've dreamed of a princess all dressed in white
Standing there to be my bride and then there's you
A sending from heaven right before my eyes
Letting me know that there is a god somewhere i know
Many people think they find love in the world
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you
I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah
And i love how loving you feels so real so real baby
Through the good through the bad
When i'm happy you're sad
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world
Ohoooh i'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world (in the world)
All my life i've wondered if i'd hear all the bells and whistles
If the one should come my way
Then there is you like the wind makes the earth shake
Making me a believer there must be a god somewhere i know
Many people think they find love in the world
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you
This kind of love doesn't come from just a touch
Nor does it come from anything you can't pay for
Its so pure if we just send love on in the world
Cus i love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah
And i love how loving you feels so real so real so real
Through the good through the bad the bad
When i'm happy you're sad
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world
Ohoooh i'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world (in the world)
I love how loving you makes me feel
And i love how loving you feels so real

What happens when you shut down
And all the amber lights turn into red?
In the silence of your cave you feel safe
You decorated with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you know that help is on its way
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The summer will come in
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
Rise up, rise up, rise and live again
'Cause only you can Madeleine
Oohh, oohh, oohh Madeleine
Remember when you use to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what would they find out?
You wrote in a notebook
And said that one day this would be a story to tell
And you put it in a movie
And maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you know that help is on its way
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The sun will come up again
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The summer will come in
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
Rise up, rise up, rise and live again
'Cause only you can Madeleine
Oohh, oohh, oohh
Let the sunshine warm your heart today
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The sun will come up again
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The summer will come in
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
Rise up, rise up, rise and live again

We could be king and queen
Rule another world forever

I'd be by your side
If we could only believe

Catch another breath I got nothing left
This love I have is pulling me to death
Waiting for the night I can feel alive with you

Listen up!
This seems so hypnotic
Smoke and mirrors, lights and magic
Group of faces and gold
This soldier boys, beauty queens
Everyone's a mystery
It's got me losing control
Yearning, I'm gurning
For the one to steal my eyes
Wanna play in this game of disguise
Chorus:
It's a masquerade
A love parade
So won't you stay
And dance with me
All through the night and day
A masquerade
I need you baby
To stay with me tonight (Masquerade)
Masquerade (7x)
Just like a perfect dream
I don't ever wanna leave
A thousand freaks in a show
One's a tiger
One's a lynx
One's a king of suffering
Moving high, moving low
Burning, I'm burning
Can't you see it in my eyes
Wanna play in this game of disguise
REPEAT CHORUS
I gotta know the girl behind the mask
Let me in where you've been
Don't pretend
Don't gotta hide alone
Show your face to me
We can be everything
It's a masquerade
A love parade
So won't you stay
And dance with me
All through the night and day
A masquerade
I need you baby
To stay with me tonight

The love I left behind
I still think about it
All the time
Nothing stays the same
Maybe I'm to blame
Oh, I
I'd do it all again
Through these eyes
I've seen a thousand lies
And it's taken years
To realize
That nothing stays the same
And noone is to blame
But I
I'd do it all again
Doesn't really matter if you got it right
Doesn't really matter who was wrong or right
All I know
Yes, I know
That I can make it through
What about you?
Oooh my my
There ain't no way it's gonna change me
'Cause all the fear I've left behind (where you gonna go?)
And only time will tell you what is meant to be
There's a place
I can't let go
Holding all the dreams I used to know
I wish it was the same
I guess noone's to blame
But I
I'd do it all again
Doesn't really matter if you got it right
Doesn't really matter who was wrong or right
Looking at my life today
And I'm allright
Yes, I'm ok
Now I see the world in a better way (so much better now)
And I know
Yes, I know
That I can make it through
Memories
The love I left behind
I wish it was the same
I guess noone's to blame
Nothing stays the same
Everything must change
Oh I
I'd do it all again

And looking for your face inside the crowd
I've been talking to the people that we used to know
But nobody wants to say where you hang out
And when I call your phone
Seems like you're never, ever home
And you don't return my calls
It tears me up
Its breaking up my heart
CHORUS
I still have your picture hung around my room
Its the only thing that's left of you with me
Girl, what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way It used to be
Oh is it someone new
That can never go on without you
Girl I don't wanna think about it
I can't sleep at night
No this can't be right
Come back into my life (come back, baby come back)

You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines, oh...
Chorus:
I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that
Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby, knowing in the end, that
Chorus Repeat
It's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't try
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye
I will love you more than that
I won't say the words
Then take them back
Ohh...

We're trying our best to make it through
There's no mistakes, just lessons

We had to accept the wrongs and try to make them right
It may be hard to look at yourself and see the truth
You've got to realize it takes time to become you

So just get to movin' on
We're movin' on
We're movin' on
Living day by day by day everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same
Movin' on
Take what you've been given
Gotta take a chance while we can
To find our place in our world
We had to understand the plan
Put the bast behind you and
Pick up the pieces move on with your life

I know you will be forever in my life (yet)
Never gone
I walk alone these empty streets
There's not a second you're not here with me
The love you gave
The grace you showed
It'll always give me strength and be my cornerstone
Somehow you found a way to see the best I have in me
As long as time goes on I swear to you that you will be

Never let 'em tick, tick, tick

No, I don't wanna share you with no one else

Torn by the way of us changing on the phone
All this space in between us
makes it hard to feel close to you

and it brought me back
No matter, will I remember you forever like that?

Save me I'm falling again, falling again
Keep me from breakin in a million pieces
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
In the end no matter what I do (what I do)
There's no where, no where to go
Nowhere to go but you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Baby I know your hurting
Right now you feel like you could never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you
From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh when I asked you out
You said no but I found out
Darling that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again
I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me
(CORO:)
Nunca te hare llorar
Nunca te hare cambiar
Prefiero morir que vivir sin ti
Te dare mi ser siempre sere fiel (2x)
Corazon todo se ve un poco mejor
Podrias quererme como yo te quiero a ti
Se que sientes gran temor
Demostrar tu sentimientos el dolor y sufrimiento
Marcaron tu corazon (marcaron tu corazon)
Just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me
Darling why can't you see
Es dificil volver a confiar
Hazlo y te enseñare a amar
yo te hare feliz

It's only been a month since I met you
I gotta say that was my favorite June
And I knew, from that night
That I would be alright
If I
I only knew that one day I would find
Someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted
Looking for the right one at the wrong door
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Baby, I'm all in it
Just tell me you were on in it
People wanna talk, shut 'em all off
And tell 'em all to mind their business
Will for the grumps and cynics
Been that way from the beginning
People see what they don't have
They get sad and act out 'cause they're winning
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me too
Ooh, eh, eh
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Nothing else matters
And baby, I know, we'll find a way
Eh, eh, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me too
Ooh
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me too
Ooh, eh, eh
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters

I see your shadow even when you're not standing there
I feel you when I close my eyes
I've been through it all, I admit it I wont lie
It's only just a matter of time
I dont think I was so (devoted)
Pieces will come together
I was so, my heart was right
And I promise you baby that..

I know I can't
It's impossible going on

On without you
I know I can't
Nick
I hear your walking through the halls when I know you`re not home
The thought of you is all that remains
I wonder if I call would you pick up the phone
and tell me that you're feeling the same
There's nothing left, might take it slow..
the pieces will come together
I tell myself, if I'm wrong
I'm not giving up baby but..

Ooh, oh, oh
She wakes up with the sun
(The sun)
She throws on her clothes
(Her clothes)
Hoping her car will start
The second time around
The day has begun
(Begun)
The lines out the door
(The door)
Serving up fraps
Until she can’t take anymore
I see it in her broken smile
Oh, I wish I could tell her
All:
You’re one in a million
You’re going the distance, babe
You’re gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You’re one in a million

Howie:
No, she never looks my way
She never, never, ever looks my way
Nick:
She ties up her hair
(Her hair)
Her makeup is smeared
(Is smeared)
Wiping the tears that she wants no one to see
She screams on the pain
I hear every word

How beautiful you are
Just see it in my broken smile
Oh, I wish I could tell her

Standing close to someone else

Wishing all my feelings was gone

Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry...
(chorus)
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie, I guess
I'm down to one last cry
I was here you were there guess
We never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feelings were gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie, I guess
I'm down to one last cry
I know I gotta be strong
But 'round me life goes on and on
And on and on and on
I'm gonna dry my eyes right after
I have my one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind

It's almost a year since
I got to hold you, head on my shoulder
Dodging the daylight, taking the blame I
It's all I got left, so lately I've spent
Every single night like its 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, you're always gonna be my
Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call
First time it rings
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you
That moment I knew
Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us
Every single night feels like 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, your always gonna be my
Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call
So let me make my case
That way you won't erase the message
That I'm leaving for you now
But if you do at least you knew
Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call
You'll always be my one
You'll always be my one

You know I been trying to figure out
Just what's going on
Am I over her?
I been doing a lot of thinking lately
Am I over her?
And I'm really missing you
It's been 3 months, 3 hours, 3 days
Since the last time I seen your pretty face
My decision to bring this to an end
And I'm caught up in reminscing
Having faithful visions of long walks, long talks
Play fights, late nights
It's been on my mind since Valentine's
Cause I had your heart and I let it slide
I ask myself time and time again (again I'm trying to comprehend that)
Unanswered questions still (things to be are meant to end)
Am I over her? (am I over her?)
Am I over her?
Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?
I was going through some things that I couldn't explain
Now my situation's taking a big change
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town
Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around
Is she sad or is she mad?
Does she have a new man, does she have it like that?
It's been so long, thought I would've moved on
Could've been strong and picked up the telephone
I ask myself time and time again (again I'm trying to comprehend that)
Unanswered questions still (things to be are meant to end)
Am I over her? (am I over her?)
Am I over her?
Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?
It's water under the bridge
But I can't seem to forget
All the plans we made, all the time we spent
Makes me reminisce
I still see your face
All this love I can't replace
Am I over (am I over)
Am I over her? (her now)
Am I over her?
Am I over her? (am I)
Am I over her? (am I over)
Tell me am I really over my my love (my love my love)
I can't think straight (my love)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her (never gonna be over her)
Am I really over my love? (never gonna be)
No
Am I over her?
No not over her no
Ohhhhhh
Am I over her?
Am I over her? (over her)
Am I over her?
Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her, am I over her?)
I can't think straight (I'm not over her)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love? (ahh oooh)
I'm not over my my my love
I'm not over my my my love
I'm not over my my my love (oh no no)
I'm not over my my my love
Am I over her? (I'm not over my my my love)
Am I over her? (I'm not over my my my love)
Am I over her? (I'm not over my love my love, she's my love, she's my)
Tell me am I really over my my love (she's my everything)
I can't think straight (she's my everything, my everything)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?
Not over not over my love
Not over not over my love
I'm not over not over my love
Am I over her?
Not over not over my love..</field>

You’re inconsistency
And ya know it’s dragging me down
You’re so conflicted baby
All:
You’re always walking away
One step and everything’s over
So you’re running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out

I already said I’m sorry

I’ve been an addict
A blind fanatic
Don’t you know?
You’re not immune to the panic

Julie was a long way from home
She can make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of her landscape
Riding her bike through alphabet city
She likes to party in the backseat under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise
She said "What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl
(right now right now ooh ooh oohh)
Julie likes to shoplift in stores
Right alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor until the camera made us
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
When she walked I followed, when she laughed I cried,
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
And I was wrapped around her finger , and I began to believe
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game

She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)

Even in my heart, I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
(1)Sometimes I wish I could, turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could, so bad, baby...
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (With my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should've known from the start
You know you've gotta stop (With my heart)
You're tearing us apart (From my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see?
(repeat 1)
Quit playing games, baby, baby
The love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hangin' here forever
Oh baby, baby
This is not right, let's stop this tonight
Baby, ooh..
Quit playing games
Na, na, na...baby
Na na na na na naaah

Oooh..
How many times am I gonna let you walk right pass?
I swear sometimes I think I'm moving too fast
You'll never know if it's gonna last
I guess that's what scares me sometimes
ooo.
I know it ain't right but I don't wanna let you care
I wanted to love but I'm a little scared
You'll never know what you're gonna get
And that is what scares me sometimes, times
(Chorus)
Next time love comes my way,
I'll never let it happen, happen baby,
If ever I made, made a mistake,
I've been a rebel too long
Rebel too long (4x)
(Verse 2)
How do I hurt people that don't hurt me back? yeah
A Tug-a-war, got so tired of that
I may not let my wall guards down,
I'm done playing tough guy for now, for now
Everybody deserves second chances,
Not only flies in certain circumstances,
Can't keep running away from these feelings
Everybody needs someone sometimes, sometimes
(CHORUS)
(Verse 3)
And before this moment fades away
I wanted you to know I made mistakes
Even if there's no more words to say
I tried to be better without you
(CHORUS) (2x)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Rumours
How do rumours get started?
Started by the jealous people
They get mad
See something they had
And somebody else is holding
They tell me that temptation
Is very hard to resist
But these wicked woman
Oh, they just persist
Maybe you think it’s cute
But girl I’m not impressed
I tell you what I’m only
With my business please don’t miss
When you look at all these rumours
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumours
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said
That’s why I’ll never
Be with the girl next door
Did you hear the one about Tina?
Some say she’s much to loose
That came straight from a guy
Who claims he has the proof
Did you hear the one about Michael?
Some say he must be gay
I tried to ague but they said
If he was straight, he wouldn’t move that way
Did you hear the one about Susan?
Some say she’s just a tease
In a camisole
She’s six feet tall
She’ll knock you to your knees (when you)...
When you look at all these rumours
Surrounding me everyday
I just need some time
Some time to get away from ?
From all these rumours
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said
That’s why I’ll never
Be with the girl next door
I can’t go no place
With somebody pointing a finger
Can’t show my face
‘Cause when it comes to rumours
I’m a dead ringer
It seems some rumours
I just can’t get away
I bet there will be rumours
Floating around on judgement day
I think I’ll write my congressman
And tell him to pass a bill
The next time they catch somebody
Spreading rumours shoot to kill
When you look at all these rumours
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumours
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said
That’s why I’ll never
Be with the girl next door
Stop stop spreading those rumours around
Stop stop spreading those lies
What’s mine is mine
I ain’t got time
For rumours in my life
I’m a man who thinks
Not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life
When you look at all these rumours
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from ?
From all these rumours
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said
That’s why I’ll never
Be with the girl next door</field>

I know that there must be
Something here
Cause you're all the air in my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete cause
You're rushed over me
There's no more blindness
When I cry I'm smilin'
You kept me from dyin'
And I know with you I'll keep on livin'
It's not enough just holding on
Before I met you I was lost
Now that you're standing here
I don't want you to go
I know that your love keeps me alive</field>

And after all this time my heart still burns for you
If you don't know by now that you're my only one
Just take a look inside me and watch my heart strings come undone
I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use?
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide
Can you see me? Here I am
I need you like I needed you then
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart and still find
You're my safest place to hide
You see colors no one else can see
In every breath you hear a symphony
You understand me like nobody can
I feel my soul unfolding like a flower blooming
When this whole world gets too crazy
And there's nowhere left to run
I know you give me sanctuary
You're the only truth I know
You're the road back home
Can you see me? Here I am
Standing here, where I've always been
And when words are not enough
I climb inside your heart and still find
You're my safest place to hide
I know I promised you forever
There's no stronger word I can use

Here I am again
Waiting on the moment you decide
To leave me stranded on the edge of nowhere
I’ve been so close to you so many times
I feel like I could drown
I wish that I could fly away from here
All:
But I’m still coming down
AJ:
From the last time
All:
That you came around
AJ:
In the starlight
All:
Now I’m pulling to your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I’m falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite
AJ:
Like a lonely satellite
Nick:
With walks on Jupiter
Fool around the moon a time or two
Left a mark on every star we could find
But now I’m burning like a meteor
That never hits the ground
Wish that I could fly away from you
All:
But I’m still coming down
AJ:
From the last time
All:
That you came around
AJ:
In the starlight
All:
Now I’m pulling to your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I’m falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite
Nick:
Love is poisoning the atmosphere
Is keeping everything unclear to me
Howie:
Something in your eyes
Never satisfies
I’m feeling so alone, tonight
All:
But I’m still coming down (still coming down)
From the last time (the last time)
That you came around (you came around)
In the starlight (the starlight)
Now I’m pulling to your gravity (ooooh)
Spinning helplessly
I’m falling through the night (falling through the night)
Yes I’m falling through the night (falling through the night)

The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my mind
Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory bliss
Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void
I've ever had in life(ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But god knows how wrong you are
Baby will you be there
Baby will you be there
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent
Wishing you
Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory bliss
Sadness has overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have
Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory bliss</field>

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness is tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no

Got nothing to hide no more

Hoping you'd rescue me

So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh
Tell me what you're really here for
If you never really loved me, I
Gave my all, but it still wasn't enough
Cause all you had to say is that you ain't
Looking for commitment
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear
Heeeeey,
You took my emotions
And scattered them on the ground
So hard to just pick up
And move on with life again.
And now I'm shattered,
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it
broke)
Oh how it hurts
(Felt) it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh</field>

She ain't even got a radio (dio)
We're more than able (able)
What kinda girl she'd be taken for ?
The perfect kind
Just what I like
Exactly what I had in my mind
A dream
She is a dream
Shawty don't know I'm on the red carpet
Almost every night
When I'm outta time to go to do work
A first class every flight
If she takes the time to open her eyes
She could realize
That she's a dream
She knows me
Shawty don't know who I am
She don't know I'm a celebrity
Cause when I let her meet my fame
And nobody mention my pedigree
Cause everytime i take her out
We're always in the VIP
Shawty don't know who i am
But she knows me (She's a dream)
That's what make her say uhhh
Make her say ahhh
Make her say uhhh
Make her say ahhh (She's a dream)
Shawty don't know who I am
And I'm cool with that
If she says so
I really got a lot to her
And when I'm out making peso
And nobody treat her like I'd do her
Cause I'm the one
That she thinks about
The only one on her mind
She's a dream
Cause she knows me
Shawty don't know that I'm on the stage
Three or four times a week
She don't even know I've been around the world
And all the different girls i meet
But there's this one face that i see
She's the only one for me
She's a dream
Cause she knows me
Shawty don't know who I am
She don't know I'm a celebrity
Cause when I let her meet my fame
And nobody mention my pedigree
Cause everytime i take her out
We're always in the VIP
Shawty don't know who i am
But she knows me (She's a dream)
That's what make her say uhhh
Make her say ahhh
Make her say uhhh
Make her say ahhh (She's a dream)
See, shorty don't know who I am
That's not good for us, cause I know,
It's not good to fuss
And I know she loves me, for me
And I love her, for her
But it wouldn't work if she ever gave
a damn 'bout who I am but she knows me
Shawty don't know who I am
She don't know I'm a celebrity
Cause when I let her meet my fame
And nobody mention my pedigree
Cause everytime i take her out
We're always in the VIP
Shawty don't know who i am
But she knows me (She's a dream)
That's what make her say uhhh
Make her say ahhh
Make her say uhhh
Make her say ahhh (She's a dream)</field>

Falling down I'm still alive
Am I? Am I?
So hard to breathe when the water's high
No need to swim, I'll learn to fly
So high, so high
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you
When walls start to close in
And your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of
When sunlight is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show 'em what you're made of
Gloves are off ready to fight
Like a lion I will survive
Will I? Will I?
You gotta stand for something
Even if you stand alone
Don't be afraid, it's gonna be alright
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof, I see myself in you
When walls start to close in
And your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me...
Chorus
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with ?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love
There's no control
Are you with me now
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Chorus
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with ?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you're asking me
to feel the things you never show ?
You are missing in my heart ...
Tell me why can't I be there where you are .

"If you wanna talk you can call

I just smiled and said "let go of me.
Now, there's something I just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?"
She said "it's not my fault"
Refrão:
Then my heart did time in Siberia
It was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
I was drifting in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been
Refrão
Then my heart did time in Siberia
It was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind, in your head
When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you wanna talk, give me a call
Refrão
Then my heart did time in Siberia
It was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious

That I called you
I'm trying to pick up
The pieces of my life
I forgot that we were over
Tell me what went wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong
Twelve days, four hours, twenty minutes
I'm stuck and you know you've got me in it
Broken glass on the floor from the picture frame
Shame, shame, shame
We had it all
This love so strong
Now everything
We had is gone
If you could read my mind
You'd know I've crossed that line
Cos I'm as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me
You know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There's nowhere to run
Girl I can't let you go
And it's twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more
Six miles, twelve lights till your front door
I'm on my way just like I have so many times before
Does he know that it's me you've been talking to?
Shame, shame, shame
If you could read my mind
I'm gonna fight to get you back this time
Cos I'm as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me

Girl I can't let you go

But I just can't take it no more
I'm tired of all these lies
There's nothing but regret behind these eyes
All this love I could never show
I don't care any more
Give a damn who knows
Cos I'm as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me
You know that I mean it
I need you back with me
There's nowhere to run

Girl I can't let you go (nowhere to hide)
And it's twisted I know

Yeah, I just can't leave you alone
Yeah, yeah
Tired of all the lies
Oh babe you've got me stripped of my pride
Gonna shout it from a mountain top
Yeah, drain the oceans from the tears we've cried
Gonna break down these walls
Gonna stand tall
Gonna be your man
Hope you understand, oh
That I’ll never let you go</field>

You didn't love the hiding scars
I'll be there when you fall apart

Seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
It's rituals, habitual
But it's never gonna work this time
We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other
I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay, in all this pain
And nothing's going to make it go away
I don't want to wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't want to wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
So save your voice
Don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end?
This goodbye, it's permanent
So wish me well
And try to forget
All the fights
And all the ways
We almost made it
But we never did
And finally it's come to this
I don't want to wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me

This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
It's a song for the unloved
This one's for the bridesmaid, never the bride
And this one's for the dreamer who locked his faith inside
And this is for the widows who think there's only one
For the dying fathers who never told their sons
No one is glamorously lonely, follow your heart
This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
It's a song for the unloved
Tomorrow the sun will shine
And dry the tears in your eyes
Suddenly love comes alive
For one last cry, for one last cry

Then, sometimes you got to crawl
Before you start to walk

I've had my rainy days
You try to keep up a smile
You go the extra mile
You run the race no matter where your place
You know which way to go so turn the page

It's hard to be strong
No right seems wrong
And nobody hears what you say

Ooohhhhhhhh
In the heart
Of the night
Where is dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Ohhhh Ohhhhh

I looked down
And my shirts turning red
I’m spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice in my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight
(All)
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can’t stop the bleeding
Ohhhh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can’t believe it
Ohhhh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)
(Howie)
Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Ohhhh ohhhh

Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can’t, I just can’t
Ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight

I can’t stop the bleeding

Stand up face to face the stakes

Girl you struck me like the sun
So just tell me how you wanna be done
I know you a couple of weeks
You seem like you don't play stupid tricks
Sweetie you are so beautiful
I can imagine you must feel wonderful
I like to know what I need to do
How to behave, oh how to please you
I can?t take it, oh come on
Let me feel those hips
You can tell me what you wanna do
If you want me to bring the freak outta you
So let me put my ego on the side
(Whatever you wish)
I ain?t got no pride
Girl I'll became your biggest fan
I could be your perfect man
You can tell me what you want
You can tell me what you need
I will do whatever you want
Just don?t ever make my heart bleed
Girl don?t you understand
That your wish is my command
So baby drop the match
Show me what?s the task
And tell me everything you want
You already told me what was in the past
All the relationships that never last
No man ever let you be free
And oh you are fed up with the jealousy
I`ll give you all the freedom that you need
Baby you and I will succeed
I like to know what I need to do
How to behave, oh how to please you
I can?t take it, oh come on
Let me kiss those lips
You can tell me what you wanna do

Always, forever

Those simple lies that she fed
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me
No

Cuz that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said

Yeah
And there are people who
Say what they really mean
She said she'd always be there
She said she'd always care
But just when you think that you can trust that
someone you love
Tell me
Well how do you know
How stars can fall from above

That's what she said
She told me we'd be together
That's what she said,she said ya
Cause you made promises
That you couldn't keep
But you're not hurting yourself
You're only hurting me
Why would you say things
That you really didn't mean
Oh how can I make you see
Just what you did to me
You said how much
You really cared
Just when I thought I was in love
Girl, how could you dare
If I were you I could not
Lie even once
To the face of the one
That I love so much

You see me sitting here, a smile upon my face.
The time has come but you know that it's not too late.
There's been to many things, together we have seen.
It's not that hard if we start to believe.
And we're not gonna take anymore.
Can we try to erase all the pain.
So please...
Show me a reason give me a sign.
Tell me the way we fall out of line.
Is it today or is it tonight.
We'll find the answer to our lives.
Oh yea

This world is not at ease, we seem to hide the truth.
Thinkin' there's only so much we can really do.
It's up to you and me, to face our destiny.

And we're not gonna take anymore.
Can we try to erase all the pain?

Tell me the way we fall out of line.
Is it today or is it tonight.
We'll find the answer to our lives.
So tell me why we have to cry,
when there's so many things we can do to help this trouble.
The world's not new.
I need a reason, I need a sign.
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side.
Is it today or maybe tonight,
We'll find
The answer to our lives.
Show me the way, give me a sign,
tell me the way we fall out of line.
Is it today, is it tonight.
The answer to our lives.
Show me a reason, give me sign,

holdin' you close in my dreams,
thinkin' about all the things that we said
and comin' apart at the seams.
we try to talk it over but the words come out too
rough.
I know you were tryin' to give me the best of your
love.
beautiful faces and loud empty places,
look at the way that we live.
wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine
left us so little to give.
that same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
that we could never rise above
but here in my heart I give you the best of my love.
o-o-o-oh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love
you get the best of my love
o-o-o-oh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love
you get the best of my love
I'm goin' back in time and it's a sweet dream,
it was a quiet night and I would be alright
if I could go on sleeping.
but every mornin' I wake up and worry
what's gonna happen today.
you see it your way and I see it mine
but we both see it slippin' away.
you know we always had each other, baby,
I guess that wasn't enough.
oh, but here in my heart I give you the best of my

Don't stay up and wait for me, ok?
Where are you?
Wait, wait ! say that again?
Hello?
You're really dropping out
I think my battery must be low.
Listen, if you can hear me
We're going to this
Place nearby alright, gotta go!"
Let me tell you the story
About the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
Just to end up in misery
I was about to go home
When there she was standing in front of me
I said hi.
I got a little place nearby, wanna go?
I should've said no,
Someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said...
Listen baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late,
Don't stay up and wait for me
I"ll say again,
You're dropping out,
My battery is low
Just so you know,
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back,
What's done is done
One of her friends found out that
She wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied.
Listen baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late,
Don't stay up and wait for me
I"ll say again,
You're dropping out,
My battery is low
Just so you know,

'bout the call that changed my destiny

And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you

            <field name="lyrics">There's Us
There's me looking down at my shoes
The one smiling like the sun that's you
What were you thinking?
What was the song inside your head?
There's us going on about a band
Working out how we'd play our hands
I lay there dreaming later on alone in my bed
If I was stupid maybe careless so were you
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us
Freeze frame I'm not about to cry
Its to late for us to change why try
I've got a camera tucked away inside my heart
If I'm a loser or just unlucky so are you
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us
Somewhere between then and now
I looked away when you said we'll never change
And if you think we might have been
You'll lose today and we've got songs to play
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us
There's us
There's us</field>

I don't blame you for being scared (for being scared, no)
Bout a novel long, all the pain that he's caused you
Baby I'm fully aware (I'm fully aware)
If I could change the stories ending to me and you
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do
Chorus
I could be the one
Give you all my love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
Please believe in me
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby
I know everything isn't meant to last
Box up all those photographs
You're moving on (yeah)
I could flip back over that hour glass
And refill the better half (the better half)
And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend
Won't you dry up all those tear drops and start again
Chorus
If I could show you there's no risk of being left
alone
Would you let your past go
I'll take it slow
Cause there's no need to rush when I know

Change can be so good
So let’s not forget why it’s understood that…
CHORUS
Time
Look where we are
And what we’ve been through
Time
Sharin' our dreams
Time, it goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is come what may
I remember when mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you’ll soon be on your way
Remember those days, that we would sing at
The drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered
Oh, I know we’ve changed but,
Change can be so good
Oh, so let’s not forget why it’s understood that…
CHORUS - repeat
So here we are
And we’ll always stay together
And through it all you know
We owe it all to you, you, you and you
(Time goes on, never stops, it keeps on)
CHORUS - repeat 2X
Time, it goes on and on everyday
Time is what it is, come what may, come what may........</field>

The first night that we met
I will never forget
Baby you were a star
Oh, from that point in time
It was always you and I
Shining so beautiful
Later out with your friends
You treat me like I'm dead
It was like I'm invisible
Nick:
(I can't let it go)
That was unforgivable
(I can't let it go)
I just wanna let you know
(I can't let it go)
Situations unliveable
(I can't let it go)
I can't let it go
(I can't let it go)
All:
So tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl
Is push on my buttons
You always bring me down
In public
When nobody's around
You say that you love me
Make me say oh, no
I see you all alone
I'm half way out the door
Unless you turn around
And treat me right
Brian:
Oh, you got me twisted
Oh, you got me twisted
I'm not someone you can just disrespect, oh
How would you feel if you were in my shoes?
Feelin' used, with a heart bruised
Nick:
(I can't let it go)
The situations critical
(I can't let it go)
Relationship is pitiful
(I can't let it go)
Everything's falling apart
(I can't let it go)
Cause you're so hypocritical
All:
So tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl
Is push on my buttons
You always bring me down
In public
When nobody's around
You say that you love me
Make me say oh, no
I see you all alone
I'm half way out the door
Unless you turn around
And treat me right
All:
y-y-you just no good for me
you're no good for me
you're just no good for me
I know you're no good for me
Howie:
You know
It's wrong to treat me cold
Have no one to hold
One day I'm gonna say goodbye
What's it gonna be
This girl I'm gonna leave
Unless you turn around
And treat me right
All:
So tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl

You always bring me down

You say that you love me
Make me say oh, no

I see you all alone
I'm half way out the door

You never know what you got
Until it's gone?
Too bad
Cause I never felt so good with anyone
How fooled was I
Into thinking I was gonna be alright?
Okay, fine
So every day I try a little harder
To forget her
Lie here, convince myself
Tomorrow will be better
The trouble is
I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone?
The trouble is
There's a part of me
That still can't let go
Of her memory
And now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is
Love is what the trouble is
How come she said
You never wear your heart
Where I can see?
Too bad
Cause now I'm the one who's sorry, yeah
How stupid was I
Into thinking I was gonna be alright?
Okay, fine
So everyday I find a little something
To remind me
No matter how I try
I can't put the past behind me
The trouble is
I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone?
The trouble is
There's a part of me
That still can't let go
Of her memory
And now I know what it is
Love has let me lonely
I'm alright, I'm okay
I'll be fine, give it time
But the only trouble is
I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone?
(Now she's gone)
The trouble is
There's a part of me
That still can't let go
Of her memory
(I just can't)
And now I know what it is
Yes, I know
And now I know what it is
Cause love is what the trouble is
The trouble
Love, love is what the trouble is

First glance and damn she stole my heart
She amazed me
The way she moves, just the way she moves
Hold me back, just the way she moves
Take me to the disco, make me dance
Oh hunny spinnin' round like a queen
And the way you do your thing
You're mesmerizing me
I'm gonna tell you how I feel
And the feeling is so real
Baby it's just so simple
You got to call me (and I'm gon' call you back)
Kiss me (and I'm gon' kiss you back)
Love me (baby I'm gon' love you back)
You've got to trust me, trust me
Hold me (whenever you're alone)
Baby (even when you're crazy)
Love me (baby I'm gon' love you back)
You've got to trust me
Oh love, you and me
Underneath the willow tree
Kissin' lovin' makin' sweet sexy babies
Grass is greener on the other side
There's no other side when it's you and I tonight
Let's count the stars
I know time will always be, our enemy
For tonight baby, come lie here next to me
I could never get enough of your blue eyes
Just another butterfly sign (?)
You got to call me (and I'm gon' call you back)
Kiss me (and I'm gon' kiss you back)
Love me (baby I'm gon' love you back)
You've got to trust me, trust me
Hold me (whenever you're alone)
Baby (even when you're crazy)
Love me (baby I'm gon' love you back)
You've got to trust me

How it feel with something so right
Don't you think it's time to let your guard down
Don't you think it's time
Don't you think it's time
You got to call me (and I'm gon' call you back)
Kiss me (and I'm gon' kiss you back)
Love me (baby I'm gon' love you back)

I know you want to, but don't give up
Try baby try
Give me a moment of your time
No, no don't, don't close your eyes
I know you're hurting now
We can work it out
If we just try, if we just try
It's always been
Just me and you
You know, I've been down there too
Always when I needed you, you were strong
Let me hold you baby, when hope is gone
Try baby try
Give me a moment of your time
No, no don't, don't, don't close your eyes
I know you're hurting now

Holding on, holding on
We used to know how to
When the nights are so long
Sing your favorite song

What we have, I'm breaking down
No reason, no warning, no love loss
You might as well
Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know
I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone
I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone
This constant echoing
In my head,
I'm spinning round
You seem so unaffected
While I go on in this hell
Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside

And now I got a life without ya

That we can be undone
We can be undone
You're talking now
and I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
it's dragging me to my grave
You're talking now
and I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave

I didn't wanna love without ya

I can't feel without you, You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me
That we could be undone
I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love with ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me

I can't feel without you, You know I can't deal without you

People say we're watching life through a glass
Desparately waiting on a chance

holding out for me

How do I know how this will end?

Before we begin

Took the stage, then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered, but I don't care
And the people walking by don't have a clue
That I kissed your face
Till the sun was in our eyes
Till the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow?
Oh yeah
After Saturday, my life is changed
In a moment, it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is, letting go
And I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
OOoh, ahhh, ooooh
This sweet relief, unexpected things
This is the end, or only the beginning
I miss your face, like the sun was in my eyes
(Like the afternoon)
Now I'm running blind
(running blind)
I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks,
the kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love that's made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

Your love
It's a weird world
Yeah
Sent a message to a G.I.
In the desert
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn
Back here it's her and me
And we're having our first baby
He's out there taking them on
It's a weird world
And I know you know it
It's a weird world

Never give up and don't let it wear out
Your love
I'm closing my eyes, but I'm starting to see
While he's looking at you, she's looking at me
The only thing it does is just keep me away from you
Sure part of this place would cheer if I die
But don’t let ‘em take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Hey hey hey
Sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Sweet baby
There's a way
For you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out
Your love

Every day i miss you more and i wanna know
Why did you have to go what were you looking for
And i hope you find your way, but i can't wait to say
You're home now, not alone now
These arms are here to hold you
Don't need to be afraid
So come in cuz i've been waiting for the moment
To open up this door and i know that it's not much
Welcome to my heart (5x)
So you lost your way but that's yesterday
And i don't care where you've been
Cuz every step you're taking since you left
Has brought you back again
And i hope you see it clear
My love has always been right here
You're home now, not alone now
These arms are here to hold you
Don't need to be afraid
So come in cuz ive been waiting for the moment

That sets you apart
Baby that's why you captured my heart
I know sometimes you feel
Like you don't fit in
And this world doesn't know
What you have within
When I look at you
I see something rare
A rose that can grow anywhere
And there's no one I know that can compare
CHORUS:
What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
(you're all I need oh girl)
What makes you different makes you beautiful to me
You got something so real
You touched me so deep
See, material things don't matter to me
So come as you are, you got nothing to prove
You won me with all that you do
And I wanna take this chance to say to you
What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
(you're all I need oh girl)
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful...
You don't know how you touched my life
Oh in so many ways I just can't describe
You taught me what love is supposed to be
You saw the little things that make you beautiful to me
So beautiful...
What makes you...
Repeat chorus
Everything in you is beautiful
Love you give shines right to me
Everything in you is beautiful
Beautiful to me
To me........</field>

Britney Spears: Barricades, can't block our way
J-Lo: Don't punish me with brutality
Destiny's Child: Talk to me

Destiny's Child/Britney Spears: (First Chorus)
Oh what's going on
What's going on
Yeah what's going on
Ahh what's going on
Ja Rule: What's going on in a world filled with pain
Where's the love for which we pray
What's going on
When our children can't play
Homeless can't eat
There's got to be a better way
What's going on
When we politically blind
Can't see the signs of endangered times
What's going on
Nelly Furtado: What's goin' on in the world today.
I'd rather be dead than to turn my head away
We got this first world vision too
Comfy to lift up our hands in the air
And cry for a switch
Michael Stipe: Father, father

Hey, what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's goin' on-uh
Nelly: What's going on 'cross seas
Every minute a child dies by this disease
In record numbers indeed
Got momma's crying out please
My baby hold on
My child ain't done nothing wrong
Still I want to holler
Ask them why they don't bother
Oh no, oh no
Make me turn to my father
And ask him why they all got a trapped soul
Nas: I can feel what was bothering Marvin
Why his words forever remain
Dealing with these modern day problems
'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents
Too many infected
Too many lives diminishing
Nobody say Protestants, Jews, Blacks, and Whites, Latinos and Asians
Pray together
Less fight
We better unite
As genocide chemical war
And the rich and the poor
Know that God delivers a cure
Eve: It's a shame our reality is devastating
People praying for a cure
Dying while they're waiting
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it
All the kids with dreams
Won't get the chance to chase it
Makes me sad
Think about the lives they would've had
Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads
How can we sit back and not try to make it right
We gotta come together
We gotta fight for life
Fred Durst: Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
We got human beings using humans for a bomb
But everyone wanna live
Don't nobody really want to die
You feeling me right
I can't be watching people die
(die) And watching people cry
Let me break it down for a minute
If there's enough room here for you and me
There's plenty of room for some humanity
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me
hat's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on

Somebody tell me what's going on

Somebody tell me what's going on

And I can't think of starting over
We used to share the stars above
I don't wanna think it’s changed
But now I gotta move on
I´ve gotta catch up to the world
Even though I gave you my life
As wrong as it seems I know its right
But is there a place that I can go away
To escape the love that I will forever know?
CHORUS
Where can we go from here?
All I know is that I love you still
Sometimes we do things against our will
I know I cry lonely tears
Where can we go from here?
Why, why do I cry inside?
For a love is gone away
And how, how can I carry on?
When I know all the love is gone
Tell me where can I go to get away?
From the pain of loving you?
Tell me where
CHORUS
Where can we go from here?
All I know is that I love you still
Sometimes we do things against our will

Like they followed you around the light
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run

Trying to make believe that nothin's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go
Sifting through the shattered dreams
Living in the in between
Baby, baby it's going to be all right
All right

And when you're lost, let down,
disappointed, jerked around
In this cold, cold world
I will always be by your side

Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are..

You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby, let me hold you tight

Chapter one was how true love is made
You taught me with your kiss
Things about romance I'd missed
You knew everything from A to Z
What pleases you and what pleases me
Girl when you touch me
I began to understand (Ohhh)
You, you wrote the book on love
I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Oh you, you wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of your love
Oh I know you wrote the book on love
(Oh Brian help me sing)
Each time I hold you
I find something new
'Cause I know what I love about you baby
Girl I discovered
You bring out the lover in me (yeah, yeah)
You're like a fire that burns in my soul
Like a volcano that's ready to blow
'Cause everytime I look at you I feel
Love I can't explain (ohhh)
You, you wrote the book on love
I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Oh you, you wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of your love
Oh I know you wrote the book on love
I hear what your heart is saying to me
I see the picture so clearly
I'm thirsty for the knowledge true love brings
Oh when you're near me
You wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of you
Oh you wrote the book
Oh you, you wrote the book on love
And I wanna read every word

did you walk across the line?
did you shake it off your mind?
did you ever think that i would be the one to bring you back?
did you cover up the sound of a million golden days?
when the sun comes up we'll all be here together, it's ok

As the sun leaves and leaps through my hands, I think

Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Let this last forever
Let this last forever!
Fall back to the ground
Spellbound by the sound
Surrender me now!
No need to be scared
True love's gonna get us there
And start to whirl around us!

You're my favorite movie
A thousand endings
You mean everything to me
I never know what's comin'
Forever fascinated
Hope you don't stop runnin' to me
'Cause I'll always be waitin'
You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
Action, thriller
I could watch you forever
You are my cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema...
Get up, get down
Three steps down
My DJ gonna break it down
Get up, get down
Three steps down
My DJ gonna break it down
Get up, get down
Three steps down
My DJ gonna break it down
Get up, get down
Lose that sound
Drop the bass
Stars spell out your name
Like in a science fiction drama
Romance growing
Like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessin'
Forever my wonderful
Hope you start undressin'
All my dreams and take me under
You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
Action, thriller
I could watch you forever
You are my cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema...
Get up, get down
Three steps down

Get up, get down
Three steps down

I need your love
I want you there
I long for you and no more loneliness
Inside my dreams
you're like a drum
your sound is good
like the beat of my heart
so take a ride
and fly me to a star
run to me run to me, baby
yes I know that you need me now
run to me run to me
I don't know how
run to me run to me, baby
'cause I know that you want me now
run to me run to me
somehow
On the sea or on the air
everything will take you there
I don't know why
I need your love to share
So take a boat or take a plane
don't leave me here don't let me go insane
I'm only asking to see your face again
run to me run to me, baby
yes I know that you need me now
run to me run to me
I don't know how
run to me run to me, baby
'cause I know that you want me now
run to me run to me
somehow
You're my lover
my one and only dream
I run for cover
don't leave me waiting here
You're my pleasure and you're my pain
You're givin' me emotions
You turn me round inside
and light my flame
you know that I'm your lady</field>

Hoping to find a miracle in the meltdown
All the loving chaos that I'm surround
I dance dance to take me off the ground ground.
I've been closing my eyes so I can see you
Trying to make every other lover be you
I know all of my fantasies won't come true
I dance dance and pray that some of them do.
(Chorus)
Hey-yeah, lift my emotion
Tonight, my heart is open
Let go, there's no confusion
Control is an illusion.
Control is an illusion.
Woo-ooo-oo-oo.
Control is an illusion.
I can't own ya love,
I can't own your love,
I gotta let it go in the night sky
When I look above
When I look above
I see it shining; I'll feel so aliiiiive.
Ready to let love back into my soul.
In the beauty, in the music, it's time to lose control of control.
(Chorus 2x)
Control, control.
Control, control.</field>

But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records, they sell
'Cause a brother like me said, "Well...
...Frarrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
what he can say to you, what you ought to do."
Follow for now, power of the people, say,
"Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical"
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again
Chorus: Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
'Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are blasting
me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters
now across the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
Till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this
Chorus: Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run-DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B
and LL, as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it
Chorus...
From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
"Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boost toast
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last
Why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the Fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling you...</field>

Looking around for a human trace
Along the edge of this satellite
Losing the route in this empty sky
A prey of the ghosts of this galaxy
Losing myself in this ecstasy
No clock is turning to sign the time
Everything’s flowing through day and night
No noise is breaking my silent star
I’m on the run I can go so far
Flying in absence of gravity
Feeling the vibe of eternity
This is the lesson I had to learn
This is the treasure I had to earn
I am the owner of nowhere land
Queen of the castle that’s made of sand
Staring in front of the universe
Maybe someday I’ll be someone else
I’m sure I’ll do it, but till’ that day
Here on my star I am just a castaway
I’m wandering alone in an open space
Looking around for a human trace
Along the edge of this satellite
Losing the route in this empty sky
A prey of the ghosts of the galaxy
Losing myself in this ecstasy
No clock is turning to sign the time
Everything’s flowing through day and night
No noise is breaking my silent star
I’m on the run I can go so far
Flying in absence of gravity

Close to me

You make me
So naked
My heart pumps
Anticipating
I fall from

If you don't come right now

You are a motion that makes me high.
You are a dream that burns inside.
A magic potion, that's my soul.

Hoping to find a miracle in the meltdown
All the loving chaos that I'm surround
I dance dance to take me off the ground ground.
I've been closing my eyes so I can see you
Trying to make every other lover be you
I know all of my fantasies won't come true
I dance dance and pray that some of them do.
(Chorus)
Hey-yeah, lift my emotion
Tonight, my heart is open
Let go, there's no confusion
Control is an illusion.
Control is an illusion.
Woo-ooo-oo-oo.
Control is an illusion.
I can't own ya love,
I can't own your love,
I gotta let it go in the night sky
When I look above
When I look above
I see it shining; I'll feel so aliiiiive.
Ready to let love back into my soul.
In the beauty, in the music, it's time to lose control of control.

Control, control.

From my face
Wash the pain away
We're all speeding
Lost in this race
And my heart's in a hearse
Can we put it in reverse, babe
Cause I can't even feel the drum and bass
It's drowned out by the beat my heart makes
I hear that song but something is wrong
My mind's a million miles away
Ohh, everybody's going to the floor
Maybe I don't want to dance anymore
Don't want to dance anymore
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain away
Touch that dial
I'm changing the station
Cause I can't smile
Like everyone else
Play my sad song
In heavy rotation
I won't go out
I'm trying to save myself
I can't even feel the drum and bass
It's drowned out by the beat my heart makes
I hear that song but something is wrong
My mind's a million miles away
Ohh, everybody's going to the floor
Maybe I don't want to dance anymore
Don't want to dance anymore

How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain away
I can't dance tonight
Oh everybody's movin but I'm tired
I can't dance tonight
I try to keep it movin but I but I but I

No more fear
No no more fear of loneliness
Do you feel
When you feel
When you feel
When you feel
When you feel alive
Do you feel alive
When you feel alive
Do you feel alive
When you feel alive
Do you feel alive
When you feel alive
Do you feel alive
I am burning, with this love
I am burning, is it love
I am burning, with this love
I am burning, is it love</field>

You are the one to blame
My love is not your toy
You better be careful boy..
You told a million lies to me
One day you said goodbye baby
I gave you one more chance
So please tell me baby..
Are you gonna hit my heart?
Are you gonna leave me once again?
Baby, don't you hit my heart..
Are you gonna break my heart?
Are you gonna make me cry again?
Baby, don't you break my heart..
I'm not that kind of girl
I know what i deserve
My trust in you was wrong, darling
I won't do it anymore
You swear that you still care for me
You tell to come back again, honey
But you is always the same
Won't you tell me baby
Are you gonna hit my heart?
Are you gonna leave me once again?
Baby, don't you hit my heart..
Are you gonna break my heart?
Are you gonna make me cry again?

EVERYTHING WE DO IS TRY

THROUGH THE DARKNESS OF THE TOWN
LOOKING FOR A LOVER
I'M PRAYING YOU TO STAY,
TO KEEP THE PROMISE YOU MADE
CAN'T YOU SEE IT BABY?
IT'S A PART OF THE GAME.
AND EVERYTIME THAT YOU SAY NO
YOU GOT ME GOING CRAZY,
I'M GOING OUT MY MIND
I'LL DO WHAT YOU WANT ME TO
I'M A VICTIM BABY.
JUST PUSH ME THROUGH
I WANNA BE YOUR ILLUSION
BE YOUR ILLUSION
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY TONIGHT
ENJOY THIS TRIP WITH ME
I WANNA BE YOUR EMOTION
BE YOUR EMOTION,
WHY DON'T YOU TURN OFF THE LIGHTS?

When the wind is in your hair

For a second I don't care
I just stare
As the sun leaves and leaps through my hands, I think
Let this last forever
Let this last forever!
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Let this last forever
Let this last forever!
Fall back to the ground
Spellbound by the sound
Surrender me now!
No need to be scared
True love's gonna get us there
And start to whirl around us!
As the sun leaves and leaps through my hands, I think
Let this last forever
Let this last forever!
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Let this last forever

Love is all you love as well
Like a precious flower
I'm a spirit floating bound
In the universe
Light, shining in your eyes
Everyday, wash away the pain
Light, coming from my mind
We are one, the night has just begun
People walking through my world
I can see our (breathing)
They are phrases, they are words
Of a simple verse
Put your gunsmen on the ground
Don't you hurt each other
Let your spirit hear the sound
In the universe
Light, shining in your eyes
Everyday, wash away the pain
Light, coming from my mind
We are one, the night has just begun
Light, shining in your eyes
Everyday, to wash away the pain
Light, coming from my mind
We are one, life has just begun
Life has just begun, we are one
Life has just begun
Oh yeah, ohohno...
Come on baby
Light, shining in your eyes
Everyday wash away the pain
Light, coming from my mind
We are one, the night has just begun
Light is just a constant
Light is just a color
Light, it is you
Because life is just a constant
Light is the all color
Light, is you</field>

Put you in a trance!

Dance till you saw

Made us party all night
And raised hell until today

No milk today, it seems a common sight
But people passing by don't know the reason why
How could they know just what this message means
The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams
How could they know the palace there had been
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
No milk today, my love has gone away
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn
No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we'd turn night into day
But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
Just two up two down</field>

Where I wanna be, standing at the edge of the world.
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!
So come on, dance!
You ride it, it’s a party,
So come on, dance!
After midnight, we’re excited!
So, come on
Get your drinks on, spend your money,
Put your hands all over somebody!
..the highest point, don’t you,
Ever come on down
You are everybody wants to be,
They all wanna go!

You’re the last vibing stone, on

Everyone here feel what you gave to lose?

Hey boy
When we first met
On the 31st
And it was Halloween
You know what I mean
And I was the one dressed up
as a rocket
that night
Please, please
Don’t ask me why
Hey boy, Hey boy
If you came over me
And said: Tell me
if you’re alone tonight
can I be by your side?”
Hey baby, ain’t we having fun Tonight
Little rocket in the sky
Little rocket in the sky
Tell me
Was a rocket in the sky
I’m a rocket in the sky
Baby baby
Ain’t we having fun tonight
I’ll be by yourside
I’ll be by yourside
Baby baby
I’ve been there all
Year long
Standing by the telephone
The telephone
Hey baby
If you care for me
Why don’t you call
And give me some dignity
Some decency
Rocket in disguise
Rocket in disguise
Don’t ask me why
Don’t ask me why
I’m a rocket in disguise
Don’t ask me why
I’m a rocket in disguise
Don’t ask me why
Tell me
I’m a rocket in disguise

run to me run to me, baby
yes I know that you need me now
run to me run to me
I don't know how
run to me run to me, baby
'cause I know that you want me now
run to me run to me
somehow
On the sea or on the air
everything will take you there
I don't know why
I need your love to share
So take a boat or take a plane
don't leave me here don't let me go insane
I'm only asking to see your face again
run to me run to me, baby
yes I know that you need me now
run to me run to me
I don't know how
run to me run to me, baby
'cause I know that you want me now
run to me run to me

You're my lover
my one and only dream
I run for cover
don't leave me waiting here
You're my pleasure and you're my pain
You're givin' me emotions
You turn me round inside
and light my flame
you know that I'm your lady</field>

Oh I know it's gone
You drive me insane

You drive me insane
You twist me
Then you crushed me
With your fake smiles

Tonight hotties wearing "Prada"-skirts
Real tight temperature is rising
Feelin' real hot in the heat of the night
Midnight the party won't stop
until the morning light
I'm skopin' out the hotties with the light eyes
Be with me tonight
Can't get you outta my mind
I can't lie
Cause a girl like you is so hard to find
I'm waiting for the day to make you mine
Cause I can't take it

Moonlight cruisin' down the boulevard
Strobe lights watching you your body's tight
Alright looking kinda freaky to me
Can't get you out of my mind

            <field name="lyrics">Saving a life, it makes a difference
The price of hope is worth the cost
Taking a chance
I'm willing to risk it all
Cause the soul is everlasting
While the mortals left behind
No one ever really dies
Strip my layers off
My memory unfolds
Back where it began
This is who I am
A flicker of light off in the distance
Guide me home when I'm lost
I'm in your hands
We'll find our way through the fog
All the gold that we've been chasing
How it weighs us down inside
And it goes so we can't climb
Strip my layers off
My memory unfolds
Back where it began
This is who I am</field>

A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from the devil's cup
Slowly it's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise

Don't you know that you're toxic?
Intoxicate me now
With your loving now
I think I'm ready now

But if you really want me, move it slow
There're things about me you just have to know
Sometimes I run Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
baby all I need is time
I don't wanna be so shy, uh-uh
Everytime I am alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that, you're the only one for me

All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world
Always saying, "little girl don't step into the club"
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why cause dancing's what I love
(Now watch me)
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it (Do you like it)
Get it get it, get it get it (This feels good)
I know I may come off quiet, may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What's practical is logical, what the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there
I'm a slave for you
I cannot hold it
I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you
I won't deny it
I'm not trying to hide it
Baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me (I just wanna dance next to you)

Oh Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me (Are you ready?)

Where you from, how's it going?
I know you
Gotta clue, what you're doing?
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you
Gettin' more than just re-up
Baby, you
Got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer
Oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, You, You are; You, you, you are
Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer (Womanizer)
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just what you a-a-are
You got me going
You're also charming
But I can't do it
You womanizer
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just what you a-a-are
You say I'm Crazy
I got you crazy
You're nothin but a womanizer
Daddy-O
You got the swagger of champions
Too bad for you
Just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard
It could be easy, who you are, that's just who you are baby
Lollipop
Must mistake me as a sucker
To think that I
Would be a victim not another
Say it, play it how you wanna
But no way I'm ever gonna fall for you, never you, baby
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer
Oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, You, You are; You, you, you are
Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer (Womanizer)
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just what you a-a-are

You're also charming
But I can't do it
You womanizer
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just what you a-a-are
You say I'm Crazy
I got you crazy
You're nothin but a womanizer
Maybe if we both lived in a different world
It would be all good, and maybe I could be ya girl
But I can't 'cause we don't
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer
Oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, You, You are; You, you, you are

            <field name="lyrics">This is a story about a girl
named Lucky...
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on her door
It's time for makeup,
Perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go...
"Isn't she lovely,
this Hollywood girl?"
And they say...
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her
lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?
Lost in an image,
in a dream
But there's no one there to
wake her up
And the world is spinning,
and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when
it stops?
They go...
"Isn't she lovely, this
Hollywood girl?"
And they say...
Chorus
"Best actress, and the
winner is...Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop
News standing outside the
arena waiting for Lucky!"
"Oh, my God...here she comes!"
Isn't she lovely, this
Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does
she cry?
If there's nothing missing in
her life
Why do tears come at night?

But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find her way

That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy
Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby
I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused your pain
And this song is my sorry
At night I pray
That soon your face
Will fade away
Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings

End up settling in court

But they can never take away your truth
But the question is
Can you handle mine?
They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Getting boys is how I live
Some ask me questions
Why am I so real?
But they don't understand me
I really don't know the deal about my sister
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago before I won this fight
Chorus:
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (tell me why)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (oh)
That's my prerogative
It's my prerogative (it's my prerogative)
It's the way that I wanna live (it's my prerogative)
They can't tell me what to do
Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong spreadin' myself around

Why can't I live my life
Without all of the things

I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it
'Cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game
Just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah)
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No rules
From the bar to the car
Let's take it back to my room
Igniting the heat of the moment
Let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we're burning bright
When we cut the light
Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah)
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Yeah, Eazy)
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or little bars
Really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are; need you
I've always wondered what was off limits
Staring at you til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this was all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we could tell that there's changes coming
See I could tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
Like Penelope in "Blow"
Well worth the stealing you, it's a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you
And make me ooh (move) , ooh, ooh (yeah) , ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, you make me ooh</field>

(Ay oh) let me do my thing with a New York verse
AC will make you hot, girl remove your shirt
I got my eyes closed you could do your dirt
And by the way, do you still got that school girl skirt?
Like the cops imma watch her watch me
Shot with a chaser like the paparazzi
Its crazy she still on top a the biz
I'm with Brit, while KFed watchin' the kids
Britney (verse 1):
He was kinda like a summer fling
Hot and heavy through that April rain
May and June he was after me
By July, it was getting hypnotic
So he kinda started feelin my fame
I don't really wanna say his name
All I know is I liked his drank
All my girls say mmm if you feel me
I saw you there, I cant get you out my sight boy
Better go and get another drank, cuz you aint getting none of mine, no
Chorus:
Ohh, tell me whatcha sippin on
Baby, baby, baby
Ohh, tell me whatcha sippin on
Baby, baby, baby
Britney (verse 2):
What I feel is more than a crush
Then again, its not quite love
Just enough to fill my cup
Whatever you do, just keep it flowin'
So tell me how you like it babe
On the rocks, or straight up babe
Oh boy don't be afraid, I'm right here and I'm gonna show ya
I saw you there, I can't get you outta my mind, boy
Better go and get another drink
All my girls say
Chorus:
Ohh, ohh, tell me whatcha sippin' on
Baby, baby, baby
Ohh, tell me whatcha sippin' on
Baby, baby, baby
I can't ignore it boy I feel like I'm yours
The way you look at me I just can't say no
So we should hook up, who knows where we will go
Cause baby when I'm with you, I feel I'm losing control
Oh boy you hit the spot
See baby, please don't stop
Do you like my lemon drop (just taste it baby)
You make me feel so hot
Summertime love is all we got
Here we are, lets take a shot
(this is AC baby)
AC:
All the tabloids tell me how you was a handful
Toxic, try to make you an example
You know me, I'm just tryin' to have you shoot for the airport(?)
Cause all this stress got me losing my hair too
Lets release, get live on the track
Got my baby in the whip, she could ride on my lap
Put that one finger up mommy, guzzle some more
Tell them the only issues you got is the covers your on, uh
One more drink, make us some a the bomb
Order shot, bartender gave one in the arm
All you rappers better recognize the best
Cuz AC about to blow like a breathalyzer test
Chorus:
Ohh, ohh, tell me whatcha sippin on
Ohh, tell me whatcha sippin on
Baby, baby, baby
So clap
Baby that's so clap
So clap (so clap common)
Are you ready for that's so clap
So clap, are you ready for that's so clap
So clap, are you ready for that's so clap
So clap, are you ready for that so clap</field>

Do you taste it
Do you feel what I feel
I feel it coming and it’s oh so near
You got me breathing like an animal
I won’t be satisfied until you’re here (9-1-1)
Every little time you touch my thighs I wanna cry
Every little touch you take me deeper in my mind
Every little thing you do I swear I’m on a ride
You got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized (9-1-1)
9-1-1
I’ll call you when I’m feeling lonely
9-1-1
Baby boy come get right on me
9-1-1
Put this fire out, I’m burning
Up, up,up
9-1-1
Do you know just what you do to me?
What I need ya know it’s criminal
Close my eyes and you’re undressing me
One step further boy and we will be
9-1-1
Every little time you touch my thighs I wanna cry
Every little touch you take me deeper in my mind
Every little thing you do I swear I’m on a ride
You got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized (9-1-1)

Put this fire out, I’m burning
Up, up,up

Sexing in the attic
When ya felt so automatic
Felt explosive when ya had it
When ya ___ all over me
Boy I made it rain
Just when I squeezed and made it tight
Just so relax, just so don’t you fight
Just calm down, feel the freakin heat
9-1-1
9-1-1
Every little time you touch my thighs I wanna cry
Every little touch you take me deeper in my mind
Every little thing you do I swear I’m on a ride
You got me hypnotized

Please take off your glasses
Gotta get through customs, taxi, baggage
You know you still love me, Sicily to the U.K
Keep them hands up everywhere follow me
I'm about to take you abroad
Show up in your town
Second that I'm touchin down
Go someplace we've been
Every time I'm with my friends
Sexy men
Whisper foreign in my ear
She's so hot
You so naughty come on show me what you got
(what you got) looked in the mirror today
Thought I had so much to say
But now that I'm face to face
I feel like runnin away
(I need a)
Think I just I need a getaway
Time for a break a holiday
Time that I make my great escape
I need it now
I need it today
I need it today
Don't know where I'm goin but I know I'm outta here
Don't know where I'm goin but I know I'm outta here
Don't know where I'm goin but I know I'm outta here
I'm goin abroad..
I'm goin abroad..
I don't speak the language
But they know my name here
Frequent flier mileage
Platinum next year
Bonjour in France, keep my head wrapped up in Hermes
Tropical destination, get my rest and my relaxation abroad
Show up in your town
Second that I'm touchin down
Go someplace we've been
Every time I'm with my friends

Today
I need a change of pace
To see some different faces
I need to get away
I need a break from u (I need a break)
I need a break for me (I need a break)
Gimme a break from here
Somewhere that I can clear my head
(I need a break) I'm goin abroad, I'm goin abroad

Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
(I'm never alone)
Not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone
Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travel the night riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong
Ooh that was then like an alien
But the stars in the sky look like home
Take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know
I'm not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
(I'm never alone)
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Like an alien
But the stars in the sky look like home
Take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know
I'm not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone (I'm never alone)
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone</field>

Needed a fight as an excuse
To get away from me, you've missed use
Sit there make me look guilty
You were leaving, anyway but with me
You have a career, I can tell
I trained you man, oh so well
No more boosting your ego
Your mom's smokin up my
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
No more chains that you gave me
Enough of pain, now I'm craving
Something sweet, so delight
How do you stand sleeping at night?
Silly patterns that I followed
You're so I'm being swallowed
By the one who she loved
They pull you down, you can't see up above
Manipulation was his key
You screw it in 'cause she was naive
We're not perfect we must say
That now we've gotta run away
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy

I saw him standin' there
In the parkin' lot
He asked if I
Came here a lot
And this is how
I responded
I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me
He don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend
Was the one that had bought me this rock
I get amnesia
When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou
He's been with me for several years
I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over
'Til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't
Forget about me
I talk to my girls
I can talk to my girls like crazy
To anyone, I speak my mind
I tell 'em off, it don't phase me
I'm not lazy
But boy, lately
When I see you, I stu-utter
Words just slip away like butterflies
I saw you standin' there
In the VIP on Friday
We conversate up in my
Fantasies like, every day
But I'm a dud
Whenever you approach
Like yesterday when you just
Came to say hello
I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me
He don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend
Was the one that had bought me this rock
I get amnesia
When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou
He's been with me for several years
I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over
'Til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't
Forget about me

Me
This is how I do
I talk to most guys
I can talk to most guys like crazy
To anyone, I'll speak my mind
I tell 'em off, it don't phase me
But you shake me
Boy, you make me
St-o-o-o-op and stutter
When we touch, I melt like butter
I saw you standin' there
In the VIP on Saturday
Now that I know you got a
Thing for me, I should be straight
Not the kinda girl who'll just let
Any guy get close
All I can say is I'mma tell my guy
He should just effin' go
I forgot my name
And forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me
He don't even know
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend
Was the one that had bought me this rock
I get amnesia
When I'm standin' next to you
He's been with me for several years
I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over
'Til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't
Forget about me
Me
Me
This is how I do

Lyin alone
Touching my skin
I'm falling under
A girl like me
And I can't hold it in
Makes me wonder
Is this for real
It's not what it seems
Like an angel
I'm runnin now
My feet up the cloud (Oh)
Refrão:
Take me touch me
Won't you hold me close
And then we kiss
And the love comes alive on my lips
I feel the rush
Comin over me over me
And when we touch
This moment where everything's still
I close my eyes
And then we kiss
Verso 2:
Feel of your hand
As it touches my hair
Makes me trumble
Don't ever let go
The feelings we share
So baby go slow
My heart is ticking fast
And my body cries (Yeah Yeah)
I'm wanted to last this burning inside
We're getting deeper
Refrão
You're drifting
The sun comes up
You're fading
You seem so far
I don't know if I'm awake
Open my eyes and then we kiss
Refrão
And then we kiss
And then we kiss
And when we touch
This moment where everything's still
I close my eyes

Don't leave me waiting longer
Why you wanna make me long for ya

our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
autumn goodbye
Thinkin' of you and the love of our lives
in the sweet summertime
so sad but true (so true, so true)
we must leave it behind
in our hearts, in our minds
From April through September
bittersweet was the love that we share
don't forget
I remember
Chorus (2 times)
Memories can fade
but my heart has a place for the smile on your face
and maybe someday
we can be more than friends
love will find us again
Red leaves and blue tomorrows
Time will give back the love that we shared
on the time that we borrowed
Chorus (2 times)
From April through September
bittersweet was the love that we share
don't forget
I remember baby
Chrous (2 times)
We'll leave behind the summertime
our hearts, our minds
they will remind
we won't forget
the day we met
the day we cried
Autumn Goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
but summer love will keep us warm long after

Oh, really?

Alright, well, I'll see you later, then
Oh, wait
Would you mind getting some...
Yeah, when you come home
Yeah, that's it

Bye
Some day when you see my face
You will think that you have won
And some day when it's all away

Never around to love me
You're always gone
Cause you're hangin out
Breakin' the rules
Oh the man has come
Looking for you
You're a rebel now
Don't give a damn
Always carrying on
With the gang
I'm trying to tell you boy
It's a mistake
You won't realize
Til it's too late
Don't understand
Why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies
Black cat
Nine lives
Short days
Long nights
Livin on the edge
Not afraid to die
Heart beat
Real strong
But not
For long
Better watch your step
Or you're gonna die
You're so together boy
But just at a glance
You'll do anything
If given a chance
Scheming, plannin lies
To get what you need
So full of promises
That you never keep
Don't you tell yourself
That it's okay
Sick and tired of
All of your games
And you want me to stay
Better change
Makes no sense to me
Your crazy ways
Black cat
Nine lives
Short days
Long nights
Livin on the edge
Not afraid to die
Heart beat
Real strong
But not
For long
Better watch your step

And I'll be done before you know,
I'm gonna come and take control
You won't breathe!
Oh, I'll eat you up alive,
Swallow all your pride!
I'm gonna crawl in your window
And no one is ever gonna know,
I'm gonna come and take control
That's the deal!
I'm a black widow!
I'm a black widow!
No, there's no time for rescuing,
Know you were just a fling, yeah.
Now that the dark, is settling,
You can go, you can go, you can,
You can go, you can go!
[Chorus:]
I'm gonna crawl in your window
And no one is ever gonna know,
I'm gonna come and take control
You can't leave!
I'm gonna start from down bellow
And I'll be done before you know,
I'm gonna come and take control
You won't breathe!
Oh, I'll eat you up alive,
Swallow all your pride!
I'm gonna crawl in your window
And no one is ever gonna know,
I'm gonna come and take control
That's the deal!
I'm a black widow!
I'm a black widow!</field>

Wanna poke my eyes out

Hey yeah yeah

Hey yeah yeah
Can't remember what I did last night
Maybe I shouldn't have given in
But I just couldn't fight
Hope I didn't but I think I might've
Everything, everything is still a blur
Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur (Did last

Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur
What's your name, man?
Can you calmly hand me all my things?
I think I need an aspirin
Better yet, I need to get up outta here
I gotta get my head right
Where the hell am I?
Who are you?

That you're the only one I belong to

Not to show the world that it was you
You made me realize
Not to compromise
The fact that you and I should be
I know we're gonna get
(know we're gonna get) (get)

Bombastic love
So fantastic
Where I'm completely yours and you are mine
And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie
When we fall in love for the first time
Dont know why I feel so insecure
I never understood what it's good for
I gotta make sure the madness
won't stop me again
I can't sit and wait anymore
You made me realize
Not to compromise
The fact that you and I should meet
I know we're gonna get

When I'm yours and you are mine
It's gonna be fantastic love
When I wake up everything is still the same
and you don't even know my name
...I know it's gonna be

Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
I'm sitting here alone up in my room
and thinking about the times
that we've been through
(oh my love)
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really wanna know what we did wrong
with a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
I know I've been a fool
since you've been gone
I rather give it up and then carry on
(oh my love)
Cause living in a dream of you and me
Is not the way my life should be
I don't wanna cry a tear for you
So forgive me if I do
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
Oh yeah ...
I'd do anything
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl
Just call out my name
(just call out my name)
And I will be there
(and I will be there)
Just to show you how much I care
Alright
I was born to make you happy
yeah, yeah...
Oh yeah, yeah
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
Oh no, no
I was born to make you happy

Ah, You know what I mean?
She wants a good time, no need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat
There's a brave new girl and she's coming out tonight
She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed, she don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?
Tonight, it's all right
A brave girl tonight
So she met this man, he was kinda rough
He said girl, whatcha lookin' for?
She said I don't know, I go with the flow
He said let's get on the floor
He said you look real cute with your lowride jeans
And your pink little baby tee
Let's get a room, girl
Come and ride with me
She wants a good time, no need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat

You got me hypnotized

Well lets give them what they've been waiting for baby
I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting
THIS LOW SONG IN CAUSE YOU AIN'T KNOW SO
But I'm here now
It's Britney
And I'm worth the wait
I can show up on the first day late
Anybody else on the Earth may hate
They can blow me like candles on a birthday cake
Go ahead and make a wish
Names like yours never make the list
Player like me gotta make the switch
L.A purple's licorice, so licorice
And I'm high like Cobey
And a spider ALLA Tobey
Mcguire, nope, I'M A LIAR party promo
I'm just flyer

That's just the case you ain't know so
We spoke twice, HIT BROKE ICE
It's not just a game, its Titanic
It goes down the same as Titanic
You and me, baby why panic?
Now, how cool am I?
Must've went to school at CUTEY High
CALVIN could've been a cooler guy
Cause I, I
Let me break the ice (the ice)
Allow me to get you right (yes)
Won't you warm up to me (thats the way I feel baby)
Baby I can make you feel (BREAK THE ICE)
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right (it's Britney Spears)
Won't you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Hot
Low so, in case you ain't know so
Got ice on the neck too
Can't break this though
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel</field>

And, boy, don't stop 'cause I'm half way there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each other's minds
One love united, two bodies synchronizing
Don't even need to touch me, baby just...
Breathe on me
Yeah oh baby, just
Breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just breathe
Oh, this is way beyond the physical
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination takin' us to places
We have never been before
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me, baby just
Breathe on me
Yeah oh baby, just
Breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe on me
Oh baby, just
Breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just breathe
Monogamy is the way to go
Just put your lips together
And blow
Breathe on me
Baby, just
Breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe on me
Oh baby, just
Breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just</field>

You are the light of my beautiful life
You know I wake up and everyday
I feel safe knowing that you got my back
Now and forever
Living my life coz I've got nothing to do
When the tear falls
You put your hands out, you catch my tears
And I'm feeling so close to your love now
If I was lost out now I can be found
I lift my hands and pray
Coz life's tough somedays
But I will not lose faith coz you will lead the way
You're my light when it gets dark
You will always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You will always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You are the light of my beautiful life
I can never let go
You're my brightest morning star
You are the light of my beautiful life
I can never let go
You're my brightest morning star
In you arms I feel alive, I'm not afraid
I will keep you listen closely
I look for signs everyday
I lift my hands and pray
Coz life's tough somedays
But I will not lose faith coz you will lead the way
You're my light when it gets dark
You will always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You will always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You will always in my heart

Don't pull me off, 'cause I'm on fire
And I can't quench my desire
Don't you know that I'm burning up for your love
You're not convinced that that it's enough
I put myself in this position
And I deserve the imposition
But you don't even know I'm alive
And this pounding in my heart just won't die
I'm burning up
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love
You're always closing your door
And that only makes me want you more
And day and night I cry for your love
But you're still not convinced that that it's enough
To justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
I'm not blind and I know
That you want to want me but you can't let go
(come on, let go)
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love (oh)
Do you wanna see me down on my knees
Or bending over backwards now
Oh, would you be pleased
Unlike the others I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
(come on, let go)
Do you wanna see me down on my knees
Or bending over backwards now
Oh, would you be pleased
Unlike the others I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame

But I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you
I have been through changes
Yeah
But I'm still the girl you used to know
It's made me no different
So tell me why you have to go
Oh baby I would trade the fancy cars, for a chance to date,
Its incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars, everybody say

Just the thought of being close to you
Its incomparable
I should be happy with the life I live
And the things I do, seems like I have it all

Can't make you love me

Come, be my desert in this
I put my spoon in your dip
Oooh!
We got one night only
Hope you brought some jolly ranchers for me
Then she told me;
I don't even know you
But here, I got a snicker for you, here!

What you do to me, I just can't believe
Oh, you're tempting me
You're so good to

You don't need to sugar coat it
I got it, and you know it
All of the pieces with it
Candy from strangers
Candy from strangers
Candy from a stranger
Shorty, have a bite
I will fill your appetite
I know your mom said not to
But, I'll change your life after tonight
Bet you never tried it, and I guarantee you'll like it
And I know you can't resist, so don't fight it, don't
Come give it to me

And Everytime I see you in my dreams,
I see your face, it's haunting me,
I guess I need you baby

How Am I supposed to know what's right?

I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I wanna see you move.
With a taste of your lips,
I'm on a ride,
You're toxic I'm gun slippin' under,
With a taste of a poison paradise,
I'm addicted to you,
Dont you know that your toxic?
And I love what you do,
Dont you know that your toxic?

Like-like-like-like a circus
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh)
Let's go
Like-like
Like-like
Like-like
Like-like
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain
And the ones that observe
Well baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat
Gotta be first (Oh, oh)
I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline
Movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me
And I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer
The dancefloor is my stage
Better be ready
Hope that you feel the same
I feel the adrenaline
Movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me
And I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer
The dancefloor is my stage
Better be ready
Hope that you feel the same
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh)
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh)
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh)
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh)
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh)
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh)
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me
And ones that are scared
So baby, I hope that you
Came prepared
I run a tight ship
So beware
I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline
Movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me
And I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer
The dancefloor is my stage
Better be ready
Hope that you feel the same
I feel the adrenaline
Movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me
And I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer
The dancefloor is my stage
Better be ready
Hope that you feel the same
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh)

Like-like-like-like a circus
Yeah

Cuz I'll be slippin' off this dress
Fooling 'round and then we smash
Again and again (come here, baby)

Never told a soul about what we've done
You let it roll right off your tongue

Cause you and I were connected
And then the stadium lights go on
And we get hectic
Cause you and I were connected
To the light that shines in our eyes
To the beat that’s running our lives
To the sound that’s bringing us back again

And I know you in and out and you know me
There’s not a thing you got to be
And I see how your glowing from inside

We got 'em on this one due
And they say
I'm crazy
For loving you
For feeling you
And maybe
I'm a little crazy
But they don't know
All the things you do
When the pen hits the pad
It's in the left hand
Every single word is worth thirty grand
Or maybe more
Don't think they understand
How much cake the pancake man had
So heavy like weight
Moving upstate
Care for my rhyme
Like the crime rate
I flick with your boy
The prince of the bay
Sit back, day to day
Got two back packs
Resno on one
La in other
Whilst I'm holding my sons
As I march through the valley of the shadow of death
Dark hair on my chest
Wife on my left
Let's go
And they say
I'm crazy
For loving you
For feeling you
And maybe
I'm a little crazy
But they don't know
All the things you do
That's how I'ma ride
For my family I'd die
Bet you're all thinking
I'm that guy
Don't care about you
'Cause I'm the truth
I ball like Kobe
Shooting hoops
Up in the roof
Been the million dollar corporation
Call me maloof
Like I said once before
I'm the truth
Hollywood can't catch me
But they got you
Nothing fake round here
I'm the realest do
Haters feel us too
I'm in and out the groove
Every word out my mouth
Make headline news
I'm the best, I rule
Come test my tools
You do so square
Get my slang out manuals, ha
And they say
I'm crazy
For loving you
For feeling you
And maybe
I'm a little crazy
But they don't know
All the things you do
And they say I'm a little crazy
But they don't even know you, baby
So they base all their the accusations
On what they really don't know
So tired of all the speculation
Fed up of negative fabrications
You say just have a little patience
But they are driving me crazy
Never been a surfer
But my chang hang loose
Got so much flavour
Like 2pac juice
Got dudes wishing you're in my shoes
I'm a rockstar baby
I do what I wanna do
Tough pack
My crew will come and clobber you
Let the pope come out
And watch it swallow you
Not a pretty boy
But I look like a model do
Not a gangster
But in my life, yeah I've fought a few
Hit the hustle tight now it look
Like I'm robbing you
All yours flys
Watch how I swatted you
Better think twice how you come at me
I'm a godfather now
I'm about my family, yeah
And they say
I'm crazy
For loving you
For feeling you
And maybe
I'm a little crazy
But they don't know
All the things you do</field>

Just light a match baby you will see
We detonate like fireworks
Watch out cause I'm feeling nasty
See me looking at you and you turned away
Wanna know, do I make you uncomfortable
Think you know all the rules of the games that you play
When it all comes around you got nothing to say
Can't stop it
Before you started up you started to break
There's a feeling when your head starts stripping
Your tongue's been slipping
Now it's getting dangerous
You're falling
And baby I can hear you calling for me
But I look the other way forget you
No I won't miss you
Now it's getting dangerous
It's getting dangerous
Watching me, you're crawling at my feet
I've seen it all and now it's on repeat
I'm razor sharp and I'm cutting deep
And you love it when I'm getting nasty
Now you're waiting for me, you don't want me to go
When the hell is your feeling get down so low
Cause I gave you my heart then you threw it away
When I came back to you you had nothing to say
Can't stop it
Before you started up you started to break
There's a feeling when your head starts stripping
Your tongue's been slipping
Now it's getting dangerous
You're falling
And baby I can hear you calling for me
But I look the other way forget you
No I won't miss you
Now it's getting dangerous
It's getting dangerous
Watch out
I'm coming right at you
There's no sign of warning
Nothing you can do
Rising
The tempature's on now
You better stay at home
Cause it's getting dangerous
Can't stop it
Before you started up you started to break
There's a feeling when your head starts stripping
Your tongue's been slipping
Now it's getting dangerous
You're falling
And baby I can hear you calling for me
Bt I look the other way forget you
No I won't miss you
Now it's getting dangerous
It's getting dangerous</field>

Today I saw a boy
and I wondered if he noticed me.
He took my breath away.
Dear Diary
I can't get him off my mind
and it scares me 'cause I've never felt this way.
No one in this
world knows me better than you do,
So diary I'll confide in you.
Dear Diary
Today I saw that boy.
As he walked by I thought he smiled at me.
And I wondered does he know what's in my heart?
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe.
Should I tell him how I feel or would that scare him away.
Diary, tell me what to do, please tell me what to say.
Dear Diary
One touch of his hand
now I can't wait to see that boy again.
He smiled and I thought my heart could fly.
Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends?
I've got a feeling we'llbe so much more than friends.</field>

Looking for an answer
How can it be this way?
What have I done?
I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change
Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along, know
After this love is found
It seems like we can't go wrong
Chorus:
Deep in my heart I know theres only you
And right from the start I always knew
I'll never let go, cause I love you so
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life
(uh huh)

Some people search
What seems to be a lifetime
To find a love like this (oh yeah)
And here we are
With everything we've wished for
I've never felt such bliss (oh no)
Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along
After this love is found
It seems like we can't go wrong
Deep in my heart I know theres only you
And right from the start I always knew
I'll never let go, cause I love you so
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life

There comes a chance
In everyone's life
And I believe it wont happen twice
Now since I've felt the glory of love
I wanna spend forever
And ever with you
Deep in my heart I know theres only you (only you)
And right from the start I always knew
I'll never let go, cause I love you so (I love you so)
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life

I wouldn't believe it
Because you know we both care
But we got to get over, over the mountain
We can't keep standing, standing there
Let's move on and be stronger
Even though we can't go
Let go, can't hold on
When love's broken
This is gonna be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry
Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry
Don't cry, cry, don't cry, don't cry
Cry, cry
In the beginning we were both crazy
We were crazy in love
But now that it's ending
We're just crazy
Because we love with no trust
Can't go on any longer
Baby, we got to let it go
Move on, can't hold on
When love's broken
This is gonna be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry
This is gonna be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry
Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry
Don't cry, cry, don't cry, don't cry

Time is up
No more cheat n' lie
No more tears to dry
You and I, we're like so "bye-bye"
Finally
I am over you
Totally unblue
And I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm tellin' you now
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door
I can see
It's no mystery
It's so clear to me
What we had is all history
It's ok
I can sleep at night
It will be alright
I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever
And I'm tellin' you now
Don't go knockin' on my door

Don't go knock on my door
Don't go knock on my door
Do what you want
As long as you don't come back
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
And now I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door

This is the making
Of another cold, rude awakening
It's been too long anticipating
Hurry up for my demonstration

Okay, light speed

Don't play, joke around
One shot, you're killin' me
Don't keep me waiting

The train is boarding, you might miss it
Follow directions, damn it, listen
Before my body's in remission
So come to your destination
Okay, light speed

Stan- standing outside

Wha- wha- what- wha- wha-
What the hell!
I'm standing outside
Colder than the freezer
Come out and melt my ice
I'm running out of time
You're changing my demeanor
So get me to your ride
Before I change my mind
Don't apologize

I wanna hear you say the words, please
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back just let it go

You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know

Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch
But 'til you say the words it's not enough
C'mon and tell me you're in love, please
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back just let it go

(One more game)
Just one more game,
It's time to play,
Come play my way.
I'm no more Mrs
Nice Girl,
No playing home ground,
I'm not the same girl,
You never rocked my world,
You used me,
Tried to abuse me,
Fanned a life of fantasy,
Now back to reality.
(How dramatic)
The truth that lies can't hide,
I'm not by your side,
But you're drumming your drummer,
Run and tell your mama,
See if she can save you,
When I'm not around you.
(So dramatic)
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were,
Now there's another ringing my bell,
I'm under his spell,
You're too dramatic,
Understand it's over.
Baby, fuck you,
The things you did, I never thought I'd get a clue,
Yeah, you wanted me to be that faithful to you,
Not let nobody's body touch my body in positions that we only knew.
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now I'm gonna give him what he wants and more,
Do all those explicit things that I told you "No",
Places you couldn't go,
You know where I'm talking,
You are too dramatic.
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were.
Now there's another ringing my bell,
I'm under his spell,
You're too dramatic,
Understand it's over.
Come and play,
You wanna play,
Come play with me.
No, you're not the one I thought you were,
Now there's another ringing my bell,
I'm under his spell,
You're too dramatic,
Understand it's over.
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were,
Now there's another ringing my bell,

Passed out on the couch and yawnin
Just walked in and it's early mornin
Bump bump till the break of dawnin
Shit don't stop till the early mornin
Met a dark dude Kinda dark hair
When he walked up Tony grabbed him
But I liked him
Told him come here

Baby, we can make plans
Where you live
Do your mama live there
Or we can hook up at the hotel
He was down
So I told him, let's go
What happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know
(Chorus)
I want out with my girl jen
And we called up Gabe and his friends
They was talking bout hittin up show
So I said, what the hell
Let's go
Got up and
Got on the dance floor
Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast danced slow
What happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

Beyond the headlight glare

And everywhere I've been
It's hard to find a friend
I've got no alibis
For the state I'm in
Everybody needs
Needs a place to go
God knows I have seen
It's a twisting, winding road
Every day the sun comes up again
A little hope begins
And it starts with you
'cause you get me through it
And every day I'm closer to the shore
I smile a little more
And because of your faith
I get closer now every day
Said every day, I said every day, every day
It's hard to recognize
Across the great divide
Just what you left behind
And what you keep inside
A ripple in the calm
You keep my safe from harm
Somehow you still believe
You believe in me
Where it starts and ends
Only time must know
Wherever you will be
Is where I wanna go
Every day the sun comes up again
A little hope begins
And it starts with you
'cause you get me through it
And every day I'm closer to the shore
I smile a little more

And I came to hit the floor
I thought you knew before
But if you don't then now you know
Yo tonight I'm 'bout to mash
Make them other chicks so mad
I'm 'bout to shake my ass
Snatch that boy (so fast)
It's all about me and you
Doin' how we do
Tear the floor up, up, up
Tell them to make room
They wanna know, tell them I'm alone
They wanna look, we can give 'em an encore
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow
We can give 'em a
Peep peep show, peep peep show
Peep show
Don't stop and let it flow
Let your inhibitions go
It's crazy now
Let's make them make a freakshow
Make it a freak show, freak
Freakshow, freakshow
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow, a freakshow
Make them clap when we perform
Wanna be crazy we can show 'em
Dancin' table top freaky, freaky
So outside the norm
I'm some superstar ish, ish
Christian hot, Bugatti whips
Hope the new designer fits
We can do it if you wish?
It's all about me and you
Doin' how we do
Tear the floor up, up, up
Tell them to make room
They wanna know, tell them I'm alone
They wanna look, we can give 'em an encore
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow
We can give 'em a
Peep peep show, peep peep show
Peep show
Don't stop and let it flow
Let your inhibitions go
It's crazy now
Let's make them make a freakshow
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow, freakshow
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow, a freakshow
Me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Said me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Said me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Freakshow...

Peep peep show, peep peep show

            <field name="lyrics">Never look back," we said
How was I to know i'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead,
Emptiness behind
Where do I go?
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know, still I miss you somehow?
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you
to know
You were my first love,
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even the time may find me somebody new
You were my real love
I never knew love
'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart
"Baby," I said,
"Please stay.
Give our love a chance for one more day"
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about
But you put a dart
Through my dreams
Through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you
to know
You were my first love,
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even the time may find me somebody new
You were my real love
I never knew love
'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart
You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you
to know
You were my first love,
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even the time may find me somebody new
You were my real love
I never knew love
'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

When the music goes up and the sun goes down
Lightning strikes and I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around (is you)
Spark and it's like gasoline

My heart only runs on supreme

Oh no, here we go
Catch me if you can
Don't move too slow
I'm on another level
Can you feel my flow?
See how good
When I'm on the floor
Wonder if you're ever
Gonna zing that I got
I told you before that I'ma keep it hot
See how it is
When I walk up in the spot
Standing in a line
Ha, I think not
I came to party baby
You might think I'm crazy
By the way I'm moving to the beat
You're standing on the wall
What you come here for?
You wanna feel the heat
Dancing next to me.
Get back (Get back) x3
If you can't take it then get back
Get back (Get back) x3
If you can't take it then get back
Get back (Get back) x3
If you can't take it then get back
Get back (Get back) x3
If you can't take it then...
DJ spin it back
Know that I like it
When you do it like that
Eyes on my waist
Feel you better think fast
Got that kind of body
Make you wanna spend cash
Shake it like you seen them do it in the video
Ladies on the floor
Let me see you get low
Fellas at the bar
Won't you spend a little dough?
This is how I do it
When I'm tearing up the floor
I came to party baby
You might think I'm crazy
By the way I'm moving to the beat
You're standing on the wall
What you come here for?
You wanna feel the heat
Dancing next to me.

Would you like it
If I tease you
Get you really hot
Watch me turn around
Then let me show you what I got
Baby if you're ready
Won't you step up to the plate
Don't be scared of how I'm moving
Boy don't play it safe
Let me see you move
Let me see you dance
Let me see you bounce
Danja, bring it back

            <field name="lyrics">There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did
There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do
If I could
I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling
The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do
I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Is me
I can't believe what I see
No...
The girl in my mirror
The girl in my mirror is me
Ohh..
is me
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do</field>

Oh God I wish you weren't sleeping
I long for your lips, to kiss me again
Don't you know my body's aching?
Seems we always have a little price to pay,
Price to pay, I'm Falling in love
It all starts, starts to fade
[CHORUS]
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys
Will make love together
I look at your face, As I lie awake
Our bodies slowly moving closer
My hand on your leg
My mouth on its way
Oh baby, I'll just turn you over
Seems we always have a little price to pay,
Price to pay, (uh) I'm Falling in love
It all starts, starts to ache
[CHORUS]
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys (boys)
Will make love together...
Love together, love together,
Love together, love together,
Love together...
Do you like this? I like this
I want you alright
Do you wanna touch me?
I like this
Can you handle this?
I like this
We've gotta slow it down,
Just a little bit
I'm lying in bed, touching my skin
I just can't take it baby
Open your eyes, whisper to me..
Do it again, do it again
[CHORUS 2x]
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys (boys)
Will make love together
Love together, love togther,
Love together...
That's good, do you like this?
Yeah, gonna slow it down
We'll make love together</field>

A creature so hypnotic
But I guess I never thought it was true (yeah)
And now that I've seen you
I've turned into a believer
Baby so much for what I thought I'd do (yeah)
Since I tasted you I got a craving
Shaking in the heat of the night
Oh, yeah, baby you got me misbehaving
And I don't even know what is right

Something about ya, 'bout ya
Something about ya
It's hard to forget ya
We're stuck here forever

As I tongue your body, sexy features so iconic
And I just can't keep my fingers away (no)
Your love got me faded
Keep it going, let's get wasted
Baby, so much for my poker face (oh)

I feel it burning and I know I'm standing far too close
I'm telling lies and if it shows I see that he don't care
I know he wants to take me home and get on out of here
I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all of my ladies and he don't know that
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
I feel my body is in focus as he touches me
And I should go but I can't overcome this chemistry
He pulls me close before he whispers something in my ear
He says he wants to take me home and get me out of here
I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all of my ladies and he don't know that
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I see him staring at me, I see what he wants to be
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I gotta, I gotta go
He don't know that

Give it time
Help me through
Heart we can do this together
You're my strength
You're my soul
I need you now more than ever
Heart
All the hurt will soon be gone
If you, if you'll just keep on being strong
You will always be my friend
So keep on hanging in

Your teeth
Your tongue

You're mine
Your lips
You're fine
You're heaven on earth
I've waited all my life for you
My favorite kiss
Your perfect skin
Your perfect smile
Waking up and you're next to me
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep
Lay my head on your chest and drift away
Dream of you and I'm almost half awake
(The palest green I've ever seen
The colour of your eyes
You've taken me so far away
One look and you stop)

Fell in love with you and
Everything that you are
Nothing I can do I'm really
Crazy about you
When you're next to me
It's just like heaven on earth
You're heaven (You're Heaven)
You're heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
I'm in love with you
Your breath
Your face
Your hands
Your head
You're sweet
Your love
Your tongue
I'd move across the world for you (the world)
Just tell me when
Just tell me where
I'll come to you
Take me back to that place in time
Images of you occupy my mind
Far away but I feel you here with me
Dream of you and you're almost next to me
(The palest green I've ever seen

You've taken me so far away

Fall off the edge of my mind

I fall off the edge of my mind
(For you)

Let me know you're all mine
Let me know you're all mine
And I might stay tonight

I was raised by old g's, so I'm low key
How much you need? And you like "Baby believe me"
I'm a freak that can eat, that can beat
That can treat you like that queen
That you was meant to be
I'm the good, I'm that raw, slick on the dong
With nothing to something, to had it all
Now, mami, just watch, learn and listen
I've got a feeling so good she stay switchin'
But before I banish, she spoke Spanish
She said: "Papito rico, te necesito"
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'

Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
Girl, it's getting hotter
I can't take much more

Please forgive me
If I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare
but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, little question
Wanna know just how you feel
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Hey you might think
That I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more, Wanna see it,
So I'm askin' you tonight
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
If I said I want your body,
Would you hold it against me?
(Yeah)
(Uh huh)
(Oww)
Give me something good
Don't wanna wait, I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out
(Alright)
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow

Please forgive me
If I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare
but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, little question
Wanna know just how you feel
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Hey you might think
That I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark inbetween us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more, Wanna see it,
So I'm askin' you tonight
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
If I said I want your body,
Would you hold it against me?
(Yeah)
(Uh huh)
(Oww)
Give me something good
Don't wanna wait, I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out
(Alright)
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me (2x)</field>

In the way he moves
Don't miss it
Do not be a fool
It's a long way
It's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones
He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight
Remembering, I forever will
Surrendering, just to how we felt
It's a long way
It's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones
He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight
And when it's all the thunder and rain
The cinema is fading away
I gotta make my way through the night
Holding on with all of my might
And when I'm lost
And I can't the find the way
I feel the pieces breaking away
Hold myself with all of my might
Don't let go
Just hold on tight
He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight</field>

Said you would be my problems than I'd ever know
Said if he's gonna go then let him go away
But then I get the urge it hurts so bad
When I feel the thirst it makes me mad
I look up in my bed I look up and there is your face
[Chorus:]
(You love it, you love it)
I'm so hooked on it, hooked on it
(You want it, you want it)
You're so good on a good day
(Sugarfall, your sugarfall)
You make my sugarfall, sugarfall
(You know you want it bad, baby)
I heard it in the streets you got another girl
Yes, it did sting but didn't shatter my world
You should catch me now when I'm in the fall of a state
You're probably thinking to yourself this just ain't me
On the contrary, I was your freak
Hit me one more time and trust me, I'll be ok
[Chorus]
Now I will be a bad chick
If I rounded up my clothes
And headed over straight to the door
You wouldn't have a clue
Of what you should do
If I left you laying longing for more
You'd be like baby, don't go
Baby, want some more?
Baby..
Don't go (just don't go)
Said baby please, listen, don't you just go
Do you lick your lips when you stand alone?
Well you got no x-ray vision staring through my clothes
Are you sure that you're prepared for what comes serves on it's plate
Wait a minute, ooh, I'm having second thoughts
See my hearts on fault, could you pass my shorts?
Don't you got a girl? Till then, I'm sorry, you must wait
(Especially since I know)
[Chorus 2x]
You know you want it
So come and get it</field>

Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
To see your foolishness and fuckery
And handling my business
Holler if you hear me
Hey, can I get a witness
Preacher, preacher
I'm the teacher, you can learn
Watch your fingers, boy
You might get burned
'Cause I'm cold as fire baby, hot as ice

If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice

Break it down, break it down, break it down
As you can see, fortunately
I'm cold as fire
Yeah, I'm cold as fire
Yeah, make you believe
Make you stop and breathe
I'll take you higher
I'm just too cool
Make you do what it do
I'm hot as ice now
Yeah, I'm hot as ice now
I'll make you feel like heaven 24 7
I'm hot as ice now
Cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice

Got no sense
But I don't care
They may or may not mean offense
But I don't care
You see, I'm sort of independent
I am my own superintendent
And my star is on the ascendent
That's why I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
What they may think of me
I'm happy-go-lucky, they say that I'm plucky
Contented and carefree
I don't care I don't care
If I do get a mean and stony stare
If I'm not successful
It won't be distressful
Cause I don't care
A girl should know her etiquette
Alas, alack
Propriety demands we walk a narrow track
When fellas used to blink at me
I'd freeze 'em and they'd shrink at me
But now when fellas wink at me
I wink at them right back!
I don't care I don't care
If people frown on me
Perhaps it's the lone way
But I go my own way
That's my philosophy
I don't care I don't care
if he's clerk or just a millionaire
There's no doubt about it
I'll sing and I'll shout it
Cause I don't care
Oh, I don't care, I don't care
When it comes to happiness
I want my share
Don't try to rearrange me
There's nothing can change me
'cause I don't care!</field>

What’s underneath the radar
Wanna do things I won’t remember tomorrow
They take me where the freaks party
Show me the room where its getting wild
And as sexy as hell and the skin is out
And ya cant leave the club without making out with the chick on the couch
I need a change
Something strange

I know them by heart
So sick and tired of singing

Think its more bizarre
I need some misbehaving

Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away
You threw it all away
So blind
Pushed me far from you
In your life
And now I know the tears won't lead to loneliness
Baby when time goes by
I'll understand
Let's pretend that I moved on
Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away
I run away
I run away
I run away

Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside

Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out (o-out)
I've been told who I should do it with
To keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out
I-I-I wanna go-o-o

You don't have to say what's on your mind
'cause I know where you've been
Give it up and leave it all behind
And let me begin
Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there
When you need someone
You just turn around
And I will be there
When you're feeling low
Baby let me know
And I will be there
Won't you let me make it up to you
Now you know where I am
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Just to love once again
Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright

When you're in sorrow
Just let me know and I will be there (2x)

You were my summer breeze, my winter sun, my
springtime soul (springtime soul), my autumn touch of gold Yeah
And you were my sky, my rain, the earth in which my love goes
The smile of my heart and the breath of my soul
Even if we find ourselves apart
We will hold our hopes and dreams
Forever in our hearts
And when the stars are falling
I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading

So real, So real
And when the stars are falling

And when your dreams are fading
I'll be waiting
I will still love you
Time may take us apart, that's true
But I will always be there for you
You're in my heart, you'll be in my dreams
No matter how many miles we've seen
I promise you that I won't forget
The day we kissed or the day we met
The sky may fall and the stars may tilt
But I will still, I will still Love you
And when the stars are falling
I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading
I'll be waiting
I will still love you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I know I may be young
But I've got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world
Always saying, "little girl don't step into the club"
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why cause dancing's what I love
(Now watch me)
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it (Do you like it)
Get it get it, get it get it (This feels good)
I know I may come off quiet, may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What's practical is logical, what the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there
I'm a slave for you
I cannot hold it
I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you
I won't deny it
I'm not trying to hide it
Baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me (Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age(Let's go)
(Like that)
(You like it)
(Yeah)
(Now watch me)
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it (Do you like it)
Get it get it, get it get it (This feels good)
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(I just can't help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(I just feel I let myself go)
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(Wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to (Uh Uh Uh)
Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me

Of my diary
That I haven't touched
Since you left me
The closed blinds
In my home
See no light of day
Dust gathers
On my stereo
Cos I can't bare
To hear the radio
The piano sits
In a shaded space
With a picture
Of your face
I'm scared
To face another day
Cos the fear in me
Just won't go away
In an instant
You were gone
And I'm scared
Coffee stains
On your favorite book
Remind me of you
So I can't even look
The magazines
You left on the floor
You won't need
Them anymore
A towel left
Hangin on the wall
No sign of wet foosteps
In the hall
There's no smell
Of your sweet cologne
I'm lying here alone
I'm scared
To face another day
Cos the fear in me
Just won't go away
In an instant
You were gone
And now I'm scared
I'm scared
To face another day
Cos the fear in me
Just won't go away
In an instant
You were gone
Now I'm scared
In an instant
You were gone
And I'm scared</field>

Oh baby
You better let your love show
Here's what I'm telling you
Let me know, let me go
I'm so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do?
I'm so curious, what do you think of me
Boy am I just a game or do you feel the same as I do?
So curious

I'm so curious about our love
If it's make believe
Why don't you set my heart free
And tell me goodbye?
But if it's for real
Tell me you feel for me
Way deep down inside
Oh baby
Is this goodbye or hello?

Yeah, yeah
All day and night I just dream of you
I think about all the things that we could do
I'm dying for and I'm feeling for the day
When you could open up and say
You feel the same, you feel like I do, yeah
I'm so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do?
I'm so curious, what do you think of me
Boy am I just a game or do you feel the same as I do?

Here is a little story that I made up
So Let's make believe
Four years ago I had a party
that was too much fun for me
Boy there's a sexy guy
He'd surely give me everything I need
Sometimes I let temptation go too far
and get the best of me
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
The conversation was going over 'til I turned my hair
He started touching me and kissing me
Like he didn't care
I thought at first I should go home
But then fell asleep in the chair
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just wanna have a good time
I just wanna be myself
And don't let nobody tell you it's any differantly
I wanna enjoy the sunshine
And do the things that I need
To see what feels good to me
I'm just so crazy
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just begun
I just begun
having my fun
I just begun
I just begun
Having my fun, yeah!</field>

With a bottle of perfume lotion
Where'd you come from talking like that?
Butterfly from the bottom of the ocean
And I can't stop this slow motion trip
Been away with me, no politics
It's a perfect notion
Your gravity has got me
Bowing in devotion
You and me fit a magic trick
If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
If I'm dancing
I know the music's good
If we're dancing, if we're dancing
If we're dancing
I know that we'll be good
One look at him and I see
Candy-coated heart shapes
The jewels and furniture can go
But baby, he stays
He plays sitar, three notes so far
If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good (did you get that?)
If we're dancing, if we're dancing
If we're dancing
I know that we'll be good
My chakra's all been pink and red
But he wants blue and green instead
(let's just do it over)
My chakra's all been pink and red
But he wants blue and green instead
If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
If I'm dancing
I know the music's good
If we're dancing, if we're dancing
If we're dancing
I know that we'll be good</field>

Say what you want about me
Oh but can't you see what I see
Say what you want about me
Love me, hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy

            <field name="lyrics">My phone is off the hook,
You're cramping up my style.
I can't believe you feel neglected,
You are such a child.
I'm going off the edge,
I think you're too obsessed.
You're so attached.
I'm about to unhook the phone,
It needs a rest.
Won't leave me alone,
Get a busy tone,
Stuck inside my home,
Im going crazy.
Need a little space,
I am sick of your face,
Now a mental place,
What have you done to me?
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
It's disturbing I forgot to mention.
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
Think I'm craving some other attention.
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
Yes I'm for you but you never listen.
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
End up single but I know what I'm missing.
You're suffocating me,
I need some room to stop.
I'm locked up in a room,
And you're the one that has the key.
I make just no mistake,
I think I want to break,
And if we jump then it's my sanity that you will take.
Won't leave me alone,
Get a busy tone,
Stuck inside my home,
I'm going crazy.
Need a little space,
I am sick of your face,
Now a mental place,
What have you done to me?
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
It's disturbing I forgot to mention.
I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
Think I'm craving some other attention.
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
Yes I'm for you but you never listen.
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
End up single but I know what I'm missing.
Let's bring it back to reality,
It's time to respect my boundaries.
You're pressuring to get close to me,
I think I'm ready for some space.
Give me back my space.
Give me back my space.
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
It's disturbing I forgot to mention.
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
Think I'm craving some other attention.
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
I'm insane,
Yes I'm for you but you never listen.
I'm insane,
You want make me insane.

Sittin' in the mirror gettin' pretty
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
I can hear a knockin' at the front door
And I know exactly what you came for
Tryin' to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
Tryin' to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
You, touch me and it's breakin' me down
Me down, me down, me down
I'm tellin' you, let's just give it up and get down
And get down, and get down
So come on, won't you give me something to remember?
Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out,
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby,
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
Cause you know me inside out, inside out
I know that we probably shouldn't do this
Wake up in the morning feeling stupid,
Said that we done but you're all up on me
Said that we done but you're all up on me
Tell me how we got in this position?
Guess I gotta get you out my system
Tryin' to let you go but it's not that easy
Tryin' to let you go but it's not that easy
You, touch me and it's breakin' me down
Me down, me down, me down
I'm tellin' you, let's just give it up and get down
And get down, and get down
So come on, won't you give me something to remember?
Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out,
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby,
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
Cause you know me inside out, inside out (x2)

I sign a thousand autographs
Please - just get to the point when you talk to me
And if a favor gets involved, just rub my feet
Yea this business is fucked
And I want some fun
I wanna sit at home and watch Dumb and Dumber
Sike- I take that back, I'm just trickin' you see
Cause when I show my belly everybody copies me
It's kinda cool, nothin' but guys
But I'm just Britney Spears and I got all this power
But the bottom line is I don't even use it
Right when you become a bitch that's when you lose it
So what if I do? What if I lose it all today?
I've always got my friends to hold me all the way
Happiness is the key, and love when you fall
Like Lauren Hill said you ain't got that - got nothing at all, y'all
So how you been?
It's been awhile.
But it feels nice
It really feels nice

Heart's beating fast

She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, ooh
Before I think, I start to run
But you can't even face me
Know exactly what you've done
Know exactly, baby
Pictures, they flash
And I can't even sleep
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

No, I just can't believe

Won't stop when you're kissing me
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You can tell that
You'll be jealous
We can have it
Nothing's wrong with kissing me
Cause you know that all I need everyday
Just to keep my hands off you
(If you, if you)
Felt that y'all need to take a break
She just wanna argue
(If you, if you)
Felt this way
Can't everybody know
It's Ok
(If you, if you)
Taste it
I'll make sure you eat every crumb off the plate
(I may think about it
Cause all your eyes are saying
That you wanna undress me)
She must not like to drink
Cuz if I was her
I would sip on you all day
(I will see about it
But then the problem is bigger than
her, you and me)
The boy I'm currently seeing is
6 foot 3 and too possessive
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You won't break it in
I may just set you free
Won't stop when you're kissing me
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You can tell that
You'll be jealous
We can have it
Nothing's wrong with kissing me
(If you, if you)
Drop the ball
That may change everything I thought about you
(If you, if you)
We should
Call this an affair
My kiss
Might hurt you
(If you, if you)
(If you, if you)
(I may think about it
Cause all your eyes are saying
That you wanna undress me)
(I will see about it
But then the problems bigger than her, you and me)
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You won't break it in

Won't stop when you're kissing me

You try to figure out
You try to breathe me
But you can't blow me out
You try to feel me
But I'm so out of touch
I won't be falling
You won't have to pick me up
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way like you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around
You think I might act out but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be
Trust in my instincts
Trust that I know what's right
These are the reasons
That keep you up at night (at night)
Tell me "Go Slow" - This is my flow
'Cos you don't know, know what I know
Let me tell you how it feels
Baby it's time that you see me for real
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way like you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around
You think I might act out but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be
Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go
Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go
You think I might act out but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be (be)

Hindsight, I can see it all so plain
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down
Left, right, nowhere to turn
I'm left in the ash

Fire come down, fire-fire come down

(ah) I'm looking at you on your knees

Crawl, crawl, crawl

Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can bleed
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
I hear you all night talk in your sleep
Saying all kind of names
But none of them me
Keeping secrets under your sheets
Under you sheets, under-under your sheets
You can cry wolf, but you know
I ain't gonna be here tomorrow, oh no
I ain't fucking with you dirty, dirty, dirty laundry
Dirty laundry, dirty-dirty laundry

Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold
(chorus)
Oooh, oooh, oooh
You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Don't knock on my door
Not this time.

I think about the times that I wasted
I think about the times that I took you back
Ain´t no way I'll be lonely
I don´t wanna let you back in
Let's just face it (face it)
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I will be lonely
I don´t wanna let you back in
Don´t tell me how to feel
Or say that you're for real
My mind is made up I'm cool without ya
You got no more appeal
Now this girl don´t need no man
Say what she can to what she can't
Now I live for me
Boy does that make you weak?
Not this time...because I realize

You thought that I will be lonely
I don´t wanna let you back in
Think of times you made me cry you
had me so confused
I´m tired of trying
leave behind this
What's a girl to do
Think of all the times you made me sick
I used to think I couldn´t handle it
What you think,I´m just another chick
Must have bit,boy you must have tripped
The way you thinkin when you lost my trust
You had it all and now your left for nothing
Ooh baby now I know you want my touch
and now you´re lonely and you still want me
I think about the times that I wasted
I think about the times that I took you back
Ain´t no way I'll be lonely
I don´t wanna let you back in

Of bread I had to eat

When all your hopes are sinking
Let me show you what love means
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?
I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?
When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Anything, anything
Keep believing in the power
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge

Trying to understand
After all the pain
We?ll take another chance
I just want to close my eyes
Forget the reasons why
Lying here on the floor
All I want is more
Love is war
We hurt the ones we love
But still don?t let them go
We hold on to the words
You and I would know
All these tears are in my eyes
That?s where they?ll stay
It?s just easier that way
Then I turn
Say that I?m not the one
I don?t feel the sting
I don?t feel anything
I?ve gone numb
From all the damage done
But I?m lying here on the floor
So many times before

named Lucky...
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on her door
It's time for makeup,
Perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go...
"Isn't she lovely,
this Hollywood girl?"
And they say...
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her
lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?
Lost in an image,
in a dream
But there's no one there to
wake her up
And the world is spinning,
and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when
it stops?
They go...
"Isn't she lovely, this
Hollywood girl?"
And they say...
Chorus
"Best actress, and the
winner is...Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop
News standing outside the
arena waiting for Lucky!"
"Oh, my God...here she comes!"
Isn't she lovely, this
Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does
she cry?
If there's nothing missing in
her life
Why do tears come at night?

I thought I was going crazy
I thought the pain would last forever
I thought he'd never ever hurt me and hurt me
Over and over again
Ohh
When you tried into my world
You showed the loving ways of how
A guy should treat a girl
The love you give that makes me breathe again
I've found someone who feels me
An understanding friend till the end
I know the future no one can see
But I feel deep in my heart
You will stay with me eternally
So just love me
Even every day
And hold me in your arms now
Please love the hurt away
Ff: I'll make it go away, yes I will
Britney: Oh hurt away (ohhh)
Ff: I see heaven in your eyes
Tell me why would he make you cry, and lie
He must have been out of his mind
I would never hurt you baby
Don't let one fool turn you cold (oh no)
You've got a heart of gold
Britney: Heart Of gold
Ff: I love everything about you
Britney: All I know is
Britney and Ff: Every word I take it straight to you
A special part of I give for everything I do
Nobody else comes close to the love you give
Body and soul
I'm gonna love you for as long as I live
Ff: And I know
It's not easy letting go (No it's not easy)
But I won't let you fall
Together you and me
We've got it all
Britney: I just love you
More and more each day
I rest my head on your shoulder
Please love the hurt away
Love the hurt away
I know
I know the future no one can see
But I feel deep in my heart
You will stay with me eternally
Ff: I just love you
More and more each day
Britney and Ff: (No, oh) Please love the hurt away (ohh yeah)
Oh my love
Love the hurt away (oh oh yeah)
Please love the hurt away</field>

            <field name="lyrics">It's a crazy little thing called mad love
It goes something like this
Tangled up in you, uh
Twisted like I've never been before
I don't know what you do
All I know is I want a little more
I don't care if the way that I act doesn't make much sense
When you're near, something in me reacts and there's no defense
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
All that matters is how this feels
I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
Oh
I wanna take you in (Come here)
A velvet rush is running through mad veins
Like adrenaline, a kiss from you and I'm going so insane
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
All that matters is how this feels
I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than my love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up

I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it
'Cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game
Just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah)
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No rules
From the bar to the car
Let's take it back to my room
Igniting the heat of the moment
Let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we're burning bright
When we cut the light
Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah)
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Yeah, Eazy)
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or little bars
Really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are; need you
I've always wondered what was off limits
Staring at you til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this was all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we could tell that there's changes coming
See I could tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
Like Penelope in "Blow"
Well worth the stealing you, it's a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you
And make me ooh (move) , ooh, ooh (yeah) , ooh

Yeah, it's keeping me alive
(Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time
And as far as I can see I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me get a world that they're tryna see
I got Britney Spears right beside of me
A Ferrari I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on if time is money
And make me ooh (move) , ooh, ooh (yeah) , ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way
I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear up my mind
But it's difficult
So difficult
Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby I wanna be closer to love
Patience, darling
Wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon, moon
Last night I was in your arms so strong
One small step and baby you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs
All I do is cry and sing along
Drinking alone in my party dress
Would you come back if I looked my best
Put on a smile and I said to myself
Patience, darling
Wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon, moon
Moon, moon
I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear
Up my mind but it's difficult
(why is it so difficult?)
So difficult
Chateau Marouatte
Il m'amène au lieu du chevalier cet hivers
Cinq, quatre, trois, deux, un
Patience, darling
Wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon, moon

Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

Mmm papa, love you
You love it when I’m freakin’ out
Things get rough and there’s no doubt
You will always be there for me
Mmm papa, love you
Mmm papa, love you
Stuck in
The middle of it all
Too many people around me
Can you hear me call?
I look this way
When you’re not there
If you don’t mind
My soul out there
Mmm papa
Mmm papa, mmm papa
You can come take me away
There’s no pressure, play all day
Grip me tight and don’t let go
Mmm papa, love you
Mmm papa, love you
You love it when I’m freakin’ out
Things get rough and there’s no doubt
You will always be there for me

This is the story about..
mona lisa
The mona lisa
Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell
About mona lisa, and how she suddenly fell
See everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well
Now I'm taking over, to release her from her spell
She's the original (yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable,(yeah, yeah)
She's wanted you to know (yeah)
She's been gone
It's kinda incredible (yeah, yeah)
She's so unpredictable (yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wanted you to know (yeah)
She's been gone, she's been gone, she's been gone.
She was taken under, drowning in her seat (huh)
Running like an angel, she was crying and could not see (oh no!)
Now see everyone's watching, as she starts to fall
They want her to break down,
And be a legend of a fall.
She's the original (yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable,(yeah, yeah)
She's wanted you to know (yeah)
She's been gone
It's kinda incredible (yeah, yeah)
She's so unpredictable (yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wanted you to know (yeah)
She's been gone, she's been gone, she's been gone.
Ladies does that make you cry?
Mona lisa's got to fly
Nobody really does
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence?
Right here.
God..
She's the original (yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable,(yeah, yeah)
She's wanted you to know (yeah)
She's been gone
It's kinda incredible (yeah, yeah)
She's so unpredictable (yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wanted you to know (yeah)
That she's home, that's she's home
She's the original (yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable,(yeah, yeah)
She's wanted you to know (yeah)
She's been gone
It's kinda incredible (yeah, yeah)
She's so unpredictable (yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wanted you to know (yeah)
That she's home, that's she's home</field>

I know you wanna get in my head
I'd rather get in yours instead
Boy you knock me off my feet
This girl bring the heat
Don't forget to paint the town
I know you wanna hear my sound
Don't try to be too tough
Don't take this out of context
But when it comes to being the best
There ain't no contest
You should know by now my name's synonymous
With all the hottest hits I keep them breathless
It's endless
Boy relentless
People pay me complements (you're so wonderful)
Boosting up my confidence
All it takes common sense
All it takes is money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
You know what they say about money
That it can't buy happiness
I just need to know
Is this real or just a dream
Hold myself in high esteem
Picky about the little things
Come full circle like a band of wedding rings
Continuing living in the life of lux
Life sometimes, I know it sucks (it's real shitty)
Boy I'm not asking much
People pay me compliments
Boosting up my confidence
All it takes is common sense
All it takes is money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
All I gotta say, I wanna be in love
I wanna run away to a place of
Fairy land of dreams, that is where I'll find
Everything I need to have a peace of mind, ow
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness

Who do I wanna be today?
If you came for a show
Which role should I take?
Fading to grey
So did we make a big mistake?
True colors'll show
Baby, just put me on display
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions
All these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body, but this mood ring
You change me, ah
Mood
I have no secrets
Cause there's a version of me
That I don't know how to hide
When you're making me glow
With your fingers against my thighs

Think I've been here before

I'm in the palm of your hand
My temperature is at your command
By my demand, and now I'm falling for you
I turn to golden from blue
And you do too, ah
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more
My love is a mood ring (My love is a mood ring)
Up and down emotions (Up and down emotions)

            <field name="lyrics">Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa can you hear me
I signed my letter that's sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, and just said this
I know exactly what I want this year
Santa can you hear me
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
And someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
I'll be on my own and I'll be thankful
Chorus
Santa can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is here
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa that's my only wish this year
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong, for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're comin' to town
Santa can you hear me
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh please make my wish come true
Santa can you hear me
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
And someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
We'll be all alone under the mistletoe
Santa can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is here
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa that's my only wish this year
I hope my letter reaches you in time
Bring me a love, I can call all mine
'Cause I have been so good this year
Happy alone, under the mistletoe
He's all I want and I'll be thankful
Santa can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is here
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa that's my only wish this year
(Oh Santa, can you hear me?)
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa that's my only wish this year

I really don't know the deal about my sister
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago before I won this fight

I have flown away
I have come alive

And the look in your eyes
Is longing to show me the way
I don't want to wait
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you
I don't wanna hear my time will come
When it feels like it's already here
We should learn to walk before we run
But why go anywhere when you're so near
'Cause when I reach out to you
So sad and confused
And feeling like I could cry
You dry my eyes
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
On and on and

So baby come with me and be my ooh la la
Baby come with me and be my ooh la la
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la</field>

The way you taste
You know I have an appetite
For sexy things
All you do is look at me
It's a disgrace
What's runnin' through my mind is you
Up in my face
Your voice is like music to my ears
Whisper softly and the world just disappears
Take me higher and just wipe away my fears
When you're with me
Oh boy, it's my heartbeat that I hear
Ooh, ooh baby
Touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips
I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby
In your arms I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love
That's the oxygen I need, yeah
You're fillin' me up
You're fillin' me up
You're fillin' me up
You're fillin' me up
You're fillin' me up
You're fillin' me up with your love
The more you move
The more I tense
It's like you got me hypnotised
I'm in a trance
Your jersey fits
It's right at home, between my hands
And now I hope you know
That I'm your biggest fan
Yeah, yeah
Your voice is like music to my ears
Whisper softly and the world just disappears
Take me higher and just wipe away my fears
When you're with me
Oh boy, it's my heartbeat that I hear
Ooh, ooh baby
Touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips

Oh baby, baby
Oops!...I did it again

Wishing that heroes,
They truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool
In so many ways
But to lose all my senses

"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean
in the end"
"Well baby, I went down and got it for you"

Oops!...I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby

Here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat
With mine
Softly you whisper
You're so sincere
How could our love
Be so blind
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side
(Chorus)
So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms
Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

Like you're my friend
And everything is O.K.
Then we shall begin
To put an end
To all the games that we play
My body's a temple
I'll choose who worships it
Let's keep it simple
No need for a big deal
So if you're ready
Just call me on the phone
I'll be here waiting
No need to be alone
Ouch, your heart, you're burning me up
Please don't stop, you're making me blush
Ouch, my God, you hit my spot
I just can't get enough of you, of you, of you, of you
So, say how you've been?
How's your girlfriend?
It's funny you're here with me
When you're still with her
And I do prefer
That we don't feel guilty
My body's a temple
I'll choose who worships it
Let's keep it simple
No need for a big deal
So if you're ready
And this is what I do
I'll take my time, baby
You used to use me too
Oh, you do
Ooh
Here we go
Ouch, don't stop, you're burning me up
Please don't stop, you're making me blush
Ouch, don't stop, you hit my spot
I just can't get enough of you, of you, of you, of you

I was used to do
I was your girlfriend
We were so true

You keep coming back to tell me
you're the one who could have been
and my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
I try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back
[Chorus]
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
So let me go
Just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And much darker every day
Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times
[Chorus]
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
And part of me still believes
When you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye
Forever
[Chorus][2x]
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without

Our love is here is to stay,
There'll always be a song about you
Forever and a day
There'll always be a song about you
I'll be your moon
I'll make it bright
And when it's dark I promise that you'll see the light

Do you like this?
This place that I'm bringing you to?
Because I do…
Oh my God….
[Verse 1]
I know this place
It's still a secret
And I don't think you've ever been
It's kinda hard
To find the entrance
You need some juice
But you'll love it once you get in
This special place it's in the basement
You have to work your way around
The place is hot and then it's pumping
So are you ready to go down?

So it's over to you now
So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you behave
You might be chosen
Just read it far
And it tells you how to get there
And when you come
You might be stunned
So baby whatchu waiting for?

So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it's over to you now

I'll let you lead the way now
'cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger though
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map</field>

I can't let go and I know
Don't know the way ahead of me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
I could hand over the keys, oh
I'll let you lead the way now
'cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger though
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map
So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and got no regret
Like a pilot yeah that's right
Now I can just enjoy the ride
I'll let you lead the way now
'cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger though
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map
And now we're finally falling
'Cause I was giving you half
Now I'm all in
My hands in the air while you're driving
This is living
This is living
This is living
Yeah
I'll let you lead the way now
'cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger though

Better make sure that the line is free

Would you prefer just like we were
Or shall I undress for you (what do you want me to do)
However may I pleasure you
Put the bubbles, warm you a bath
Lay back, relax, anything you ask
Let me release the stress for you
However may I pleasure you
You're so perfect that I get nervous
Tonight I'm at your service
I'm so unselfish
And though I'm helpless, whatever brings you pleasure
You're the reason I live
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I'll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you
Hey Britney
It's Don Philip
Any fantasy can occur
May be observed
Just say the word
I'll do it if you want me to
Whatever just to pleasure you
If you want to get off from that
Lay on your back, I got the max
Certainly I'll pull you through
Whatever just to pleasure you
You're so perfect that I get nervous
Tonight I'm at your service
I'm so unselfish
And though I'm helpless, whatever brings you pleasure
You're the reason I live
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasure's you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I'll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you
If I pleasure, together, whatever, whenever
Baby with you
And it's like, heaven, together, no matter, whatever
As long as you ask me to
You're the reason I live
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasure's you
And if it takes me all night

We're just so pretty!

Pretty girls
Jump the line
To the front
Do what we like
Get what we want
(Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty
Hey
Don't you know that it's always the same
From Australia 'round to La
You can betcha, wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keepin' them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Just you watch, they're so predicable
(some things don't change)
The girls roll up
Windows roll down
Eyes on us
Jaws on the ground
Watch them go
It's just so funny
Like bees to the honey!
All around the world
Pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks
Bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world
Pretty girls
Jump the line
To the front
Do what we like
Get what we want
We're just so pretty
Tell me
Is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be actin' bizarre?
Everytime I walk out of my house it's like "hey baby"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They're buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(some things don't change)
The girls roll up
Windows roll down
Eyes on us
Jaws on the ground
Watch them go
It's just so funny
Like bees to the honey!
All around the world
Pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks
Bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world
Pretty girls
Jump the line
To the front
Do what we like
Get what we want
We're just so pretty
If you ask me I'm killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy Iggy give 'em one more chance
But B's n Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See it took that line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist thick cake
The whole world want a piece
Bad girl good would make you lose your mind
While all the boys beggin' Britney hit 'em one more time
Iggz!
What's up Britney?
All around the world
Pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks
Bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world
Pretty girls
Jump the line
To the front
Do what we like
Get what we want
We're just so pretty</field>

Your eyes on mine
Sit you down, hop onto your pot of gold
You make me come alive
Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights
Dripping in smiles, they come on down
Take your seat now
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low
We don't need crowds, we just need us
Put my feelings up, about to be rough
All my tricks, they're spectacular
My encore is immaculate
Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights
Dripping in smiles, they come on down
Take your seat now
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low
Strut it out, strut it out, eyes on me (eyes on me)
Watch me strike a pose, feel my heat (feel my heat)
Spin around, spin around, three-sixty
Ain't no boundaries here, the camera speaks
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, some entertaining
Ooh, ooh
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low
Curtains are closing now
Guess that's the end
Can we go again?
Can we do it all again?
Nah, I'll take a bow
Up, down, run it ‘round
Tasting all my apple pie
Apple pie, satisfy</field>

I still see your coat hangin on the door
Never let anybody, put one there before
My pillows got your head printed it on it
Baby, of all the guys, you were my favorite (You we're
my favorite)
Don't ask, me why (Me why)
I just can't, say good-bye (Say good-bye)
No, not tonight (Tonight)
No, I just can't say it (Say it)

[Pre-chorus]
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah I'm gonna hold on
Baby, got to keep holdin' on to what we have
Cause I don't wanna move on, so we got to hold on
But baby, because you and me are sinkin' like
Quicksand (Like Quicksand)
[Chorus]
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) But baby, because-you and me are
sinkin' like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Baby, like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) But baby, because-you and me are
sinkin' like Quicksand
[Verse 2]
You came along, I didn't know love (Know love)
But now I know, but sometimes it's just not enough
(It's just not enough)
I hear your footsteps in my corridor, but it is just
my heart
It's pounding like before (It's pounding like before)
[Refrain]
Wish I, could try (Could try)
But I just can't, say good-bye (I just can't say
good-bye)
No not, tonight (Tonight)
No, I just can't say it (I just can't say it!)
[Pre-chorus]
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah I'm gonna hold on
Baby, got to keep holdin' on to what we have (Gotta
keep holdin' on to what we have)
Cause I don't wanna move on, so we got to hold on (So
we gotta hold on)
But baby, because you and me are sinkin' like
Quicksand (Sinkin' like Quicksand)
[Chorus]
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) But baby, because you and me are
sinkin' like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Baby, like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) But baby, because-you and me are
sinkin' like Quicksand
[Bridge]
Cause the ground is breaking, I can feel it shaking
Wish it was that easy, but it's not that easy
Gotta hold my hands out, gotta keep my head up
Gotta keep on breathin', baby even if we're sinkin'
Even if we're sinkin'
Baby, even if we're sinkin' (Sinkin')
Even if we are sinkin' (Sinkin')
Cause I just-just, gotta-gotta (I just-just,
gotta-gotta!)
Hold
[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah I'm gonna hold on
Baby, got to keep holdin' on, to what we have
Cause I don't wanna move on, so we got to hold on
(Hold on!)
But baby, because-you and me are skin' like Quicksand
(Gotta, gotta hold on)
[Verse 3]
We got it like we wanna, we don't even need to be so
strong
Only you and me, we need to hold on and hold on
Oh we got it like we wanna, we don't even need to be
so strong
Only you and me, we need to hold on and hold on
[Ad-libs]
Hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on (Baby, because-you and me are
sinkin' like Quicksand)
(Oh, oh, oh) And hold on (Hold on)
And hold on (And hold on)
And hold on (And hold on)
Baby, because you and me are sinkin' like Quicksand
(Hold on, and hold on)
And hold on (Hold on)
And hold on (And hold on)
And hold on (And hold on)
Baby, because-you and me are sinkin' like Quicksand

Yeah, I'ma just let y'all know somethin' like this
Yeah
(laughs)
Gonna break it down for all you girls out there.
You got your ass on your shoulders and you wonder why
nobody ever really wanna get down and hang with you.
(Uh, nobody really wants to get with you)
Cause ya only hang around with fake people that barely even
know you, kiss your ass, and love to agree with you.
(Agree with you, it's all in your mind)
You should take a look around when your down by yourself all
alone and you'll see who's standin' there next to you.
(No one but you)
No wonder why you up and change your number every time
you a blind bitch, you're cryin' and nobody gave a damn but you.
(Nobody gave a damn but you baby)
Yeah Yeah
So where did you get that game
You don't even know my name
So who do you think you are
You a wannabe rockstar (oh)
So get off of your own throne (get off your own throne baby)
Baby you'll be alone
By the time you hear this song
You a wannabe rockstar.
Xo No love I'm gonna give you
Xo Oh love I never knew you
Xo Know what, I never loved you (Nope)
Xo, xo, xo, xo
Xo No love I'm gonna give you (I can't give it to you)
Xo Oh love I never knew you (I never knew you)
Xo Know what, I never loved you (Nope)
Xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo
You call every minute of the day, every second of the hour
cause you're trying to come back but it's way too late.
(That's what you said, not me)
How's it feel all alone on your throne and the crowd
is gone and you're holdin' on.
(Why you wanna hold on baby?)
So i saw you at the bar with your head up high but you're
so down low and it's only cause you don't even know.
(You don't even know
It's so sad, you know?)
It's sad when people, they can't even recognize, that they don't have a clue.
(Don't have a clue)
You a wannabe rockstar
Xo, No love I'm gonna give you (yeah)
Xo, Oh love I never knew you (yeah)
Xo, Know what, I never loved you
Xo, xo, xo, xo, xo
Xo No love I'm gonna give you
Xo Oh love I never knew you (knew you)
Xo Know what, I never loved you
Xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo
I hate to break it to you
(i hate to break it to you)
But I'm not thinking 'bout you
(Nuh uh)
You're so wrapped up in you're boys, full of noise,
don't know, go ask all your boys then
(That's really sad)
You talk so much, but so what
Please won't you shut yourself up
(Shut the fuck up!)
So all my girls scream and shout
If you've got an xo
Get him right back
(You a wannabe rockstar)
Hey, Yeah, Yeah, Oh

Xo No love I'm gonna give you (Yeah)

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones

These hoes think they classy?
Well that's the class I'm skippin'
Got a party in my bedroom
That's a party she ain't missin'
I brought her by Will.i.am
But she kept callin' him William
Only God can judge me, case closed
I've got my hoes at Drake shows

Scream, and shout, and let it all out
I'll put it in her backyard like a fuckin' doghouse

Come closer, don't be shy
Cross my heart and hope to die
Keep a secret me and you
And seal it with a kiss
In the shadows where it's hot
You're the risk of getting caught
Wanna taste forbidden fruit
And seal it with a kiss
When you look at me, there is no mistaken
Like telepathy, I know what you're thinking
That you want me like that
(That you want me like that,
That you want me like that,
That you want me like that)
Ultraviolet light, burning hot like you do
Can we synchronize, meet me in the backroom
Cause I like it like that

But you are not
You give a little
Not A lot
You coup your love until we kiss
You're all I want but not like this
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here
Chorus
It's only your shadow
Never yourself
It's only your shadow
Nobody else
It's only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
and leaving too soon
Your body gives
But then holds back
The sun is bright?
The sky is black
Can only be another sign
I can not keep what isn't mine
You left, but still, linger on
But you, you were almost gone
Chorus
How can I tell you if you mean what you say?
You say it so loud but you sound far away
Maybe I had a just glimpse of your soul
Was that your shadow I saw on the wall
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here
Chorus x2
Oh
It's only your shadow</field>

If you think you're hurtin' you ain't seen nothin' yet
Was it really worth it?
Was she everything

Feel like a man
I hope you know that
You can't come back
'Cause all we had
Is broken like shattered glass
You're gonna see me in your dreams tonight
My face is gonna haunt you all the time
I promise that you gon' want me back
When your world falls apart like shattered glass
Glass, glass, glass...
Are you havin' trouble focusing throughout the day?
Do you find yourself still calling my name?
Do you wish you could rewind time and take it back?
I bet you realized that she ain't half the woman I am
Was it really worth it?
Was she everything

Feel like a man
I hope you know that

Boy, what's this I see?
Your girl, she looks just like me,
Blond hair and dressed to a T,
You tell me how can this be,
Does she know I was the one,
Who used to turn you on?
Yeah,
But you don't wanna talk about it
When you think you can find
Someone to fill my shoes
And you ask yourself why
she don't do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside
You know I'm one of a kind
(There'll never be another me)
Can't get me out of your mind
(You're lost in your own fantasy)
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me
Why can't you see it girl
Got no idenity
Whenever he's touching you
He's really thinking of me
Do you know I am the one
Who used to turn him on?
Yeah,
But you don't wanna talk about it
And the way you must feel
You've got to be confused
And you ask yourself why
You can't don't do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside
You know I'm one of a kind

Can't get me out of your mind
(You're lost in your own fantasy)
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me
Don't you think that she won't see through you
(Don't you think that she won't see through you)
But you don't wanna talk about it
(But you don't wanna talk about it)
You try so hard to do
The things I do
But you don't wanna think about it
You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind

Sometimes I just love to have that out
Just something a girl gotta do, oh
Never thought I'd see you like this
You're looking good when you're half dressed
Just let me give you one last test
Is that a sin? Am I too hot for you though ?
Did you check out my video ?
There's something you don't know ...
Like this
I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in when you are ready to play
Like this
Here comes the Showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up
Then we can make up
Check my body all night
Here comes the Showdown,oh
I don't really wanna be a tease
Would you undo my zipper, please
Uh uh, please don't talk...Listen
I'll let you touch me if you want
I see your body rise, rise
And when you come, don't get too hot
Butterfly
I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in when you are ready to play
Like this
CHORUS
Forget the tension
When we fight
We'll make it up
Turn down the lights
It's just a lover's game we play (yeah,aeh,aeh)
After the screamings at an end
Why don't we do it all again
That's when the fun really begins

All the boys like to ask me
What you doing with that
Yeah, if you say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man
I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me, one day he wants me not
I don't do chances, cause time isn't what I got
If he's like that
I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sitting round here waiting for a man
To tell me where the fuck my CV at
Where Mike Will at
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff, bangerz bangerz
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff
I can strut in my stuff, bangerz
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff
Fucking bangerz
I can strut in my stuff bangerz bangerz
I'm flying high upon the bird, acrophobia
My slick carder, I ain't down my purse
Where the dollars at
I let them know the rings two on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause if there's anybody violation I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with the big dog
All I need is milli's
When I got Billy on my speed dial
You know I'm that meow
Quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the corner
Make them nervous, call it too much
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff, bangerz bangerz
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff
I can strut in my stuff, bangerz
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff
Fucking bangerz
I can strut in my stuff bangerz bangerz
Play boss the play
Doctor get that big rose
Sit that on my hand
Make that media big talk
Play boss the play
Strike that boss with the purple
Got up in my brain
Had me a little bit dismal

But I don't feel wrong
I was tempted
And let myself lose
All control
This is Eve
I don't wanna leave
I'm sorry Adam
I ate the apple
I didn't walk away when I heard the rattle
I'm sorry Adam
Don't try to help me
You're gonna have to go and build the world without me
I'm sorry
I, I, I, I, I ate the apple, 'cause I
I, I, I, I ate the apple, 'cause I
I, I, I, I ate the apple
I'm sorry Adam
I'm sorry Adam
I woke up in the Garden of Eden
And it's changing everything I believe in
'Cause the grass is greener
And the trees are gold
I can't help it, no
'Cause it makes me feel so
Beautiful
This is Eve
I can't leave
I'm sorry Adam
I ate the apple
I didn't walk away when I heard the rattle
I'm sorry Adam
Don't try to help me
You're gonna have to go and build the world without me
I'm sorry
I, I, I, I, I ate the apple, 'cause I
I, I, I, I ate the apple, 'cause I
I, I, I, I ate the apple
I'm sorry Adam
I'm sorry Adam
I tasted extraordinary
Can't go back to ordinary
I tasted extraordinary
Can't go back to ordinary
I tasted extraordinary
Can't go back to ordinary
I'm sorry Adam
Ohh
This is Eve
I need to be free
I'm sorry Adam
I ate the apple
I didn't walk away when I heard the rattle
I'm sorry Adam
Don't try to help me
You're gonna have to go and build the world without me
I'm sorry
I, I, I, I, I ate the apple, 'cause I
I, I, I, I ate the apple, 'cause I
I, I, I, I ate the apple
I'm sorry Adam (I'm sorry Adam)

Transcending time and space
No other way I can describe
Instantly beautiful
Its almost mystical
Cause your mine
And I cant believe that I feel what I feel
Such a strange kind of real
Love is a state of grace
Between you and I
I...
Golden broken
I didn't know
One touch could open
my body and soul
And you've just begun
Like the moon and sun
We fade to one
Love is a state of grace
Transcending time and space
No other way I can describe
Instantly beautiful
Its almost mystical
Cause you're mine
And I cant believe that I feel what I feel
Such a strange kind of reall
Love is a state of grace
Between you and I
I...
And the way that we feel
Is a dream that we know is real
Love is a state of grace
Love is a state of grace
Love is a state of grace
Transcending time and space
No other way i can describe
instantly beautiful
Its almost mystical
Cause your mine
Cause your mine
Oh, love is a state of grace</field>

So far from home
Talking
But they don't know
Can't make sense of the signs
I thought I would die
Til you looked in my eyes
Til something changes
It's a different language
It's worth saying too much and get in the way of me
Talking the strangest love
Another night
Anywhere to go
Nothing
I've been here all alone
No one to show me
No one can hear me
Baby just tell me
Til something changes
It's a different language
It's worth saying too much and get in the way of me
Talking the strangest love
Til something changes
It's a different language
It's worth saying too much and get in the way of me
Talking the strangest love
I don't have to know what you're saying
I don't have to be afraid no more
Don't talk no more
They aren't the words
Til something changes
Til something changes
It's a different language
It's worth saying too much and get in the way of me
Talking the strangest love
Strangest love
Strangest love
Strangest love

You know what they say about mixing the races
And in the end we got the same faces
My mama told me got love yourself first
And if you disagree, get off this damn earth

I?m the big fish in the pond
And I?m fishing with a pole, t
they call me Silvers John Long
If that don?t excite ya and I?m talkin
way too much
Dial Nemo and you?re single Danja,
Britney and The Clutch
I see you fishing and you?re wishin that
I?d Just take the bait
You think the girls up in this club are all like
Fish in a tank
Keep throwin line out after line but
One by one they all sink
You?re off the hook
But your body I like
And I think I think
I might bite
Give it to me straight don?t make me wonder wonder
Now look me in my eye tell me there?s no other
Better reel me in don?t let the line break
I might take the bait tonight
Might take the bait tonight
Oh I-I
Might take the bait tonight
Oh I-I
Better reel me in don?t let the line break
I might take the bait tonight
I just might take the bait tonight
Reach out and grab me you can have me
If you wait long enough
I?ll just make circle around you if I don?t
See what I want
Most girls take anything you throw them
But I?m calling your bluff
I?m off the hook
But I?m worth the wait
If you want me that?s what it takes
You caught me boy and I?m a keeper
You play this right you just might keep her
Ain?t you getting tired of the fishing
You just don?t know what you been missing
Here it goes
Let me know</field>

K-kinda busy, k-kinda busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna

And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You shoulda made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think

Call when you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club and I'm sipping that bub

Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I shoulda left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station

Keep telling myself
Get out of my mind
The way he feels
He feels so right
Every night I feel the heat
I close my eyes and he comes to me
I confess I have done wrong
But in your eyes I see a guilt
I am guilty
Stress that keeps me strong
I feel it with all my heart is empty
Cause you're not with me
In my secret place
Where I drift the way
(CHORUS)
Tell me
am I sinner?
Tell me
am I wrong?
Something is wrong with the pictures
This is not my fault
So, am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?
Don't watch the truth and fault
Please don't try to see right through me
When do you touch me?
You will never know
Imagination starts to haunt me
It controls me
In my secret place
Where I drift the way

Friends say
I'm away
Because I'm down with you everyday
They say
Break away
I'm missing out on the fun and games
But you smile
And the words they tell me
Quickly disappear
You speak and there is no other
Voice that I can hear
(Chorus)
I spend my days
With you
I spend my nights
Thinkin' about you (2x)
You're so fine
On my mind
And I think about you
All the time
Day and night
Feels so right
And for us there is no end in sight
Each day that I spend around you
Passes by too fast
Each night
That I spend without you
Is longer than the last
Chorus
You know I can't get
enough of you
You know that 24 hours
won't ever, ever do

My dynamite stick known to drive shit crazy baby
I want you laying up in the bed with your feet up
Right there in my wife beater
She like the way I eat her, beat her, beat her
Treat her like an animal somebody call PETA
Put a little bit of this inside a margarita
Then put your thing have you running like a meter
On a cab in the city where the girls are pretty
Find me in the club where the girls get busy
With a flask on a fat booty, nice shaped titties
My wrist so froze
You could ice skate with it
Give it to you til you curl your toes
Get your ass out your clothes
Sit back for the whole explosion
Better make me tik tik tik tik tik tik boom
Tik tik tik tik tik tik
Better make me tik tik tik tik tik tik boom
Not too slow and not too quick
Baby make me tik tik boom
Tik tik tik tik tik tik boom

You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got till it's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Till it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got till it's gone

But they lie, can't confide me to a cage
In my mind, the life we had replays
Now everywhere I turn I see your face

            <field name="lyrics">It's written everywhere I've even read it in my script
But when I thought it wasn't fair I felt it on my lips, let go
I don't want to be the one you think you already know, oh...
The feeling of going down way to deep
And holding on so you won't lose your feet
Sometimes you just gotta trust you gotta take that leap and let go
Gotta let go...
I've got a feeling, by your look you're through, oh no
But your revealing I sit and pray and I will pull through
When you let go of all you've known
The butterflies fly and you will see the rainbows
And all the love, everything will be shown, so let go, let go
The touch of grass, the air, the sun it wiill rise
You will see so clear, it will bring tears to your eyes
Baby, everything will be alright, just let go, you gotta let go
I've got a feeling, by your look you're through, oh no
This little song might be the one that will tell us what to do
These tears are overflowing and never knowing why
All these years we've, we've been hurting
We have to looke inside and try, to let go
You gotta let go
To love, you gotta let go
If you really wanna love
You gotta let go</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in
"It is always nice to see you"
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
I'm pretending not to see them
Instead I pour the milk
Everybody's welcome, come on
Come on in
Sit yourself down
The fun does never end
Love is the blood that makes you wanna drink
'Til the morning after
I open up the paper
There's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope
And looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me
And so I raise my head</field>

I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I'm going to places I can be out of control
And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I'm tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly
I love myself it's not a sin
I can't control what's happening
CHORUS:
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

The small of my back and the arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticing the beautiful me
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait
I'm into myself in the most precious way
And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I'm tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds then I'll teach myself to fly
CHORUS:
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
There's a world undefined
In my body and mind
I won't be left behind
I'm already here
CHORUS(2x):
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand

A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from the devil's cup
Slowly it's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise
I'm addicted to you

Don't you know that you're toxic?
With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Intoxicate me now
With your loving now
I think I'm ready now

Britney, (break me off)
OHHHH Toy soldier (x4)
I'm out the door, its automatic, simple babe
I'm like a fire, bottle bustin in your face
So tired of you bein up in my space,
How much more can I take
I'm tired of privates drivin,
Need a general that ain't weak...
When I shut the door leaving with my bag,
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gonna wish he knew the type of fun I'm getting
into,
Peek a boo, he good doing things you wish you could,
He's not talking, he's just walking like them city boys from New York
This time I need a soldier,
A really bad ass soldier
That know how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier, I'm sick of toy soldiers
(I need ....i'm so sick of...toy soldiers...)
A boy that knows how to take care of me,
Won't be just coming over...
I don't want no more, (break me off)
OHHHH Toy soldier
I'm simply sick and tired of those...
I don't want no more,
I'm simply sick and tired of those...
I want it more than ever now,
I realized that they ain't listenin,
Like a princess supposed to get it
That's why I'm dustin off my fitted,
Coming back looking delicious,
Yes I know they wanna kiss me,
Now I hold them at attention,
Cuz new Britney's on a mission...
When I shut the door leaving with my bag,
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gonna wish he knew the type of fun I'm getting

Brit, I heard that he was saying he's still in love with you, and
Brit, I heard he said he could stay if he wanted to, and
Brit, I heard every man out here is wanting you now
Brit, I heard, I heard, what you gona do now?

Turn the light now, just the two of us
Like how you whisper in my ear
Your breath like ghost that disappear
Pull me close
Pull me close
Hold me tight, now
Need you more
Want you more
Feel so right now
Like how your hands feel me up and down
Like how your touch send me off the ground
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Baby, can't believe you were sent to me
Like a postcard, full my memory
You body feels like a fantasy
This moment it's all that I can see
Pull me close
Strip me down
Hold me tight, now
Need you more
Want you more
Feel so right now
Like how your hands never let me down
Like how your touch send me off the ground
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Trip to your eyes
Trip to your arms
Trip to your kiss
Trip to your lips
Trip to your tongue
Trip to your voice
Trip to your dark
Trip to your heart
Trip to your head
Trip to your chest
Trip to your breath
Trip to your skin
Trip to your sin
Trip to your touch
Trip to your tears
Trip to your heart
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart

And I'm the only making sure to stay
Out of your sight
Oh-oh
You know I can make your night

You got something that I like

Me and you, we're a disaster
And you're only a danger to me

You put my pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken
It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken
All my stars are coming undone
When you got me coming undone
Like all the damage to my heart
Is finally undone

Love, I can see
Nothing will be
Just like it was
Is that because
Baby, hear me you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to
Break my heart, I expect you to
So why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise I could get used to
Unusual you
Been so many things when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring, trying to defend myself
And the private eye to see what's going on
(That's long gone)
When I'm with you, I can just be myself
You're always where you say you will be
Shocking cuz I never knew love like this
Could exist
Tables are turning
My heart is soaring
You'll never let me down
Answer my call
Here after all
Never met anyone
Like you

Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to
Break my heart, I expect you to
So why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause

Can't believe that I
Almost didn't try

You got me tripping now I'm up on my feet
It's the vertigo (vertigo)
Vertigo, baby

Vogue, vogue, vogue

Look around everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go [look around]
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know [life that you know]
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so
Chorus
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music
[move to the music]
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow [go with the flow]
You know you can do it
All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for [that's what it's for]
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door [open up the door]
It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar, yes, that's what you are
you know it
Come on, vogue
Let your body groove to the music
[groove to the music]
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow [go with the flow]
You know you can do it
Beauty's where you find it
Not just where you bump and grind it
Soul is in the musical
That's where I feel so beautiful
Magical, life's a ball
So get up on the dance floor

Only you can make it all right
If I can be with you holding you tight
There won't be no more in my life
Every where I turn
I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Every time you smile
Angels cry
Every time you walk on by
I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by
(Every time you walk on by)
I keep my cool I pretend I'm not here
Every time you come too near
I'm such a fool 'cause, this love is true and
If I don't tell you someone else surely will
Every where I turn
I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Every time you smile
Angels cry
Every time you walk on by
I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by
(Feeling lonely)
If I ever see you again
This craziness must find an end
I look at you
I promise myself
I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by
I'm not the only

You should never try to change me,

I know you watch me when I'm dancin',
When I'm partying with my friends.
I can feel a rise in my back, baby.
I can't help the chains around me, baby can't you see,
I can be anything you dream of,

(First Chorus)
Oh what's going on
What's going on
Yeah what's going on
Ahh what's going on
Ja Rule:
What's going on in a world filled with pain
Where's the love for which we pray
What's going on
When our children can't play
Homeless can't eat
There's got to be a better way
What's going on
When we politically blind
Can't see the signs of endangered times
What's going on
Nelly Furtado:
Ah tell me
What's going on in the world today

Nelly:
What's going on 'cross seas
Every minute a child dies by this disease
In record numbers indeed
Got momma's crying out please
My baby hold on
My child ain't done nothing wrong
Still I want to holler
Ask them why they don't bother
Oh no, oh no
Make me turn to my father
And ask him why they all got a trapped soul
Nas:
I can feel what was bothering Marvin
Why his words forever remain
Dealing with these modern day problems
'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents
Too many infected
Too many lives diminishing
Nobody say Protestants, Jews, Blacks, and Whites, Latinos andAsians
Pray together
Less fight
We better unite
As genocide chemical war
And the rich and the poor
Know that God delivers a cure
Eve:
It's a shame our reality is devastating
People praying for a cure
Dying while they're waiting
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it
All the kids with dreams
Won't get the chance to chase it
Makes me sad
Think about the lives they would've had
Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads
How can we sit back and not try to make it right
We gotta come together
We gotta fight for life
Fred Durst:
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
We got human beings using humans for a bomb
But everyone wanna live
Don't nobody really want to die
You feeling me right
I can't be watching people die
(die)
And watching people cry
Let me break it down for a minute
If there's enough room here for you and me
There's plenty of room for some humanity
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on

Somebody tell me what's going on

Somebody tell me what's going on

With words so sweet
And I love the way with just one whisper
You tell me everything
And when you say those words
It's the sweetest thing I've ever heard
CHORUS:
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes say it
I love all the ways that you show me
You'll never leave
And the way your kisses, they always convince me
Your feelings run so deep
I love the things you say
And I love the love your touch conveys
Repeat CHORUS
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it, say it
And the words that say take my breath away
No song ever sounded so sweet
I love every word that they say to me
Repeat CHORUS
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside

Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night
To see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight
I never seem to win
I can't go on
As long as I believe
Can't let go
When I keep wondering
(Chorus:)
Where are you now?
What have you found?
Where is your heart
When I'm not around?
Where are you now?
You gotta let me know
Oh Baby, so I can let you go
I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me but yet so far away
I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity
But I can't go on
As long as I believe
Can't let go while I keep wondering
(Chorus)
Where are you now?
What have you found?
Where is your heart
When I'm not around?
(Tell me) where are you now?
You gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go
I should let it out
It's time to let you go
Oh baby, I just wanna know
(Chorus x2)
Where are you now?
What have you found?
Where is your heart
When I'm not around?
Where are you now?
You gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go
Where are you now?

Where is your heart
When I'm not around?

            <field name="lyrics">They couldn't believe I did it
But I was so committed
My life was so restricted for you
I just dove inside it blind
Couldn't see, but swam inside
Thought I'd be romantic for you
Exchanged my vows and said it all
Woman, lets prepare to fall
Even, screaming "dammit" for you
My friends said you would play me
But I just said they're crazy
While I was crying frantic, was it true
Chorus:
Why should I be sad, heaven knows
From the stupid freakin' things that you do
Or should I get back or sad, who knows
Just take it all as a sign that we're through
Goodbye!
Its time for me to move along
Goodbye!
Its time for me to get it on
OK!
I'm tired of singing sad songs
Alright!
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go!)
I sent you to Vegas
With a pocket full of paper
And with no ultimatums on you
I thought, "what could separate us"
But it just seemed that Vegas
Only brought the playa out of you
(Hey, baby, what's your name?)
Lavish homes and fancy cars
Even got the drop Ferrari
Filled up our garage for you
Made your choice with all the teams
People, Limos, Magazines
Tell us who'd I do that for? Who?
Chorus:
Why should I be sad, heaven knows
From the stupid freakin' things that you do
Or should I get back or sad, who knows
Just take it all as a sign that we're through
Goodbye!
Its time for me to move along
Goodbye!
Its time for me to get it on
OK!

Alright!

Goodbye!

Goodbye!

OK!

Alright!
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go!)
And dont you worry bout our angels
(All the magazines trying to analyze
Seeing things in the gossip section)
There'll get good guidance
And be trained well
Don't worry I'll keep a little secret
When I ask this question
Chorus:
Why should I be sad, heaven knows
From the stupid freakin' things that you do
Or should I get bad or sad, who knows
Just take it all as a sign that we're through
Goodbye!
Its time for me to move along
Goodbye!
Its time for me to get it on
OK!

Alright!

Where you from, how's it going?
I know you
Gotta clue, what you're doing?
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you
Gettin' more than just re-up
Baby, you
Got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer

Too bad for you
Just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard
It could be easy, who you are, that's just who you are baby

Must mistake me as a sucker
To think that I
Would be a victim not another
Say it, play it how you wanna

I was the game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came out of the night
Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best
Don't you know
Don't you know
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true
There's just you
You must have been heaven sent
Hearing me call
You were out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
Over him
All over
You've got it all over
All over
You've got it all over
Now, don't let him worry you so
What's a matter you
I let go
Oh you can surely see
You're so much more to me
Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best (yeah...)
Don't you know
Don't you know
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true (so true)
There's just you
You must have been heaven sent
Hearing me call
You went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not (all that he's not)
Just look what I've got (look what I've got)
'Cause you've got it all (you've got it all)
All over him
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true (so true)
There's just you
You must have been heaven sent

You went out on a limb (out on a limb
And you're all that he's not (all that he's not)

ladies and gentlemen
i've got a little story to tell

and how she suddenly fell
see
everyone knew her
they knew her oh so well
now i am taking over to release her from her spell
she's the original
she's unforgettable
she wants you to know she's been cloned
it's kind of incredible
she's so unpredictable
she wants you to know she's been cloned
she's been cloned
she's been cloned
she was taken under
drowning in her seat
running like an angel
she was crying and could not see
now see everyone's watching as she starts to fall
they want her to break down
there will be a legend of her fall. ladies
does that make you cry?
mona lisa's got to fly
nobody really does
everyone
may we have a moment of silence right here?

            <field name="lyrics">you might not believe it
but trust me this is true
you fall for their poison
and become a part of their crew
i'm in a rebellion
and i'm up against the truth
so will you join me?
or will you be taken too?
you'll find it in rebellion
your body starts breaking in
they're not believing what they're seeing
'cause you're rebellion
you'll find it so compelling
'cause everyone's yelling
'cause your soul you're not selling
'cause you're rebellion
be wary of others
the ones closest to you
the poison they feed you
and the voodoo that they do
but in rebellion there's a sparkle of truth
don't just stand there
do what you got to do
you'll find it in rebellion
you'll finally start breathing
they're not believing what they're seeing
'cause you're rebellion
you'll find it so compelling
with everyone yelling
'cause your soul you're not selling
'cause you're rebellion
the eye that is deceiving is the one trapping us in
i'm fighting a losing battle and my patience is wearing thin
but in rebellion there's a glimmer of light
and nobody claims the crown without some sacrifice
you'll find it in rebellion
you'll finally start breathing
they're not believing what they're seeing
'cause you're rebellion
you'll find it so compelling
'cause everyone's yelling
'cause your soul you're not selling
'cause you're rebellion</field>

i could handover the keys
i'll let you lead the way now

it's hard to jump with no net
but i've jumped and got no regret
my co-pilot yeah that's right

again and again
call me a fool
call me insane
but don't call it a day
closer to you
closer to pain

said you would be more problems than i'd ever know
said if he's gonna go then let him go away

i look up in my bed
i look up and there is your face
you love it

you know you want it bad
babe
i heard it in the streets
you got another girl
yes
it did sting
but didn't shatter my world
you should catch me now
when i'm in the fall of a state
you're probably thinking to yourself
this just aint me
on the contrary
i was your freak
hit me one more time
and trust me i'll be ok
hey
you love it

you know you want it bad
babe
now i will be a bad chick
if i rounded up my clothes
and headed over straight to the door
you wouldn't have a clue
of what you should do
if i left you laying longing for more
you'd be like baby don't go
baby
want some more?
you want some more?
baby don't go
said baby please listen
don't you just go
do you lick your lips?
when you stand alone
well you got no x-ray vision
staring through my clothes
are you sure that you're prepared
for what comes serves on its plate
wait a minute
oooh
i'm having second thoughts
see my hearts on fault
could you pass my shorts?
don't you got a girl?
till then
i'm sorry
you must wait
especially since i know
you love it
you love it
i'm so hooked on it
you want it

i'll make sure you eat every crumb off the plate
(i need to think about it
cause all your eyes are saying
that you wanna undress me)
she must not like to drink
cuz if i was her

6 foot 3 and too possessive

nothing's wrong with kissing me
drop the ball
that might change everything i thought about you
you should call this an affair
my kiss might hurt you

you showed the loving ways of how
a guy should treat a girl
the love you give that makes me breathe again
i've found someone who feels me
an understanding friend till the end
i know the future no one can see
but i feel deep in my heart
you will stay with me eternally
so just love me
even every day
and hold me in your arms now
please love the hurt away
i'll make it go away
yes i will
oh hurt away
i see heaven in your eyes
tell me why would he make you cry
and lie
he must have been out of his mind
i would never hurt you baby
don't let one fool turn you cold
you've got a heart of gold
heart of gold
i love everything about you
all i know is
every word i take it straight to you
a special part i give for everything i do
nobody else comes close to the love you give
body and soul
i'm gonna love you for as long as i live
and i know
it's not easy letting go
but i won't let you fall
together you and me
we've got it all
i just love you
more and more each day
i rest my head on your shoulder
please love the hurt away
love the hurt away
i know
i know the future no one can see
but i feel deep in my heart
you will stay with me eternally
i just love you
more and more each day
please love the hurt away
oh my love
love the hurt away
please love the hurt away</field>

it goes something like this
tangled up in you
uh
twisted like i've never been before
i don't know what you do
all i know is i want a little more
i don't care if the way that i act doesn't make much sense
when you're near
something in me reacts and there's no defense
i don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
all that matters is how this feels
i'm falling deeper
so fill up my cup
nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
i know i should
but it's so good
i'm never gonna give it up
'cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
oh
i wanna take you in
a velvet rush is running through mad veins
like adrenaline
a kiss from you and i'm going so insane
i don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
all that matters is how this feels
i'm falling deeper
so fill up my cup
nothing tastes sweeter than my love
i know i should
but it's so good
i'm never gonna give it up
'cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
i'm falling deeper
so fill up my cup
nothing tastes sweeter than mad love

Huh? Fly (woo)
I drink 'til I'm drunk (yeah) , smoke til I'm high (yeah)
Castle on the hill (well damn) , wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly
(you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know) , I know I'm super fly
The ladies love the luxury (yeah)
That's why they all fuck with me (woo)
Out here with the moves (yeesh) like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly
(you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know) , I know I'm super fly
Huh, huh, huh
I stay fresh as hell, take a pic, I might as well, hell
Drop the top and take a selfie, my car drives itself
I got white girls blushin', homie
college girls rushin' on me (woo)
All my diamonds custom so they clutchin'
and they touchin' on me
Ooh, pick his vegetables
Ooh, that kid's edible
Ooh, it's incredible
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I smell like Bond Number 9, nine
Section full of foreign dimes
Bitch is starin' at me sayin', "Wow"
Unforgettable like Nat King Cole
Gucci berry wine, don't sneak and tell your ho (well damn)
Her one night show, a human bank roll (whoa)
She lost in the sauce 'cause Gucci got the glow (huh)
I drink 'til I'm drunk (brra) , smoke 'til I'm high (it's Guc')
Castle on the hill (heh) , wake up in the sky (you won't)

Kodak, Kodak
Mine so fly, don't need no flight attendant
Big Cuban link, don't need no pendant
I ain't never had no pot to piss in, yeah
Now all my records trendin'
Oh my, I came from stealing bikes to flying on a G5
I don't know why I been smokin' this Cherry Pie so much
But this my life
I'm on adderall, I be smellin' Hi-Tec when I piss
Like it's basketball, I drop 50-pointer on my wrist
It's Lil Kodak take a pic
I came home to drop the heat
All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled
Cutlass sittin' high, I feel like I can fly
So fresh to death it's crazy, I feel like I can die
I done finally got my wings
they make me wanna sing (glee)
I drink 'til I'm drunk ('til I'm drunk)
Smoke 'til I'm high ('til I'm high)

A little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio,
But it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you
All that it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little
When I hear your name
And all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you
Flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man
My pride, my ego
My needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you
To walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up
The mess I made
And it haunts me
Every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Mm,too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you
Flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say
That I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably
Much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers,
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember
How much you loved to dance
Do all the things
I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things
I should've done
When I was your man</field>

Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her
She won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect is what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking
If you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while

Drop, drop it for me

Wake up with no jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the cadillac, girl
Let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like

Silk sheets and diamonds all white

Say the word and we go

Girl, I'll be on fleek, ah, mamicita
I will never make a promise
That I can't keep
I promise that you'll smile
And gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (is it you?) is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us)

Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like</field>

            <field name="lyrics">[Chorus- Bruno Mars] (B.o.B)
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted,
they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
[Verse 1- B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
[Bridge- Bruno Mars]
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering,
if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v
episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
[Chorus]
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted,
they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
[Verse 2- B.o.B]
Hands down, there will never be another one (nope)
I've been around, and I've never seen another one (never)
Because your style, I 'aint really got nothin' on
(nothing)
And you wild when you 'aint got nothin' on? (haha)
Baby you the whole package
Plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real, while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr
Fantastic
Stop- now think about it
[Bridge 2- Bruno Mars]
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
[Chorus]
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted,
they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
[Bridge 3- B.o.B]
Everywhere I go, I'm always hearing your name
And no matter where I'm at, girl you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane, or a car, or a train
No other girl's on my brain, and you the one to blame
[Chorus]
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted,
they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
[B.o.B]
Yeah (laughing)
And that's just how we do it (laughing)
And I'ma just let this ride
B.o.B

My neighbours think I'm crazy
But they don't understand

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the Moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talking to the moon?
I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back
(Chorus:)
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the Moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talking to the moon?
Ahh..
Ahh..
Ahh...
Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ahh..
Ahh..
Ahh...)
Oh oh ooh oooh
'Cause every night
I'm talking to the Moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talking to the moon?
Ohoooo...
I know you're somewhere out there

buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare
for when I'm a billionaire
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of everyday of Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this
And last but not least grant
somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months since I've single
So you can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than Fema did
Yeah can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare
for when I'm a billionaire
oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a Billionaire
oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a Billionaire
I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens, and
bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left
and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No don't be afraid to show it off
I'll be right here ready to hold you

Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
And keep you from walkin' out the door
Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same
If you walk away, everyday it will rain
Rain, rain-a-a-ain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Oooh if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin' there goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Oooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Yea for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right
Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same
If you walk away, everyday it will rain
Rain, rain-a-a-ain
Don't you say (don't you say)
Goodbye (goodbye)
Don't you say (don't you say)
Goodbye (goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right
Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies

Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on girl
Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

Say it now, say it now
Look what you doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you
I promise is a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla
You and me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas
Yeah I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling telling me daddy it's yours
'Cause you know how I like it
Use a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff
Call the swat we don't stop, we keep rocking
While they knocking on our door
And you're screaming give it to me baby
Give it to me m-therf-cker
Ohh look what you doing, look what you've done

I get lost in the words I say
Start believe in my own lies
Like everything will be ok

Thinking what else could go wrong
Would of stayed in bed,
How can the day be so long?
Never believed
That things happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubts so believe
that for you I'd do it
All over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again
For you...
I missed the first train
Stood out in the rain all day
Little did I know,
When I caught the next train
There you were to sweep me way
Guess that's what I waited for
Never believed
That things happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubts
so believe
that for you I'd do it
All over again
Do it all over again
All I went through it led me to you
So I'd do it all over again.
Who ever thought a day gone so wrong
Would turn out so lovely, Oh
I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing
Oh, I'd do it
I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again.
I'd do it all over again
(I'd do it all over, I'd do it all over...)
Do it all over again
(I'd do it all over for you, for you)
All I went through led me to you (Lead me to you)
So I'd do it all over again
Who ever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely
Who ever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so..
lovely, Yeah...</field>

You don't know how I feel
Cause I'm usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
Oh, I want you to know

But I can't hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Can't wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more
Oooh

Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Maybe I'm a fool for speaking up but I don't mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do
And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I'll change my ways I'll
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothin' to lose
I've got nothin' to lose
Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Girl when you smile
Not a place I'd rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you'll see that you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That's why I have to take this time baby to tell ya
Oh, and now you know
And now you know
Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do

I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes
They speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or injust
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?</field>

(Hey y'all, Bruno Mars)
That's what you taste like to me
(Love it when girls taste like milk chocolate,
White chocolate, dark chocolate)
And all I need is your sex to wash it down
(It all goes down the same way)
Uh come it girl right now
I'm a British boy, so I do British things
That nibble on your earlobe, but let your body sing
You're my violin and on a string
With every breath you take, I won't let it sting
So let me in, open the doors
What yours is mine, what mine is yours
Where's your pussy, give me your pours
And I'll mind if it's you going through my drawers
Keep it clean 'cause we gettin in the mess
Baby go yeah you're baring in the flesh
I heard from your friends that I'm better than your ex
And if I real that I'm better than your next
But noffy pie, you my sweet tart
That's one of the reasons that you're my sweet heart
So when I meet us, repeat fast
Why don't we just take it slow, so we love
Sugar, cocoa and honey
That's what you taste like to me
Now all I need is your sex to wash it down
Uh come it girl right now
The world is ours
Put your head back, see the stars
I like you just the way you are, like Bruno Mars
I know I can, call me Nas
I love your face, I love your ass
Now give me your flower, 'cause I'm a human vase
And I'm about to guide you, before I
I hope you think you can keep a secret before I ask
Oh no, oh no, you burning my tongue just like your cocoa
Oh no, oh no, I think you need some cream upon ya
You think I got a chick, what's her name?
I ain't lying, you're my man
You're the only picture inside my friend
Let's wash it down my sex, no champagne
Sugar, cocoa and honey
That's what you taste like to me
Now all I need is your sex to wash it down
Uh come it girl right now
Sugar, cocoa and honey
That's what you taste like to me
Now all I need is your sex to wash it down
Uh come it girl right now</field>

Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby
Everyday same old things
So you're still feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows,
All she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows,
All she knows
You've been livin this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one your looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see
Everyday same old things
So you're still feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows,
All she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows,
All she knows
All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends
She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows,
All she knows

Is not a question of love
'Cause our love has never changed
But all the little thinks keep pilling up
And life keeps getting in the way
Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More night of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss
Just let it go...
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before is out of our control
Lets stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes
Somethings we wont understand
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood
So lets just turn around and walk away
And hold on to what was good
Don't make it harder than it is

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare
for when I'm a billionaire
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of everyday of Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this
And last but not least grant
somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months since I've single
So you can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than Fema did
Yeah can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare
for when I'm a billionaire
oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a Billionaire
oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a Billionaire
I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens, and
bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left
and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing
[

You can travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
California gurls were unforgettable
Daisy dukes bikinis on top
Sun kissed skin, so hot, will melt your popsicle
California gurls, were undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce they got it on lock
West coast represent, now put your hands up
"Sex on the beach"
We got sand in our toes
They freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the stereo
You can travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us

Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles, c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like..
You won't come thru
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm goin' in circles, c-circles, for you!
I give you everything, but, it's not enough
You started being easy but lately you've made it rough
(for us)
You say you need me but then turn me away
Got me, oh so confused, should I leave or should I stay?
(Baby tell me what you want) A little more time
(Baby tell me what you need) Baby all your love
(How far you tryna go?) All the way
(Girl I just don't know) Make up your mind
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles, c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like..
You won't come thru

If I was broke i’d give you half of nothing
Or give it all then I give you more
I’m no decorator but the writing’s on the wall
Went to summer fall, April, May and June
You shot me through the heart but I don’t have a wound
You got a good aim cause I could’ve sworn I moved
When it comes to relationships I don’t have a clue
Love at first sight
I don’t know I zoom
You put a hit on me ba da bing ba da boom
If this is pain hurry up and let me suffer
What doesn’t kill me should make my love tougher
I’m tough now, whassup now
Fire at me I swear I won’t duck down
Wow, you had me in awe
You ain’t have to shoot girl you had me from your jaw

And we gon’ do it big although we just met
I was just being fresh yeah I know i’m a mess
But I like spontanuity, continuity
Let it flow let it flow just you with me
And I’m not pressing charges
Don’t want you to ricochet and hit another target
You take me to the edge, right up to the margin
All I see is fireworks I can feel it sparking
Hope you keep me at the center of your bullseye
And you know it’s more benefits or full time
You are everything and more
You ain’t have to shoot girl you had me from your draw

You shot me through the heart staring in your eyes

She wakes up in the morning, jumps in the shower
Then rubs on her lotion, while she's wrapped in a towel
And no music on, but she dance till perfection
I swear the bathroom's the club,
The ways she's showing love to her reflection
[pre-chorus]
Every morning I watch her from behind, but she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep, but I don't miss her show
[chorus]
My favorite of the day,
Is when she dance in mirror
Dance in the mirror
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror
Dance
Oeh she's so cute, cute, cute
Dancin' in there nude, nude, nude
Oooh
My favorite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
[verse 2]
It's late in the evening, we got dinner reservations
She's taking her time, but I don't mind waiting
I don't get impatient, cause when she gets naked
Oeh the temptation, oeh the temptation
You make me wanna cancel all of our plans
Keep you right where you stand, just wanna see you
Dance

Ooh here she comes
She's dancing with the stars
Living in the sky with diamonds
Ooh she's dancing with the stars
And oh how the lights are shining
She builds castles with white sand
The reflection in the mirror is her best friend
Ooh she's dancing with the stars

Keep dancing
You can't change her
cause she knows you think it's hard
That girl knows danger and she don't when to start

You feel like quitting, you feel you're through
Well I have some advice for you
Don't give up
Keep on trying
You're gonna make it
I ain't lying
Don't give up, don't ever quit
Try and try and you can do it
Don't give up, yeah
If you want to catch a ball
But you're having no luck at all
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose
It hits your belly, your chin and toes
Well, try and try and try again
Keep on trying and soon end
You put your hands out in the air
You'll catch the ball
Yes this I swear
Don't give up
Keep on going
You're on a boat,
So keep on rowing
Don't give up, don't ever stop
Try and try and you'll come out on top
Don't give up
You got yourself rollerskates
You put them on and you feel great
You stand up, then you fall,
Don't think you can skate at all
You get back up, then you trip,
You skip and tip and slip, and flip
You try and try and try some more
And soon you're skating across the floor
Don't give up, keep on moving,
You're gonna get there, just keep on grooving
Don't give up, don't pack it in
Try and try, and you'll win
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, no no
Don't give up!</field>

I used to go out of my mind tryna
Redefine the real meaning of love
I lost my dignity, forgot about me
I was so lost in us
I had to take on
Because you had me stuck in the middle of nowhere
And my faith it would shake
I know you're trying your best to take me
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way for far too long
Dream maker now it's taking your place
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait til you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
You used to be the man of my dreams
Only now it seems you were just a nightmare
But this little light of mine told me open my eyes
There's more than darkness out there
I'm not gonna run from ya,
Imma walk from ya,
I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya
And my faith is in place
In the night I no longer see your face!
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way for far too long
Dream maker now it's taking your place
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait til you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
Ooohhhhhhhhhh
From ashes to ashes and dust to us
Ooohhhh
I'm not gonna run from ya, imma walk from ya,
I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya
I'm not gonna run from ya, imma walk from ya,
I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya

Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way for far too long

Evil, why you keep knocking on my door?
(My door, door, door, door)
Lord knows I don't want you no more
(No more) no more (no more) no more!
I keep on trying do right
But you know just what I like!
This shit is wicked in these mean streets
I used to be a Grammy nigga, it was me and Millie
We used to hustle 24 7, money for my brother
More paper in a daily now I see in a week
And when Millie got knocked for his third crime
They sent him upstate, nigga still serving time
That's when I promised to myself I'll leave that life alone
Around the same time
I discovered microphones and beat machines
This way I ain't tryin' keep the clean
but I remember what it feels like
To my stomach so bad, you're even still right
Tried to get a deal
but they had the door to the game sealed tight
Temptation is a beast
I tried to be patient but that patience is deceased
Can you blame me?
Now I'm in the game G, and I ought to be lapsed
But now the homies calling me back and I be tryin' tell 'em
Chorus
Evil, why you keep knocking on my door?
(My door, door, door, door)
Lord knows I don't want you no more
(No more) no more (no more) no more!
I keep on trying do right
But you know just what I like!
Oh tell me evil, if you keep on knocking I'll lose my mind
Guess I let you win but it's the last time
(Last time) last time (last time) last time!
I keep on trying do right, but you know just what I like!
The music in the street Is cutthroat except
For the real hits I give him the utmost respect
For giving these quay in a shot
I try to live right but you know
a leopard never changes its spots
The reality is I'mma forever have the enemies
necessary mentality kid
It's the way that I miss, it's embedded in my mind
Sometimes I think about the life I left behind
or did I? (Evil)
Shit I never tell, but if I don't cut these corners
Man, you know I'll never sell
And I ain't even tryin' sell shit, I'm just tryin' prevail
But as hell tryin' sustain relevance
I just can't tell if it's gonna be worth it to me in the end
Then I think of my friend, Millie, he in the pin
They let the wrong nigga in the industry, for real
Scheming my way to the top but I be tryin' tell evil to chill
Chorus
Evil, why you keep knocking on my door?
(My door, door, door, door)
Lord knows I don't want you no more
(No more) no more (no more) no more!
I keep on trying do right
But you know just what I like!
Oh tell me evil, if you keep on knocking I'll lose my mind
Guess I let you win but it's the last time
(Last time) last time (last time) last time!
I keep on trying do right, but you know just what I like!

Do as to others as they would Do to you
Look at you now
I got you running (running)
Ohh Ohh Oh Oh
Ohh Ohh Oh Oh
I bet you thought that you could just get away with it
Tip toed in my life, break everything inside and not stay to fix it
But how foolish of you to think i was a fool
and played me like you did everyone else
I caught you cheating so you don't have an alibi
Don't try to prove otherwise cos evidence don't lie
I got phone bills, i got emails
case closed i got all the proof
How does it feel to know it's all coming back to you (you)
I'm sorry but you're guilty as charged
For breaking in and stealing my heart
You thought that you could just get away
But you picked the wrong girl to play
And look who's getchu on the run now (the run now)
You ain't got no where to hide
Baby i getchu on the run now (the run now)
You won't get away this time
Baby i getchu on the run
You looking over your shoulder cos you know they're coming for you
Every girl that you f*cked over is gonna expose the truth
That you're a lying, cheat
Something like a heart thief
that takes advantage and takes every girl for granted
But it's clear to me that you don't care and won't ever change
Don't care that all these broken hearts won't be the same
We know your secrets (we know your secrets),
We know your lies (we know your lies)
And now it's time for you to pay the price
How does it feel to know it's all coming back to you (you)
I'm sorry but you're guilty as charged
For breaking in and stealing my heart
You thought that you could just get away
But you picked the wrong girl to play
And look who's getchu on the run now (the run now)
You ain't got no where to hide
Baby i getchu on the run now (the run now)
You won't get away this time
Baby i getchu on the run
No matter where you go i'm gonna hunt you down
You're all alone and nobody's gonna help you up
Oh look at you (look at you)
Such a fool (such a fool)
You did it to yourself and now you're running (running)
I'm sorry but you're guilty as charged
For breaking in and stealing my heart
You thought that you could just get away
But you picked the wrong girl to play
And look who's getchu on the run now (the run now)
You ain't got no where to hide
Baby i getchu on the run now (the run now)
You won't get away this time
Baby i getchu on the run
I'm sorry but you're guilty as charged

And look who's getchu on the run now (the run now)
You ain't got no where to hide

Hold me close make it last
We knew this day would come
So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run
Wish we could run it off
But we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask
You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait, wait, wait, wait for you oh
Our phone calls will have to do
Write you letters just to prove
You're the only thing on my mind
I'm going
Just hold on I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side
But we can't stop time
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask
You know I wait for you

Holding hands wish I could be them
Lovers doing what we use to do
(but I'm stuck here alone)
That's the way it's been here lately
You're too busy now to save me
Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me
How do I always end up being the girl at the window
(window, window)
I tell myself
I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go
(you go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I...
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window
I know you're working that's why you're leaving
I will never argue your reasons
If this means that you believe in them
Oh time goes on and we're growing apart
Broken promises break my heart
Please don't give me a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me
How do I always end up being the girl at the window
(window, window)
I tell myself
I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go
(you go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I..
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window
How can I be what you're saying
When you keep turning all the pages
Am I suppose to believe your words are true
Don't take advantage of me
Cos you know I won't leave you
I make sure you know I always wanna see you
Whoa won't you do it for me too
Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window
(window, window)
I tell myself
I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go
(you go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I..
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)

You're just smiling telling me daddy it's yours

Use a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff
Call the swat we don't stop, we keep rocking
While they knocking on our door
And you're screaming give it to me baby
Give it to me m-therf-cker

You’re more like a hell’s angel
And for you, i’d rather sin

Die for you, and i’ll die smiling

I'm traveling without her somewhere far away
I keep thinking about her but I know I can't stay
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is
Everywhere
She doesn't leave me alone
I can't escape her or erase her
When I know she's not coming home
I can't understand where I went wrong
I can't understand where her love has gone
I don't know where I belong
My world is over
When life goes on (her world goes on)
And on and on (her world goes on)
When life goes on (her world goes on)
And on and on (my world is gone)
Am I crazy or just human
Is this what heartbreak is
What should I be doing
It feels like I got seconds to live
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is
Everywhere
She doesn't leave me alone
I can't escape her or erase her
When I know she's not coming home

Oh, I love you more today than yesterday,
But not as much as tomorrow.
I love you more today than yesterday,

Always be mine.
Be mine, be mine.
Why are you so sad?
I'll protect you forever.

Just be mine alone

And you shine like I shine
And all this sexy flirting
You know it's working
But even though you're cute
Please don't get it confused
'cause I'm miss independent
If you don't miss pretending
I'm not the one
If you don't want yourself to turn
I'm not the one
If you don't want that good good every night

So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah will find us
I know most girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me
Baby I, I wished we were seventeen

Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
And keep you from walkin' out the door
Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same
If you walk away, everyday it will rain
Rain, rain-a-a-ain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Oooh if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin' there goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Oooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Yea for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right
Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds

If you walk away, everyday it will rain
Rain, rain-a-a-ain
Don't you say (don't you say)
Goodbye (goodbye)
Don't you say (don't you say)

But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me
I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring at my gun
Click clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run
Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me
I warned you, I told you it would end this way

This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
[Eminem:]
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king?
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, just cock back with this still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell em shove it
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall said bust a leg
Muster cause he couldn't cut mustard mustered up nothing
Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, cause f-ck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me strength
So let em cause I came with 5'9' but I feel like I'm 6'8'
[Bruno Mars:]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see

A sky full of lighters
[Royce Da 5'9":]
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going
From buying 4 or 5 of the homies to iron man outtie
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried many tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right till he can march
Right into that post office and tell em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meooww, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Ya'll are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like ? Patrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossiping like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal and now
I'm the second best I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
[Bruno Mars:]
You and I know what it's like
To be kept down, forced to fight
But tonight we're alright
So hold up your light
Let it shine
Cause this one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters

Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
Me and my guitar tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna live on more than what I got
Cause '68 Citrus
Ain't gonna pay the rent so
I'll be out here til they call the cops
Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
[Damian Marley:]
Here comes Junior Gong, I'm flying high like superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I don't know if it's just because pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I woulda stand up to the cops
And stand up to the big guys, because de whole lot a dem saps
All de talk dem a talk and dem fly make no drop
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape the trap
Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow</field>

All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face every day
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, you're so far
This long distance is killing me
I wish that you were here with me

You're so far, this long distance is killing me

And the hours feel like days
While I'm away
You know right now I can't be home
But I'm coming home soon, coming home soon

It's getting hard to wait,
I'm trying to make her see,
That she don't really knows
That I'm trying to find a way,
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I...
I don't wanna be,
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Say the love for me,
I'm standing shaking ground,
And I'm been thinking that I'm gonna lose it,
(Chorus:)
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already caught.
Are you talking to me?
I'm already caught.
I wish that I could see,
But it's making you
Feel this should be.
My love is like gunshot
All it takes is a shot for me to blow it all away.
I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time,
It's gonna be with you and no one else.
Until you notice me,
I need to know right now
Cause I've been think it that I'm gonna lose it
(Chorus:)
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already caught.
Give me a chance to...
But girl you make me nervous,
By now you should have noticed me.
And what will it take it
To a heavenly...
You're driving me insane!
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
Shes got me..
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my weight
But I think she deal I'm already lost
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
Shes got me..
I'm losing my head

            <field name="lyrics">Now Hollywood wants to make you think
They know what love is
But I'm a tell you what true love is
Love is not what you see in the movies
It's not the ecstasy, it's not what you see in that scene
You know what I mean?
I'm telling you right now, true love is sacrifice
Love is thinking about others
Before you think about yourself
Love is selfless not selfish
Love is god and god is love
Love is when you lay down your life for another
Whether for your brother, your mother,
Your father or your sister
It's even laying down your life for your enemies,
That's unthinkable, but think about that
Love is true
Think
(chorus)
I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love
Love is patient, love is kind
It does not envy, it does not boast
It is not proud
Love is not rude, it is not self-seeking
It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs
You see love does not delight in evil
But rejoices with the truth
It always protects, always trusts,
Always hopes, it always perseveres
Love never fails
Love is everlasting
It's eternal, it goes on and on, it goes beyond time
Love is the only thing that will last when you die
But ask the question why?
Do you have love?
(chorus)
I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love
There is no greater love than this
Than he who lays down his life for his friends
Now are you willing to lay down your life for your friends?
You're probably willing to lay down your life
For your mother your father, or your best friends
But are you willing to lay down your life
For even those that hate you?
I'm going to tell you who did that
The definition of love is jesus christ
He is love
The nails in his hands, the thorns in his brow
Hanging on a cross for your sin my sins
That is love he died for you and me
While we still hated him
That is love
God is true love, and if you don't know this love
Now is the time to know, perfect love
(chorus)
I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love
I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love</field>

And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh
And when he comes there to it,
Can nobody come between our love
I know some girls like good boys,
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go
Ohh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'm a take you home even though
You're my mamas worst nightmare
He drinks his jack with no cola,
Cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything around that bottom yeah, turns me on
We live the good life,
Sleep all day and party all night long

Mamma don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown
And I fallen in love

With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But, you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it
Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love and disguise
I see the pain hitting in your pride
I see you not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the

Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm looking at the

You know you look even better
Than the way you did night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips
You know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know
To escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you
And I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free
Ohhh
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
I know, I was with you last night
But it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they know
That I'm not myself when you gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh
Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

When I am weak, it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I forget to close my eyes
And listen to my heart
With you, life is so easy
Why do I make it hard
Oh, taking roads that lead me no where,
How do I expect to get there
When will I learn to just put you first
I, I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong, cause only with you
Can I move on
I'll get out of my own way,
Let you have your way
Cause I realized I'm no good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you
I come to you now when I need you
Why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong,
With only you, only you, with only you
Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on</field>

Never wanna do this again
Long turn on a dusty road
I did it too much so I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good god I must've been blind
Cause she got me for everything,
Everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her door
Cause once I get my hands on her,
Imma ooohh
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there
Thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch
For this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for pretty little blank
Natalie, if you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run
The good lord better bless your soul
Cause I don't know already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, please please please
And now I look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh
Why is it that cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night
I spend your lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I do)
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
So there ain't no use in try
Once again my hands on you,
Imma oooh
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there
Thinking it's funny
Telling everyone that I'm taking my tension
From this golden complexion
Watch out she's quick
Look out for pretty little blank
Natalie, if you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run
I should've known better
Cause when we were together
She never said forever
I'm a fool that played her game
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there
Thinking it's funny
Telling everyone that I'm taking my tension
From this golden complexion
Watch out she's quick
Look out for pretty little blank
Natalie, if you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run</field>

Cause we got no time to lose
None of us are promised to see tomorrow
And what we do is ours to choose
Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It's only getting better if we want it to
But you know I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes, our eyes, never!
It's so hard to think this would fade away
But what goes up must come down
Why can't we just live life with no consequence
That no way living the now
Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you

When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I can always count on him oh
He taught me everything I know
And till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend
There was so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help
I wouldn't be
Where I am
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Oh never say you cant
Ohhh
So when lifes rain begins to fall
And you're out there on your own
And you can't see a thing
Oh no no
Just find that voice that understands
For me it was my old man
Taught me to say the words I can
Oh
There was so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help
I wouldn't be where I am
If my father didn't tell me to never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and they only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Everything you taught me will stay with me forever
No I won't forget a thing
Oh because of my dad I now know myself better
Oh I hope I can do for him what he did for me
I wouldnt be where I am
If my father didnt tell me
To never say I can't
Oh he'd carry
And never let me fall
Oh and they only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you cant
Oh never say you can't (x2)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">[Chorus- Bruno Mars] (B.o.B)
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted,
they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
[Verse 1- B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
[Bridge- Bruno Mars]
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering,
if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v
episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
[Chorus]
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted,
they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
[Verse 2- B.o.B]
Hands down, there will never be another one (nope)
I've been around, and I've never seen another one (never)
Because your style, I 'aint really got nothin' on
(nothing)
And you wild when you 'aint got nothin' on? (haha)
Baby you the whole package
Plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real, while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr
Fantastic
Stop- now think about it
[Bridge 2- Bruno Mars]
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
[Chorus]
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted,
they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
[Bridge 3- B.o.B]
Everywhere I go, I'm always hearing your name
And no matter where I'm at, girl you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane, or a car, or a train
No other girl's on my brain, and you the one to blame
[Chorus]
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted,
they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
[B.o.B]
Yeah (laughing)
And that's just how we do it (laughing)
And I'ma just let this ride

The ice is melting down your back
'Cause there's a flame between us
Girl with every single touch
Its like your body strikes a match
I'mma need to
Stop
Drop
And roll
'Cause baby girl your heat's out of control
Feels like I'm on fire, fire
My body's a hundred degrees
Every time you standing next to me
Feels like I'm on fire, fire
Girl you make me so hot
I don't want it to stop, no
Oh, you got me burning up,
burning up, burning up, oh
So turn it up, turn it up some more
Feels like I'm on fire, fire
My temperature is higher
I'm sweating with desire
Feels like I'm on fire
The smoke detector's going off
The neighbour's gonna make the call
The fire trucks are on their way
Now we're both turning red
We've been up and down the bed
We don't care so we say
I'mma need to
Stop
Drop
And roll
'Cause baby girl your heat's out of control
Feels like I'm on fire, fire
My body's a hundred degrees
Every time you standing next to me
Feels like I'm on fire, fire
Girl you make me so hot
I don't want it to stop, no
Oh, you got me burning up,
burning up, burning up, oh
So turn it up, turn it up some more
Feels like I'm on fire, fire

I'm sweating with desire
Feels like I'm on fire
Girl we got the house burning down
But ain't nobody gonna save us now
And I don't care who's knocking on the door
I'mma give you more, more, more
Feels like I'm on fire, fire
My body's a hundred degrees
Every time you standing next to me

Doing things I saId that I wouldn't do
It's 3 am and I'm rushing out the door to see you
(see you, see you, see you)
Waiting (waiting) all day (all day)
But now you wanna call me
Why do (why do)
You do this to me all the time
After all the things you put me through
Ooh still I come right back
But now I know the truth
I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely (lonely)
If I say I'm gonna leave
That's the only time you want me (want me)
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Had me fooled from the start
And I quickly gave my heart
Cos I love you, love you, love you
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl
With no one to touch you (touch you, touch you)
Now I'm stronger don't need you any longer
So get off your knees
Your words don't mean anything
After all the things you put me through
Ooh still I come right back
But now I know the truth
I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely (lonely)
If I say I'm gonna leave
That's the only time you want me (want me)
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
Oh nothing's ever changing
Decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself
And never me at all
If you're with your friend
You just leave me alone
But I won't allow it anymore
So it's stuck on me to move on
Cos I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely (lonely)
If I say I'm gonna leave
That's the only time you want me (want me)
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it

You only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

You only want me when you're lonely (lonely)
If I say I'm gonna leave

So you could just sit down and just sit still
Aye, we tryna have a good time tonight
Let's go over here!
It's my birthday
No it's not
But I still look good though
High comb hot
I bet you want an autograph
For you and your friends
Gotta do it in the penthouse
That's where I keep my pen
What you can't dance? Ain't got rhythm?
What you got a man? I don't see you with him
Put your phone down, let's get it
Forget your Instagram and your Twitter
Got me like woah, wait a minute
You need to take a minute
Loosen them shoulders up
Pour it up, let's work
Throw some perm on your attitude
Girl you gotta relax, ooh

And now we're here
The music's on,
We're feeling freaky (oh)
I want you in my bedroom,
You want me closer to you
What are we doing?
Let's get to it
I lay you down,
Take off your clothes,
And kiss your lips
It feels so good,
Ooh you're saying more
I wanna be inside you
Ooh girl you got that fire
I can't wait no longer I just gotta take control
The lights in the club are turning you on
Now girl let's pretend we both are alone
We'll finish this up when we get home
The only thing I need from you girl
Is to press your body,
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back now, let me feel your body
Just (press it, press it)
My favorite place is that space
between your legs and yours hips
Ooh, got me licking my lips, wanna get up on it
It's a special thing that we be doing
Feelin' bit bad boy, girl I'm doing
It ain't no secret 'bout what it is
Come on girl serve me the dish
The lights in the club are turning you on
Now girl let's pretend we both are alone
We'll finish this up when we get home
The only thing I need from you girl
Is to press your body,
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back now, let me feel your body
Just press your body,
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back now, let me feel your body
Just press
Girl you're the only thing that I see
So don't you take your body from me
And there's no other place I'd rather be
Oh girl there's something about your body, body, body
Ooh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good, the way you press your body on me
All I need from you
Is to press your body,
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back now, let me feel your body
Just press your body
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Girl there's something about your body, body, body
Oh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty

More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what do they know?
Cause years passed and we're still here today
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me
As i stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I mustve done something right
And i promise to love her for the rest of my life
Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flys when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait cause I finally found the one
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me
As i stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could i be so lucky
I mustve done something right
And i promise to love her for the rest of my life</field>

So easy to forget our love
The litlle things we do
Like callin' for no reason
Just to say the words
Baby, I love you.
I know lately I've been busy
But a second doesn't go by
Without you crossin' my mind.
It's been so long since we had time
Let's take a day and make everything right
Just take my hand
Fall in love with me again.
Let's runaway to the place where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated,
It only takes a day to change it.
What I have to say can't wait,
All I need is a day
So let's runaway...
Let's runaway...
Just for the day...
Runaway...runaway...
Girl, you've been so patient
Spendin' nights alone and not complainin'
But I'll make it up to you
And I promise today I won't keep waintin'.
Please give me this one chance
To remind you of everything we have
I won't give up, I'm too much in love
And I want you to know that.
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again...
Let's runaway to the place where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it...
What I have to say can't wait,
All I need is a day...
So let's runaway for the day,
And I'll give everything in this moment
And I promise to make everyday just like the day...
Let's runaway for the place where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day,
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it.
What I have to say, can't wait
All I need is a day
So let's runaway</field>

Well, look at here
Look at here
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thang
Ready for me to grab
But little does she know
That I'm a wolf
In sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding
I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me baby, baby
Please, don't go away
But when I play
I never stay
To every girl that I meet here
This is what I say
Run, run, runaway
Runaway baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away
Get away darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart
Will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So, you better run
Run, runaway
Runaway baby
Well, let me think, let me think
Ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies
That I'd like to pursue
Now even though they're eating
Out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot
And they all gotta share it
I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me baby, baby

It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
Little Ms
Perfect sitting at the train stop
Red Nike high-tops listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting started conversating
Before I got her name along came a train
Next stop Brooklyn
Now I'm lookin'
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
On the street kickin' rocks circling the same block
Green Farm, Flatbush, checking every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders askin' if they know her
Everyday's the same back to the train
Next stop Brooklyn
I'm still lookin'
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, I wonder if we'll meet again

For ruining your night so many times

And I don't wanna be like every other man that you had
So I'm stopping all these childish things
Girl you mean too much to me
Your love is worth too much to lose
Girl I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard
But watch how quick I change my ways starting today

You're tired of playing the kiss and make up game
And I apologize for the man I became

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free love me say hell yes

No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow

Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her
She won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing

Everything's been so nice
Wish I didn't have to go
Feeling sexy in the bentley
Touching me so gently
But I gotta get home
So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Oh boy just listen
Before we just go down this road
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you now
Ain't no rush so can you slow it down
Take me the long way home
I know that we pulling up
Circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we ride
Touch me while we ride
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we ride
Touch me while we ride
Just take me the long way home
Wish I could stay all night
But I can't tonight
Cause I gotta be up at 6 (am in the morning)
Boy you made my heart melt
When you undid my seatbelt
Told me to come give you a kiss
So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Oh boy just listen
Before we just go down this road
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you now
Ain't no rush so can you slow it down
Take me the long way home
I know that we pulling up
Circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we ride
Touch me while we ride
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we ride
Touch me while we ride
Just take me the long way home
Something about ya
wants me to drive all night all night all night long
I can't wait to see you the next time we on
Take me the long way home
Ain't trying to leave you now
Ain't no rush so can you slow it down
Take me the long way home
I know that we pulling up
Circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we ride
Touch me while we ride
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we there
Touch me while we there
Just take me the long way home
Just take me the long way home
Oooh oh oh oh

Just take me the long way home
Oooh oh oh oh
Kiss me while we ride
Touch me while we ride

Somewhere far away
I want you back
I want you back
My neighbours think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have
You're all I have
(Chorus:)
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the Moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talking to the moon?
I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back
(Chorus:)
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the Moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talking to the moon?
Ahh..
Ahh..
Ahh...
Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ahh..
Ahh..
Ahh...)
Oh oh ooh oooh
'Cause every night
I'm talking to the Moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talking to the moon?
Ohoooo...
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away</field>

Baby girl, what's hatnin'?
You and your ass invited
So gon' and get to clappin'
So pop it for a pimp
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a pimp
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in miami
Wake up with no jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the cadillac, girl
Let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like

Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl, I'll be on fleek, ah, mamicita
I will never make a promise
That I can't keep
I promise that you'll smile
And gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (is it you?) is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us)
And I'll agree, baby

Remember our first time, time, time, time, time, ta ta ta oooh
Let's let the music keep our bodies awake
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time
For the first time
Remember our first time, time, time, time, time, ta ta ta oooh
I think I might explode, this tension is so cold
And all this fighting between us is really getting old
We need a magic touch, before it all blows up
We've both had enough, we've both had enough
So let's just get away, go to that special place
Where we first met and on the floor
my feet were swept away
Baby it's worth a try, I beleive in you and I
Only takes just one night
Before we both give in, don't let it end
Let's fall in love again
I feel like dancing the night away
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time
For the first time
Remember our first time, time, time, time, time, ta ta ta oooh
Let's let the music keep our bodies awake
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time

Before we both give in, don't let it end
Let's fall in love again

I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the Tv on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
(Naahh)
I'll be lounging on a couch, just chillin in my snuggie
Click to Mtv so they can teach me how to Douggie,
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin man
Ooooh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can!

Do some P90x
Meet a really nice girl
Have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out this is great
(Oh my God, this is great)
Yeeaah
I might mess around
And get my college degree,
I bet my old man will be so proud of me.
But sorry paps you'll just have to wait

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no, ooooh

And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Yeah I'm a monster

And quite frankly
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside

Many have tried to go into the night
To cross over the line and come back alive

What she's all about
She plays like she's not messing around but I know
And there I go again
Falling for the same old type it just aint right
And there I go again
Such a sucker for a pretty smile every time
There I go again

See I've been trynna give her so much,
But everything I do is just not enough
Call me crazy but I think that she really cares so I know
And there I go again

Through changes, girl you got me contemplating
Dammn I feel like here I go again.

Seems like pain has been my only friend
My fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if I'd ever heal again
Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (ohh)
I will break these chains that bind me,
Happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin
I know I can make it, today my life begins
Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learnt how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win
Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (ohh)
I will break these chains that bind me,
Happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin
I know I can make it, today my life begins
Life's too short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past
And try to forget
Only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it
I will break these chains that bind me,
Happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin
I know I can make it, today my life begins
I will break these chains that bind me,
Happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins

Maybe if I jump or spread my wings

I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it
Tonight
Oh tonight
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Tonight
Tonight
Because impossible is possible tonight
[Verse 1: Johnny Angel]
Some 'bout the day
Some 'bout the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
With' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
Low like Kesha when she on the mic
Move on to another cause she wasn't treated right
I could relate to that boy Drizzy
How did I wind up right here with you
Sure you can achieve if you do believe
Gotta chase your dreams true reality
No fantasy enjoy it while you have it
Relax and take it in
I tell as your friend your friend to the end
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Johnny Angel]
Some 'bout the day
Some 'bout the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
With' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
We could get together like it's New Years Eve
Met a lotta girls but cute what I need
I live life fast...
Tryna hang on passenger...
I need a companion on this campaign
Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days
One life to live gotta be epic or be..
you can be my bella
[Chorus]</field>

I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after
Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Ooh, I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world
Baby, ain't no body gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye
Yeah, I'm still in love with you darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of us both being broken hearted?
I pray it's never too late
So tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl

And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

Girl won't you listen?
(Oh, don't you give up)
It's you that I'm missin'
(Oh, don't you give up)
Take my hand, I wanna go, I wanna go

If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
I know we're gonna make it
This is the chance, let's take it
Baby, ain't no body gonna love me like the way you do
(No, no, no, no)
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine

Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?

I'm trippin' out
Met in a crowded place
Expression on her face
The look in her eyes said she wanted me
So I played it cool
But inside I knew
If I'm in my move
Then heaven was just seconds away
Me and you touching, dancing, another way
Another world, another time
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
When I like you girl
Only you can chill my mind
Trippin' out
I'm trippin' out
Got me thinking 'bout your love, your love
I'm trippin' out
I'm trippin' out
Got me thinking 'bout your love, your love, your love
Time was standing still
Our destiny fulfilled
Just watching her body moving all night long
Then she took my hand
Instantly we danced
She knew by my actions that I wanted more
Me and you touching, dancing, another way
Another world, another time
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
When I let you go
Only you can chill my mind
Trippin' out
I'm trippin' out
Got me thinking 'bout your love, your love
I'm trippin' out
I'm trippin' out
Got me thinking 'bout your love, your love, your love
Got me hallucinating, anticipating, imagining (me and you...)
Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imagining (me and you, me and you)
Got me hallucinating, anticipating, imagining (me and you...)
Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imagining (me and you, me and you)
Me and you, me and you, me and you
I think about you, girl
I'm trippin' out

And I can't get in nothing.
Don't be alone, but intruiged by your charm.
I see you up under my arm.
What's my chances here on my odds

No rain you weather my storms.
You wear my heart as a charm

Like that, your games, from pleasure, comes a little pain
Don't bite your lips to explain
climax and I feel you rain.
This wet girl, this sex girl,
Nothing wrong with a little bit of sweat girl
Next time I see you as a threat girl.
Im gonna switch right on to the next girl.
All right all right all right,

Oh you make me feel so right so right so right so right.

I hope you didn't catch a tan,

Changed the colour of you hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay the fine?
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?

It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
Oh just gotta get through the day
It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
Oh I just gotta get through
The voices in my head (the voices in my head)
Keep saying she's coming back to you
Is it strange that I talk to myself
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Is it weird when I hear someone else
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
What do I do (what do I do)
There's no more you (there's no more you)
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh)
Voices in my head
Oh, oh, oh (oh oh oh oh oh oh)</field>

It's Gucci (it's Gucci)
Huh? Fly (woo)
I drink 'til I'm drunk (yeah) , smoke til I'm high (yeah)
Castle on the hill (well damn) , wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly
(you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know) , I know I'm super fly
The ladies love the luxury (yeah)
That's why they all fuck with me (woo)
Out here with the moves (yeesh) like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly
(you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know) , I know I'm super fly
Huh, huh, huh
I stay fresh as hell, take a pic, I might as well, hell
Drop the top and take a selfie, my car drives itself
I got white girls blushin', homie
college girls rushin' on me (woo)
All my diamonds custom so they clutchin'
and they touchin' on me
Ooh, pick his vegetables
Ooh, that kid's edible
Ooh, it's incredible
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I smell like Bond Number 9, nine
Section full of foreign dimes
Bitch is starin' at me sayin', "Wow"
Unforgettable like Nat King Cole
Gucci berry wine, don't sneak and tell your ho (well damn)
Her one night show, a human bank roll (whoa)
She lost in the sauce 'cause Gucci got the glow (huh)
I drink 'til I'm drunk (brra) , smoke 'til I'm high (it's Guc')
Castle on the hill (heh) , wake up in the sky (you won't)
You can't tell me I ain't fly
(you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know) , I know I'm super fly

You can't tell me I ain't fly

I know I'm super fly (I know) , I know I'm super fly
Now watch me fly, fly
Now watch me fly, fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly
Kodak, Kodak
Mine so fly, don't need no flight attendant
Big Cuban link, don't need no pendant
I ain't never had no pot to piss in, yeah
Now all my records trendin'
Oh my, I came from stealing bikes to flying on a G5
I don't know why I been smokin' this Cherry Pie so much
But this my life
I'm on adderall, I be smellin' Hi-Tec when I piss
Like it's basketball, I drop 50-pointer on my wrist
It's Lil Kodak take a pic
I came home to drop the heat
All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled
Cutlass sittin' high, I feel like I can fly
So fresh to death it's crazy, I feel like I can die
I done finally got my wings
they make me wanna sing (glee)
I drink 'til I'm drunk ('til I'm drunk)
Smoke 'til I'm high ('til I'm high)
Castle on the hill (ayy) , wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly
(you can't tell me I ain't fly, baby)
I know I'm super fly (I know it)
I know I'm super fly (I know it)
The ladies love in luxury, that's why they all fuck with me (ayy)
Out here with the moves like I invented smooth

Im just watching her move
She walks on in with her retros on
Her lips as bright as the sun
Her curves goes every which way
Got skin like porcelien
The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
(are you talking to me?)
The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
(are you talking to me?)
Her legs like a supermodel
She worn for them high heel boots
She got every single guy in the club just watching her move
And she dont wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club just watching her move
And she dont wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
Just watch her get it (get it...)
Just watch her move
She pulls me to the side
Tells me she wants to go
I say girl im yours tonight
After this im taking you home
First and for most I dance with you
Get you in the mood
Maybe later baby girl
I'll show you exactly how I do
She got every single guy in the club just watching her move
And she dont wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club just watching her move
And she dont wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
Just watch her get it (get it...)
Just watch her get it (get it...)
God baby
You look goood
You sexy
Watch her move
Watch her move
She got every single guy in the club just watching her move
And she dont wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club just watching her move

            <field name="lyrics">In this life, we are fighters
In a world where they try to divide us
Time's running out
We don't have forever
Unless we break down these walls
Stand together
There's no other way
There's no other way
Only the strong survive, the weak will perish off
If we stand together, then we can share it all
United we stand, and divided we fall
Unless we let the evil amendments guide us all
Birds falling from the sky as their wings failing
Sharks attacking boats and people parceling
Fish dying, 80% reifying
Salute to the survivers, I'm admiring
Condolences to the ones that tried to triumph
Respect the Wydef and his alliance
Man think they mastered science
Trying to rule the world,
But they got small things to a giant
Kids see the hood through the window
Fighting for their lifes,
Trying to seperate the woman from the kimbo
I'm a pitbull, fight till the death,
But my life is not simple
In this life, we are fighters
In a world where they try to divide us
Time's running out
We don't have forever
Unless we break down these walls
Stand together
There's no other way
There's no other way
There is no other way
No other way
You got to prove it
I'm gonna fight to the end
It's in my music I'm gonna fight
This is my exclusive
Arizona shooting, is that a big deal?
Cause every day in the ghetto somebody gets killed
It's been real, so what's beef?
Calstein, watch what you eat
Is Jay-Z a meson? Or like he said, is he just a mason?
Government persuasion, hip-hop is power,
Weak under invasion
I'm a fight for my fam, I'm a fight for the kids
To make them understand,
Before they praise the ice-top watch in their hand
The North Pole is melting, time is out their hand
No promise land, more global warming
More earthquakes, more tornados storming
More floods pooring
Wait till that place starts swalling
In this life, we are fighters
In a world where they try to divide us
Time's running out
We don't have forever
Unless we break down these walls
Stand together
There's no other way
There's no other way
There is no other way
No other way
You got to prove it
I'm gonna fight to the end
It's in my music I'm gonna fight
This is my exclusive
Some seek God, others point their finger
Jihad, war, speculations linger
Music is power, extortion is the ringer
Modern day mob killing Mexican singers
Is the world coming to an end,
Or is God giving us time to fight the peace within?
Men killing us, political sins
All for the love of a pittiful win
Greed in their skin, chasing their extra will
Hurting the economy
Look at the oil spilled, blood pressure builds
More rules are made,
While the poor leaders keep getting paid
In this life, we are fighters
In a world where they try to divide us
Time's running out
We don't have forever
Unless we break down these walls
Stand together
There's no other way
There's no other way
There is no other way
No other way
You got to prove it
I'm gonna fight to the end
It's in my music I'm gonna fight
This is my exclusive</field>

A little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio,
But it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you
All that it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little
When I hear your name
And all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you
Flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man
My pride, my ego
My needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you
To walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up
The mess I made
And it haunts me
Every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Mm,too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you
Flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say
That I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably
Much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers,
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember
How much you loved to dance
Do all the things
I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things
I should've done
When I was your man</field>

She made her body go down
Her physical was so crazy
She could make a blind man see
Ooh
Before then we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
Noo-whoa whoa whoa
If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before shes sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Where did she go
Where did she go
Where'd she go
Where'd she go
I've been looking for her all night

I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl

I must've seen her beauty at the bar
Under the strobe lights
Looking like a star
(looking like a star girl)
But everyone started rushing me
Looking through the crowd
Shawty left the scene oh!
Before then we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit

I've been looking for her all night
Club closing up I'm still looking for you
Walked up to the ladies room
No luck so I'm headed to the dj booth
Next thing I know she tell my show this ain't you
Looking at you you wanna take me home
So tonight I just might put you on
I'm looking for the girl

You use to look me in my eyes, but now you just look away

She watched me try

Oh, I still dream of simple life
Boy meets girl makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know
Yes, I know
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me
The death of me
Oh you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you
Come back to you
You, you, you
Yeah you, you, you
You, you, you
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me
The death of me
Oh you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you
Come back to you</field>

We don't care who sees

That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my n-ggas
Keep it player for this hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day,
watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on
and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your b-tch smokin' grade A
Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, it's gettin' kinda heavy,
relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front four blunts,
like "Khalifa put the weed in a J"
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, and now I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in here's gonna be
some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin everywhere we going
and now you know one when I step right up
Get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin you're down
Find out how to turn things around,
now things're looking up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up,
and round up and do my thing
Now I'm chillin, fresh out of class filling
Like I'm on my own
and I can probably own a building
Got..., no job, no children
Had the science project
Me and Mac kill it

Well nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt
To know this moment I owe
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (Yeah)
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)
Don't be afraid to catch feels (Ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (Straight up)
Feels with me (Woah)
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking
You gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had
You just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came in through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid about this (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Woah, woah, woah
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)
Don't be afraid, baby
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Woah, okay)

Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again

You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
I've been trying to make a change
And now my eyes are open
I need your love
I need your time

Stand still, fallin' away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?
I'm holdin' on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right, now I'm on the outside
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right, now I'm on the outside
Though you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you
I'm holdin'on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right, now I'm on the outside
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right, now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Show you what it feels like

We did everything right, now I'm on the outside</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing
And it's not enough
To tell me that you care
When we both know
The words are empty air
You give me nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet nothing</field>

That this couldn't get better baby
And your heart beat
It let's me know you feel the same
I can hold you
Keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worry
Cause I can give you what you need
Now everything I do
Is all for loving you
Is not something that we're used to
No other way to say
I need you everyday
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose
I'd do anything you want me to
Like any other day
I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone, you say
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you

I know that everything can change
And I know that
My life will never be the same
You're the only one that's making sense to me
When I close my eyes you're the one I see
There's no other way
I can ever be without you babe
Now everything I do
Is all for loving you
Is not something that we're used to
No other way to say
I need you everyday
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose

But I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss that day,
Are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day
You can see it from afar
We were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss that day,
Are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds

We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, or ignore the stars
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind

All this jewelry
Ain't no use when it's this dark
This my favorite part
We see the lights, they cut so far
It went too fast
We couldn't reach it with our arm
Wrist on the wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Player, we're still in lincoln park
It's like we could dye our own hair
Like we could dye it all blonde, hon'
If we could see in 20-20
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Put that spotlight on her face (spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (ah, yeah)
We gon' pipe up and turn up (pipe up)
We gon' light up and burn up (burn up)

Mama too hot like a furnace (furnace)
I got a hundred g's in my goyard (g's)
My diamonds gon' shine

You and I'll take a ride down the boulevard

And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord
[verse 3: offset]
(offset!) good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds
While I'm hoppin' out the spaceship
Need your information
Take vacation to malaysia
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle
While I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion
Twenty thousand paintings, picasso
Bitch'll be dippin'
Dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties
Diamonds dancin' like rick ricardo
She havin' it
When they call her workin' on the bachelor
I know you got a past
I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch I'm out of it

So everything is on me
Got them girls going Cyndi Lauper
Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk then you're in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy you're on the wrong beach
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass
Just bottles and I'm buying everybody one each
Yeah so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big 30
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life
Can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle
Yeah I was done with this thing getting it wrong
Then everything is alright
Got them girls going Heidi Klum
The Kardashians, Rihanna all types
If you ain't lean then you're in the wrong scene
If you ain't high then you're not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers
Or nothing just keep the bottles coming all night
Yeah so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big 30
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo we live, we die
We give, we try

I lost the feeling but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life I know now
I've been lying on the floor
Dreaming on the ground
I will give up everything in life I know how
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to perceive the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to to the sky
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you
Oh
When the moon was shining bright before morning
I made a deal with the stars to keep holding
Shining bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
The visions in my mind are enough
To keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down
The other way around
I don't want the words to
I can't make a sound
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to perceive the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to to the sky
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you
Can't hold back
Reachin' out

Between us
I told you that

            <field name="lyrics">Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do
Tried to search all through the world not well
But I can't find a girl that lives close like you
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed out on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front
You're a stone cold diva
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby</field>

Filling up the tub, what's the scent of the day now
Boy you can't resist it, boy you know you miss it

Where the afro shiny and the girls all purty
Where the white girl molly
And a dark-skinned Kylie, can I rock both bodies? Ayy
New 'Rari, how I ride, both shotty, uh
Keep your table, can we boogie on the floor?
I've been stressin' all week
tryna clear it through the door now
Ballin' like LeBron now, shots like a pro now
Hella weed, yeah, it goes 'round
Let me tell you how it goes down
I ain't drivin' when it's goin', now pour me another cup
This your favorite song on, don't tell me you in a rush
When I give you all I have, you tell me it ain't enough
I've been tryna clear our mind and wine and dine ya
See I know just how you like it, I'll back behind ya
If I look up at the stars, ain't hard to find ya, ayy

With your heartbeat pumpin' and your love keep comin'
Shake somethin', break somethin'

Sho' you right, motorbike, you could ride me overnight, uh

Diamonds shining, diamonds shinning

You tryna keep me like a checklist (uh, uh)
Slow whine, slow whine
Body cold like a necklace (uh, uh, uh)

Just let me give you keys to my life, and
Baby girl show me your vibe
Baby girl show me your light
Me need a lickle bit of your time, and
Just let me give you keys to my life, and
Baby girl show me your vibe
They control, on control</field>

I been keeping my eye on your movement
I can't see no room for improvement
Why you all over there on your jack jones?
You need to let me get behind your backbone
'Cause I'm the man for the job, let me work it
I won't waste no time, I'll make it worth it
One hundred percent, I'll make it worth it
You got a body to die for, let me merk it
Now it's murder on the dance floor
I wanna take this further than the dancefloor
I ain't forceful but I'm still hardcore
You're gonna give me everything I ask for
It's not a long ting, you're the boom ting
Maybe more than a hotel room ting
I'll never know if I just walk past
I really wanna dance so I guess I'll just ask
She ain't no hoe
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes
She's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance wiv me
If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date
Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar
Tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance wiv me
I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance wiv me
Yo, it goes on and on
I see you get excited like this is my song
You think I wanna get involved
You done nothin wrong
Cause I been waiting for this moment all night long
So I creep, creep creep back to your seat
I got my left eye checking out your scenery
I got my right eye right where it needs to be
Don't matter how I look at it
You look good to me
Still, I'm looking for the perfect view
The way I see it, that's right next to you
I know you've probably heard it before but still
I love it when you flex like that for real
So don't stop doing what you do when you do it
I just wanna be a part of it when you do it
I'll feel like a wally if I don't pursue it
And I can't go through it
So let's get to it
She ain't no hoe
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes
She's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance wiv me
I know you didn't come out to stand and stare
You bought new shoes and you did up your hair
You made a real effort tonight and it shows
I can tell by your face you don't wanna be alone
'Cause the mood is right and the time is now
And if you can't do it I'll show you how
All you gotta do is get loose, let go
Just throw a couple shapes
Put your skills on show, oh
If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date
Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar
Tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance wiv me
I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance wiv me
If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date
Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar
Tell your boyfriend hold your jar

With my skills our love was going okay.
Until the night when we were on the phone,
You're moving on and want better.

You running out of time
You lose your mind, you lose your fuckin' mind
You lose your mind, you lose your fuckin' mind
You close your eyes, you seeing dollar signs, dollar signs

I told you once ain't gotta tell you twice
If life's a game I'm throwing loaded dice
These other girls ain't really what ya like, what ya like
Feeling like running away
Stressing 'bout nothing all day
Money and hoes, come and they go
Let them go, fuck 'em away-ay
Everything ain't what it seems if it's all just a dream
I believe it, I believe it
People searching for answers

They say love is the answer

Love is something vicious
Still it isn't right
Seeing all them secrets in your eyes
Meet me in the middle, underneath the lights
You know I ain't got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no

So everything is on me
Got them girls going Cyndi Lauper
Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk then you're in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy you're on the wrong beach
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass
Just bottles and I'm buying everybody one each
Yeah so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big 30
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life
Can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle
Yeah I was done with this thing getting it wrong
Then everything is alright
Got them girls going Heidi Klum
The Kardashians, Rihanna all types
If you ain't lean then you're in the wrong scene
If you ain't high then you're not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers
Or nothing just keep the bottles coming all night
Yeah so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big 30
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time

The next top model, the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
The next top model, the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model

Break through from the other side
And lead me to Paradise
Cause nothing but love can take us away from here
Ever time I close my eyes, we disappear

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing
[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying
[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
(Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
(Fuck you, too)
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell
[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying
[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?

Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh
[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you holding me?
Why you holding me?
[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Oh, she killed that shit
She was killing it, that was hard, bruh
I didn't know she could get that high but she killed that

Well nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt
To know this moment I owe
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (Yeah)
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)
Don't be afraid to catch feels (Ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (Straight up)
Feels with me (Woah)
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking
You gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had
You just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came in through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid about this (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Woah, woah, woah
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)
Don't be afraid, baby

Before I knew what it was
I saw the pills on your table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)
Don't hide your emotion
You can throw down your guard
And freed from the notion
We can be who we are
You taught me something, yeah
That freedom is ours
It was you who taught me living is
Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness
I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet

And I don't smoke, but I love to drink
I'm paranoid, I don't miss a thing
But I'm still nice, at least that's what I think
Fall in love like I'm a freak
But then I pull out, and say
"I need freedom, I need freedom"
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
Baby, I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me
I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me
'Course you love me, you don't know me
But I got news for you, I came broken
Ego issues, my head is swollen
I got a million chips on my shoulder
But if you stick despite all I showed ya
Maybe you don't need freedom, freedom
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it

Go deeper, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real

And every time, I look out at my seat today
They chase, they flash they flash, yes
Tell me how you feel right now
'Cause all I wanna do is keep it real right now
I'm tryna beat it up, Beat Pills right now
Athletic in the sheets, I got skills right now
Break bread with some red baby hair
Ballin' in the club, Ace of Spades, yeah
Pop that bitch and spray it like 'Raid'
Yellow diamonds on you like a glass of lemonade
Qb, I'll throw it
Teeth white, Newports
I won't need, like shorts
80 thousand dollar Birkin bag in the Porsche
I'm tryna fuck with you 'til we on life support
I'll split it with you if we get half of Michael Jordan
No toilet tissue, I shit on niggas 'cause life is short (facts)
No passport to go with me, I had to get deported
Release, let go, and have a good time

Oh babe

Brand new chapter of a real you
She got every red bottom like a baboon
Hunnid' bottles in the club, real one room
Girl you gotta keep up with a boss move
King of the jungle, tycoon
Everybody thinking that's a cartoon
We just wanna party, way back in the war room
Do you want some? No I don't, son
Tryna watch me ballin', do you want money?
I'm just tryna turn up, tryna work something
Shawty suck the dick good, she wanna fuck it first
Hey mista, you a rat burn
Good hair down her back
Rich nigga, I like 'em ratchet
Fuck it up, throw it back
No shave, Brazilian wax

I guess there's nothing left to say

Getting in from here to china, getting in from here to China
From here to China x 4
Wind in my face, spinning in versace shades
Wearing a fresh pair of gaze
Looking i cough just been paid
Stupid i don't play no games
Switching out lanes on these lames
Switching out lanes and putting up planes
No i can't be contained
Plus i'm raw and untamed
I'm so far from my game, getting ghost is my aim
I suggest you do the same
Taking a trip out to spain, with my girl mary jane
And she stays on my brain, lots of big gravy train
Paparazzi on my case, even chase, …in my face
All up in my space, gotta pick up the pace
Singing amazing grace, i'm in an amazing place
With crazy peeps, i ain't lie,
Hoping for my brakes, making no mistakes
We just get on with it
You are constipated and your shit is overrated, you should save it
Getting in from here to China, getting in from here to china
Getting in from here to China, getting in from here to china

Look, open your eyes, déjà vu
In ways I knew my focus remains on you
I'm so true, I love that, 'cause who woulda knew?
LBC, me? Do what it do
Question: is your bath water ready for ya?
'Cause I could be the man for ya
Baby, are your bills paid?
Were those dinner reservations made?
The whistles, the bells, how 'bout your hair?
What about your nails?
See I can have it done for ya
Looks like I'm the one for ya
I'll crack the whip and get a little action in here, my dear
But first, relax a bit, the questions and answers are clear
[Chorus: John Legend]
A holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
(Takeoff!) Smile at you (smile) I got my eyes on you (eyes)
I wanna climb on you
Can I ride with you? (can I?) touch the sky with you? (phew)
A-huh-huh-huh-huh
Say the place and we go where you wanna go (where?)
She say Rodeo, I say I'm thinking 'bout Tokyo (Tokyo)
With the top gone, won't turn up the stereo (stereo)
Singing every word of my song that's on radio (aye)
I'ma roll one, I know that you don't smoke (I know)
Sit back, let your mind float (phew) never give up hope (no)
And if ya got a problem, let me know (let me know)
I try my best to keep you close
The life we in, no boss to match 'em on the ropes (ooh)
If I'm top ten, to win, I gotta be the GOAT (GOAT)
I feel like when I step in (what?)
gotta make an announcement
But y'all know (but y'all know)

Real deal, you can see it in my posture
I feel like Leo with a Oscar
The price just changed, no sour, it'll cost ya!
And I'm not an imposter
My style don't borrow or foster
My enemies will not prosper
Seems like every time they take a shot
They hit the crossbar
And I move like Neymar
Them boys ain't even on my radar
I do my own stunts, no saviour
That's why I gotta stunt so major
They say I go mad for the paper
I think I need a shrink and a tailor
But I do not think about failure
I'm a star, I should get my own trailer

I'm so legit
I do not slip, I just stick to the script
Fully equipped, there is no stopping me
I do not quit, I do not cip
Ready for action, I've gotta be physically fit
Sit-ups and burpees and dips
Gettin' a grip and it's making me physically sick
Somehow I still get a kick

            <field name="lyrics">Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old
Can find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold
You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
To next year
God I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone
If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
No?</field>

And everyone here make the same mistakes as me
And either way our time are go to waste
Our heart will never be the same again

I took a chance with your mind, I've come to play
I get the buzz from your girl, I buzz away
In my car, in my house and my babe today.
I never wanted to stand the loving game
I write your name on my hand to fan the flame
I look twice at your girl, we're not the same
And if we fight, you're the one to blame
But now suddenly, I don't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and the act like I don't know you
It's not good for me, I can't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and the act like I don't know you
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends

Woah
Lookin at your last text
Damn did you even really mean it?
Did you even look through it?
Did you even read it?
I been breakin up with girls since I was 15
It's the only thing that hasn't got easier
A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
God damn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm saying I got more liquor
More ladies, more drugs and no cases
Witch house and no babies
I hope no phone saving and if so you gon hate me
When you see me standing on the couches
Turning clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass but I hate that fucking outfit
I'm taking off her blouses while she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems to add
To the couples' counseling
Open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is
Let me see how big your mouth is
Goin' hard 'til I OD
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are old me
Wishin' they could X and O me
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off
On the ledge and we danglin' off
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off
Bartender, I call the shots
We call for shots, y'all call the cops
Sometimes drinks speak louder than words do
Body language speaks louder than verbal
We standing on the couches
Turning clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass but I hate that fucking outfit
I'm taking off her blouses while she taking off my trousers
Thats just a couple more problems to add
To the couples' counseling
Open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is
Let me see how big your mouth is
This goes out to, uh
You know who this goes out to

I remember when this world was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
Anymore
I lost the feeling but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life I know now
I've been lying on the floor
Dreaming on the ground
I will give up everything in life I know how
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to perceive the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to to the sky
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you
Oh
When the moon was shining bright before morning
I made a deal with the stars to keep holding
Shining bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
The visions in my mind are enough
To keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down
The other way around
I don't want the words to
I can't make a sound
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to perceive the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to to the sky
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you
Can't hold back
Reachin' out
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
Between us
I told you that
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment

Counterfeit, counterfeit
That's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this
And I make her bleed
Lick the blood stain from your finger
Say what do you see?
Remind you that whatever you get is
What you want it to be
You want it to be
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends get out the way!
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl
(and ask her to dance)
(Mary Pearce)
(Ouuw) I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
(Ouuw) I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
(Ouuw) I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
(Ouuw) I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend ...
(Calvin Harris)
Coming back coming back
To a place where, I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders
but I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror, reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view
You fall out of view!
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends get out the way!
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clappin our hands
We find the nearest girl
(and ask her to dance)
(Mary Pearce)
(Ouuw) I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
(Ouuw) I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I got anger in my chest
I got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85

L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci
(know what I'm sayin'?)
L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's pucci
(get what I'm sayin'?)
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
We deserve Grammys and some Oscars, damn
They deserve wammys, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe
[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up
I was in the parkin' lot when I rolled up

Ay yo, bring in the blunt, Emily Blunt
Platinum back, ice bling in the front
I'ma land the jump, Yao Mingin the dunk
And I'm playing the field, Brad Wingin the punt
I'ma tell him I love him in the foreign and cuff him
Whips in immigration, everything on them is custom
Now they calling me Billy, I'm the goat
No Achilles heel since I left Philly
Countin' them millis to billis
Beep beep beep beep, put the hurt on me
Yeah, I'm wearing jeans, but he put the skrt on me
Rode him to sleep, and then I put his shirt on me
Pussy clean, these niggas ain't got no dirt on me
Gotta play it by my rules or I swerve on him
Bout my cash money, you can ask Bird or Slim
Took him to my paradise, silk ribbon my linen
Now he got a big thing for Caribbean women

All this jewelry
Ain't no use when it's this dark
This my favorite part
We see the lights, they cut so far
It went too fast
We couldn't reach it with our arm
Wrist on the wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Player, we're still in lincoln park
It's like we could dye our own hair
Like we could dye it all blonde, hon'
If we could see in 20-20
Twice we could see it 'til the end
[verse 2: quavo]
Put that spotlight on her face (spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (ah, yeah)
We gon' pipe up and turn up (pipe up)
We gon' light up and burn up (burn up)
Mama too hot like a (like what?)
Mama too hot like a furnace (furnace)
I got a hundred g's in my goyard (g's)
My diamonds gon' shine
When the lights dark (shine)
You and I'll take a ride down the boulevard
(yeah)
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord
[verse 3: offset]
(offset!) good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds
While I'm hoppin' out the spaceship
Need your information
Take vacation to malaysia
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle
While I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion
Twenty thousand paintings, picasso
Bitch'll be dippin'
Dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties
Diamonds dancin' like rick ricardo
She havin' it
When they call her workin' on the bachelor
I know you got a past
I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch I'm out of it
[chorus: frank ocean]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
(I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes too clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
(I might)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes too clear
[outro: frank ocean]
I might empty my bank account (ooh)
And buy that boy a wooden pipe (ooh, yeah)
Buy that boy a wooden pipe
I might, I might (slide)
Empty my bank account (ooh, slide)
And buy that boy a wooden pipe (slide, yeah)
(do you slide on all your nights like this?)
Buy that boy a wooden pipe

Everybody, everybody slow down

Remember that night at your old house?
Remember that time that you broke down?
Saying that you're happy, that you dropped that chain
No I'm not, I'm the one to hold down
Champagne, I took all your clothes off
Champagne, 'cuz you called other girls off
And I'm making it high like a soldier
And you're making me take my clothes off
I'm still a kid and, I'm stealing your time
But I still feel your heart, so I'm asking
Could you just be real?
Don't be scared to feel this
We can make the world go still
Could you let me feel this?
You can risk it, but I'll be here
I can make your lonely disappear right
I could, could you just be real?
Could you just be real?
Ain't nobody home now
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody home now
Everybody be on that night life flow
When I exit the club, so they putting on a show now, no doubt
I ain't tryna move like a dummy
I'm tryna move real so you trust me
I'm tryna show you that other people try
But it's better when you touch me
Champagne, I took all your clothes off
Champagne, and I'm missing all my phone calls
Swimming in your bed like, be like
Fucking you a slow jam, I'm rocking your phone now
I'm still a kid and, I'm stealing your time
But I still feel your heart, so I'm asking
Could you just be real?
Don't be scared to feel this
We can make the world go still
Could you let me feel this?
You can risk it, but I'll be here
I can make your lonely disappear right
I could, could you just be real?

            <field name="lyrics">There’s a stillness in time
Which I cannot define
Does your heart bleed like mine?
(Oh does your heart, yeah)
For a place we can go
Where the troubles of our time are far away
(Hey they're so far awa-ay)
And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkness days are trouble-free
There are so many wondrous things for you to see
If you find that something’s going wrong
Look around at what you’re running from
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time
I found love in that way
And I’m never sad, and I’m always glad
Anything you give me today
I will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
'Cos they don’t know where they’re coming from
There was nothing left to do but hang on
For a stillness in time
(For a stillness in time
Search the spaces on my mind)
If this world is turning too fast for your head
Just remember how bad times can roll instead
Guess I'll have to search the spaces on my mind
For a stillness in time
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time
I found love in that way
And I'm never sad, and I'm always glad
Anything you give me today
I will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
'Cos they don't know where they're coming from
There was nothing let to do but hang on

And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

But I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss that day,
Are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day
You can see it from afar
We were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss that day,
Are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, or ignore the stars
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day

            <field name="lyrics">Must be the worst day of my life
Izza kizza
Girl
My first mistake was ltting you into my life
(Yes it was)
My second mistake
was allowing you into my bed
(Laying in my bed)
My third mistake was loving you more than I should
Oh, I really should know better
My fourth mistake was sitting with you,
While you're telling me that you can't do this anymore
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side
(My life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side
(My life)
I'm walking home and listening to MP3s
Just how did I let you decide to destroy me?
I'm missing you,
it crossed my mind that our heart will bleed
The love that I have left behind is gonna finish me
It's one of those days
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side
(My life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side
(My life)
See yesterday I called her back
The day before I called her flat
It ain't working, break my neck
Still it ain't cut me my cheque
A week ago I did my thang
Three o'clock, I missed my train
Tomorrow I thought we could chill
There won't be, yes, you won't, I will
The moral of the story like I told my cousin Corey
You see Cupid he will stab you in the back
like Jason Voorhees
So he's got smoking cigarettes and got me drinkin' 40s
And the doctor said take two,
and he said call me in the morning
It's the worst day
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side
(My life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side
(My life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life

Oooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend [Repeat x4] Coming back coming back To a place where, I never knew. Pushing knobs, pushing faders, But I, don't know what they do. This reflection in my mirror, reminds me of you. When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view. You get a feeling, that's what you choose. And I was told there was not a minute to lose So if you're waiting, jump out your skin To find a cure for whatever state your in I tell my good friends 'get out the way!' of all the lightning hitting the trees today?

I still feel your touch in my dream.
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why.
Without you it's hard to survive.
Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling.
And everytime we kiss I swear I can fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.
Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static.
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat slow
I can't let you go.
Want you in my life.
Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky.
They wipe away tears that I cry.
The good and the bad times, we've been trough them all.
You make me rise when I fall.
Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling.
And everytime we kiss I swear I can fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.
Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static.

This empty house, that don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry
Every once in a while even though goin on
With you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me
What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watchin you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seein that lovin you
Is what I was tryin to do
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you
Everywhere I go
But I'm doin it
It's hard to force that smile when I see
Our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder gettin up, gettin dressed,
Livin with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved
In my heart that I left unspoken
What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watchin you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seein that lovin you
Is what I was tryin to do
What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watchin you walk away
And never knowing, what could have been
And not seein that lovin you
Is what I was tryin to do

My stone heart was breaking
My love ran away
These moments I knew I would be someone else
My love turned around and I felt
Be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you in my life again
Won't you be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you again
No I don't need you again
You once made this promess
To stay by my side
But after some time you just push me aside
You never thought that a girl could be strong
Now I show you how to go on
Be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you in my life again
Won't you be my bad boy, be my man
Be my week-end lover

Let's get out on the floor
I like to move it
Come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical
Out of control
There's people watching me
I never miss a beat
Still the night, kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight
'Cause it's pulling you in
Pump it up, you can't stop
'Cause it feels like an overdose
(Feels like an overdose)
Evacuate the dancefloor
I'm infected by the sound
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey mister DJ let the music take me underground
(Everybody in the club)
Evacuate the dancefloor
I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey mister Dj come burn this place right down to the ground.

My body's aching
That's some overload
Temperature's rising
I'm about to explode
Watch me I'm intoxicated
Taking the show
It's got me hypnotized
Everybody step aside
Still the night, kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight
'Cause it's pulling you in
Pump it up, you can't stop
'Cause it feels lile an overdose
(feels like an overdose)
Evacuate the dancefloor
I'm infected by the sound
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey mister DJ let the music take me underground

Evacuate the dancefloor

Hey mister Dj come burn this place right down
to the ground.
Come on and evacuate
Feel the club is heating up
You wanna accelerate
Push it to the top
Come on and evacuate
Feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate
You don't have to be afraid
Now guess who's back with a brand new track?
They got everybody in the club going mad
So everybody in the back,
Get your back up on the wall and just shake that
thang
Go crazy
Yo lady
Yo baby
Let me see you work that thang
Drop it down low low
Let me see you take it to the dancefloor Yo

Cuz everytime we touch
Wake up with you next to me
I'm thinking how can this be
God it's true you blessing me, it's destiny,
Me and you were meant to be
The way I touch you
You know I love you
But I still put it down like a thug do
Know you like that
Yeah you like that
It's the love letter that I had to write back
Argue when you don't even fight back
Baby girl you put me on the right track
Not another person that I can see myself with
Know the way it sounds, sound kinda selfish, but
You don't wanna put me in this position
I'm wishin theres nothin in this relationship
That we missing (yea)
You don't know what you mean to me
Am I living in a fantasy (nah)
Just do well, girl how you make me feel
Me and you, we know the deal
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
Slow us down
Cuz you know that we hold this down
It's the hand that I reach and clutch
Lean on when I need that crutch
Baby girl yeah I know this much
Cuz cuz cuz everytime we touch
Cuz everytime we touch
I get this feeling
Everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side
Cuz everytime we touch
Everytime we touch and ride
People wanna front and lie
Duckinging high, lower your pride
Need you by my side girl
But when we kiss, you fly
G4 touchdown 745
Be-fore me and you were down to ride
Now it's at a point we gotta try so
We go out on the turn and caico
Somewhere converting dollars to peso
Lay low and we give kisses to besos
You get a feeling that's what you say so
Its d.o.
Whats the p.o.
If you love me why
You play for
I don't kno
This ring glow
Wanna put it on
I don't know
It's crazy when we get along
We ain't holding hands but I read your palm
Heart beat fast
I ain't feeling calm
Want this to last
Everlasting bond but
It's like a light switch on and off
Leave you in things so you could flause
What's the cost if you can feel me
I want you to turn around and you could tell me
Cuz everytime we touch
I get this feeling
Everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side
Cuz everytime we touch
Don't think cuz I'm a thug
That Imma hide my love
I know we gonna last
Cuz I need you boo
Everytime we touch
It's me and you
Don't think cuz I'm on dubs
That Imma hide my love
I know we gonna last
Cuz I need you boo
Everytime we touch
It's me and you
Cuz everytime we touch
I get this feeling
Everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side

I don't need no diamond rings, alibis no more.
Who do you think you are?
cuz once again you broke my heart
I know that love went just to far
it's hard to catch a falling star
but now I finally realize, your a brown eyed angel in disguise
just one step too far so tell me
honestly, who do you think you are?
you and I were on our way together
but this life passed bye, these days are gone
all the tears i've cried they thaught me nothing lasts forever
I been blind for just too long
cuz I don't need no diamond rings, alibis no more.
Who do you think you are?
cuz once again you broke my heart

Could you believe in love again?
How can I make you understand?
But this I promise you so true,
The summer belongs to you.
The summer belongs to you</field>

Everybody wants to know how I'm feeling
Everybody's [?]
I'm fed up recent time, just believe it
I am good here on my own
And you don't know what you've been missing
I'm not your stupid love affair
So you shut up and start to listen
'Cause I can feel it everywhere
Don't want you back for good (tried so hard)
Don't want you back for good
Don't want you back for good (tried so hard)
Don't want you back for good
Back, back for good
(Tried so hard)

Do you think I'm taken in by your drivel?
That one kiss can change the world?
What you think about love gives me shivers
Boy, you've got your vision blurred
And you don't know what you've been missing
I'm not your stupid love affair
So you shut up and start to listen
'Cause I can feel it everywhere
Don't want you back for good (tried so hard)

When everything surrounding me
Is nothing but a fake disguise
I don't know,
I don't know where I belong
It's time for me to carry on
I'll say goodbye
I can't stop the rain from fallin'
I'm drownin in these tears I cry
Since you left without a warning
I face the dawn with sleepless eyes
No I can't go on
When clouds are pushin' down on me, boy
I can't stop, I can't stop the rain
From fallin
So, tell me where I went wrong
I'm stuck inside a dream long gone
It's hard to reveal the truth
Your love,
Is nothing but a bitter taste
It's better if I walk away,
Away from you
I can't stop the rain from fallin'
Im drownin in these tears I cry
Since you left without a warning
I face the dawn with sleepless eyes
No I can't go on
When clouds are pushin' down on me, boy
I can't stop, I can't stop the rain
From fallin</field>

            <field name="lyrics">He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on tv, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up mtv
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does her pretty face see what's he's worth
He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does her pretty face see what's he's worth
Sorry girl, but you missed out
Well tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?
I'm with the skater boy, I said see you later boy
I'll be the backstage after the show
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know
I'm with the skater boy, I said see you later boy
I'll be the backstage after the show
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know</field>

            <field name="lyrics">What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Everytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes
So I don't say a word
'Cause she already knows
That she's my better half
That's what she'd better know
She always tells me yes
She never tells me no
If I went, they'd hold me back
She's telling me to go
So I don't need the world
Pulling up on my throat
I just need my girl
Believing my every quote
Telling me I can fly
So I don't need to float
That's why I walk on water
If she inside a boat
Go weather the storm
And cover every slope
Together we're forever
So I won't ever hope
That she'll be mine forever
'Cause I already know
That what we have is magic
'Cause she my pedestal
And I can reach the sky
If I don't let her go
So all I do is climb
'Cause I will never fall
No I'll never fail
'Cause with her
I will throw every ball
And though I never say a word
My love's already spoke
What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes
It's unspoken
I give her everything
'Cause what she is to me
Is more than anything
So I ain't scared to let her breathe
'Cause when you love somebody
You gotta let them be
That's why I let her fly
And she come back to me
Like Cinderella
She's my umbrella in every storm
She's picture perfect
So I'll protect her through every war
Through every summer
Or every winter or every fall
I spring through fire to get her
Smashing through every wall
All just for the love
That she has give me
And more to show the love
That I am giving she
So ya'll better forgive me
For my wicked dream
I did it all
In the name of love repeatedly
'Cause I remember every time
That she's forgiven me
And I'll be by her side
Until the Lord delivers me
And then delivers she
'Cause I don't wanna be
In hell, earth or even heaven
If she ain't there with me
What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes
'Cause I remember every time
That she's forgiven me
And I'll be by her side
Until the Lord delivers me
And then delivers she
'Cause I don't wanna be
In hell, earth or even heaven
If she ain't there with me
What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes
It's unspoken</field>

What can we do now?

What are we doing here?
Now life is hunting us into the wrong
Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
(Faces in the sun)
Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
Living on
This world is yours and mine
You gotta take a step across the line
We're going back to the start
I'm about to blow my mind
Watch me as I'm longing to feel alive

Well I tossed a lot o' nickels in a wishing well
And saved the fortunes that the fortune cookies tell
I've got a lucky penny and a mustard seed
But a warm and tender love is all I need
And I want a love that lingers
And is stronger through and through

But times been healing me and I say goodbye
Cause I can breathe again dream again
I'll be on the road again
Like it used to be the other day
Now i feel free again so innocent
Cause someone makes me whole again for sure
I'll find another you
Could you imagine someone else is By my side
I've been afraid he couldn't keep myself from falling
My heart was always searching for a place to hide
Couldn't to wait to done to bring another day
You're not the only one so hear me when I say
The thoughts of you they just fade away
Cause I can breathe again dream again
I'll be on the road again

I'll find another you
Sometimes I see you when I close my eyes

Your words don't mean a thing
Blah blah blah
Why the masquerade?
You think you're funny but you never entertain
Ha ha-ha ha-ha
I'll never be your appetiser melting on your tongue
Here's the simple truth boy you just don't turn me on
So you think you're something special oh-oh-oh
And you claim to be the next best movie star
So superficial oh-oh-oh
I don't buy your show
Au revoir
Bye bye bye
Au-au-au-au-au-au revoir
Au revoir
Bye bye bye
Au-au-au-au-au-au revoir
Au revoir
Always centre stage
Not ashamed to say
You're fishing for the fame
Ah ah-ah ah-ah
Boy you're not a saint
Not irresistible in any kinda way
Ah ah-ah ah-ah
I'll never be your appetiser melting on your tongue
Here's the simple truth boy you just don't turn me on
So you think you're something special oh-oh-oh
And you claim to be the next best movie star
So superficial oh-oh-oh
I don't buy your show
Au revoir
Let's keep it confidential oh-oh-oh
Boy you wanna show the world how cool you are
No no potential oh-oh-oh
I don't buy your show
Boy, you're not breaking the ice
Hey, stop telling me lies
You're not one of a kind
Hey, stop telling me lies
Au revoir

No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky
Look down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Be near me Lord Jesus
I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray
Bless all the dear children
In thy tender care
And take us to Heaven
To live with thee there
The cattle are lowing
The poor baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes
I love you Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side
Til morning is nigh
Be near me Lord Jesus
I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray
Bless all the dear children
In thy tender care
And take us to Heaven
To live with thee there
Be near me Lord Jesus
I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray
Bless all the dear children
In thy tender care
And take us to Heaven
To live with thee there
To live with thee there
To live with thee there</field>

Everybody wants to know how I'm feeling
Everybody's [?]
I'm fed up recent time, just believe it
I am good here on my own
And you don't know what you've been missing
I'm not your stupid love affair
So you shut up and start to listen
'Cause I can feel it everywhere
Don't want you back for good (tried so hard)
Don't want you back for good
Don't want you back for good (tried so hard)
Don't want you back for good
Back, back for good

Do you think I'm taken in by your drivel?
That one kiss can change the world?
What you think about love gives me shivers
Boy, you've got your vision blurred
And you don't know what you've been missing
I'm not your stupid love affair
So you shut up and start to listen
'Cause I can feel it everywhere
Don't want you back for good (tried so hard)

My stone heart was breaking
My love ran away
These moments I knew I would be someone else

Be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you in my life again
Won't you be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you again
No I don't need you again
You once made this promess
To stay by my side
But after some time you just push me aside
You never thought that a girl could be strong
Now I show you how to go on
Be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you in my life again
Won't you be my bad boy, be my man
Be my week-end lover
But don't be my friend

Have I doubt, baby, when Im alone
Love is a ring on the telephone
Love is an angel, disguised as lust
Here in our bed til the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, and the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now
Can't touch you now

I don't need this to end to understand
That I'm gonna miss it, gonna miss it
I can't believe how the minutes keep passing us by
Better live my life
Here in the moment just own it and don't think twice

No, I don't wanna blink

Your eyes are pretty when you look sad
Nothing's like a salty kiss
Tasting the tears, the tears on your lips
We always forgive and forget
It's funny how we feel no regret
Cats and dogs and black and white
Picking a fight, we're feeling alright
We should break up
Cuz baby I love when we kiss and make up
We should break up
Cuz baby I love when we kiss and make up
We should break up
Cuz baby I love when we kiss and make up
We should break up
Cuz baby I love when we kiss and make up
Break up
We should break up
C'mon baby let it all out
It's easy to get caught in a roundabout
Better to let off the steam
Than blow in the fuse if you know what I mean
We should break up
Cuz baby I love when we kiss and make up
We should break up
Cuz baby I love when we kiss and make up
I know we're two of a kind
I know we'll get through the bump in the ride
And how I don't care if we build it up just to tear it down
We should break up
Cuz baby I love when we kiss and make up
We should break up
Cuz baby I love when we kiss and make up
Break up

Another endless night
Heart's brake
And nearly morning light, yeah
I take my time
Downtown
Alone some boy at home
I don't know
What's really going on, yeah
I take my time
But I'm the all I know
It feels so right
I feel I'm going crazy
But I won't cry tonight
Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't turn away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now I know
I never meant to break up
I promess
I never meant to say goodbye
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
If I could start it all again
I'd know you're more than just a friend, yeah
I turn my time
But I'm the all I know
It feels so right
I feel I'm going crazy
But I won't cry tonight
Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now I know
I never meant to break up
I promess
I never meant to say goodbye
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now take my hand
Let's break the way
Don't stop, don't be afraid
'Cause I know ('cause I know)
We'll be forever
Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now I know

No I can't go on
When clouds are pushin' down on me, boy
I can't stop, I can't stop the rain
From fallin
So, tell me where I went wrong
I'm stuck inside a dream long gone
It's hard to reveal the truth
Your love,
Is nothing but a bitter taste
It's better if I walk away,
Away from you
I can't stop the rain from fallin'
Im drownin in these tears I cry

No I can't go on

I never dare to ask me who could I be
Who can bring back the love that's inside me
Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could it be you
Or do I break away
So leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true I don't have a clue
Could it be you
Too many things said and done
Sure if you could be the one
To dry the tears I left behind
To chase these demons off my mind
I see your face
Touch your skin
Is this a fight
We both can't win
Sometimes the truth is miles apart
But it's hard to break your heart
Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could it be you
Or do I break away
So leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true I don't have a clue
Could it be you
Baby I don't wanna waste your love
Though it's hard to just walk on
Well will this hurt be neverending
Where do I belong
Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could it be you
Or do I break away
Just to leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true I don't have a clue
Could it be you
Maybe it is me
Used to plan to see that it's you
For everything I am everything I need lies in you</field>

No doubt, I wanna be your lover

It tells me everything is wrong, maybe
I lost my dreams long the way
Feels like we're about to fall
Into the shadow I run but lately gravity
Is pulling me back on my feet again
Why don't we say goodbye
Cos' now I know how it feels to live a lie
It's turning so deep inside
Tell me why, oh its breaking me, its killing me
So why..draw the line
Tic-tac every heart beat drums
Whenever you're around baby
Can't seem to chase those clouds a ray
There's no escape from it all
Into the shadow I run byt lately gravity
Is pulling me back on my feet again
Why don't we say goodbye
Cos' now I know how it feels to live a lie
Oh it's turning so deep inside
Tell me why, oh it's breaking me, it's killing me
What if we turned around and walk away
Right now.
Would you cry, would you die a little
Oh boy I'm about to say goodbye
Oh why don't we say goodbye
Cos' now I know how it feels to live a lie
Oh it's turning so deep inside
Tell me why, oh it's breaking me, it's killing me
Oh it turning so deep inside
Tell me why, oh it's breaking me, it's killing me
So why...draw the line,
I draw the line

Through the clouds hits the ground
Wash away traces in the sand
And Yesterday so far away you disappeared, love was here
I close my eyes to be with you again
You're still alive the world is in your hands
Dream on dreamer
And the sun will always shine down on you
Keep on dreamin'
It’s alright feel alive
Dream on dreamer
And the world keeps spinnin'round and round you go
Don’t stop dreamin'
It’s alright, we’re alive
We’re alive
I light your name across the sky
I’ll be with you 'till the end of time
Don’t wake me up I'm reaching for your hand
I’ll never go to break your heart
No matter if you're near or far
Just close your eyes
To be with me again
We're still alive the world is in your hands
Dream on dreamer
And the sun will always shine down on you
Keep on dreamin'
It’s alright feel alive
Dream on dreamer
And the world keeps spinnin' round and round you go
Don’t stop dreamin'
It’s alright, we’re alive

we're stuck in the middle
two ways to go
Words inside my head

We've been hurt before
but why can't we let it go
You know I
I've been searching for this love all my life
I can't stand this pain
won't you please tell me why
you still hide away
you don't need to be afraid
I will be waiting here for you to realize
open your heart to me, you'll see it through
my eyes!
If you could read my mind
Nothing I need to say,
You'd never run away!
How can I make you start believing?
that I'm not the enemy!
If you could read my mind
all the things I feel inside
then you'd see
that I'm not the enemy
I'm not the enemy
Do you know
you're the air I breathe and I wanna show
what's inside my head
know that you're not alone
push your fears away
cause I am still holding on
I will be waiting here for you to realize
open your heart to me, you'll see it through

stop playin' these foolish games

Let's get out on the floor
I like to move it
Come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical
Out of control
There's people watching me
I never miss a beat
Still the night, kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight
'Cause it's pulling you in
Pump it up, you can't stop
'Cause it feels like an overdose
(Feels like an overdose)
Evacuate the dancefloor
I'm infected by the sound
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey mister DJ let the music take me underground
(Everybody in the club)
Evacuate the dancefloor
I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey mister Dj come burn this place right down to the ground.

My body's aching
That's some overload
Temperature's rising
I'm about to explode
Watch me I'm intoxicated
Taking the show
It's got me hypnotized
Everybody step aside
Still the night, kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight
'Cause it's pulling you in
Pump it up, you can't stop
'Cause it feels lile an overdose

Come on and evacuate
Feel the club is heating up
You wanna accelerate
Push it to the top
Come on and evacuate
Feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate
You don't have to be afraid
Now guess who's back with a brand new track?
They got everybody in the club going mad
So everybody in the back,
Get your back up on the wall and just shake that
thang
Go crazy
Yo lady
Yo baby
Let me see you work that thang
Drop it down low low
Let me see you take it to the dancefloor Yo

And said your last goodbye
I never thought that six months on
You'd still be in my life
I have tried to forget
Get you out of my head
But the memories won't fade
I can run I can hide from this feeling inside
But the pain won't go away
Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
Baby with a single word
I can see your face again
Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
And I'm taken back to what we had
Every time I hear your name
Now I'm sure you've found a girl
To fill my empty space
But I'm stuck with the love that we shared
That time just can't erase
I can run I can hide from this feeling inside
But the pain won't go away

I still feel your touch in my dream.
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why.
Without you it's hard to survive.
Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling.
And everytime we kiss I swear I can fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.
Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static.
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat slow
I can't let you go.
Want you in my life.
Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky.
They wipe away tears that I cry.
The good and the bad times, we've been trough them all.
You make me rise when I fall.
Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling.
And everytime we kiss I swear I can fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.
Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static.
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky.

I'm thinking how can this be
God it's true you blessing me, it's destiny,
Me and you were meant to be
The way I touch you
You know I love you
But I still put it down like a thug do
Know you like that
Yeah you like that
It's the love letter that I had to write back
Argue when you don't even fight back
Baby girl you put me on the right track
Not another person that I can see myself with
Know the way it sounds, sound kinda selfish, but
You don't wanna put me in this position
I'm wishin theres nothin in this relationship
That we missing (yea)
You don't know what you mean to me
Am I living in a fantasy (nah)
Just do well, girl how you make me feel
Me and you, we know the deal
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
Slow us down
Cuz you know that we hold this down
It's the hand that I reach and clutch
Lean on when I need that crutch
Baby girl yeah I know this much
Cuz cuz cuz everytime we touch
Cuz everytime we touch
I get this feeling
Everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side
Cuz everytime we touch
Everytime we touch and ride
People wanna front and lie
Duckinging high, lower your pride
Need you by my side girl
But when we kiss, you fly
G4 touchdown 745
Be-fore me and you were down to ride
Now it's at a point we gotta try so
We go out on the turn and caico
Somewhere converting dollars to peso
Lay low and we give kisses to besos
You get a feeling that's what you say so
Its d.o.
Whats the p.o.
If you love me why
You play for
I don't kno
This ring glow
Wanna put it on
I don't know
It's crazy when we get along
We ain't holding hands but I read your palm
Heart beat fast
I ain't feeling calm
Want this to last
Everlasting bond but
It's like a light switch on and off
Leave you in things so you could flause
What's the cost if you can feel me
I want you to turn around and you could tell me
Cuz everytime we touch
I get this feeling
Everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side
Cuz everytime we touch
Don't think cuz I'm a thug
That Imma hide my love
I know we gonna last
Cuz I need you boo
Everytime we touch
It's me and you
Don't think cuz I'm on dubs
That Imma hide my love
I know we gonna last
Cuz I need you boo
Everytime we touch
It's me and you
Cuz everytime we touch
I get this feeling
Everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side
Cuz everytime we touch</field>

Now I've faded
into someone else
Made me someone
I don't wanna be
Yeah, I'm faded
My true colour's gone
Like a picture
Nobody sees
I'll bet you don't
Don't even know
My favourite song
You tell me how
How I should
Wear my hair
You wanna change
Everything I ever was
Try to erase me
Till I'm not there
(Chorus)
Now I've faded
Like I never was
Till I don't
Even know myself
Yeah, I'm faded
Into what you want
But I'm not takin' it
Too well
I don't wanna be
Your little picture
Perfect pretty girl
Who's got nothing to say
I'm not gonna wait around
Let you run
My whole life down
So you can
Watch me fade away

Travelling in a limousine
I'm a girl but don't call me baby
Who the f**k is VIP?
Never alive in luxury
I don't care so just call me crazy
Can you give it out?
Don't stop just take it to the limit
Watch me boy it's spinning around this time
Hush, hush, running to the night, feel alive
I just can't get enough when I'm with you
'Cause your fever makes me feel so good
Turn it up boy you make your move
See I'm burning but it feels so good
Can't get enough when I'm with you
You got fever but it feels so good
Turn it up baby make your move
Keep me burning 'cause it feels so good
I don't need no superman
Trying to tell me who I am
Know it all's a driving me crazy
Nothing ever is for sure
I can't take this anymore
All I want is yes or no baby
Can you give it out?
Don't stop just take it to the limit

Hush, hush, running to the night, feel alive

Hang a shining star upon the highest bough

Running wild, the city sleeps
You're waking up and you're feeling strong,
It wont take long, and once you're gone,
Where and why as you're moving on,
When you laugh, when you do
Who's gonna tell ya where's the truth,
Will you see it, will you try
I wanna love you but I don't know why
The morning colours you blue, in the night you're the king of taboo, though you never could explain, what's your game?
Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just'a little, move along
Scared sea, we've gotta try, your running was the reason why
Nightmares rising, so unchain
You never would lose but you played the game
The morning colours you blue and the night you're the king of taboo, the machine is running wild, the coolest tide
Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just'a little, move along
Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just'a little, move along
If you can hold on and, you can't deny your way
We're running out of better time
Where will you be? I wanna know it I don't wanna see
Now I can't even cry "I'm done", 'cos you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just'a little, move along

'Cause when you move you're like a butterfly
Flown away
But I've got no tears left for you
I held on and I hope you come through, I do
Hold your hands up
I miss you, I miss you tonight
Hold your hands up
I'll find you when I look inside
Hold your hands up
I miss you, I miss you tonight
Remember all the things we used to say
In the hope that we'd remain
It's all forgiven not forgotten boy
It's not too late
But I've got no tears left for you

Hold your hands up
I'll find you when I look inside
Hold your hands up
I miss you, I miss you tonight
I'm alive
When I'll look for you
I hope you'll look into your heart
And you'll know what you missed
It's not a lot to ask
Just stay and make it last
Now all I am asking is this
Do you ever miss me!?
Hold your hands up
I miss you, I miss you tonight
Hold your hands up
I'll find you when I look inside
Hold your hands up
I held on and I hope you come through
Hold your hands up
I miss you, I miss you tonight
Hold your hands up
I'll find you when I look inside
Hold your hands up
I miss you, I miss you tonight
I'll find you when I look inside
Hold your hands up
Hold your hands up
Do you ever miss me?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">There should be a holiday for girls like me
It's started kind of hazy
And somehow I gave in to temptation
I thought that you would please me
But all I got was false accusations
But then you tried to break me
And lived up to your bad reputation
There should be a holiday for girls like me
Just to get some time to pack my bags and breathe
And maybe you will get it when you watch me leave
'Cause it's time to say goodbye
You see I made my mind up when I got that bruise
And if you really wanna know the truth
I'm not the kind of girl that settles for excuses
And I know I'll be alright
I might as well just say it
We always were a bad combination
You're old enough to take it
Don't need to hear your sad explanations
Don't tell me we'll make it
We both know that is false information
There should be a holiday for girls like me
Just to get some time to pack my bags and breathe
And maybe you will get it when you watch me leave
'Cause it's time to say goodbye
You see I made my mind up when I got that bruise
And if you really wanna know the truth
I'm not the kind of girl that settles for excuses
And I know I'll be alright
And it's no way you'll turn it around
'Cause I won't let you hold me down
Everybody knows, everybody knows it, honey
Everybody knows, everybody knows...
There should be a holiday for girls like me
Just to get some time to pack my bags and breathe
And maybe you will get it when you watch me leave
'Cause it's time to say goodbye
You see I made my mind up when I got that bruise
And if you really wanna know the truth
I'm not the kind of girl that settles for excuses
And I know I'll be alright
There should be a holiday for girls like me
Just to get some time to pack my bags and breathe
And maybe you will get it when you watch me leave

It's making me spin now, spinnin' within
Before I melt like snow, I say Hello
How do you do?
I love the way you undress now
Baby begin
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess
I love your blue-eyed voice, like Tiny Tim shines thru
How do you do?
Well, here we are crackin' jokes in the corner of our mouths
and I feel like I'm laughing in a dream
If I was young I could wait outside your school
Cos your face is like the cover of a magazine

CHORUS (2x):
How do you do, do you do, the things that you do
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do?
Did it ever make sense to you to say Bye Bye Bye?

I see you in that chair with the perfect skin
Well how have you been, baby, livin' in sin?
Hey, I gotta know, did you say Hello
How do you do?
Well, here we are spending time in the louder part of town
And it feels like everything's surreal
When I get old I will wait outside your house
Cos your hands have got the power meant to heal

With the world just spinning around
I don't know how you got me feeling this way
But damn I'm really feeling it now
So turn out the light and shut the door
I just need some time to come to my senses
It's not up to you
Nothing you can do to summon this pain away
You've got me hungover and over and over
It's like there's no end in sight
I'm feeling it day and night
It goes over and over and over
And I've got to break away
But I know there's no escape
'Til I'm sober
'Til I'm sober
'Til I'm sober
You've got me hungover
You've got me hungover
You've got me hungover
People say you're no good for me
But my mind can't seem to figure it out
You intoxicated every pert of me
And damn I'm really feeling it now
So turn out the light and shut the door
I just need some time to come to my senses
It's not up to you
Nothing you can do to summon this pain away
You've got me hungover and over and over

'Til I'm sober
'Til I'm sober
You've got me hungover
You've got me hungover
You've got me hungover
I'm fighting
Just trying
To tell myself that we'll work it out
But it's useless
The truth is
You're no good for me
You've got me hungover
Yeah
It goes over and over and over
And I've got to break away
But I know there's no escape
'Til I'm sober
'Til I'm sober

You've got me hungover

Oh.
sun above us in a foreign land
Seemed like you and me
could wait forever
Oh.
but the clouds pulled in and the sky got dark
Then it kind of seemed like the wind picked up
A cold wave was coming
Time to run now or never more
So come out of the storm why don't you babe
Tell me that you love me that your love wont' change
'Cause the winds blowing now gonna turn into a hurricane
So come into my heart why don't you babe
Show me what you got if you need me today
'Cause the winds coming now gonna blow into a hurricane
So we took cover from the pouring rain
In an old broken down forgotten place
Up on high ground where
The flood wouldn't drown us
Oh the night was long the wind was cold
On your shoulder out the storm I rode
We were waiting for morning
To make our getaway...
So come out of the storm why don't you babe
Tell me that you love me that your love won't change
'Cause the winds blowing now gonna turn into a hurricane
So come into my heart why don't you babe
Show me what you got if you need me today
'Cause the winds coming now gonna blow into a hurricane</field>

And again and again, I need that feeling

So come on and take my hand
And I'll show you the promised land

Who will ever know the way?

Forget the past, try to create,
A feeling that can wait.
If you want I know it's not too late.

            <field name="lyrics">Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day
She said she'd never love again
Because he broke her heart
And now she's blaming him
But he told her from the start
That what they had was special
But it ain't really love
Although he gave her everything
She never had his heart
But that's all that she needs
So what's tearing her apart?
'Cause loving him is hard
But that's all she really wants
She treats him like a king
And he treats her like a queen
But when he don't come home
He don't tell her where he's been
But she already knows
He got lipstick in his clothes
It's the message in his phone
And the smell of his cologne
But she don't say a tone or even moan
She don't stress, fight or fuss
She just keeps it to her own
When she cries, she dries her eyes
She never lied in her life
So his lies sound like knives every night
In the morning she's all right
'Cause she don't wanna fight
But tonight she'll be gone forever
Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day
He said he'd never love again
'Cause he don't want the pain
Of having someone special
Do that shit to him again
And though it ain't his fault
There ain't no-one else to blame
For all those sunny days
When all you see is rain
All you got are memories
But that just ain't the same
'Cause the woman that he loved
Must have simply gone away
And everyday he wakes up
Feeling like he's up in chains
And now her sweetest touch
Is like a shot to his brain
And this is just a shame
'Cause she don't say a thing
Except to break his heart
Like she's in a wicked game
That he ain't trying to play
But he's stuck trying to win
'Cause he's stuck loving someone
Who just ain't in love with him
But he's in love with her
And this is where it hurts
No but she don't give a damn
Or even know his worth
She treats him like he's dirt
That she can throw away
But he ain't going away
'Cause today's gonna be the day
Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day
So forgive me but I'm gone now
'Cause I'm free and I'm never coming home now
I'll find hope in forever
'Cause I'm thrown now
And I'm flying and I ain't gonna go down
I used to think we were magic but slow down
You didn't know what you had when you had it
And now you realise that it's gone like magic
And I guess you really want me back, right?
Well, forget it
Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day
Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day</field>

Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat
That's the jingle bell rock
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet

What have you done?
I thought it would be fun
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't on your morphine
It's making me itch
Said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bicth
I think I'll get out of here
Where I can run
As fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear
You're just like a pill
'stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
Run as fast as I can

You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
I haven't move from the spot where you left me
Must be a bad trip

Down town the young ones are going
Down town the young ones are growing

We're the kids in America (x2)
Everybody live for the music-go-round
Bright lights the music gets faster
Look boy, don't check on your watch
Not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance
Hot-shot-shot, give me no problems
Much later baby you'll be saying never mind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind
Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory
(Chorus)
Come closer, honey that's better
Got to get a brand new experience
Feeling right
Oh don't try to stop baby
Hold me tight
Outside a new day is dawning
Outside Suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go baby
New York to East California
There's a new wave coming I warn you

            <field name="lyrics">Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
(Happy Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you"
and meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
Oh my God I thought you were
Someone to rely on
Me?
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
[Maybe next year]
I'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone special.
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special</field>

All the way home i'll be warm

Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems

No more tears, no alibis,
I'm still in love with you,
There's so much I gotta show,
I will never let you go,
But still I know for sure,
Come take me by the hand,
This summer never ends,
And I want to know that you believe in love again,
Please tell me now it's not the end,
'Cause this I promise you so true,
The summer belongs to you,
Could you believe in love again?
How can I make you understand?
But this I promise you so true,
The summer belongs to you.
The summer belongs to you.
Would you catch me if I fall?
Crash and burn and lose it all,
Tell me what to do,
'Cause I need you night and day,
Will you ever run away?
Just one more thing to say
Come take me by the hand,
This summer never ends,
And I want to know that you believe in love again,
Please tell me now it's not the end,
'Cause this I promise you so true,
The summer belongs to you,
Could you believe in love again?
How can I make you understand?
But this I promise you so true,
The summer belongs to you.

If you can't make up your mind now it's good bye

Cuz tonight we're gonna party on the top floor
And I'll meet you there
And I don't care if it all comes natural
Your medical prescription - baby get ready now

Be who you want me to be
Personality
Goldilocks

And a boob job completes it
I'll be your beauty queen
Upgrading your self esteem
But you'll never meet the original me
I'll be your cover girl
Living in your plastic world
But you'll never ever meet the original me
So what's the reason to love?
Ain't got no reason to show my all

Hugest skill diploma
Put another perfume on
You will be trapped in my aroma
Here's my transformation
It's a logical manipulation
In your eyes I will remain
A piece of decoration
I'll be your beauty queen

            <field name="lyrics">You took a piece of my heart
I never thought that this could fall apart
You said you fell in love
And this was more than I had ever been afraid of
Another life
Another happy ending cuts like knife
Another place, another time
Another hand to touch, another sun to shine
You got me deeper and deeper, I'm constantly blinded
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls are divided
Why can't they forgive me these demons inside
Deeper and deeper, I'm constantly flying
My heart starts to shiver for I was letting up
I start to talk in my sleep, cause our souls have divided
How can it be that you're ready for love
Ready for love ...
How can it be that you're ready for love .....
Time will tell
A single day had helped me break this spell
Don't want to be alone
When will I be understood when is my kingdom to come
Another boy, another life
Another happy ending, and I'll be alive
Another place, another time
Another hand to touch, another sun to shine
You got me deeper and deeper, I'm constantly flying
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls have divided
Why can't they forgive me these demons inside
Deeper and deeper, I'm constantly flying
My heart starts to shiver for I was letting up
I start to talk in my sleep, cause our souls have divided
How can it be that you're ready for love
How can it be that you're ready for love ...

Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Everytime you do, what you do, what you do to me
Take your chance boy ready, ready or not
Take your chance boy, ready or not
Longing for inspiration
Somehow you turn me inside out
I need an explanation now, right now
Don't tell me to run away from this
Cause you've got the love I can't resist
How can I breathe?
How should I feel?
Holding me back
Baby what you do, what you do, what you do to me
Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Everytime you do, what you do, what you do to me
Take your chance boy, ready or not
Baby what you do, what you do, what you do to me
Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Everytime you do, what you do, what you do to me
Take your chance boy ready, ready or not
Baby what you do, what you do, what you do to me
Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Everytime you do, what you do, what you do to me
Take your chance boy ready, ready or not</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Was something in your eyes I know I can't resist.
Something in the air, I don't know why.
You were hardly there when I was on my own.
There's something about you that makes me cry.
Can I believe that your heart still beats for me?
Let me receive a sign that you're my destiny.
I wanna know.
Give me a reason for me to believe in, can't you see in my eyes?
Now I need a reason, for I am still grieving
Is the time to say goodbye?
'Cause deep in my heart I know there's a reason why I am not leaving, why im not alone.
So give me a reason for me to believe in, give me a reason.
There's something in your eyes I know I can't resist.
Something in the air, I don't know why.
Can I believe that your heart still beats for me?
Let me receive a sign that you're my destiny.
I wanna know.
Give me a reason for me to believe in, can't you see it in my eyes.
Now i need a reason so I'm still breathing.
Is it time to say goodbye?
'Cause deep in my heart I know there's a reason why I am not leaving, why I'm not alone.
So give me a reason for me to believe it, give me a reason</field>

Feel the light upon your face
We're on our way to the sun
Live and let the fire burn
Welcome to the point of no return
We're going back to the start
What can we do now?
Now life is blurry
What can we do now?
Share the love
What are we doing here?
Now life is hunting us into the wrong
Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
(Faces in the sun)
Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
Living on
This world is yours and mine
You gotta take a step across the line
We're going back to the start
I'm about to blow my mind
Watch me as I'm longing to feel alive
We're running into the night
What can we do now?
Now life is blurry
What can we do now?
Share the love
What are we doing here?

From Berlin to Rome
You're searching for something
A place to call home
Been hiding your feelings
Went out of control
Your destinations unknown
Tell me
How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love
How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above, baby
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love
Runaway from love (runaway)
A new town, a new place
A knock on the door
You came as a stranger and entered the door
The moment I saw you, I knew it for sure
You won't pack your bags anymore
Tell me
How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love
How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above, baby
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love
Runaway from love (runaway)
I know you don't want to be a bother
Though your love's so undiscovered
I want you to stay boy
Stop running from love
How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love
How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above, baby
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love

Let's hit the city of freedom, like old times
It's getting dirty underneath the blue sky
Imagine you and me count the butterflies
One, two, three
Let's bring it on
Keep on dancing in the streets of love
French kissing on JFK drive
Till we crash at the beach
Where we watch the sun rise
Tell me what you waiting for
We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the frisco bay
Wake me up in San Francisco
Where are flowers in your hair, girl
Party everywhere, girl
Wake me up in San Francisco
Where the love is in the air
All the people stop and stare
Baby take me back to the city of love
Right to the place that I've been dreaming of
(San Francisco)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(San Francisco)
(Oohhh, oohh)
It's 10 pm, getting ready for the night
Wanna be a hippie when the city's getting high
I'm cruising down broadway, you on my side
Pulling over my pink rover at the hungry eye
One, two, three
Let's bring it on
DJ play my favorite beats all night long
Poppin' some bottles, champagne, red wine
And we both giddy up on the rooftop
And watch the city lights
Tell me what you waiting for
We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the frisco bay
Wake me up in San Francisco
Where are flowers in your hair, girl
Party everywhere, girl
I Wake me up in San Francisco
Where the love is in the air
All the people stop and stare
Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of
(San Francisco)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(San Francisco)
(Oohhh, oohh)
We're playing songs of life, like it's 69
We singing, dance, under the neon lights (of San Francisco)
Stars shine so bright on the city tonight
We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the frisco bay
Wake me up in San Francisco
We knew the power is in your head, girl
Party everywhere, girl
Wake me up in San Francisco
Where the love is in the air
All the people stop and stare
Baby take me back to the city of love
Right to the place that I've been dreaming of
(San Francisco)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(San Francisco)
(Oohhh, oohh)
C'mon take me back to the city of love
To the place, the place that I've been dreaming of
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Oohhh, oohh)</field>

I've lost my illusions, I'm lost in my fears
Alone in the darkness, Alone in the night
I'm waiting for you and I'm waiting for light
But when the night is gone, ???life will still go on???
And the darkness comes again
And the bright blue sky turns to grey and I
wonder why i cant forget
It's a secret of love, It's a secret of dreams
I've been lost in my fears, love is not what it seems
It's a secret that I, need you here by my side
Never can't get enough
Its a secret, a secret, a secret of love.
It's a secret of love
Alone in the darkness, I'm waiting for you
I cry for the day when my dreams will come true
Alone in the darkness, Alone I fall asleep
It's hard to forget when my love is so deep
But when the night is gone, ???life will still go on???
And the darkness comes again
And the bright blue sky turns to grey and I
wonder why i cant forget
It's a secret of love, It's a secret of dreams
I've been lost in my fears, love is not what it seems
It's a secret that I, need you here by my side
Never can't get enough
Its a secret, a secret, a secret of love.

I, I've been waiting so long
Siting here by the phone
And I really don't wanna be alone, I don't
I, just don't know what to do
I need a mood to make love to you
And I am dreaming all your body
That'll be for two, for two
You're so, you're so sexy, sexy, sexy

You're so sexy, sex, sex, sexy

You're so, you're so sexy, sexy, sexy
Be my lover, be my inspiration
You're so sexy, sex, sex, sexy
Fisical and logical temptation
No, no, no, don't stop keep it going

And You the fool for love
You look like George the second
You were not good enough

Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on tv, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up mtv
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does her pretty face see what's he's worth
He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does her pretty face see what's he's worth
Sorry girl, but you missed out
Well tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?
I'm with the skater boy, I said see you later boy
I'll be the backstage after the show
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know
I'm with the skater boy, I said see you later boy
I'll be the backstage after the show
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know</field>

That body bout to blow on up like dynamite

Pop some bottles of rozay getting wasted till we cray
I see a lot of sexy divas body ticking when they tok
Body tweaking when they drop, go head make it pop
You sexy and you know it with your freaky deaky style
That body bout to blow on up like dynamite
I got that peachie, Nicci flow to rock a party all day
From Ibiza over to the MIA

A reason for living
A deeper meaning
Yeah
I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me
And when the stars are shinin brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish, send it to heaven, then make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of
The highest power
In lonely hour
The tears devour you
I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me
Oh can't you see it baby?
You don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right before you
All that you need will surely come
I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need

            <field name="lyrics">What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Everytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes
So I don't say a word
'Cause she already knows
That she's my better half
That's what she'd better know
She always tells me yes
She never tells me no
If I went, they'd hold me back
She's telling me to go
So I don't need the world
Pulling up on my throat
I just need my girl
Believing my every quote
Telling me I can fly
So I don't need to float
That's why I walk on water
If she inside a boat
Go weather the storm
And cover every slope
Together we're forever
So I won't ever hope
That she'll be mine forever
'Cause I already know
That what we have is magic
'Cause she my pedestal
And I can reach the sky
If I don't let her go
So all I do is climb
'Cause I will never fall
No I'll never fail
'Cause with her
I will throw every ball
And though I never say a word
My love's already spoke
What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes
It's unspoken
I give her everything
'Cause what she is to me
Is more than anything
So I ain't scared to let her breathe
'Cause when you love somebody
You gotta let them be
That's why I let her fly
And she come back to me
Like Cinderella
She's my umbrella in every storm
She's picture perfect
So I'll protect her through every war
Through every summer
Or every winter or every fall
I spring through fire to get her
Smashing through every wall
All just for the love
That she has give me
And more to show the love
That I am giving she
So ya'll better forgive me
For my wicked dream
I did it all
In the name of love repeatedly
'Cause I remember every time
That she's forgiven me
And I'll be by her side
Until the Lord delivers me
And then delivers she
'Cause I don't wanna be
In hell, earth or even heaven
If she ain't there with me
What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes
'Cause I remember every time
That she's forgiven me
And I'll be by her side
Until the Lord delivers me
And then delivers she
'Cause I don't wanna be
In hell, earth or even heaven
If she ain't there with me
What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes

'Cause every word you say
I find myself mistaken
Can't you see we're not the perfect combination
'Cause you got what you want

With every breath I take
I fake the right impression
On and on and on and it goes...
On and on and on
Hey what about me (what about me, what about me)
What about me now (what about me, what about me)
If you don't like the way I do
You better leave now
What about me yeah (what about me, what about me)
What about me now (what about me, what about me)
I've got nothing left to say
I'm breaking free now
I'm longing for your touch
But you don't seem to care
I need to get away
And fight this sweet surrender
So heavy on my heart
You hurt me like no other
It's killing me inside
I need to run for cover
On and on and on and it goes...
On and on and on

Hey what about me (what about me, what about me)
What about me now (what about me, what about me)
If you don't like the way I do
You better leave now

What about me yeah (what about me, what about me)
What about me now (what about me, what about me)
I've got nothing left to say
I'm breaking free now
Can you tell me why you had to throw it all away?
Don't wanna spend another night in desperation
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
Hey what about me (what about me, what about me)
What about me now (what about me, what about me)
If you don't like the way I do
You better leave now

Again you're circling all around
If you could only touch me now
Strangers from the past
Don't hesitate
Now we're standing face to face
If heaven is the only place
Would you take my hand?
Just tell me what do you want from me
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why, everytime I feel your eyes all over me
Tell me what do you want from me
Are you mad enough to see
That it's hard to cross the line
Come on now, set me free
What do you want from me
Get closer now
Softly whisper in my ear
Please take me away from here
Away from all my tears
It's not too late
Now we're standing face to face
And heaven is the only place
Will you understand?
Just tell me what do you want from me
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why, everytime I feel your eyes all over me
Tell me what do you want from me
Are you mad enough to see
That it's hard to cross the line
Come on now, set me free
And I know, If you give me this feeling
I'll be there to hold you tight oooh
'Cause I'd show, your love is a hero
We will run, run out of sight
(What you want?!)
What do you want from me
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why everytime I feel your eyes all over me

There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me
What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watchin you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seein that lovin you
Is what I was tryin to do
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you
Everywhere I go
But I'm doin it
It's hard to force that smile when I see
Our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder gettin up, gettin dressed,
Livin with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved
In my heart that I left unspoken
What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watchin you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seein that lovin you

Who do you think you are?
cuz once again you broke my heart
I know that love went just to far
it's hard to catch a falling star
but now I finally realize, your a brown eyed angel in disguise
just one step too far so tell me
honestly, who do you think you are?
you and I were on our way together
but this life passed bye, these days are gone
all the tears i've cried they thaught me nothing lasts forever
I been blind for just too long
cuz I don't need no diamond rings, alibis no more.
Who do you think you are?
cuz once again you broke my heart

Each day I seemed to love you more
Nothing was going to break us apart (break us apart)
The truth couldn't have been any further
From what I thought was reality
Now I've been left with a broken heart (broken heart)
I don't know if it's right or wrong
Somehow I'm weak and strong
Find myself on the run
But where do I belong
It's hard to believe that one day you're here
The next you are gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave
I just can't believe that one day you're here
The next you are gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave
Rewind back to the time when you held me
The air is calm, the stars are bright
Nothing in this world can take you from me (take you from me)
No stop, think of the pain that I'm feeling
I really want to feel your touch
But now I feel helpless, so helpless baby
Since you went away I feel
That some days still conceal it from me
I'll be free, I'm better off alone
It's hard to believe that one day you're here
The next you are gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave
I just can't believe that one day you're here
The next you are gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave
I could feel you all around me
Knew your loving words surround me
Still I can't believe
Why you had to leave
I was ..
but now I'm broken
Many words been left unspoken
I just can't conceive
Why you had to leave
It's so hard to believe that one day you're here
The next you are gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave
I just can't believe that one day you're here
The next you are gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave</field>

There was a sign,
It was the time,
To take me away into your arms.
I heard your voice,
You called my name.
A single touch would stop my pain,
I feel like you in everything I do.
Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes,
Even if it was for just one day.
Wouldn't it be good,
If we could wish ourselves away.
And wouldn't it be good to be on your side,
The grass is always greener over there.
Wouldn't it be good,
If we could live without a care.
The times passing by,
I feel like you,
I always do.
You are my place to hide,
I don't know why.
Still hear your voice,
Still feel the same,
A single kiss can stop the rain.
So close to you,
In everything I do
Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes,
Even if it was for just one day.
Wouldn't it be good,
If we could wish ourselves away.
And wouldn't it be good to be on your side,
The grass is always greener over there.

            <field name="lyrics">Oh, oh, yeah

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

(Happy Christmas!) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I Love You" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Oh now I've found a real love,
you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
(maybe next year)
I'll give it to someone,
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone,
I'll give it to someone special</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then
And just let them out

I'm not afraid to cry
Every once in a while even though goin' on
With you gone still upsets me

There are days
Every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away

Never knowing
What could have been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain
Of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it

It's hard to force that smile when I
See our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder

Gettin' up, gettin' dressed
Livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over

I would trade, give away all the words
That I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away

Never knowing
What could have been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

I'm not afraid to cry
Every once in a while even though goin' on
With you gone still upsets me

There are days
Every now and again
I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away

Never knowing
What could have been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away

Never knowing
What could have been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so
I can't let you go
Want you in my life

Your arms are my castle 
Your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry
The good and the bad times 
We've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss I reach for the sky

It's making me spin now, spinnin' within.
Before I melt like snow, I say 'Hello'
How do you do!
I love the way you undress now.
Baby begin.
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess.
I love your blue-eyed voice,
Like Tiny Tim shines through.
How do you do!
How do you do, do you do, the things that you do.
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do! Did it ever make sense to you to say bye? Bye Bye

How do you do, do you do, the things that you do.
No one I know could ever keep up with you.
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you to say 'Bye'
Bye Bye?

How do you do, How do you do
I see you in that chair with the perfect skin.
Well how have you been, baby, livin' in sin?
Hey, I gotta know, did you say 'Hello'
How do you do?
Well, here we are spending time in the louder part of town
And it feels like everything's surreal.
When I get old I will wait outside your house
Cause your hands have got the power meant to heal.
How do you do, do you do, the things that you do.
No one I know could ever keep up with you.
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you to say 'Bye'
Bye Bye?</field>

You left me drown in in the tears of memory
And ever since you've gonna I found it hard to breathe
'Cause there was so much that your heart just couldn't see
A thousand ways to dreams are rollin' off my eyes
But times been hillin' me and I say goodbye

'Cause I can breathe again dream again
I'll be on the road again
Like it used to be the other day
Now I feel free again so innocent
'Cause someone makes me whole again for sure
I find another you

Could you imagine someone else is by my side
I've been afraid I couldn't keep myself from fallin'
My heart was always searching for a place to hide
Could not have waited on to bring another day
You're not the only one so hear me when I say
The thoughts of you that just fade away

'Cause I can breathe again dream again
I'll be on the road again
Like it used to be the other day
Now I feel free again so innocent
'Cause someone makes me whole again for sure
I find another you

Sometimes I see you when I close my eyes
You're still apart of my life
But I can breathe again dream again
I'll be on the road again
Like it used to be the other day
Now I feel free again so innocent
'Cause someone makes me whole again for sure
I'll find another
Ooh, I'll find another you</field>

Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why

Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town (downtown)

The young ones are going
(Downtown) the young ones are growing
We're the kids in America (whoa)
We're the kids in America (whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance

Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind (kind hearts)

Don't make a new story
(Kind hearts) don't grab any glory
We're the kids in America (whoa)
We're the kids in America (whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la, sing!
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la

Come closer, honey, that's better
Got to get a brand-new experience, feeling right
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight

Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go, baby

New York to east California
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya
We're the kids in America (whoa)
We're the kids in America (whoa)
Everybody lives for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a

Would you catch me if I fall
Crash and burn and lose it all
Tell me what to do
'Cause I need you night and day
Will you ever run away
Just one more thing to say
Come take me by the hand

Why can't true love be forever 
Why did my dream explode 
The day you went away 
Cause I will keep the spare together 
I wish you well of hope

I never thought that this could fall apart
You said you fell in love
And this was more than I had ever been afraid of
Another life
Another happy ending cuts like knife
Another place, another time
Another hand to touch, another sun to shine

You got me deeper than deep, I'm constantly flying
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls have divided
Why can't they forgive me these demons inside
Deeper than deep, I'm constantly flying
My heart starts to shiver for I was letting up
I start to talk in my sleep, cause our souls have divided
How can it be that you're ready for love

Ready for love

How can it be that you're ready for love

Time will tell
A single day had helped me break this spell
Don't want to be alone
When will I be understood when is my kingdom to come
Another boy, another life
Another happy ending, and I'll be alive
Another place, another time
Another hand to touch, another sun to shine

You got me deeper than deep, I'm constantly blinded
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls have divided
Why can't they forgive me these demons inside
Deeper than deep, I'm constantly flying

And lived up to your bad reputation

There should be a holiday for girls like me
Just to get some time to pack my bags and breathe
And maybe you will get it when you watch me leave
Cause it's time to say goodbye
You see I made my mind up when I got that bruise.
And if you really wanna know the truth
I'm not the kind of girl that settles for excuses
And I know I'll be alright

I might as well just say it
We always were a bad combination
You're old enough to take it
Don't need to hear your sad explanations
Don't tell me we'll make it (yeah yeah yeah)
We both know that it's false information

[Chorus]

And there's no way you'll turn it round
Cause I won't let you hold me down
Everybody knows, Everybody knows it
Honey
Everybody knows, Everybody knows

Come on now, set me free.

What do you want from me.

Get closer now,
Softly whisper in my ear,
Please take me away from here,
Away from all my tears.

Now we're standing face to face,
And heaven is the only place,
Will you understand?

Just tell me what do you want from me,
This is love in the first degree,
Tell me why every time I feel your eyes all over me.

Tell me what do you want from me,
Are you mad enough to see,
That its hard to cross the line,
Come on now, set me free.

And I know, If you give me this feeling,
I'll be there to hold you tight.
Cause I'd show, your love is a hero,
We will run, run out of sight.

What you want?

What do you want from me,
This is love in the first degree,
Tell me why every time I feel your eyes all over me</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house, that don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry
Every once in a while even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days
Every now and again I pretend I'm OK but that's not what gets me

What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doing it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, living with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart that I left unspoken

What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do

I'm not afraid to cry
Every once in a while even though goin on with you gone still upsets me
There are days
Every now and again I pretend I'm OK but that's not what gets me

What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seeing that loving you

Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt baby when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our beds till the morning comes

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because the night belongs to lovers

I try to hide
I'm listening to my voice inside
What's on to tell me right or wrong
I need to know where I belong
For all the days I ran away
I never dare to ask me who could I be
Who can bring back the love that's inside me

[Chorus]
Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could it be you
Or do I break away
So leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true I don't have a clue
Could it be you

Too many things said and done
Sure if you could be the one
To dry the tears I left behind
To chase these demons off my mind

I see your face
Touch your skin
Is this a fight
We both can't win
Sometimes the truth is miles apart
But it's hard to break your heart

[Chorus]

Baby I don't wanna waste your love
Though it's hard to just walk on
Well will this hurt be never ending
Where do I belong

[Chorus]

Maybe it is me
Used to plan to see that it's you
For everything I am everything I need lies in you</field>

Run as fast as I can

To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better
You keep makin' me ill
You're makin' me ill

I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills, they were different

You're searching for something
A place to call home

Been hiding your feelings
Went out of control
Your destinations unknown

Tell me

How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love

How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love

Runaway from love (runaway)

A new town, a new place
A knock on the door
You came as a stranger and entered the door
The moment I saw you, I knew it for sure
You won't pack your bags anymore

Tell me

How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love

How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love

Runaway from love (runaway)

I know you don't want to be a bother
Though your love's so undiscovered
I want you to stay boy
Stop running from love

How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway
You chase the dreams from heaven above
Where in this world will you find a place to stay?
Runaway from love

How can it be boy?
You're still a runaway

            <field name="lyrics">He was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious
He was a punk, she did ballet, what more can I say
He wanted her, she'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose, they had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy, she said see you later boy, he wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space, she needed to come back down to earth

Five years from now, she sits at home, feeding the baby she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees, skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know and they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd, looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy, she said see you later boy, he wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star, slamming on his guitar, does your pretty face see what he's worth
He was a skater boy, she said see you later boy, he wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star, slamming on his guitar, does your pretty face see what he's worth

Sorry girl but you missed out, well tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends, this is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see, see the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye, I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl, can I make it any more obvious
We are in love, haven't you heard, how we rock each others world

I'm with the skater boy, I said see you later boy, I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at the studio, singing the song we wrote about a girl you used to know
I'm with the skater boy, I said see you later boy, I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at the studio, singing the song we wrote about a girl you used to know</field>

Just tell me what do you want from me
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why, every time I feel your eyes all over me

Tell me what do you want from me
Are you mad enough to see
That it's hard to cross the line
Come on now, set me free

What do you want from me

Get closer now
Softly whisper in my ear
Please take me away from here
Away from all my tears
It's not too late

Now we're standing face to face
And heaven is the only place
Will you understand?

Tell me what do you want from me
Are you mad enough to see

We will run, run out of sight

I know that love went just to far
Its hard to catch a falling star
But now I finally realize,
Your a brown eyed angel in disguise
Just one step too far so tell me honestly
Who do you think you are?

You and I were on our way together
But this life passed by, these days are gone
All the tears I've cried they thought me nothing lasts forever
I been blind for just too long

It's hurting so deep inside
Tell me why, oh its breaking me, its killing me

Tic-toc every heart beat drops
Whenever you're around baby
Can't seem to chase those clouds away

            <field name="lyrics">When you walked away from me
And said your last goodbye
I never thought that six months on
You'd still be in my life

I have tried to forget
Get you out of my head
But the memories won't fade
I can run I can hide from this feeling inside
But the pain won't go away

Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
Baby with a single word
I can see your face again

Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
And I'm taken back to what we had
Every time I hear your name

Now I'm sure you've found a girl
To fill my empty space
But I'm stuck with the love that we shared
That time just can't erase

I can run I can hide from this feeling inside
But the pain won't go away

Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
Baby with a single word
I can see your face again

Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
And I'm taken back to what we had
Every time I hear your name

And I'm taken back to what we had
Every time I hear your name</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Running wild, the city sleeps
You're waking up and you're feeling strong,
It wont take long, and once you're gone,
Where and why as you're moving on,
When you laugh, when you do
Who's gonna tell ya where's the truth,
Will you see it, will you try
I wanna love you but I don't know why

The morning colors you blue, in the night you're the king of taboo,
Though you never could explain, what's your game?

Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along

Scared sea, we've gotta try, your running was the reason why
Nightmares rising, so unchain
You never would lose but you played the game

The morning colors you blue and the night you're the king of taboo,
The machine is running wild, the coolest tide

Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along

Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along

If you can hold on and, you can't deny your way
We're running out of better time

Where will you be? I wanna know it I don't wanna see
Now I can't even cry "I'm done", 'cos you're stuck in the middle, come along

Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along

Hold on, what's going on?
But you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along</field>

I'm longing for your touch
But you don't seem to care

So heavy on my heart

Not ashamed to say you're fishing for the fame

we're stuck in the middle
Two ways to go
Words inside my head
But you don't wanna know
We've been hurt before
But why can't we let it go

You know I
I've been searching for this love all my life
I can't stand this pain
Won't you please tell me why
You still hide away
You don't need to be afraid

I will be waiting here for you to realize
Open your heart to me, you'll see it through
My eyes

If you could read my mind
Nothing I need to say 
You'd never run away
How can I make you start believing
that I'm not the enemy
If you could read my mind 
All the things I feel inside
Then you'd see
That I'm not the enemy
I'm not the enemy

Do you know
You're the air I breathe and I wanna show
What's inside my head
Know that you're not alone
Push your fears away
Cause I am still holding on

I will be waiting here for you to realize
Open your heart to me, you'll see it through
My eyes

If you could read my mind
Nothing I need to say 
You'd never run away
How can I make you start believing
that I'm not the enemy
If you could read my mind 
All the things I feel inside
Then you'd see
I'm not the enemy

'Cause nothin' feels the same
Every time you say my name
And I need you to know
That we need to make a change
Stop playin' these foolish games

I'm not the enemy

If you could read my mind
Nothing I need to say
You'd never run away
How can I make you start believing

            <field name="lyrics">Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day

She said she'd never love again
Because he broke her heart
And now she's blaming him
But he told her from the start
That what they had was special
But it ain't really love
Although he gave her everything
She never had his heart
But that's all that she needs
So what's tearing her apart?
'Cause loving him is hard
But that's all she really wants
She treats him like a king
And he treats her like a queen
But when he don't come home
He don't tell her where he's been
But she already knows
He got lipstick in his clothes
It's the message in his phone
And the smell of his cologne
But she don't say a tone or even moan
She don't stress, fight or fuss
She just keeps it to her own

When she cries, she dries her eyes
She never lied in her life
So his lies sound like knives every night
In the morning she's all right
'Cause she don't wanna fight
But tonight she'll be gone forever 

Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day

He said he'd never love again
'Cause he don't want the pain
Of having someone special
Do that shit to him again
And though it ain't his fault
There ain't no-one else to blame
For all those sunny days
When all you see is rain
All you got are memories
But that just ain't the same

'Cause the woman that he loved
Must have simply gone away
And everyday he wakes up
Feeling like he's up in chains
And now her sweetest touch
Is like a shot to his brain
And this is just a shame
'Cause she don't say a thing
Except to break his heart
Like she's in a wicked game
That he ain't trying to play
But he's stuck trying to win
'Cause he's stuck loving someone
Who just ain't in love with him

But he's in love with her
And this is where it hurts
No but she don't give a damn
Or even know his worth
She treats him like he's dirt
That she can throw away
But he ain't going away
'Cause today's gonna be the day

Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day

So forgive me but I'm gone now
'Cause I'm free and I'm never coming home now
I'll find hope in forever
'Cause I'm thrown now
And I'm flying and I ain't gonna go down
I used to think we were magic but slow down
You didn't know what you had when you had it
And now you realise that it's gone like magic
And I guess you really want me back, right?
Well, forget it

Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day

Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day</field>

Let's hit the city of freedom, like old times
It's getting dirty
Underneath the blue sky
Imagine you and me countin' the butterflies

One, two, three
Let's bring it on
Keep on dancing in the streets of love
French kissing on JFK drive
Till we crash at the beach
Where we watch the sun rise

Tell me what you're waiting for

We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the Frisco bay

Wake me up in San Francisco
(When you got power in your head girl, party everywhere girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of
San Francisco
Wake me up in San Francisco

It's ten pm
Getting ready for the night
Wanna be a hippie when the city's getting high
I'm cruising down Broadway, you on my side
Pulling over my pink rover at the hungry eye

One, two, three
Let's bring it on
DJ play my favorite beats
All night long
Poppin' some bottles, champagne, red wine
And we both giddy up on the rooftop
And watch the city lights

Tell me what you waiting for

We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the Frisco bay

Wake me up in San Francisco
(When you got power in your head girl, party everywhere girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of
San Francisco
Wake me up in San Francisco

We're playing songs of life
Like it's sixty nine
We sing and dance, under the sun of San Francisco
Stars shine so bright on the city tonight

We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the Frisco bay

Wake me up in San Francisco
(When you got power in your head girl, party everywhere girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of
San Francisco
Wake me up in San Francisco

C'mon take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of

So wake me up in San Francisco</field>

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me

And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you
Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has..
Come
Where it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy
Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has..
Come
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has..
come
Oohh, a light..
Oohh
Hush, now
I see a light in your eyes
Oh, in the eyes of a boy
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love</field>

True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small, to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise (Oooh, Oooh)
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise (Oooh, Oooh)
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

            <field name="lyrics">The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too
Much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love
The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I`m going do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love</field>

And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

            <field name="lyrics">There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby baby
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now
If you forgive all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me now
(it's all coming back to me now)
When you kiss me like this

When I touch you like that

Hold me, so you can't let go
Just believe in me

I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me, inside
Fulfill your destiny,
Is there within the child,
My storm will never end,
My fate is on the wind,
The king of hearts, the joker's wild,
But we don't say goodbye,
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me
Cos I have found a dream that must come true,
Every once of me must see it through,
But you are my only
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play,
Hand over my heart I'll find my way,
I will make them give to me
Immortality
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me, inside
And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
With all my love for you
And what else we may do
We don't say, goodbye</field>

            <field name="lyrics">How does a moment last forever?
How can a story never die?
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try
Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow, our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will
Minutes turn to hours, days to years and gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on
Maybe some moments weren't so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or our lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
We'll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on
How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, perceives and perseveres
And makes us whole
Minutes turn to hours, days to years and gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on
How does a moment last forever?
When our song lives on</field>

No rivers too wide, for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray

And everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see...
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
I saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It doesn't have to be this way, let me show you a better day
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears, just cast them on me
How can I make you see...

No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep up safe and warm
And I know we will survive
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the sky...
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me

It's all because of you
You are the reason
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
You are the reason, the reason
In the middle of the night
I'm going down 'cause I adore you
I want to floor you
I'm giving it up
No more running around spinning my wheel
You came out of my dream and made it real
I know what I feel
It's you
It's all because of you
You are the reason
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
You are the reason, the reason
In the middle of the night
I'm going down 'cause I want you
I want to touch you
I want to floor you
You are the reason, baby
You are the reason
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">"Let's Talk About Love"
Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land
I've never seen
There are people around the world -
different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that
reminds me we're the same...
Let's talk about love
From the laughter of a child to the tears
of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us
all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker
to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the
very last refrain...
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about us
Let's talk about life
Let's talk about trust
Let's talk about love
It's the king of all who live and the
queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your
sleeve - till the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of
any storm
But as gentle as a falling leave on any
autumn morn...
Let's talk about love - it's all we're
needin'
Let's talk about us - it's the air we're
breathin'
Let's talk about life - I wanna know you
Let's talk about trust - and I wanna show
you
Let's talk about love</field>

Maiden mild!
Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer
For thou can't hear amid the wild

We slumber safely till the morrow
Though we've by man outcast relived
Oh, Maiden see a maiden's sorrow
Oh, Mother, hear a suppliant child!
Ave Maria
Ave Maria, gratia plena
Maria, gratia plena
Maria, gratia plena
Ave, ave dominus
Dominus tecum
The murky cavern's air so heavy
Shall breath of balm if thou hast smiled
Oh, Maiden, hear a maiden pleadin'
Oh, Mother, hear a suppliant child!

Guess I lost all track of time
Started walking and couldn't stop
Turning it over in my mind
Trying to make some sense of it
Trying to make the pieces fit
I thought I covered my tracks so well
But now he says he knew about it from the start
Yeah he knew about us all along, , ,
If there was any other way love
Don't you think I've tried to find it
Don't you think I want to stay
If there was any other way love
There's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way, , ,
Maybe I'd better be leaving now
But there's something I want you to understand before I go
Sometimes we don't have a choice when we play and break the rules
I just had to see you darlin', one more time
If only just to say good-bye
'Cos he knew about us all the time
If there was any other way love
Don't you think I've tried to find it
Don't you think I want to stay
If there was any other way love
There's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way, , ,
I never wanted it to be like this
I never meant to get serious
But now the thought of losing you
Takes some getting used to
If there was any other way love
Don't you think I've tried to find it
Don't you think I want to stay
If there was any other way love
There's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way, , ,

You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
Because you make me fell so alive
Oh,what you've done to me
Close to you because you make me feel so alive.
You make me fell
You make me feel

I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear
Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you
Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has..
Come
Where it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy
Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears

And takes me back home, takes me back home
All of the promises broken
And all of the songs left unsung
Seem so far away
As I make my way back to you
You gave me faith
And you gave me a world to believe in
You gave me a love to believe in
And feeling this love
I can rise up above
And be strong, and be whole once again
I know that dreams we hold on to
Can just fade away
And I know that words can be wasted
with so much to say
And when I feel helpless
There's always a hope that shines through
And makes me believe
And makes me believe
And I see for one fleeting moment
A paradise under the sun
I drift away
And I make my way back to you
You gave me faith
And you gave me a world to believe in
You gave me a love to believe in
And feeling this love
I can rise up above
And be strong
and be whole once again
Life goes on
Can leave us with sorrow and pain
And I hold on
To all that you are
To all that we'll be
And I can go on once again
You gave me a love to believe in
You gave me a love to believe in
And feeling this love I can rise up above
And be strong
And be whole
Once again
You gave me a love to believe in
You gave me a love to believe in
And feeling this love
I can rise up above
And be strong
And be whole
Once again
'Cause your love
Heals my soul
Once again
I can live I can dream
Once again
'Cause you made me believe

            <field name="lyrics">The war was over and the spirit was broken,
The hills were smokin' as the men withdrew.
We stood on the cliffs
Oh, and watched the ships
Slowly sinking to their rendezvous.
They signed a treaty and our homes were taken,
Loved ones forsaken
They didn't give a damn.
Try'n' to raise a family,
End up the enemy
Over what went down on the plains of Abraham.
Acadian driftwood,
Gypsy tail wind.
They call my home the land of snow.
Canadian cold front movin' in.
What a way to ride
Oh, what a way to go.
Sailing out of the gulf headin' for Saint Pierre,
Nothin' to declare
All we had was gone.
Broke down along the coast,
But what hurt the most
When the people there said
"You better move on".
I've worked in the fields down in New Orleans.
It was ever green up until the floods.
You could call it an omen,
Points ya where you're goin'.
Set my compass north
I got winter in my blood
J'arrive, Acadie.
J'ai le mal du pays.</field>

All I got is questions, and you left me wondering why
Why you keep your distance, every lonely night
When love was bound together
We lived it by the letter
Cant close my eyes forever
Cos everything has changed and now
I aint gonna look the other way
One more time
Cos after all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky
I aint gonna wait to see the rain
Go by
Nothins gonna make it right, look at me cos I choose life
Its all about giving, its not about winning the game
My mind was open, ready or not you closed it up again
Still I keep asking, if you got something to hide
I never stop learning, all the reasons why
It took about a minute
To find the point and hit it
Gotta take this life and live it
Cos everyting has changed and now
When all the lights go out so suddenly, I loose my way
Baby tell me
Is something going on
You gotta free me, this time I'm gonna be strong</field>

Composição: Eric Carmen
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin'alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore
When I was young

One look in your eyes would have proved me wrong.
I find myself speechless
This feeling of completeness is so strong.
And now as convinced that my heart had reached it's limit
Till you created this new place in it.
Your touch wraps around me
In love that knows no boundaries
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
You're the answer I've been needing.
Life doesn't hold no meaning
Now..
All because of you.
Everything is different,
There's no frame of reference for the way I feel
Would you look at your face
I'm still amazed, I can't believe you're real.
I can lie here forever just watching you sleep
Hanging on every breath that you breathe.
Your touch wraps around me
In love that knows no boundaries
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
You're the answer I've been needing.
Life doesn't hold no meaning
Now..

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

That's right, I don't wake up in the shadows anymore
I can finally breathe
I did a little deep-down searchin'
Took a little time to work it through
But I found everything the day that I had you
I once was the lost one
Like a wayward child
Now you're the light that leads the way
I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I will fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it better than it was for me
You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world since you're my boy
I'll always be your girl
I'm pickin' up all the pieces
When I put 'em back together I'm like new
'Cause my greatest wish has already come true
We'll always be connected, baby
Like a button to a sleeve
And this lullaby will send you off to sleep
It's hard to imagine my life before you
'Cause you're the light that leads the way
I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I will fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it better than it was for me
You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world since you're my boy
I'll always be your girl
I'll be holdin' the rope if you tumble and fall
There's love after love after all
We'll always be connected, baby
You're like a button on my sleeve
And this lullaby…
I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I will fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it better than it was for me
You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world since you're my boy
I'll always be your girl</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Another Year Has Gone By
(Bryan Adams and Eliot Kennedy)
So many 25th's of December
Just as many 4th of July's
And we're still holding it together
It only comes down to you and I
I know you can still remember
Things we said right from the start
When we said that this could be special
I'm keeping those words deep down in my heart
Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by
I never been much for occasions
You never let another birthday go by
Without announcing how much you love me
But the truth was always there
Right there in your eyes
And we're still holding hands when we're walking
Acting like we've only just met
But how can that be - when there's so much history
I guess that's how true lovers can get
Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by
Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye.</field>

These prayers ain't working anymore
Every word shot down in flames
What's left to do with these broken pieces on the floor?
I'm losing my voice calling on you
'Cause I've been shaking
I've been bending backwards till I'm broke
Watching all these dreams go up in smoke
Let beauty come out of ashes
Let beauty come out of ashes
And when I pray to God all I ask is
Can beauty come out of ashes?
Can you use these tears
to put out the fires in my soul?
'Cause I need you here, woah
'Cause I've been shaking
I've been bending backwards till I'm broke
Watching all these dreams go up in smoke
Let beauty come out of ashes
Let beauty come out of ashes
And when I pray to God all I ask is
Can beauty come out of ashes?
Can beauty come out of ashes?</field>

My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
At last
The SKIES above ARE blue
My heart was wrapped UP in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream, that i could speak to
A dream that i, can call my own
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to
A thrill that i, have NEVER known
Oh , Yeah
You SMILED, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last
I FOUND A DREAM
THAT I COULD SPEAK TO
A DREAM THAT I CAN CALL MY OWN
I FOUND A THRILL, TO PRESS MY CHEEK TO
A THRILL THAT I, HAVE NEVER KNOWN
YOU SMILED YOU SMILED
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
FOR YOU ARE MINE

            <field name="lyrics">I leaned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth
And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say, "Come dance with me"
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen
A brown-eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, "Pity, please, the ones who serve
'Cause they only get what they deserve"
And the rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly
So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen
To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me
We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
They call and say, "Come on, dance with me"
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me at seventeen</field>

Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer

Though we've by man outcast relived
Oh, Maiden see a maiden's sorrow
Oh, Mother, hear a suppliant child!

Ave Maria, gratia plena
Maria, gratia plena

The murky cavern's air so heavy
Shall breath of balm if thou hast smiled
Oh, Maiden, hear a maiden pleadin'
Oh, Mother, hear a suppliant child!

C'est tout un autre monde que tu vois a tout regarder d'en haut
Non je ne suis pas la princesse en bleu de ton bois dormant
Tu le vois je suis bien reelle et je veux de toi pour amant
Get down of your wire you the happy artist you the gentle pierrot
It's all another world that you see all looking from up there
No I'm not the blue dressed princess from your sleeping woods
You can see I'm real and I want you as lover
Avec toi
Je veux caresser la vie
Je veux devorer les plus beaux fruits
Je veux pleurer aussi
Avec toi
Je veux partager mes nuits
Je veux embrasser tes ciels de lit
Jusqu'a mon dernier cri
With you
I want to caress the life
I want to devour the most beautiful fruits
I want to cry too

I want to share my nights
I want to kiss your bed's skies
Until my last shout
Tu reves debout et tu restes pur au milieu des loups
C'est pour ca que je t'aime malgre moi et tu m'aimes malgre tout
Non je ne suis pas la sagesse meme et mes sentiments
Ne sont pas faits que d'innocence
Ils sont faits de chair et de sang
You dream awake and you stay pure among the wolves
That's why I love you against my will and you love me against all
No I am not the wisdom itself and my emotions
Are not only made of innocence
They are made from flesh and blood
Avec toi
Je veux caresser la vie
Je veux devorer les plus beaux fruits
Je veux pleurer aussi
Avec toi
Je veux partager mes nuits
Je veux embrasser tes ciels de lit
Jusqu'a mon dernier cri
With you
I want to caress the live
I want to devour the most beautiful fruits
I want to cry too
With you
I want to share my nights
I want to kiss your bed's skies
Until my last shout
Au nom de l'amour je voudrais te voir faire des folies
Renoncer a toi-meme et quelques fois bousculer l'ordre de ta vie
Mais je t'aime trop pour te perdre un jour alors je te dis
Que si toi tu veux rester sage, je serai sage moi aussi
Que si toi tu veux rester sage, je serai sage moi aussi
In the name of love I would like to see you make crazy things
Renounce to yourself and sometimes to knock the order of your life over
But I love you too much to lose you someday so I tell you
That if you want to stay good, I will be good too
That if you want to stay good, I will be good too.</field>

let your worries go
you fall asleep
think of nothing more
memories will keep
your dreams will turn to gold
and you will wake and find
that you hold a smile all day
from this lullaby
maybe somewhere in the silence
you may wake and you're all alone
just call and I'll be there
even when I'm gone
each day will end
so I'll say good night
till we meet again
now baby close your eyes
and rest your weary mind
II'll let you know the joy you bring
every time you hear me sing
you this lullaby

You've been the sweetest part of my life so long
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
This is getting serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us
(chorus)
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice
Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the
memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Baby I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for
a higher ground
'Coz when you're halfway up, you're always halfway
down
But baby this is serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
(breakdown)
Baby this is serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Don't do what you're about to do
My everything depends on you (I depends on you)
And whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
Before you roll those dice

Never sure that love would grow
Now at night as I lay me down to sleep
I could never let you go
And lying here with you, I still can't believe it's true
Never thought that I would ever find a love
That lasts forever
Be the man that's mine
Find the love that never goes away
Be the heart I know will be
The one that beats for me, be the man
Used to be scared if I would ever get this close
I'm not afraid to touch you now
Long before I knew, I'd be making love to you
I dreamed that maybe I would one day
Lose myself in someone, someday
Be the man that's mine
I always try to find the love that never goes away
Be the heart I know will be
The one that beats for me, be the man
Take me where I have never been
I will follow you, you'll never be alone
I will run, run to you
I never thought that I would ever find a love
That lasts forever
Be the man that's mine
I always try to find the love that never goes away
Tell me we will always be together
Make us stay in love this way forever
Be the heart I know will be
The one that beats for me
Wherever you may be</field>

I can hardly wait,
to see you come of age,
but I guess we'll both just have to be patient,
cuz it's a long way to go,
a hard row to hoe
yes it's a long way to go but in the meantime,
before you cross the street,
take my hand,
life is what happens to you,
while you're busy making other plans,
(chorus)
before you go to sleep, say a little prayer,
ev'ry day, in ev'ry way
it's getting better and better.

For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through, through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me</field>

Cut the chord

If I could turn the page

Goodbye forever

Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty heartache
I could breakaway
Is it true what people say
That it's darkest before dawn
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
Any hope we might have saved
Is too weak to let live on
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
And if I really wanna change
Then tonight I'm gonna need all of my strength

Anything is better

I close my eyes
I remember when
Your sweet love filled this empty room
The tears I cry
Won't bring it back again
Unless the lonely star should fall
Call the man
Who deals in love beyond repair
He can heal the world
Of hearts in need of care
Shine a light ahead
When the next step is unclear
Call the man
He's needed here
Needed in the chaos and confusion
From the plains to city hall
Needed where the proud who walk the wire are set to fall
Call the man
Who deals in once upon a time
Maybe he
Can mend this broken heart of mine
Shine a light ahead
Now the future isn't clear
Call the man
He's needed here
Call the man
He's needed here
He's needed here
He's needed here
Call the man
He's needed here
Right here right now</field>

Someplace better than where you've been
A coffe machine that needs some fixin'
In a little cafe just around the bend
Chorus
I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you
A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we both know the change is coming
Come in closer, sweet release
I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you
A desert road from vegas to

Someplace better than where you've been

In a little cafe just around the bend
A hot dry wind blows right through me

Feelin' kinda strange
I don't know what it is but I like the change
That comes over me whenever he's around
It's as if my feet don't even touch the ground
'cause when I'm feelin' down
He's there to pick me up
And when I talk to much
He doesn't interupt
Let me tell you there's no better guy
This is how he makes me feel inside
I wanna dance, I wanna play
Well can you hear my heartbeat
A million miles away
It won't stop, till I drop
And every day and night he tells me
I'm so special that he never could give me up, and
I'm hooked on a feelin' a natural high
You better believe it and the reason why
It's a thing called love
It makes me feel so alive
And I can't fight the feelin'
Somebody told me once
You only get one chance
So live your life and do the best you can
Once a day goes by you never get it back
So live every minute like it was your last
And just dance, come on play
And tell somebody you love them
At least once a day
And don't stop, till you drop
I didn't know that one day someone so special
Would come along to steal my heart
I'm hooked on a feelin' a natural high
You better believe it and the reason why
It's a thing called love
It makes me feel so alive
Love, love love
And john lennon said that was all you need
If you taste it once
It won't be enough
I'm hooked on a feelin' a natural high
You better believe it and the reason why
It's a thing called love
It makes me feel so alive
I'm hooked on a feelin' a natural high
You better believe it and the reason why
It's a thing called love
It makes me feel so alive
And I can't fight the feelin'
I can't fight the feelin'
I can't fight the feelin'
You better believe it
Can't fight the feelin'</field>

'Tis is the night before
And in my heart there is no doubt
That this is gonna be
The brightest holiday
'Cause here you are with me
Baby, baby, I can't wait
To spend this special time of year with someone who
Makes me feel the special way that you do
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe
People smiling everywhere we go
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love
Ooh, you make the season bright
With the lights reflecting in your eyes
All my dreams are comin' true tonight
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love
We'll stay up late tonight
Decorate the tree
Just look into my eyes
And I will tell you truthfully
That I don't need no Santa Claus
To hear my Christmas wish
I got you in my arms
And what could be a better gift
Than to spend my very favorite time of year
With the one I really love so near, Oh Yeeeaahhh
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe
People smiling everywhere we go
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love
Ooh, you make the season bright
With the lights reflecting in your eyes
All my dreams are comin' true tonight
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love
And the bells are ringing when I hear you say
We'll do it all again on Christmas Day
I can't wait
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe
People smiling everywhere we go
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love
Ooh, you make the season bright
With the lights reflecting in your eyes
All my dreams are comin' true tonight
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe
People smiling everywhere we go
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love

don't walk around
with the world on your shoulders

laying on the ground
I know you think
you've gotta try to be my hero
but don't you know
the stars you wish upon
they fall that's true
but I still believe in you

and those seven seas you sail
or the winding road you roam
leave you lost and feeling all alone
let my heart be your beacon home

Plus fort qu'un moment de plaisir
Et plus longtemps qu'un seul ete
Je veux savoir comment t'aimer
Tell me instead hot to love you
What needs to be done to keep you
I hear your voice speaking of everything
I don't hear speaking of us
Farther than three words to say to each other
Stronger than a moment of pleasure
And for longer than a single summer
I want to know how to love you
Du sable entre les mains
Le froid d'un feu d'hier
Un peu de neige en fin d'hiver
Voila ce que je tiens
Sand between my hands
The coldness of a yesterday's fire
A little snow at the end of winter
Here's what I hold
Alors dis-moi comment t'aimer
Ce qu'il faut faire pour te garder
Larmes si je vivais sans toi
Rires le jour ou je te vois
So tell me how to love you
What needs to be done to keep you
Tears if I was living without you
Laughs the day I see you
Plus loin que le dernier soleil
Plus fort encore que l'arc-en-ciel

Stronger than the rainbow
And for longer than a single summer

Does it always have to move
At its own kind of pace
When you're driving on cruise control
Coming off a bumpy ride
And your heart is back in shape
Then it hits you with no chance to hide
But don't you miss out on the way
Don't find a reason to say
Coulda Woulda Shoulda
But I didn't do that
You gotta give it a shot
Dare to believe
And don't say you
Coulda Woulda Shoulda
But I didn't do that
Just throw in everything you've got
'Cause in love there's no holding back
You tell me that you play it safe 'cause you're afraid
To hurt your neck
On that rollercoaster trip
Never knowing what you'd get
But do you wanna be cynical
On a date with destiny
Giving up the greatest rush
Who knows what it turns out to be
No don't you miss out on the way
Don't find a reason to say
Chorus
If it's meant to be
Don't think about it
Let love run free
Cause you're on your way
Follow your heart when it's calling on you
Don't you say

Then you hide just a little bit more
And you lie just a little bit

If you want to keep your love, love alive
You've gotta see the signs
Yeah, Cry
Look into his eyes
And never let him go
You gotta tell him you need him
More than he'll ever know
And he'll be wrapped around your finger
Under your thumb
It really makes a difference
When you know you got his love
First you cry just a little bit (a little bit)
Then you hide just a little bit more
And you lie just a little bit (a little bit)

            <field name="lyrics">Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved
If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again
When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah yeah..
Then finally make me do just what my moma said
Then about night when i want to sleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
If i could steal one final glance, one final step
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
'Cause I'd love, love, love, love
To dance with my father again
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama cried for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me
I know I'm praying for much too much
But could you send back the only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But dear Lord she's dying
To dance with my father again
Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream</field>

Baby, I'm giving you this heart of gold
So listen up, it's you I trust
I feel magic every time that we touch
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love
(Hey of love)
Just like Juliette belonged to Romeo
You can stay prepared that I won't be letting you go
In the heat of the night
So right you taste my sweetness on your lips
I'll make it better than you ever dreamed
And the rest of your life will be just like this

You say you still don't know the reason why
I walked away
I know you thought you were so good to me
I didn't see it that way
My love's not something you can buy and sell
Like pearls on a string
And if you want to know where we went wrong
You ought to stop and think
(Chorus)
Did you give enough love, did you show that you cared?
When I needed understanding were you really there?
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?
Maybe you should ask yourself, did you give enough love?
Did you give enough love?
Good intentions I know you had, right from the start
But if you wonder why we didn't last
Just look inside your heart
(Chorus)
(Bridge)
Did you give enough time when I was alone
When I needed you there to make me feel I belonged
You just don't know what you do to me.</field>

It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up and find it gone

You know you've found it when it hurts
It can drive you off a cliff

Careful where you spend the night

It's just a game of love, love, love
And even though it's hard baby

Tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for

So I got in the car
But I didn't get far
'Cause the radio played
Every song that I sang with you
Yesterday's gone
And it may be true
But you know that
I'll never get over you
It's just a game of love, love love
And even though it hurts me baby I can never give you up

You never see me fall apart

It's just emotion
Taking me over
Caught up in sorrow
Lost in the soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me darling
Don't you know there's
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Don't you know there's
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Kiss goodnight
Goodnight goodnight
I'm there at your side
I'm part of all the things you are
But you got a part of someone else
You go to find your shining star
And where are you now

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion
That's taking me over
Taking me over
Caught up in sorrow
Lost in the soul
But if you don't come back
Yeah yeah yeah
Come home come home come home
Don't you know that there'll be
Nobody to hold me
Nobody to kiss me
Goodnight
And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you you go
I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion emotion yeah
I'm caught up in sorrow
Lost in my soul
Don't you know the nights without you baby
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
Nobody left in this world
To hold me tight
Nobody, nobody to hold me
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Nobody to kiss me goodnight
Goodnight goodnight</field>

That boy is gonna hurt you
His kind of love is not for real
He's only playin'
Foolin' with your heart girl
But I know how he makes me feel
And I don't need any other proof
They just don't understand
They don't know the truth
Momma says he's bad for me
Poppa says I'll be sorry
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
He's not like the others
Nobody wants to see it
They don't even wanna try
Judge a book by its cover
And you'll never know the story
There's so much more than meets the eye
Oh and I know his heart is true
I don't need anyone
To tell me what to do
(chorus)
My sisters and my brothers
Tell me I should find another
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
Oh but they can't feel his touch
They can't feel his kiss
They don't know what it's like to be
Loved like this
I don't care about their point of view
'Cause it's understood
When the love is good
Nothin' else is gonna do
(chorus)
No they don't know what he's all about
Everybody just wanna talk my baby down
No they cant' see that his heart is gold
Everybody wanna treat my baby so cold,
So cold

You don't think of
The devil who's inside
And maybe there'll come one day
When you'll feel safe
And I wont have the time
You'll hear what you wanna hear
Blink once I could disappear
Some rules to the game will make it right for both of us
So just say what you wanna say
I've got it to give away
we both wanna make it last so keep
your eyes on me
Your eyes on me
It's not an illusion
That you're the one
and I have fallen deep
I said right from the start
When we're apart
You must only think of me
Temptation is all around
Take good care of what you've found
That's why when I turn around
You better keep...
You better keep your eyes on me
No matter what you think I need
No matter what you once believed
If you're mine
So you better say yeah
No matter what you think I need
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed
Say yeah
I wanna be the air you breath
Yea you better be everything you said you'd be
So you better say yeah!
I wanna be the only one or we can't go on
No matter what you think I need
You better keep your eyes on me...
Say that you want me
Open up your heart
even if its hard
Say that you need me
Better let 'em know
baby don't put on a show
Say that you need me
tell 'em how you feel
let 'em know its real
And if you love me
never turn your back
gonna keep my eyes on that
Temptation is all around
take good care of what you've found
That's why when I turn around
You better keep...
You better keep your eyes on me
No matter what you think I need
No matter what you once believed
If you're mine
So you better say yeah
No matter what you think I need
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed
Say yeah

Yea you better be everything said you'd be
So you better say yeah!
I wanna be the only one or we can't go on
No matter what you think I need
You better keep your eyes on me...

NOT EVERYTHING LASTS
I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW
EVERYTHING CHANGED
WHEN YOU WALKED AWAY
BUT I'LL SURVIVE SOMEHOW
THOUGH I HAVE REGRETS
I'LL LEARN TO FORGET
AND JUST KEEP MOVIN' ON
'CAUSE WHEN LOVE IS GONE
YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG
ONCE TOUCHED BY PAIN
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME
BUT TIME CAN HEAL YOUR
HEART AGAIN
SO LET THE CLOUDS
THAT BRING YOU DOWN
JUST FADE AWAY
SO I TRY TO SMILE
BUT AFTER A WHILE
THE MEMORIES COME BACK
BUT I WON'T GIVE IN
'CAUSE I KNOW THAT THEN
MY HEART WILL FADE TO BLACK
AND THIS TIME I LEARNED
THAT LOVE CAN BURN
IT'S AN ALL CONSUMING FLAME
THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG
I'VE GOTTA BE STRONG
ONCE TOUCHED BY PAIN
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME
BUT TIME CAN HEAL YOUR
HEART AGAIN
SO LET THE CLOUDS
THAT BRING YOU DOWN
JUST FADE AWAY
I KNOW THAT ONE DAY
I'LL FIND THOSE FEELIN'S AGAIN
BUT UNTIL I DO I'M DOIN'
FINE JUST BY MYSELF
ONCE TOUCHED BY PAIN
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME
BUT TIME CAN HEAL YOUR

JUST FADE AWAY
JUST FADE AWAY(I'm O.K.)

So many times and so many ways
I didn't know just where to go,
You gave me a sign and opened my eyes
That's the reason why I know
That you are different, you're still here
I guess you figured me out right then
Now I believe that we can make it through

And it feels so good falling into you
I was afraid to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground
I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are
Catch me, don't let me drop!
Love me, don't ever stop!
So close your eyes and let me kiss you
And while you sleep I will miss you
I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are
Falling into you

Never know how much I care.
When you put your arms around me
I get a Fever that's so hard to bear.
You give me Fever,
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
Fever all through the night
Ev'rybody's got the Fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet,
Juliet she felt the same.
When he pout his arms around her,
He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame."
You give me Fever,
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
Fever all through the night
Captain Smith and Pocahantas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him, she said,
" Oh daddy, don't you dare."
He gives me Fever,
When you kiss me
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus
Daddy won't you treat him right
Now you've listened to my story
Here's a point that I have made.
Chicks were born to give you Fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever,
When you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn.
Fever , 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn</field>

Fly beyond imagining
The softest cloud, the whitest dove
Upon the wind of heaven's love
Past the planets and the stars
Leave this lonely world of ours
Escape the sorrow and the pain
And fly again
Fly, fly precious one
Your endless journey has begun
Take your gentle happiness
Far too beautiful for this
Cross over to the other shore
There is peace forevermore
But hold this mem'ry bittersweet
Until we meet
Fly, fly do not fear
Don't waste a breath, don't shed a tear
Your heart is pure, your soul is free
Be on your way, don't wait for me
Above the universe you'll climb
On beyond the hands of time
The moon will rise, the sun will set
But I won't forget
Fly, fly little wing
Fly where only angels sing
Fly away, the time is right
Go now, find the light</field>

As I rock you gently
Right here in my arms
I promise to always
Be here for you

Sometimes in the middle of the night
I wake up cryin when I think of how long
It took to find you
And now that I have I won't be movin on
Nothing can ever separate us
We know where we belong
All I'm asking you
All I'm asking
Before this moment's gone
Forget me not
Don't forget what we got
Every day is surely but a dream
I found the sweetest of all things
For all my life
Youll be my light
With every beat that's in your heart
Oh baby please remember to
Forget me not
Time is funny
Time can fly
That's one thing for sure
Ill wake tomorrow
Blink my eyes
See you standin at that door
And I'll be lookin at you
See the wonder of what love can be
Someday I might have to let you go
And that's just so hard to believe
And if I do you'll know just
How much you mean to me
And all I'll ask of you
All I'll ask you
Before I set you free
Forget me not
Don't forget what we got
Every day is surely but a dream
I found the sweetest of all things
For all my life
Youll be my light
With every beat that's in your heart
Oh baby please remember to
Forget me not

You gave life to me
Turned a baby into a lady
And mamma
All you had to offer
Was the promise of a lifetime of love
Now I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And I know
A love so complete
Someday must leave
Must say goodbye
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
Mamma
You gave love to me
Turned a young one into a woman
And mamma
All I ever needed
Was a guarantee of you loving me
'Cause I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And it hurts so
That something so strong
Someday will be gone, must say goodbye
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
But the love you give will always live
You'll always be there every time I fall
You offered me the greatest love of all
You take my weakness and you make me strong
And I will always love you 'till forever comes
And when you need me
I'll be there for you all the way
I'll be there your whole life through
I'll be there this I guarantee, mamma
I'll be
I'll be there through the darkest nights
I'll be the wings that guide your broken flight
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm
And I will love you 'till forever comes
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
'Till we meet again...
Until then...
Goodbye</field>

Walking with your hand in mine
Feel so fine
When I'm close to you
I know what it means to want to be true
Never felt this way before
Is there more
Are you feeling the same as me honestly
Don't you think it's unreal
I'm not dealing in fairy tales
If this fails
I don't know what on earth I will do 'cause I'm
Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't want to give it up
'Cause I'm already falling in love
When we reach that place
I'm dying to see the smile on your face
I'm so sure you'll want to stay
That's okay
I have so many dreams to share
Please be there
Let me share them with you
If you're looking for happiness nothing less
Come with me, baby I'm looking too and I'm
Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't want to give it up
'Cause I'm already falling now
Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't want to give it up
'Cause I'm already falling in love
I don't want to give my life in moderation (baby no)
I'm prepared to give myself up to temptation it's time
I could use a little love and inspiration (baby now)
Come and share the joy and join the celebration
It's time
Hoping and praying that soon you'll be saying be mine
I don't want to give it up
I don't want to give it up
'Cause I'm already falling in love.</field>

Have you ever been in love, have you
The time I spent Waiting
For something that was heaven sent
When you find it don't let go
I know
Have you ever said a prayer
And found that it was answered
All my hopes have been restored
And I ain't looking anymore
Have you ever been so love, have you
Some place that you ain't leaving
Somewhere you're gonna stay
When you finally found that meaning
Have you ever felt this way
The time I spent waiting
For something that was heaven sent
When you find it, don't let go
I know
Coz have you ever been in love, so love
You could touch the moonlight
You can even reach the stars
Doesn't matter near or far
Have you ever been so in love
Cause have you ever been in love
Have you ever been in love
So, in love</field>

Changing my life with one wave of his hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There running my hands thru his hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be someone is speaking
But he doesn't know she's there
I want him everywhere
and if he's beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there
To be here and everywhere here there and everywhere
I want him everywhere
and if he's beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share

How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading, too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your ways
And how do you not run out of few things to say?
And since we know, we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name
I know the way I feel for him
It's now or never
The more I love the more that I'm afraid
That in his arms I may not see forever
Forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it better as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose
The music never ends
I know the way I feel for him
It's now or never!
The more I love the more that I'm afraid
That in his arms I may not see forever
Forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it better as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose
The music never ends</field>

            <field name="lyrics">How does a moment last forever?
How can a story never die?
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try
Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow, our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will
Minutes turn to hours, days to years and gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on
Maybe some moments weren't so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or our lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
We'll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on
How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, perceives and perseveres
And makes us whole
Minutes turn to hours, days to years and gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on
How does a moment last forever?
When our song lives on</field>

You hear your voice as it echoes
The heart of a man as he grows will glow
Sing a hymn
Sing a hymn for your brothers
Everybody needs to know
Sing a hymn for your father
And following the sun will grow
Sing a hymn for your father</field>

Ce que tu es pour lui
If it's a friend

What you are for him
Celui qui peut t'aimer
Sans jamais te juger
Celui qui reste quand les autres t'ont deja quitte
The one who can love you
Without ever judging you
The one that stays when the others already left you
Je dis que si c'est un ami
Alors tu as bien reussi ta vie
Tu as deja trouve l'etoile du berger
Et tu n'es plus seul sur la route
I say that if it's a friend
Then you have succeeded in your life
You already found the evening star
And you're not alone anymore on the road
Si c'est un ami
Donnes ton pain et ton vin et ta vie
Et refais le monde comme l'ont fait trois cents fois

If it's your friend
Tell him so he'll sing and sing with him
Friendship is the most beautiful country
Si c'est un ami
S'il devient fou quand tu fais des folies
S'il te montre parfois qu'il avait peur pour toi
Si rien de moins que le meilleur ne le satisfait pour toi
If it's a friend
If he becomes crazy when you do crazy things
If he shows you sometimes he feared for you
If nothing less than the best satisfies him for you
Je dis que si c'est un ami
Alors tu as reussi ta vie
Chacun de son cote
On est que deux moities
A deux on franchit des montagnes

We're only thow halves

Friendship is the most beautiful country
Si c'est un ami
S'il a ton rire s'il a tes larmes aussi
Si les memes coleres
Le prennent quand la terre
Avec ses trompettes et ses guerres
S'en va de travers
If it's your friend
If he has your laughing if he has your tears too
If he has the same angers
Fill him when the earth
With its trumpets and its wars
Goes wrong
Je dis que si c'est un ami
Tu peux dire un grand merci a la vie
Puisqu'elle a fait de lui
Un frere que tu choisis
Et le compagnon de la chance
I say that if he's a friend
You can say a huge thank you to life
Because it made of him
A brother you choose
And the companion of luck

Coeur ouvert

Suis ton étoile
Va jusqu'où ton rêve t'emporte
Un jour tu le toucheras
Si tu crois si tu crois si tu crois
En toi

N'éteins pas la flamme que tu portes
Au fonds de toi souviens-toi
Que je crois que je crois que je crois
En toi

Someday you'll find me, too
And when I hold you close
I'll know that it's true

Can't stand in my way, I'd go on
Brutal machines, unbending laws
Can't slow me down, I'd go on
I've learned how to deal and when to fight
I know what's real, I know what's right
I'm not afraid, a wounded dove
I can be tender in a world so tough
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know
The winds of the heart can blow me down
But I get right up and I stand my ground
I've tasted fear, my share of pain
The wasted tears of love in vain
I've held you tight, pushed you away
Now with all my might I beg you to stay
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know
I know what I want, I know what I need
But there's just one thing I must believe
Deep in the night by a dying flame
You will be there when I call your name
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you was just burning me up inside
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night
What in this world keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go
I hear the beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark
Uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?

Woke you from your sleep to make love to you

Too much, too much baby all I do is think
About you night and day I feel too -
Too much, too much baby don't let go 'cause
It's my heart you're takin'
The spell that I'm under I can't undo
But baby I wonder do you feel it too
A classic case of infatuation
Is it possible that I feel

It's a serious connection when I look into your eyes
When you show me your affection, it's more than I
Realized.</field>

Tired of giving love to you that you don't deserve
So this is my way of saying it's over
Cause I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left
I gave you my best and you treated it worthless
So I've got nothing
Anybody ever tell you that you're gonna learn
Trust and respect are two things you must earn
When it came to loving me you just weren't concerned
You never gave a damn so I guess it's my turn

So done with you
Maby, we're through

(The) Heavens are still there
When skies are gray
Some days are better
Than they seem
Some days are better
Because you dream
On rainbows to rainbows
On starlight to star
To dream isn't that what
Tomorrow is for
Only a dreamer knows what I know
What it's like to wonder
And then let go
On rainbows to rainbows
I know what I seem
I have to wonder

Now wrapped in moonlight
At last together
Here in the incandescent glow
We are all we need to know
As we softly please each other
'Til the stars and shadow glow
And we sleep
With our dreams around us.
Oooohhhh ahhhhhh
Ooohhhhohhhh
It guided me
It knew you'd be here
I knew I loved you
Before I found you
I knew I'd built my world around you
Now all my days
And all my nights
And my tomorrows
Will all begin
And end
With you...
With you.

Time has taught me this
I will fly
And you'll be there to guide me
Straight up to my heart's highest wish
I feel you close to me
And I know what love is
Now there's no mountain
Too high for me to climb
No ocean so wide
That I could not reach the other side
Now I believe in me
Cause you live and breather in me
And nothing can come between
We are one star
No nigh can darken, Oh
I will fall
And you will catch me always
Time has taught me this
I will fly
And you'll be there to guide me
Straight up to my heart's highest wish
I feel you close to me
And I know what love is
It's an unspoken thing
A quiet opening
There are no words that can go that deep
But I know
I know

But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch
To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time
So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time
Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there
I love you, please say
You love me too
Please say you love me too
Till the end of time
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Oh, I love you Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time
My baby Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes

When you love someone as much as I love you
Oh I don't wanna leave you
Baby it tears me up inside

Baby, its never gonna work out

            <field name="lyrics">Ooh Baby, hmmm
Listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me
I met an angel on Christmas day
Twentyfourth of December
It was a cold and snowing night
I still can remember Gazing at the stars and the moonlight
Fell asleep on a sofabed
Dreams of Christmas in my head
But I woke up to my surprise
There he was right in front of my eyes
Listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me
I met an angel on Christmas day
I was stuffing the stockings
And hanging tincel on the tree
When I heard him knocking
I opened the door in time to see
Carollers sing "Silver Bells"
I saw his face, that's when I fell
He was there bent on one knee
Santa sent him just for me
Listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me
I met an angel on a Christmas day
Yeah, yeah
And I know this love will grow
When flowers bloom in early spring
I'll be his bride
I'll wear his ring
So if your looking for an angel who,
Is gonna make your every dream come true
Just write a letter saying Santa hey,
I'll need an angel next Christmas day'
Yeah
Yeah, yeah baby
Ooh
Ding, ding, dong, ding
Listen up what I got to say, hey
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring and ring in me
I met an angel on a Christmas day
Ooh, listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring
Chapel bells are gonna ring
I met an angel on a Christmas day
Listen up to what I got to say
True love and it's on its way
I met an angel on a Christmas day
Yeah
On a Christmas day
Ooh
Ooh baby</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I remember L.A.
Seems a lifetime ago
We were stars on Sunset Boulevard
What a movie we made
There were days in the sun
That have stayed forever young
Nights when passion was invincible
We tought love would never die
(Chorus)
There were moments in that lifetime
That my heart still replays
There were minutes, there were hours, there were days
There are moments I still love you that same way
When I remember L.A.
I remember goodbye
I watched your plane out of sight
Love was over, time to close the book
Still I go back for one last look.</field>

I've left to live
And this fire's burning still
When I watch you look at me
I think I could find the will
To stand for every dream
And forsake this solid ground
And give up this fear within
Of what wound happen if they end, you
I'm in love whith you
Chorus
Cause I'd surrender everything
To feel the chance, to live again
I reach to you
I know you can feeel it too
We'd make it throught
A thousand dreams I still believe
I'd make you give them all to me
I'd hold you in my arms and never let go
I surrender
I know
I can't survive another night away from you
You're the reason I go on
And now I need to live the truth
Right now, there's no better time
From this fear, I will break free
And I'll live again with love
And know they can't take away from me
And they will see..
yeah
(I'd surrender everything)
To feel the chance, to live again
I reach to you
I know you can feel it too
We'd make it through
Chorus
Every night gets longer
And this fire is getting stonger baby
I'll swallow my pride
And I'll be alive
Can't you hear my call?
I surrender all
(I'd surrender everything)
To feel the chance to live again
I reach to you
I know you can feel it too
We'd make it through
A thousand dreams I still believe

            <field name="lyrics">Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With "boy thought I told you not to go outside"
Tryin' your best to bring the
Water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her
From woopin' your behind
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so
Brother says he's tellin'
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin'it-it sure felt outta sight
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go</field>

I'm glad that I'm alive
You've set my heart on fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman
On clouds above
I couldn't get much higher
My spirit takes flight
Cause I'm alive
Ohh

Through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait for the rest of my life
When you call on me

When you reach for me

I get wings to fly
I feel that
When you bless the day

I just drift away

All my worries die
I know that I'm alive, yeah

I'm lost in everything you do
I love you
I'm saving every moment for you
You're hidden in a place that's safe and true
Lovin' everything we do
With every second
You hold me near
I'm closer to a place I want to be
To hear you whisper
But no one else can hear
I want your love
To stay forever-inside of me
I'm loving every moment with you
I'm living in a dream that's comin' true
I'm lost in everything you do
I love you
I'm saving every moment for you
You're hidden in a place that's safe and true
Lovin' everything we do
In our silence
Looking in your eyes
I hear words you don't need to say
Just hold on baby
'Cause it's reason-I'm prayin'
You feel what I feel.</field>

All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No rivers too wide, for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray
And then you will see, the morning will come
And everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see...
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
I saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It doesn't have to be this way, let me show you a better day
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears, just cast them on me
How can I make you see...
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep up safe and warm
And I know we will survive
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the sky...
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I am your angel</field>

I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me can't you see
I am in love
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I've got a hold of that string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let go

Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger

If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand

There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
The doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear
We're lost in a cloud
With too much rain
We're trapped in a world
That's troubled with pain
But as long as a man
Has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly
Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answer gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle
And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, please let my dream
Come true, right now
Let it come true right now

Would be the ones I'd hold so close

You lose what means the most

Higher than any star in sight

These are the things that I would do
If I were you
Simple pleasures
The hardest to be found
Can't be measured
'Till they're not around
Maybe she'll go
Maybe she'll stay
But she'd rather go than fade away
Sometimes the sweetest sorrow
Is the saddest fate

You gave me compliments and too much wine
I've played that game..
I know all the moves
You show emotion but you hide what you feel
You play the innocent but I've watched you steal
I rest my case..
you stand accused
But I must confess I was quite impressed
You seduced me with your easy charm
And I must admit I could fall for it
But if love is out the question
There's no point to this affection
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need
'Cos if love is out the question
Put a little heart in your intention
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need...
You talk in circles when I need a straight line
You've got your principles and I've got mine
We all need commitment that's all I ask
(Is that a crime?)
And I must confess I was quite impressed
I was losing to your winning ways
But I must resist there's no point to this
But if love is out the question
There's no point to this affection
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need...
'Cos if love is out the quesion I just gotta stop
Little point to this affection I just wanna stop
It makes no sense to carry on like this
If there's nothing between us you don't know
what you'll miss
No love
There's no love
Baby it's true
There's no love
But if love is out the question
There's no point to this affection
'Cos if love is out the question
Put a little heart in your intention

You're the bravest of hearts, you're the strongest of souls
You're my light in the dark, you're the place I call home
You can say it's all right, but I know that you're breaking up inside
I see it in your eyes
Even you face the night afraid and alone
That's why I'll be there
When the storm rises up, when the shadows descend
Ev'ry beat of my heart, ev'ry day without end
Ev'ry second I live, that's the promise I make
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes
If that's what it takes
You can sleep in my arms, you don't have to explain
When your heart's crying out, baby, whisper my name
'Cause I've reached out for you when the thunder is crashing up above
You've given me your love
When your smile like the sun that shines through the pain
That's why I'll be there
When the storm rises up, when the shadows descend
Ev'ry beat of my heart, ev'ry day without end
I will stand like a rock, I will blend till I break
Till there's no more to give, if that's what it takes
I will risk everything, I will fight, I will bleed
I will lay down my life, if that's what you need
Ev'ry second I live, that's the promise I make
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes
Through the wind and the rain, through the smoke and the fire
When the fear rises up, when the wave's ever higher
I will lay down my heart, my body, my soul
I will hold on all night and never let go
Ev'ry second I live, that's the promise I make
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes
If that's what it takes
Every day
If that's what it takes

hey...never felt like this before
that you'll always be the one for me
two people making memories
just too good to tell
these songs are never ending

we're painting pictures
making magic
taking chances
making love

I love you so
I love you so
when I'm feeling weak
you give me wings
when the fire has no heat
you light it up again
when I hear no violins
you play my every string
stop the press
hold the news

            <field name="lyrics">I never found out why you walked away
And never said good bye
But now that I see you
I'm torn inside, but I've still got my pride
I understand that some things are better left unsaid
I'm afraid of the truth
But what can I do if I still want you
If we could start over again
I know if we try our love could be stronger
If we could start over again
I'm sure, wo oh
We'd never have to let go
For so many years now
I've held inside things I meant to say
But faced with the past now I realize
I can't let that stand in our way
I never knew that a love so strong would never fade
But what can we do
If I still want you
And you want me too
How can we walk away
From something that was once so strong.</field>

Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in
But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life, forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to
Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling darling since
I've found you
That I've found my home
That I'm finally home
I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me darling
I said I needed, needed to be free
But if you asked me to...
Ask me to, I will give my world to you baby
I need you now
Ask me to, I'll do anything for you baby, for you baby
If you asked me to
I'd let you in my life forever
If you asked me to.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Here they come
Every night the same
Silent stars
Light from a distant flame
Just like the memories of you
That I hold inside
I see you touch
But all the warmth has died
Empty rooms
Crowded by the past
Time is my enemy
Days keep moving faster
But the nights alone can be
An eternity
That never heals the scars
Of foolish pride
If only you could see me now
Goodbye is not so easy now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
That you alone can break
And you would free me now
Your heart would come undone
Just looking at me once
And my love would bring you back
If only you could see me now
Here I am
Stranger to a smile
Trying to fight the tears
Missing by a mile
I'm not the one who laughed at you
On that yesterday
When you warned me not to throw your love away
If you could only see me now
Goodbye is not so easy now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
I know your heart would break
If you could hear me now
Your heart would come undone
If you could hear me once
Hoping love will bring you back
If only you could see me now
(Bridge)
Like the lonely moon
You see above
That sails the dark alone
Forever
I have no light of my own
Other the love we've known
So long ago
Together
If you could feel me now
Your heart would come undone
If you could touch me once
I know love will bring you back.</field>

And I must follow on the road that lies ahead,
And I won't let my heart control my head,
But you are my only
And we don't say goodbye,
We don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be
Immortality
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me, inside
Fulfill your destiny,
Is there within the child,
My storm will never end,
My fate is on the wind,
The king of hearts, the joker's wild,
But we don't say goodbye,
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me
Cos I have found a dream that must come true,
Every once of me must see it through,
But you are my only
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play,
Hand over my heart I'll find my way,
I will make them give to me
Immortality
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me, inside
And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
With all my love for you
And what else we may do
We don't say, goodbye</field>

Don't give me that same old speech
You don't have to speak at all
You can say you love me
That I'm your perfect crush
How it hurts to need someone that much
You can swear you mean it
But that ain't good enough
Cuz when a man loves a woman it is all
In his touch
I wish you could see (yeah)
Just how simple
It's supposed to be
'Cause now that we've come this far
We don't want to lose it
If you wanna win my heart
Baby just shut your mouth
You can say you love me
That I'm your perfect crush
How it hurts to need someone that much
You can swear you mean it
But that ain't good enough
Cuz when a man loves a woman it is all
In his touch...

But if we give a little of our love away
Maybe meet in the middle
Every night and day
If we could hear just a whisper
Of what the heart needs to say
If could sure make a difference
In some small...
In some small way
In your heart lies the key that unlocks your destiny
Look within and we'll find everything we're longing for
(Chorus)
Oh...
May you cherish each moment you live
And know all the love that you give
Will go on and on and on
There's a sky vast and blue, and it lies deep insideof you
Breathe it in, let it out, breathe it in again

We'll go down in history

If a love as strong as ours
Couldn't make it all the way
Can anything make sense at all
If a love so deep and true
Couldn't stand the test of time
Then mount everest could slide
And jeruselem could fall
Is nothing sacred anymore Is forever just another word Is a promise something people used to keep
When love was worth fighting for
If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore?
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore?
I can hear the final words
Every sentence that was said
Don't know what turned our lives around
It doesn't matter who was right
There's no justice in a dream
Never thought a heart could break
Without making any sound
Is nothing sacred anymore
Is forever just another word
Is a promise something people used to keep
When love was worth fighting for
If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore?
If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Our love was as certain as the dawn
As solid and save as any love could be
Our love was the star you wished upon
And you thought that I saved you
Could've sworn that you saved me
Is nothing sacred anymore
Is forever just another word
Is a promise something people used to keep
When love was worth fighting for
If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore
Is nothing sacred anymore
Is forever just another word
Is a promise something people used to keep
When love was worth fighting for
If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore
If we can say good-bye

            <field name="lyrics">There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby baby
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now
If you forgive all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me now
(it's all coming back to me now)
When you kiss me like this
(it's all coming back to me now)
When I touch you like that
(it's all coming back to me now)
If you do it like this
(it's all coming back to me now)

And when we will have done the tour of our projects
When we will learn to love our failures and our regrets
When we will be to open our souvenir books
I will sing, I will sing, I will sing, I will always sing
Quand les reves de nos enfants deviendront nos esperances
Quand leurs chagrins d'amour seront les notres et notre souffrance
Quand nos regards nous suffiront, quand nos pas seront les memes
Je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai toujours
When our children's dreams will become our hopes
When their love grieves will be ours and our suffering
When our looks will be enough, when our steps will be the same
I will sing, I will sing, I will sing, I will always sing
On dit ces choses, on oublie parfois, quand on reve
Ou qu'on est ivre
Je te les dirai 100 000 fois, et ca m'aide tant a vivre
We say those things, we forget sometimes, when we dream
Or when we are drunk
I will tell you them 100,000 times, and it helps me so much to live
Quand nos passes, quand tous ces jours seront notre vraie richesse
Quand je saurai tout de tes dons, quand je saurai tes faiblesses
Quand l'amour aura d'autres gouts que la passion, le desir
Je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai toujours
When our pasts, when all those days will be our true wealth
When I will know all about your gifts, when I will know their weaknesses
When love will have other tastes than passion, desire
I will sing, I will sing, I will sing, I will always sing
Et je t'aimerai, je t'aimerai, je t'aimerai comme au premier jour
Je chanterai, je t'aimerai, je chanterai, je chanterai toujours
Je chanterai toujours

Je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai toujours

A force de la regarder
Je commence a me demander
Si ma tele ne va pas m'avaler
By seeing it so much
I begin to wonder
If my head won't swallow me
Dehors les neons s'allument
All right!
J'prefere regarder la lune
All night , , ,
Etendue nue sur mon lit
Dans la chaleur de la nuit
Outside neon tubes turn on
All right!
I prefer to watch the moon
All night, , ,
Laid naked on my bed
In the night's heat

Hurlent comme des loups
Je voudrais comme Alice

To fall in a big hole, , ,

The old Chevy's dead they tried to fix it in vain
Elisa's got her first teeth, little Jimmy is getting strong
I'm learning guitar I almost know a song
I've found some chanterelle at the market this morning
I'd like to live in Rome, oh it would be such a good thing
Try to grow some flowers, the same I tried before
That's all for now
Oh yes je t'aime encore
But where are you
So far with no address
How's life for you
My hope is my only caress
Finally cut my hair, I hear you say at last
It's been kind of strange but you see I survived
When I'm asked I go out, I dance all night and more
But when I dance
Je t'aime encore
But where are you
So far with no address
How's life for you
Time is my only caress
Je t'aime encore lust like in an old fashioned song
And it burns in my soul, anything else seems too long

With you I've laughed and cried
I have lived and died

I know I must forget you and go on
I can't hold back my tears too long
Though life won't be the same
I've got to take the blame
And find the strenght I need to let you go
Just walk away
Just say goodbye
Don't turn around now you may see me cry
I mustn't fall apart
Or show my broken heart
Or the love I feel for you
So walk away
And close the door
And let my life be as it was before
And I'll never never know
Just how I let you go
But there's nothing left to say
Just walk away
There'll never be a moment I'll regret
I've loved you since the day we met
For all the love you gave
And all the love we made
I know I've got to find the strenght to say
Just walk away
Just say goodbye
Don't turn around now you may see me cry
I mustn't fall apart
Or show my broken heart
Or the love I feel for you
So walk away
And close the door
And let my life be as it was before
And I'll never never know
Just how I let you go
But there's nothing left to say.</field>

We realize
We're always alone in the world

            <field name="lyrics">I understand that you’ve met someone
With a perfect heart
But you’ve been questioned by everyone;
Are you’re in the dark?
Can you choose to fall,
Should you risk it all?
How’m I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I’m on your side
And I understand you’re the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide (you’re the only one)
Some may tell you don’t take the risk
It’s a waste of time
But if you think you’ll find happiness
Baby take the dive
It’s unusual
But it’s critical
How’m I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I’m on your side
And I understand you’re the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide (you’re the only one)
Give it up
How’m I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I’m on your side
And I understand you’re the only one to know
Whether wrong or right

            <field name="lyrics">"Let's Talk About Love"
Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land
I've never seen
There are people around the world -
different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that
reminds me we're the same...
Let's talk about love
From the laughter of a child to the tears
of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us
all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker
to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the
very last refrain...
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about us
Let's talk about life
Let's talk about trust
Let's talk about love
It's the king of all who live and the
queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your
sleeve - till the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of
any storm
But as gentle as a falling leave on any
autumn morn...
Let's talk about love - it's all we're
needin'
Let's talk about us - it's the air we're
breathin'
Let's talk about life - I wanna know you
Let's talk about trust - and I wanna show
you
Let's talk about love</field>

The picture of a broken man
Your confidence is shaken
The world caved in on you again
But I know what to do to ease the pain
And bring you back to life again, , ,

A little bit of love
Can go a long way sometimes
A little bit of love
Is really all you need
When life gets tough you need
A little bit of love sometimes
Oh baby hold me
Let all that anger disappear
A little smile is showing
Something's catching fire here
And when the morning comes you'll be good as new
You'll take this night that we've shared with you, , ,

Is stronger than anything
Words ain't enough, , , you need, , ,

Get up off the floor, and jump right back in
Baby, I still believe in you
And we'll see this through
'Cause true love is on our side

I want a chance to live

For the one I love
Love
As no one has loved
Give
Asking nothing in return
Free, free to find my way
Free to have my say
Free to see the day
Be like I used to be
Like a wild bird free
With all of life in me
Live
For the one I love
Love
As no one has loved
Give
Asking nothing in return
Though this world tears us apart
We're still together in my heart
I want the world to hear my cry
Even if I have to die
Love will not die
Love will change the world
Live
For the one I love
Love
As no one has loved
Give
Asking nothing in return
I'll love until love wears me away
I'll die and I know my love will stay
And I know..
I know my love will stay</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Somewhere past midnight
When the moment is just right
We ride the streets of desire
We take it slow and
Always get where we're goin'
'Cause where there's smoke there's a fire
There's no denying
We don't need to keep trying
Let's face the music and dance
Well it's all semantic
What we never say
But what we feel ain't goin' away 
.
So I wonder - how could we be feeling
More than this
Tell me true
What it is, 'cause
Something has to make us feel this way
Love by another name
Doesn't matter 'cause it's still the same love
Won't depend on the words we say
Love by another name
Something happens when we're making love
Si ce n'est pas l'amour
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
We're superstitious
When every day is like Christmas
It should be left undisturbed
No promise spoken
Hearts don't have to get broken
More than a four letter word
If we're just pretending
We can write a new ending
If we don't like where it leads
Well it's new romantic
Action over words
The sweetest nothings that I've heard
I can't tell you everything I'm feeling
More than this
Do you know
What it is, 'cause
I know that I can't describe
What I'm feeling inside
Maybe I'll learn
I guess I live with the fear
This could all disappear
If I try to put in words.</field>

Just a little trust
If you believe in love
Love can move mountains
Believe in your heart
And feel, feel it in your soul
And love baby love can love can move mountains
Oceans deep and mountains high
They can't stop us
Because love is on our side baby
We can reach the heavens and touch the sky
Just believe it,
Believe in you and I baby
If we got love that is strong enough
We can do anything,
make it through anything
Coz through it all love will always find a way

Don't ask me if this feeling's right or wrong
It doesn't have to make much sense
It just has to be this strong
'Cause when you're in my arms I understand
We don't try to have a voice
When our hearts make the choices
There's no plan
It's in our hands
Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that
Love doesn't think twice
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance
Now I can feel what you're afraid to say
If you give your soul to me
Will you give too much away
We can't let this moment pass us by
Can't question this chance
Or expect any answers
We can try
But love doesn't ask you why
(Instrumental)
So let's take what we found
And wrap it around us
Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains

with pictures of smiling faces.
But there's a different story told inside,
underneath it all.
With the sunglasses and makeup on,
blaming the stairs and bases.
They all knew (didn't even ask is something wrong),
so they wait...
Now she's gone.
I don't understand the concept of,
the power of one is stronger.
Why don't people seem to care at all,
as long as it's not about them...
I say....
I guess we've underestimated love,
well why would we hurt each other.
Don't you find that, ironical ?
When Love Is All We Need oh yeah
He is living down his sunset strip,
singing the blues for money.
It's easy just to look the other way,
when you have it all.
He's reaching out to find a helping hand,
but nobody seems to bother.
Hear them say (It's not my problem so it's not my call.)
You're on your own
Through it all.
I don't understand the concept of,
the power of one is stronger.
Why don't people seem to care at all,
as long as it's not about them...
I say....
I guess we've underestimated love,
well why would we hurt each other.
Don't you find that, ironical ?
When Love Is All We Need oh yeah
When all becomes too real..
We have a tendency to be..
Too scared to face it.
It's breaking my heart..
to see...
When Love Is All We Need
I don't understand the concept of,
the power of one is stronger.
Why don't people seem to care at all,
as long as it's not about them...
I say....
Guess we've underestimated love,

Love is on the way
On wings of angels
I know its true, I feel it coming through
Love is on the way
Time is turning the pages
I don't know when
But love will find me again
I am not afraid
Of the mystery of tomorrow
I have found the faith deep within
There's a promise I have made
There's a dream I'm gonna follow
There's another chance to begin
And it's coming as sure as the heavens
I can feel it right here in my heart
Love is on the way
On wings of angels

Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep, inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me
Goodnight, my angel, it's now, it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry, and if you sing this lullaby
Then in your heart there will always be a part of me
Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabys go on and on
They never die

Un meuble a trois tiroirs d'amour
D'amour
A schoolboy exercise book
A notebook for loves
Life comes from the same floor
Wind comes from the backyard
A drawing table
A dressing gown red and black
Charlie Brown and Tintin
A furniture with three drawers of love
Of love
Les bagues et les photos
Dans le tiroir d'en haut
Des adieux douloureux
Dans celui du milieu
Quand ma chambre s'eteint
Et se rallume ailleurs
J'entend mes robes a fleurs
Des bouts et des ravins d'amour
D'amour
Rings and photos
In the top drawer
Painful goodbyes
In the middle one
When my room lights out
And lights on elsewhere
I hear my dresses with flowers
Some pieces and some ravins of love
Of love
Et les fermoirs de collier
Les souliers de Lanvin
Je les entend parler
Quand ma chambre s'eteint
And the clasps of necklace
Shoes from Lanvin
I hear them talking
When my room lights out
Je reviendrai toujours, toujours, toujours, toujours
La vie vient de la cour
Toujours, toujours, toujours
Le vent vient de mon amour
I always, always, always, always come back
Life comes from the backyard
Always, always, always
Wind comes from my love
Les rideaux sont en soie au Waldorf Astoria
La chasse est en argent a l'Hotel Saint-Amant
Ma chambre est en papier
Les murs sont en amour
Les plus beaux d'un cote
De l'autre les plus lourds d'amour
D'amour
The curtains are made of silk at the Waldorf Astoria
The flush is in silver at the Saint-Amant hotel
My room is in paper
The walls are in love
The most beautiful on one side
On the other the heaviest of love
Of love
La vie vient du palier
Le vent vient de la cour
Ma chambre est habitee
Par des secrets d'amour
Qui commencent a l'ecole
Et se rendent ce soir
Coucher dans des gondoles
Et des boites a mouchoirs d'amour
D'amour
Life comes from the same floor
Wind comes from the backyard
My room is filled
By love secrets
That begin at the school
And go tonight
Sleeping into gondolas
And boxes of tissues of love
Of love
Moi quand j'ai besoin de vous
C'est ici que je viens
A la peche aux bisous
A la chasse aux calins
Je reviendrai toujours, toujours, toujours, toujours
Me, when I need you
It's here I come
For kisses fishing
For hugs hunting
I will always, always, always, always come back
La vie vient de la cour
Toujours, toujours, toujours
Le vent vient de mon amour
Je reviendrai toujours, toujours, toujours
Parler a mes amours
Toujours, toujours, toujours
Le vient de mon amour
Life comes fro the backyard
Always, always, always
Wind comes from my love
I will always, always, always, always come back
Talking to my loves
Always, always, always.</field>

I wanna be the one to make you happy
I wanna be the one to give you hope
But in these days of conscious living
We've got to take it slow
You can't be sure of who you've met
You just don't know what you might get
Cause in these crazy times we're living
Love can turn into regret
But you, could be the one
to change my point of view
It's all up to you
Give you love without the pain
Show you light beyond the rain
Gonna make you happy
Gonna make you happy now
There'll be days when things go wrong
I'll be there to make you strong
Gonna make you happy
Gonna make you happy
I wanna find a place where dreams can happen
I wanna find a love who'll take me there
And in your eyes I see a vision
That makes me want to care
And if two people both agree
That only love can set them free
Then together let us make a world
Of which others only dream
And you can be the one to make it all come true
So what you gonna do
I'll give you love without the pain
Show you light beyond the rain
Gonna make you happy
Gonna make you happy now

Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs
A summer disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer:
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer:
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart
You can't close your, your mind!
Then you close your mind!
That man, that man, that man, that man
That man, that man You know..
that man
have been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)

Under the stars
Riding on horses
Boys with guitars
If you really want to get the root of me
You don't have to try so hard
Give me a reason to dance in the dark
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart
If you wanna know how to get to me
Follow the map to my heart
I cry for no reason
I laugh at awkward moments
There's no manual that explains where I'm going
So show me the way, show me the way
White chocolate kisses
Under the stars
Riding on horses
Boys with guitars
If you want to know how to get to me
Follow the map to my heart
You played that thing like you're talking to God
You strum those strings like an angel of love
Did you notice I can't focus on nothing else?
What's making me come out of the shell?
Sometimes it's so hard to tell
I don't even know myself but you do, yeah, you do
Oh baby
Don't ask for directions
I'm tired of explaining
There's no book I've read that says what I'm saying
So show me the way, show me the way
Give me a reason to dance in the dark
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart
If you really want to get the root of me
You don't have to try so hard
If you wanna know how to get to me
Then follow the map to my heart
Just follow it, baby
To my, to my heart...</field>

Paint you a crimson sunset over sheltering skies
I could learn all the world dialects for you
Whisper sonnets in your ear discovering truth
I could never worship pagan gods around me
I will only follow the path that leads me to you baby..
always
Every step I take for you
I will always defend, never pretend
That every breath I take for love
I could never be wrong, the journey is long
With miles to go before I sleep, miles to go before I sleep...
I would carry the rock of Gibraltar just for you
Lifted like a pebble from the beach to the skies
I could build you a bridge that spans the ocean wide
But the greatest gift I give you would be to stand by your side
Some can criticize and sit in judgment of us
But they can't take away the love that lives inside us always
Every step I take for you
I will always defend, never pretend
That every breath I take for love
I could never be wrong, the journey is long
With miles to go before I sleep, miles to go before I sleep...
I won't run from the changing signs along the highway.</field>

you're my angel from above
only God creates such perfect love
when you smile at me, I cry

with a romance that is pure in heart
you are my dearest part
whatever it requires
I live for your desires
forget my own, your needs will come before

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You been seriously misled
Loving somebody ain't your average 9 to 5
It takes conviction it takes a will to survive
I'm not somebody who commits the crime
And leaves the scene
But when I've been dissed
I don't spend much time on what might've been
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm movin', movein' on

Je vous le dit
Ca devait arriver a moi aussi
Je le voyais rever d'une autre fille depuis longtemps
My boyfriend left me
I tell you
It was to happen to me too
I was seeing him dreaming of another girl since a long time
Mon ami est ailleurs
Je ne sais ou
Au pres d'un autre coeur
Et loin de nous
A cueillir d'autres fleurs
Et d'autres rendez-vous
My boyfriend is elsewhere
I don't know where
Close to another heart
And far from us
Gathering other flowers
And other rendezvous (dates)
Moi je regarde les vagues
Dont la mer ecrase les rochers
Et je voudrais que le calme
Vienne habiter ma solitude
Me I see the waves
With which the sea crushes the rocks
And I would want that the calm
Come to fill my loneliness
Il m'a quittee
Je vous le dit
Oui c'est arrive a moi aussi
A force de rever d'une autre fille depuis longtemps
My boyfriend left me
I tell you
Yes it happened to me too
By dreaming about another girl since a long time
Mon ami m'a quittee
C'est trop facile
C'est la fin de l'ete
Soleil fragile
Les bateaux sont ranges
Pour un meilleur avril
My boyfriend left me
It's too easy
Its the end of the summer
Fragile sun
Boats are put away
For a better April
Alors moi je regarde les vagues
Dans mon coeur quelquechose a bouge
Il etait tendre et sauvage
Et le voila qui se raconte
So me I look at the waves
In my heart something moved
He was tender and wild
And now he tells about himself
Il m'a quittee
A la fin de l'ete
Il m'a quittee
He left me
At the end of the summer
He left me
Mon ami m'a quittee
Je vous le dis
Oui c'est arrive a moi aussi
J'ai fini de rever du moins pour aujourd'hui
My boyfriend left me
I tell you
Yes it happened to me too.</field>

The maestro took bow after bow
He said, "my dear friends I have given my all.
I'm sorry, it's all over now."
When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry
Oh, mr
paganini
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing you simply have to
Scat
Listen paganini,
We breathlessly await your masterful baton
Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it you simply have to
Scat
We heard your repertoire
And at the final bar
We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of:
I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'
Would do
So, paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to
Scat
Listen paganini, please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it, wont you sing it?
If the boys is bopping
Aint no need in stopping
Scat
Listen paganini,
We breathlessly await your masterful baton
Come on and spring it
If the boys is bopping
Aint no need in stopping
Scat
I heard your repertoire and
At the final bar
We greeted you, we greeted you
With wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of
Scat
Listen paganini
Now, don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it

So hush my dear and sleep

I'll kiss your little cheek
And underneath the smiling moon
I'll sing you back to sleep

There was a boy...
A very strange enchanted boy.
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea,
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he.
And then one day,
One magic day, he passed my way.
And while we spoke of many things,
Fools and kings,
This he said to me,
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return."
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn.</field>

I am woman
A mountain I will climb
Oh yes I will
I've been beat down and I've been broken
But each day I give it another try
Each road we travel
Will show a different light
You know
Sometimes livin aint easy
But Jesus will help you get it right
Oh yes he will

A new day will come
We will carry on

            <field name="lyrics">I listen to the sound of the rain fallin' down my window
Prayin' for a gentle wind
To bring my baby back again
Tryin' to be strong but I'm not getting any stronger
Loneliness is tearing apart this heart of mine
I lay awake 'coz I can't take another night lonely
It's been too long, I can't hold on no more
Leavin' on the next plane out
Coz I gotta see my baby
It's been too long since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
Till he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again
Gotta be with my baby
Talking on the phone but that don't make it any better
Nothing's gonna ease this pain
Until I'm in his arms again
Runnin' down the stairs there's a taxi that's waiting for me
Loneliness I'm gonna leave you far behind
I'd walk for days through pouring rain
Anything to be with him
It's been too long, I can't be strong no more
Leavin' on the next plane out
'Coz I gotta see my baby
It's been too long since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
Till he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again
Gotta be with him
Gotta be by his side
Gotta be with him
My heart's made up my mind
Leavin' on the next plane out
Coz I gotta see my baby
It's been too long since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
Till he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again
'Coz I gotta see my baby
It's been too long since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
'Till he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again
Gotta be with my baby, gonna be with my baby
Gonna take the next plane or the next train
Gotta get there gotta see my baby
And nothing's gonna stop me from leavin' this time
Leavin' on the next plane out...</field>

Life will go on
Stars will still be
Bright as diamonds in the sky now
Even if you said goodbye now
Oh, the clock wouldn't stop, no
That sun would keep shinning down
If you weren't here with me
This world would still be spinnin' 'round
But baby there would be
Just no living without loving you
How could I ever survive
Just no living without loving you
It would be like living without being alive without you
If you ever walk out this door
What would I have left to live for
What would there be left to do now
What would I be without you now
Oh, the clock wouldn't stop, no
Each day would go on just the same
There would still be air to breath
It wouldn't stop the sun and rain
But baby there would be
Just no living without loving you
How could I ever survive
Just no living without loving you
It would be like living without being alive without you
That sun would still keep shinning down
If you weren't here with me
That world would still be spinnin' 'round
But you know I would have nothing
Won't have no life if I don't have your loving
If I don't have you with me
Just no living without loving you
How could I ever survive
Just no living without loving you.</field>

Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby you're the best
I wasn't looking
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your lovelight
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why d'you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnning
But just keep it coming
How'd you learn to do the things you do
And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby baby darling
You're the best
Baby you're the best</field>

If you asked me how I'm doin' I'm fine

I really don't know why
Oh baby, since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart
You won't find no tears in my eyes now baby
If you think I'm sad that you're gone now
Then you're wrong now
If you ask I'll say I'm happy I'm free
Tell you that's the way I wanna be
And all those nights we shared together baby
We'll they don't mean a thing
Oh baby since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoyces
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O night divine!
And in His Name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise his holy name
Christ is the Lord!
Their name forever praise we
Noel, Noel, and
O night, O night Divine

Down this highway
Memories, they all lead up to this one day
And many dreams lost along the way
Haunt me still
I guess they always will
When love was too much to bear
I just left it there
But here I stand face to face
With this heart of mine
Livin' without you I only fall behind
We had a love most people never find
All this time I never realized
And the courage I finally found
Has made me turn around
(Chorus)
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime one heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back, I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me
I can still hear the song of your laughter
I can still taste the sorrow of your tears
We said goodbye but our hearts did not hear
Now my love there's nothing left to fear
With all my heart put me through
It leads me back to you
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime one heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back, I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime one heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back, I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me
But I'm gonna run back, I'm gonna run back

You're so sincere

Be so blind
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms
Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
And now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay
(Chorus)
So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me

Just for two though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away
Over dreams I have picked out, a perfect come true
Though you never knew it, was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come, from too far away
For you to say come back some other day
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be overjoyed, over loved, over me
Over hearts I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far, for me now to find
The love that I've sought, can never be mine
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be overjoyed, over loved, over me
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know?
For in romance, all true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I, overjoyed, over loved, over you
Over you</field>

Can we unite a sacred lesson
Every child creates a skylight of beauty
Can you hear cathedrals falling
All the universe is calling
Cry a single cello from your heart
Since the world has lost her way
Loneliness journey endlessly
Yet the promised chance remains
Gift of what could be
So let the children remember the sun
Let them dance
Let them soar
For their lives have begun
Let the children engender the rain
As the river runs through fields
Forever subsiding their pain
Prayer
Every voice along the shoreline
Standing still within time
Spinning unresolved the walking
As each season passes
Through wonderland and looking glasses
The secret garden shines beckons you
Gentle flower, don't fade away
Sweet innocent still harbors thee
In faith of golden dreams
Where one love lives eternally
Let the children remember the sun
Let them dance
Let them soar
For their lives have begun
Let the children engender the rain
As the river runs through fields
Forever subsiding their pain
Prayer
(Prayer)
Prayer
(Prayer, Prayer)
(Bless the children) For they are the light
They are the truth of spirit in flight
Yes, the children engender the rain
As the river runs through life
Healing their pain
You could trust with your heart but for time
Sweet angel, conceive you have
Forever and always believed

Et le traneau joyeusement dvale travers les cteaux
Dans le vallon s'accroche l'hiver mais le ciel est bleu
Ah qu'il fait bon faire un tour au grand air
Comme deux amoureux
At a gentle trot goes the horse with its bells
And the sledge happily goes around the slopes
In the small valley sticks the winter but the sky is blue
Ah it's so good to take a ride in the fresh air
Like two lovers
A di hop, a di hop, a di hop, oh hey!
Oh hey! du traneau
Emmitouflez-vous bien dans vos manteaux
A di hop, a di hop, a di hop, oh hey!
Pour se tenir chaud
L'un contre l'autre on se blottis comme deux moineaux dans un nid
C'est merveilleux de voir dfilant comme un dcor peint
Devant nos yeux les villages tout blancs et les petits sapins
Parfois tu cris car a penche un peu c'est l'instant d'effroi
Moi je souris j'ai le coeur amoureux et le bout du nez froid
A di hop, a di hop, a di hop, oh hey!
Oh hey! on the sledge
Muffle you up well in your coats
A di hop, a di hop, a di hop, oh hey!
To keep us warm
One against the other we curl up like two sparows in a nest
It's wonderful to see passing by like a painted scenery
In front of our eyes the villages all white and the small firs
Sometimes you shout out because it's tilts it's the moment of fear
I'm smiling i have a heart in love and the tip of the nose cold
L'attelage a dj pris le chemin du retour
Nous allons tre surpris par la tombe du jour
Car c'est l'heure o la nuit sans bruit s'panouit comme une fleur
Et s'allume le ciel qui change de couleurs
Mais voici notre maison qui nous fait signe au loin
Sa lumire l'horizon scintille comme un point
Je me vois dj prs de toi le rire aux yeux le coeur content
Prs du grand feu de bois qui flambe et nous attend
The harnessing has already taken its way back
We will be surprised by the nightfall
Because it's the time when the night without a sound causes like a flower
And lights on the sky which changes colors
But there's our house that makes us a sign from far away
It's light over the horizon sparkles like a dot
I already see myself by your side laugh in the eyes heart happy
Near the big wood fire that burns and waiting for us
Au petit trot s'en va le cheval avec ses grelots
Et le traneau joyeusement dvale travers les cteaux
Dans le vallon s'accroche l'hiver mais le ciel est bleu
Ah qu'il fait bon faire un tour au grand air

Somewhere a perfect man
I don't believe in the stars
You smiled at my pretence
As you broke down my defenses
Just want to be where you are
Love ain't like fashion
The look remains the same
I'll wear your heart forever
'Cause some things never change
Like rain, tax
After lightening the thunder cracks
Sooner or later it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks
You see what I want
What I want is you
Through that life was logical
Love was a miracle
That happened to someone else, not me
Baby I musta said a little prayer
Suddenly I looked up, you were there
And the rest is history
I don't want to be an island anymore
Just resign yourself
'Cause there's one thing for sure
Like rain, tax
After lightening the thunder cracks
Sooner or later it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks
You see what I want
What I want is you
It had to be you,it had to be you
Say you'll be here forever
You and me here together
When will you see what I want
What I what is you

Sooner or later it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks
You see what I want
What I want is you</field>
