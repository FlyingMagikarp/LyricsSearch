            <field name="lyrics">(Originally recorded by Sweet Savage)

Sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight
Reports come in of the heavy attack
Message is seen, we're moving back

Preparations are made for the journey back
It's a survival, supplies are packed
No more nights in this eternal hell
Destination is simple, we move out

Killing time - you left from the line
Killing time - your turn to kill
Killing time - what do you say?
Killing time - aha, killing time

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life

The silence is over, they attack again
Killing and hatred drive me insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message is seen, we're moving back

Killing time - you left from the line
Killing time - your turn to kill
Killing time - what do you say?
Killing time - aha, killing time

Sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message is seen, we're moving back

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life

Killing time - you left from the line
Killing time - your turn to kill
Killing time - what do you say?
Killing time - aha, killing time</field>

            <field name="lyrics">They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed  if not it's Satan's fall

Way out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill  (for the kill)
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, he's taken, he's taken
He's taken his toll
And he took it on me

I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell

Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane

You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry

And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye (goodbye)
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
'Cause I will eat your mind</field>

Love that little lady always on my mind
She gives me lovin' every night and day
Never gonna leave her
Never going away
Someone to love me
You know she makes me feel alright
Someone to needs me
Love me every single night

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love
It's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman till the end of time
Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time
She make me feel happy
Good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime
I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived
Ya gotta believe me

Hey! I'm talking to you!
Well I know its hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die

Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on. Ha ha!

Whoa
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love
It's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman till the end of time
Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time
She make me feel happy
Good to know that she's all mine

She's all mine, yeah
Yo-oh, yeah</field>

And didn't you hear me you never listen past
And didn't I see you gone to seed
And the only reason is that you're too young greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
Whatever happened to your life
Stone dead forever

You're in perhaps you'll listen a judge like you
In your sweet life innocence that's nobody's fault
You've never had it quite so good
Because you didn't know that you even could

At times it's been too old
Your judge turned to gold
Whatever happened to your life
Stone dead forever

And it's been a long, long time been a long, long wait
And then you thought you'd beat us at the pearly gates
You better leave your number, oh and we'll call you
You must admit your problem and it's heckling you

The time has come to pay
Turns out you've been the prey
Whatever happened to your life
Stone dead forever</field>

Don't give me all that crap 
I just escaped your trap 
But didn't you see the joke 
Then you're just chasin' smoke 
You found another one
An old story's done

Your rude, but you're absolute
Stalemate, ahh too late, too late 

Misunderstanding me 
The way you felt so free 
I'm gonna jump the gun 
I'm gonna cut an' run

I've got no ice in me 
And now the thrill is gone

Tuesday's gone with the wind,
My baby's gone, gone with that wind
Long Gone (Gary)

And I don't know, oh, where I'm goin'.
I just want to be left alone.
When this train ends, I'll try again.
I'm leavin' my woman at home.

Tuesday's gone with the wind. (oh yeah)

Train roll on
Train roll on many miles from my home,
See I'm, I'm ridin' my blues, babe, blues away, yeah.
But Tuesday you see, oh, she had to be free.
Somehow I got to, to carry on.
My baby's gone.

Tuesday's gone with the wind.
Tuesday's gone with the wind. (Tuesday's gone)
Tuesday's gone with the wind.
My baby's gone, with the wind.

The Cork and Kerry Mountains
I saw Captain Farrell
And his money, he was countin'
I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya"

I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money,
Yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me,
No, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman,
Yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha rain dum a doo, dum a da
Whack for my daddy, oh
Whack for my daddy, oh
There's whiskey in the jar, oh

Being drunk and weary
I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' Molly with me
But I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven,
Yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired my pistols
And I shot him with both barrels

Yeah, musha rain dum a doo, dum a da, ha, yeah
Whack for my daddy, oh
Whack for my daddy, oh
There's whiskey in the jar, oh

Yeah, whiskey, yo, whiskey
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

Now some men like a fishin'
But some men like the fowlin'
Some men like to hear,
To hear the cannonball roarin'
Me, I like sleepin',
'Specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison,
Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha rain dum a doo, dum a da, heh, heh
Whack for my daddy, oh

There's rumor going 'round, gotta clear outta town
I'm Smelling like a dry fish bone
Here comes the law, gonna break down the door,
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, never, never want it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon, I got a blow a typhoon,
Playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Walking down the street,
Shooting people that I meet,
Fully loaded tommy gun,
Here comes the deputy, try fuckin' gettin' me
Gotta fuckin' get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I run right outta juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?

An endless stream of fear that I've made
Treading water full of worry

Sucka!

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out!

Not only do I not know the answer...
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS!! (x2)

God it feels...
Like it only rains on me (x4)

Not only do I not know the answer...
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS!! (x2)

Sucka!

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Out of my head, get 'em out of my head
Get 'em out!

Enough's enough (x8)</field>

Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I

Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify (x3)

Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash
Ghost white
Ultra clean
Want to be skeleton
Clear eyes
Diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine

Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify (x3)

I can find the dirt on anything
I can find the dirt on anything

I ain't dancing with your skeletons
I ain't dancing with what might have been

Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify
You and I, Purify
C'mon, Purify!</field>

And she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile

These are the boots that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside

This is the face that'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more

These are the legs in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's not so safe
This is the face you'll never change
This is the God that ain't so pure
This is the God that is not pure
This is the voice of silence no more

Are we the people? (x2)

Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...

This is the face that stones you cold
This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
This is the voice of silence no more

This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the voice of silence no more

Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

It comes alive... 
It comes alive...
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive...
It comes alive...
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Been here before (x6)

I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart, hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it'll be here soon

It comes alive... 
It comes alive... 
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive...
It comes alive... 
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Ooh, I die, I die, I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
...Takes me

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
...Takes me away!

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
...Takes me away!

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Get the fuck out of here
I just want to get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, Why? Why? Why me?

I cannot sleep with a head like this
I want to cry, I want to scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I want to hate it all away</field>

Suicide, I've already died

Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death-black wings
Unfolding sleep
Treading on me

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Oh, call your name!
Suicide, I've already died

Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That stained your concrete face for years
Crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life
A narrow freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the moon that swallows fast
It's peace at last
Oh, peace at last

Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay?
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Oh, call your name

We'll meet again, when both our cars collide

            <field name="lyrics">When I was a young boy,
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band.
He said, "Son when you grow up,
would you be the saviour of the broken, The beaten and the damned?"
He said "Will you defeat them,
your demons, and all the non believers, the plans that they have made?"
Because one day I'll leave you,
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join The Black Parade."
When I was a young boy,
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band.
He said, "Son when you grow up,
will you be the saviour of the broken, The beaten and the damned?"
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me.
And other times I feel like I should go.
When through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets.
and when you're gone we want you all to know
We'll Carry on,
We'll Carry on
And though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I cant contain it
The anthem wont explain it.
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Lets shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end
We hear the call
To carry on
We'll carry on
And though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on
And on we carry through the fears
Ooh oh ohhhh
Disapointed faces of your peers
Ooh oh ohhhh
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all
Do or die
You'll never make me
Because the world, will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
You want it all, we want to play this part
Won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I -- don't -- care
We'll Carry on
We'll carry on
And though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on
Do or die
You'll never make me
Because the world, will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
You want it all, I'm gonna play this part (x2)

I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday
Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you
Down and out
It's where you oughta stay
And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up
While you can
When you go
Would you even turn to say
"I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday"
(Well c'mon, c'mon!)
When you go
Would you have the guts to say
''I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yester..
day, hey, hey, oh
"I don't love you
Like I loved you yester...
Say, hey, hey"
"I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday."</field>

            <field name="lyrics">They're gonna clean up your looks,
With all the lies in the books,
To make a citizen out of you.
Because they sleep with a gun,
And keep an eye on you, son,
So they can watch all the things you do.
Because the drugs never work,
They're gonna give you a smirk,
Cause they got methods to keeping you clean.
They're gonna rip off your head,
Your aspirations to shreds,
Another cog in the murder machine.
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me,
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed.
So darken your clothes,
Or strike a violent pose,
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me.
The boys and girls in the clique
The awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid.
But if you're troubled and hurt,
What you got under your shirt,
Will make them pay for the things that they did.
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me,
They could care less as long as someone will bleed.
So darken your clothes,
Or strike a violent pose,
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me.
Whooooaaaaa yeeeeaaaaahh!
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me,
They could care less as long as someone will bleed.
So darken your clothes,
Or strike a violent pose,
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me.
All together now!
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me,
They could care less as long as someone will bleed.
So darken your clothes,
And strike a violent pose,
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down or have you go,
It's better off this way
For all the dirty looks,

Remember when you broke your foot
from jumping out the second floor?
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
You wear me out.
What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words
but don't know what they mean
(I'm Not Okay)
So be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time
Take a good hard look!
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
You wear me out.
Forget about the dirty looks
For photographs your boyfriend took?
You said you read me like a book,
But the pages are all torn and frayed.
I'm okay.
I'm okay!
I'm okay, Now
(I'm okay, Now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this I'm okay!

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.

Take the cash

Eight legs on the wall
Hit the gas, kill 'em all
And we crawl and we crawl and we crawl!
You be my detonator!
Love
Gimme love
Gimme love
I don't need it
But I'll take, what I want from your heart
And I keep it in a bag
In a box
Put an x on the floor
Gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme more!
Shut up and sing it with me!
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
From mall security
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
To every enemy

Standing in a V-formation

Shut up and let me see your jazz hands

Kiss me you animal!

Right here, right now
All the way in Battery City
The little children
Raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvee halls
And the ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon
And fucking garbage, scream out:
"What will save us?"
And the sky opened up
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one
Wants to die
Wanna try
Wanna try
Wanna try
Wanna try
Wanna try
Now!
I'll be your detonator!
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Make no apologies
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
It's death or victory
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
On my authority
Crash and burn
Young and loaded
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Drop like a bulletshell
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Dress like a sleeper cell
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Than be in a purgatory
Cut my hair
Gag and bore me

I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey if you stay
Ill be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
Can you see
My eyes are shining bright
Cause im out hear
On the other side
Of the jet black
Hotel mirror
And im so weak
Well is it hard under standing

Asleep or dead (x4)

Baby I'm just soggy from the chemo

Use your voice every single time you open up your mouth
Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Sing it out, boy they're gonna sell what tomorrow means
Sing it out, girl before they kill what tomorrow brings
You've got to make a choice
If the music drowns you out
And raise your voice

Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it sing it for the world

Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Cleaned up, corporation progress
Dying in the process
Children that can talk about it
Living on the webways
People moving sideways
Sell it 'til your last days
Buy yourself the motivation,
Generation nothing!
Nothing but a dead scene
Product of a white dream
I am not the singer that you wanted
But a dancer
I refuse to answer
Talk about the past, sir
Wrote it for the ones who want to get away.
Keep running!
Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
We've got to see what tomorrow brings
Sing it for the world

Mama we're meant for the flies

Mama we're all full of lies
Well mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
You should have raised a baby girl
I should have been a better son
If you could
coddle the infection
They can amputate at once
You should have been
I could have been a better son
And when we go don't blame us,yeah

Your manners when you go
And when you go don't return to me my love

And if you would call me your sweetheart
I'd maybe then sing you a song
But the shit that I've done
With this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes all along
We're damned after all
Through fortune and flame we fall
And if you can say then I'll show you the way
to return from the ashes you call...
We all carry on
When our brothers in arms are gone
So raise your glass high
For tomorrow we die
And return from the ashes you call...</field>

And if your heart stops beating
I'll be here wondering
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life
And if you get to heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this
Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned.
And wouldn't it be great If we were dead?
Ohh dead.
Tongue-tied and oh so squeamish
You never fell in love
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life
And if you get to heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this
Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand?
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?
And in my honest observation
During this operation
Found a complication in your heart
So long, 'Cause now you've got (now you've got)
Maybe just two weeks to live
Is that the most the both of you can give?
One, two, one two three four!

Well come on,

I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know just how much you mean to me
And after all the things we put each other through and
I would drive on to the end with you
A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
And I feel like there's nothing left to do
But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running
But this time, I mean it
I'll let you know just how much you mean to me
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of everything

We'll show them all how much we mean

As lead rains, will pass on through our phantoms
Forever, forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning
Forever, and ever
Know how much I want to show you you're the only one
Like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun
And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood
And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down

And if the sun comes up will it tear the skin right off our bones
And then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks I saw you there
Someone get me to the doctor, someone get me to a church
Where they can pump this venom gaping hole
And you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat
And if they come and get me
You put the spike in my heart

We'll shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey they're always there
Someone get me to the doctor, and someone call the nurse
And someone buy me roses, and someone burned the church
We're hanging out with corpses, we're driving in this hearse
Someone save my soul tonight, please save my soul

I'll never let them, I'll never let them
I'll never let them hurt you now tonight
I'll never let them, I can't forget them
I'll never let them hurt you, I promise
Struck down, before our prime
Before, you got off the floor
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?

bring us back into the light
and this venom from my heart)
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
(And these thoughts of endless night
bring us back into the light
kill this venom from my heart)
Can you stake me before the sun goes down?

If I crash on the couch can I sleep in my clothes?

If it looks like I'm laughing I'm really just asking

This alone
You're in time for the show,
You're the one that I need, I'm the one that you
loathe.
You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose,
Cause I love all the poison, away with the boys in
the
band.
I've really been on a bender and it shows,
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
Give me a shot to remember,
And you can take all the pain away from me.
A kiss and I will surrender,
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead.
A light to burn all the empires,
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me.
There's a place in the dark where the animals go,
You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow.
Juliet loves the beat ant the lust it commands
Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands.
Romeo.
I've really been on a bender and it shows,
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
Give me a shot to remember,
And you can take all the pain away from me.
A kiss and I will surrender,

A light to burn all the empires,
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be

            <field name="lyrics">Well, I know a thing about contrition,
Because I got enough to spare.
And I'll be granting your permission,
'Cause you haven't got a prayer.
Well I said hey, hey hallelujah,
I'm gonna come on sing the praise.
And let the spirit come on through ya,
We got innocence for days!
Well, I think I'm gonna burn in hell,
Everybody burn the house right down.
And say, ha
What I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel,
Take this to my grave.
Tell me I'm a bad man,
Kick me like a stray.
Tell me I'm an angel,
Take this to my grave.
S-I-N, I S-I-N,
I S-I-N, I S-I-N,
I S-I-N, I S-I-N,
I S-I-N, I S-I-N
You play ring around the ambulance,
Well like you never gave a care.
So get the choir boys around you,
It's a compliment, I swear.
And I said, ashes to ashes, we all fall down,
I wanna hear you sing the praise,
I said, ashes to ashes, we all fall down,
We got innocence for days!
Well, I think I'm gonna burn in hell,
Everybody burn the house right down.
And say, ha
What I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel,
Take this to my grave.
Tell me I'm a bad man,
Kick me like a stray.
Tell me I'm an angel,
Take this to my grave.
You better run like the devil,
'Cause they're never gonna leave you alone!
You better hide up in the alley,
'Cause they're never gonna find you a home!
And as the blood runs down the walls,
You see me creepin' up these halls.
I've been a bad motherfucker
Tell your sister I'm another
Go! Go! Go!
And I said, say,
What I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel,
Take this to my grave.
Tell me I'm a bad man,
Kick me like a stray.
Tell me I'm an angel,
Take this to my grave.
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man.
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man.
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man.
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man.
So get up!
So get out!
S-I-N, I S-I-N!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb.
He's always choking from the stench and the fume.
The wedding party all collapsed in the room.
So send my resignation to the bride and the groom.
Let's go down!
This elevator only goes up to ten.
He's not around.
He's always looking at men
Down by the pool.
He doesn't have many friends.
As they are
Face down and bloated snap a shot with the lens.
If you marry me,
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?
So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
She keeps a picture of the body she lends.
Got nasty blisters from the money she spends.
She's got a life of her own and it shows by the Benz
She drives at 90 by the Barbies and Kens.
If you ever say never too late.
I'll forget all the diamonds you ate.
Lost in coma and covered in cake.
Increase the medication.
Share the vows at the wake.
(Kiss the bride)
If you marry me,
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?
So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
And say goodbye to the last parade
And walk away from the choice you made
And say goodbye to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
So say goodbye to the last parade
And walk away from the choice you made
And say goodnight to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
To the last parade
When the parties fade
And the choice you made
To the End.</field>

Don’t you breathe for me.
Undeserving of your sympathy

And through it all.
How could you cry
For me
'Cause I don’t feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part is letting go of your dreams
A drink for the horror that I’m in
For the good guys and the bad guys
For the monsters that I’ve been
Three cheers for tyranny,
Unapologetic apathy
'Cause there ain’t no way that I’m coming back again
And through it all.
How could you cry

'Cause I don’t feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye

Just sleep

the awful things that I’ve seen

and sometimes I see people
that I love dying

Just sleep [x6]

Well, they're never gonna get me,
And like a bullet through a flock of doves...
To wage this war against your faith in me,
Your life...will never be the same.
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer...say a prayer!
Now, but I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us,
Well, I can't...well, I can!
Too much, too late, or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish,
I'll kiss your lips again.
They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost,
My cellmate's a killer, they made me do push-ups (in drag)
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself...am I losing myself?!
Well, I miss my mom,
Will they give me the chair,
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope if you dare;
Ah, nobody knows...all the trouble I've seen!
Now, but I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us,
Well, I can't...well, I can!
Too much, too late, or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish,
I'll kiss your lips again.
To your room...
What they ask of you
Will make you want to say, "So long..."
Well, I don't remember,
Why remember...YOU?!
Do you have the keys to the hotel?!
Cause' I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire! (FIRE!!)
Life is but a dream for the dead,
And well I, I won't go down by myself,
But I'll go down with my friends.
Now now now now...now now now...now now take it like a man!!

Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you;
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away,
Run away from here.
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow point smile
Me and your runaway scars
Got a photograph dream on a getaway mile;
Let's blow a hole in this town
And too much talking with a lazer beam
Gunnin' out of this place
In a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again.
How can they say
Jenny could you come back home?
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever wanna come back
Let me be the one to save you.
Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
When we could run away
If we could run away, run away from here...
I'm shootin' out of this room
Because I sure would like the company
Stop your preachin' right there
'Cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head,
Cause it's getting kind of cramped, you know
Comin' ready or not
When the motor gets hot
We can do it again;
The papers say:
Johnny won't you come back home
Cause everybody knows you don't
Wanna give yourself up
Tell the truth and God will save you...
Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away, run away from here...
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you gonna be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded
I ain't gonna be the one left standing
You ain't gonna be the one left standing
We ain't gonna be the ones left standing
Gravity
Don't mean to much to me
Is this our destiny?
This world is after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away,
Run away, run away
Run away from here...
Away from here
Away from here.</field>

Right Now!
I hope you're ready for a firefight
'Cause the devil's got your number tonight
[They say] we're never leaving this place alive
But if you sing these words we'll never die
Get off the ledge and drop the knife
Not a victim of a victim's life
[Because] this ain't a room full of suicides
We're believers, I believe tonight
We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever if you've got the time

If you save yourself tonight

If you save yourself tonight
I'll tell you all how the story ends
Where the good guys die and the bad guys win [Who cares?]
It ain't about all the friends you made
But the graffiti they write on your grave
For all of us who've seen the light
Salute the dead and lead the fight
Hail! Hail!
Who gives a damn if we lose the war?
Let the walls come down, let the engines roar.
We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever if you've got the time
Woah!
I'm the only friend that makes you cry
You're a heart attack in black hair die.
So just save yourself and I'll hold them back tonight
Are you ready where you are?
If you save yourself tonight
'Cause they're coming for you
Can you save yourself tonight?
Right now!
'Cause I'll hold them back
We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever if you've got the time!

Be a burning star if it takes all night

Till you picked me off the ground
With brick in hand, your lip gloss smile
Your scraped up knees
Cos' if you stay I would even wait all night
Or until your heart explodes, how long?
Until we find our way in the dark and out of harm
You can run away with me
Anytime you want
Terrified of what I'd be
As a kid from what I'd seen
Every single day when people try
And put the pieces back together
Just to smash them down
Turn my headphones up real loud
I don't think I need them now
'Cause you stopped the noise
Cos' if you stay I would even wait all night
Or until your heart explodes, how long?
Until we find our way in the dark and out of harm

Anytime you want
Don't walk away (x3)

You can run away with me

They sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out
We watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself
But it started with an alright scene
It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
And was a lie when they smiled and said you won't feel a thing
And as we ran from the cops
We laughed so hard it would sting
If I'm so wrong, (so wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
Now will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamned thing
You're just a sad song
With nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
Well, if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
I spent my high school career
Spit on and shoved to agree
So I can watch all my heroes
Sell a car on tv
Bring out the old guillotine
We'll show what we all mean
If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
Now will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamned thing
You're just a sad song
With nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
Well if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
So go
Go away
Just go
Run away
But where did you run to?
Where did you hide?
Go find another way
Price you pay
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah...
You're just a sad song
With nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
Well if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
C'mon
It's just a sad song
With nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay

Been holding on forever
Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll kill my enemies
The damage, you've inflicted temporary wounds
I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole
We never got that far
This helps me to think all through the night
Bright lights that won't kill me now, won't tell me how
Just you and I, your stareless eyes remain
Hip hip hooray for me
You talk to me
But would you kill me in my sleep
Lay still like the dead
From the razor to the rosary
We could lose ourselves
And paint these walls in pitchfork red
I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole
This hole you put me in
Wasn't deep enough and I'm climbing out right now
You're running out of places to hide from me
When you go, just know that I will remember you
If living was the hardest part
We'll then one day be together
And in the end, we'll fall apart
Just like the leaves change in colors
And then I will be with you
I will be there one last time now
When you go just know that
I will remember you
I lost my fear of falling
I will be with you
I will be with you

Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you, you baby
I wont ask for much this Christmas
I wont even wish oh I wont even wish
I wont even wish for snow.
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I wont make a list and send it to the North Pole for St Nick
Wont even stay awake to hear the magic reindeer play
Cause I just want you here tonight,
Holdin on to me so tight
What more can I do
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you, oh baby
Oh our lives are shinin surrounding everywhere
Where the sounds of children's laughter fills the air
And everyone is singin' oh I hear those sleigh bells ringin'
Santa wont you bring me the one I really need
Wont you bring back my baby to me
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm askin for
I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know

Give them all that they can drink and it will never be

So give them blood, blood, blood.
Grab a glass because there's going to be a flood!
A celebrated man amongst the gurneys.
They can fix me proper with a bit of luck.
The doctors and the nurses they adore me so,
But it's really quite alarming cause I'm such an awful...
I gave you blood, blood, gallons of the stuff,
I gave you all that you can drink and it has never

It better be black
It better be tight
It better be just my size
I'm stalking these metro malls
And airport halls
And all these schoolgirls
I'm not asking
You're not telling
He's not dead
He only looks that way
Way out nowhere
Take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self destruction
Hopeless for you
Sing a song for California
I buy my enemies rope to hang me
And knives to gang me
You can watch them stab me
On your television
Stalk the halls
Because the bathroom walls
Would have a lot to say
About the lives you're putting down
It better be white
It better be cut
It better be just my size
Until all of my capillaries
Burst of boredom
I'll be waiting
I'm not laughing
You're not joking
I'm not dead
I only dress that way
Way out nowhere
Take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self destruction
Hopeless for you
Sing a song for california

Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you;
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away,
Run away from here.
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow point smile
Me and your runaway scars
Got a photograph dream on a getaway mile;
Let's blow a hole in this town
And too much talking with a lazer beam
Gunnin' out of this place
In a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again.
How can they say
Jenny could you come back home?
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever wanna come back
Let me be the one to save you.
Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
When we could run away
If we could run away, run away from here...
I'm shootin' out of this room
Because I sure would like the company
Stop your preachin' right there
'Cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head,
Cause it's getting kind of cramped, you know
Comin' ready or not
When the motor gets hot
We can do it again;
The papers say:
Johnny won't you come back home
Cause everybody knows you don't
Wanna give yourself up
Tell the truth and God will save you...
Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away, run away from here...
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you gonna be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded
I ain't gonna be the one left standing
You ain't gonna be the one left standing
We ain't gonna be the ones left standing
Gravity
Don't mean to much to me
Is this our destiny?
This world is after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away,
Run away, run away
Run away from here...
Away from here
Away from here.</field>

I can take it
We walked alone in your city lights
Did you make it?
We lit the fire and it's burning bright
Did you take it?
Kissed all the boys in your city lights
Did you make it?
Left all the stars in your city lights
Can you fake it?
I lost my way in your city lights
Count your men
We stole the fire, and it's burning bright.
So give me all you've got
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
We lit the fire, and it's burning bright
Not ashamed of what I am
I took the pills for these empty nights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
They always told me that you never get to heaven
With a love like yours
Well if you're lost little boy
The cameras pull you right back down, yeah
It's like a chemical burn
Peeling off your skin, yeah
And when you see your face
Well you'll never be the same again, yeah
‘Cause if you just stop breathing
All stop, stop my heart
I'll stop breathing too
So give me all you've got
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
We lit the fire, and it's burning bright
Not ashamed of what I am
I'd trade the world for your city lights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
And it makes me who I am
And it makes me who I am
And though I missed the chance to do this
I confess that I can't wait until it's gone
No, I mean this every single day
So go if you can't burn inside
‘Cause the world don't need another hopeless cause
Though it makes me who I am
‘Cause it makes me who I am
And you made who I am
And you made who I am
Be afraid of what I am
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
I burned it all, and I'll do it fine
‘Cause I'll never fade away
If I steal the fire from your city lights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
Who I am</field>

Late last night,
I'm sleepin next to pools in vacant alleyways.
And what I'm goin through, shot lipgloss through my veins,
And well I can't complain,
With the falling rain.
C'mon!

Baby I'm just soggy from the chemo

In a solitary style
And crash the cemetery gates.
In the dress your husband hates
Way down, mark the grave
Where the search lights find us
drinking by the mausoleum door
And they found you on the Bathroom floor
I miss you, I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
Back home, off the run
Singing songs that make you slit your wrists
It isn't that much fun? staring down a loaded gun
So I won't stop dying, won't stop lying (are you there at all?)
If you want I'll keep on crying (do you care at all?)
Did you get what you deserve? (are you there at all?)
Is this what you always want me for?
I miss you, I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
Way down, way down
Way down, way down
Way down, way down
Way down, way down
I miss you, I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
When will I miss you? When will I miss you so far?
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
Made it so hard

            <field name="lyrics">She came from greece she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at st martin's college
That's where I
Caught her eye
She told me that her dad was loaded
I said "in that case I'll have rum and coca-cola."
She said "fine,"
And then in thirty seconds time she said
"I want to live like common people
I want to do whatever common people do
I want to sleep with common people
I want to sleep with common people like you."
Well what else could I do?
I said "I'll see what I can do."
I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere
So it started there
I said "pretend you've got no money."
But she just laughed and said "oh you're so funny."
I said "yeah?
I can't see anyone else smiling in here"
Are you sure you want to live like common people
You want to see whatever common people see
You want to sleep with common people
You want to sleep with common people like me?
But she didn't understand
She just smiled and held my hand
Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'cos when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all
Yeah
You'll never live like common people
You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And then dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do
Sing along with the common people
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do
Because you think that poor is cool
Like a dog lying in a corner
They will bite you and never warn you
Look out
They'll tear your insides out
'cos everybody hates a tourist
Especially one who thinks it's
All such a laugh
Yeah
And the chip stain's grease will come out in the bath
You will never understand
How it feels to live your life
With no meaning or control
And with nowhere else to go
You are amazed that they exist
And they burn so bright whilst
You can only wonder why
Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'cos when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all
You'll never live like common people
You'll never do what common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you

But you can't now, I don't blame you
And it's not your fault that no one ever does
But you don't work here anymore
Its just a vacant 3 by 4
And they might fill your place
A temporary stand-in for your face
It happens all the time
And I can't help but think I'll die alone
So I'll spend my time with strangers
A condition that is terminal
In this water-cooler romance
And its coming to a close
We could be in the park and dancing by a tree
Kicking over blades we see
Or a dark beach with a black view
As pin-pricks in the velvet catch our fall
But you don't work here anymore
Its just a vacant 3 by 4
And they might fill your place
A temporary stand-in for your face
It happens all the time
And I can't help but think I'll die alone
I know you don't work here anymore [x6]
Sometimes I think I'll die alone [x3]
Live and breath and die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone [x3]
I'd think I'd love to die alone (many times)</field>

Oh take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned.
And wouldn't it be great If we were dead?
Ohh dead.
Tongue-tied and oh so squeamish
You never fell in love

Wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand?
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?
And in my honest observation
During this operation
Found a complication in your heart
So long, 'Cause now you've got (now you've got)
Maybe just two weeks to live
Is that the most the both of you can give?
One, two, one two three four!
LA LA LA LA LA!

And then I'd say to you we could take to the highway
With this trunk of ammunition too
I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets
I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know just how much you mean to me
And after all the things we put each other through and
I would drive on to the end with you
A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
And I feel like there's nothing left to do
But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running
But this time, I mean it
I'll let you know just how much you mean to me
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of everything
I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know how much you mean
As days fade, and nights grow
And we go cold
Until the end, until this pool of blood
Until this, I mean this, I mean this
Until the end of...
I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know how much you mean
As days fade, and nights grow
And we go cold
But this time, we'll show them
We'll show them all how much we mean
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of every...
All we are, all we are
Is bullets I mean this
[x4]
As lead rains, will pass on through our phantoms
Forever, forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning
Forever, and ever
Know how much I want to show you you're the only one
Like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun
And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood
And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down
And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down
I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood
I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever</field>

Well after all, we'll lie another day
And through it all
We'll find some other way
To carry on through cartilage fluid
And did you come to stare, or wash away the blood?
Well tonight, well tonight
Will it ever come?
Spend the rest of your days
Rocking out just for the dead
Well tonight
Will it ever come?
I can see you awake anytime, in my head
Did we all fall down? [x4]
From the lights to the pavement
From the van to the floor
From backstage to the doctor
From the Earth to the morgue
Morgue, morgue, morgue
Well tonight
Will it ever come?
Spend the rest of your days
Rocking out just for the dead
Well tonight
Will it ever come?
I can see you awake anytime in my head
All fall down
Well after all...</field>

They're painting The passports brown
The beauty parlor Is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes The blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied To the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad They're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady And I look out tonight From
Desolation Row
Cinderella She seems so easy
"It takes one to know one"
She smiles And puts her hands In her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo He's moaning
"You Belong to Me I Believe"
And someone says " You're in the wrong place My friend
You better leave"
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row
Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see That nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you got a mail
From the Desolation Row</field>

Don't believe what they say
We're dead flies in the summertime
They leave us all behind
With duct tape scars on my honey
They don't like who you are
You won't like where we'll go
Brother protect me now
With blood they wash in the money
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us

Right now I'm sick down from the bones to the other side
Red-mob, we insects hide
King Rat on the streets in another life
They laugh we don't think it's funny
If what you are
Is just what you own
What have you become
When they take from you
ALMOST EVERYTHING?
You don't believe in God

            <field name="lyrics">Well, I was there on the day
They sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out
We watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself
But it started with an alright scene
It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
And was a lie when they smiled and said you won't feel a thing
And as we ran from the cops
We laughed so hard it would sting
If I'm so wrong, (so wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
Now will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamned thing
You're just a sad song
With nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
Well, if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
I spent my high school career
Spit on and shoved to agree
So I can watch all my heroes
Sell a car on tv
Bring out the old guillotine
We'll show what we all mean
If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
Now will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamned thing
You're just a sad song
With nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
Well if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
So go
Go away
Just go
Run away
But where did you run to?
Where did you hide?
Go find another way
Price you pay
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah...
You're just a sad song
With nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
Well if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
C'mon
It's just a sad song
With nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
Well if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

At all...
At all...

and dressed in red and blue I squeezed
Imaginary wedding gown
That you can't wear in front of me
A kiss goodbye, your twisted shell
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet
Lets say goodbye, the hundreth time
And then tomorrow we'll do it again
I dragged her down I put her out
And back there I left her where no one could see
And lifeless cold into this well
I stared as this moment was held for me
A kiss goodbye, your twisted shell
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet
Lets say goodbye, the hundreth time
And then tomorrow we'll do it again
I never thought it'd be this way
Just me and you, we're here alone
And if you stay, all I'm asking for is
A thousand bodies piled up
I never thought would be enough
To show you just what I've been thinking
And I'll keep on making more
Just to prove that I adore
Every inch of sanity
All I'm asking for is, all I'm asking for is
These hands stained red
From the times that I've killed you and then
We can wash down this engagement ring
With poison and kerosene
We'll laugh as we die
And we'll celebrate the end of things
With cheap champagne
Without, without a sound
And I wish you away</field>

Then holding hands and life was perfect, just like up on the screen
And the whole time while always giving
Counting your face among the living
Up and down escalators, pennies and colder fountains
Elevators and half price sales, trapped in by all these mountains
Running away and hiding with you
I never thought they'd get me here
Not knowing you changed from just one bite
I fought them all off just to hold you close and tight
But does anyone notice?
But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head...
But would anything matter if you're already dead?
And should I be shocked now by the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger,
Your eyes vacant and stained...
But does anyone notice?
But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head...
And would anything matter if you're already dead?
And now should I be shocked by the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger,
Your eyes vacant and stained...
And in saying you loved me,
Made things harder at best,
And these words changing nothing
As your body remains,
And there's no room in this hell,
There's no room in the next,
And our memories defeat us,
And I'll end this direst.
But does anyone notice?
But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head...

Isn't it crazy?
Well as soon as I get my gun
They'll put me on vacation underneath the sun
As soon as I get my gun
I'll holler and flash it at my belting blood
Out on the sand
Like a hole from an Ied
'Cause I'm holding up my gun
Holding up my gun
Yeah
And if I'm old enough to die for your mistakes
Then let's go
Can I bleed enough to fill up what the engine takes?
I don't know
And if you're watching up above
They're teaching me to kill
Who's teaching me to love?
Now baby
Isn't it crazy?
As soon as I get my gun
(Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my gun
(Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my G - U - N
(Don't even have a gun!)
I'm standing out in the S - U - N
(Don't even have a gun!)
I'm never gonna have a son
(Don't even have a gun!)
She's never gonna have a son
(Don't even have a gun!)
I'm never gonna have a S - O - N
And now I'm never gonna have a S - O - N
And if I'm old enough to die for your mistakes
Then let's go
Can I bleed enough to fill up what the engine takes?
I don't know
And if you're watching up above
They're teaching me to kill
Who's teaching me to love?
Now baby
Isn't it crazy?
As soon as I get my gun
(Don't even have a gun)
Well, as soon as I
As soon as I get my gun.</field>

Ride in to the sunset
Would I lie to you?
Well i've got something to say
Grab your six-gun from your back
Throttle the ignition
Would I die for you?
Well here's your answer in spades
Shotguns sinners,
Wild eyed jokers,
Got you in my sights!
Gun it while I'm holding on
After all is said and done
Climb out from the pine box
Well I'm asking you
Cuz she's got nothing to say
The angels just cut out her tongue
Call her black mariah
Would I lie to you?
That girl's not right in the brain!
Mass convulsions,
Strike the choir
By the grace of god!
Gun it while I'm holding on but
Don't stop if I fall
And don't look back
Oh baby don't stop
Bury me
And fade to black
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
So baby...
Don't stop if I fall
And don't look back
Oh baby don't stop
Bury me
And fade to black
Don't stop if I fall
And don't look back
Oh baby don't stop
Bury me
And fade to black</field>

And as the fragments of my skull begin to fall
Fall on your tongue like pixie dust just think happy thoughts
Refrão:

We'll fly home
You and I
We'll Fly Home

            <field name="lyrics">Hear the sound, the angels come screaming,
Down your voice, I hear you've been bleeding
Make your choice, they say you've been pleading,
Someone save us.
Heaven help us now,
Come crashing down,
We'll hear the sound
As you're falling down.
I'm at this old hotel but can't tell if i've been
Breathing or sleeping or screaming or waiting for the man to call
And maybe all of the above, cause mostly
I've been sprawled on these cathedral steps
While spitting out the blood and screaming,
Someone save us.
Heaven help us now,
Come crashing down,
We'll hear the sound
As you're falling down.
And will you pray for me?
Or make me say don't leave?
And will you lay for me?
Or make us change?
Cause i'll give you all the nails you need,
Cover me in gasoline, wipe away those tears of blood again
And the punchline to the joke is asking,
Someone save us.
Heaven help us now,
Come crashing down,
We'll hear the sound
As you're falling down.
And would you pray for me?
(you don't know a thing about my sins, how the misery begins)
Or make us say don't leave?
(you don't know, so I'm burning, I'm burning)
And will you lay for me?
(you don't know a thing about my sins, how the misery begins)
Or make us change?
(you don't know, cause I'm burning, I'm burning)
Cause i'll give you all the nails you need
(I'm burning, I'm burning again)
Cover me in gasoline again.

Just like the hearse, you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on, just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
And what's the worst you take (worst you take)
From every heart you break (heart you break)
And like a blade you stain (blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight
Chorus:
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight
Came a time
When every star falls
Brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold
And what's the worst you take (worst you take)
From every heart you break (heart you break)
And like a blade you stain (blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight
Chorus

Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight
Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave and then
We'll meet again, when both our cars collide
Chorus
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way

You better run like the devil,
'Cause they're never gonna leave you alone!
You better hide up in the alley,
'Cause they're never gonna find you a home!
And as the blood runs down the walls,
You see me creepin' up these halls.
I've been a bad motherfucker
Tell your sister I'm another
Go! Go! Go!

And maybe when you get back

You're still the good-for-nothing and I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out
While you can
When you go
Would you even turn to say
I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday
Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you
Down and out
It's where you oughta stay
And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up
While you can
When you go
Would you even turn to say
"I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday"
(Well c'mon, c'mon!)
When you go
Would you have the guts to say
''I don't love you

Some other way to continue
To hide my face
Another knife in my hands
A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off
I'm so dirty, babe
The kind of dirty
Where the water never cleans off the clothes
I keep a book of the names and those
Only go so far to bury them
So deep and down we go
Touched by angels though, I fall out of grace
I did it all so maybe I'd live this everyday
Another knife in my hands
A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off
I'm so dirty, babe
It ain't the money
And it sure as hell ain't just for the fame
It's for the bodies I claim and those
Only go so far to bury them
So deep and down we go
Down
And down we go
And down we go
And down we go
And we all fall down
And we'll all dance alone to the tune of your death
We'll love again, we'll laugh again
And it's better off this way
And never again, and never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now
Well never again, and never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now
I tried, one more night, one more night
Well I'm laughing', crying', laughing'
I tried, well I tried, well I tried
Cause I tried, but I lied
I tried, I tried, I tried
And we'll love again and we'll laugh again
We'll cry again and we'll dance again
And it's better off this way
So much better off this way
I can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed
Never again, and never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now</field>

I'm not okay.

You wear me out.
What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words
but don't know what they mean
(I'm Not Okay)
So be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time
Take a good hard look!
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
You wear me out.
Forget about the dirty looks
For photographs your boyfriend took?
You said you read me like a book,
But the pages are all torn and frayed.
I'm okay.
I'm okay!
I'm okay, Now
(I'm okay, Now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this I'm okay!

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay.

Been holding on forever
Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll kill my enemies
The damage, you've inflicted temporary wounds
I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole
We never got that far
This helps me to think all through the night
Bright lights that won't kill me now, won't tell me how
Just you and I, your stareless eyes remain
Hip hip hooray for me
You talk to me
But would you kill me in my sleep
Lay still like the dead
From the razor to the rosary
We could lose ourselves
And paint these walls in pitchfork red
I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole
This hole you put me in
Wasn't deep enough and I'm climbing out right now
You're running out of places to hide from me
When you go, just know that I will remember you
If living was the hardest part
We'll then one day be together
And in the end, we'll fall apart
Just like the leaves change in colors
And then I will be with you
I will be there one last time now
When you go just know that
I will remember you
I lost my fear of falling
I will be with you
I will be with you

But honey, what are you gonna do?
And you can sleep in the coffin
but the past ain't through with you.
Cause we are all a bunch of liars.
Tell me, baby, who do you wanna be?
And we are all about to sell it

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba.
And we all get-together

It's been eight bitter years
since I've been seeing your face.
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.
And you're walking away
and I will die in this place.
Sometimes you scrape and sink so low.
I'm shocked at what you're capable of.
And if this is a coronation,
I ain't feeling the love.
Cause we are all a bunch of animals
that never paid attention in school.
So tell me all about your problems
I was killing before killing was cool.
You're so cool, you're so cool, so cool.

And you're walking away

You'll never take me alive
You'll never take me alive
Do what it takes to survive
Cause I'm still here
You'll never get me alive
You'll never take me alive
Do what it takes to survive

We kill the girls to get paid
And put the whole damn room
On the edge of a blade
You'll get far, stay clean
And if the world stops believing
I'll keep believing
That the world could make a change
And put the suicide dolls as the last ones to mate
So come hard, stay clean
And sing the songs for the damned now
Hail, hail
'Cause the king is gone
And if you don't stop believing
We'll keep believing
You put the record on
And live the life that you're making
Shots that you're taking
So grab the cash and run
And let the suits watch each other
Kill one another
It doesn't matter if the words don't mean a thing
You're gonna kiss that ring
Well, alright
Move like the walls and keep the faith
There ain't a dry eye left
In the back of the place
Is it hard to stay clean?
And if you all keep believing,
I'll keep believing
That the world drives the saints
And put the shotgun shells in the hills it makes
So come hard, stay clean
Because they don't give a damn now
Hail, hail
'Cause the king is gone
And if you don't stop believing
We'll keep believing
You got your leather on
And live the life that you're making
Shots that you're taking
It doesn't matter if the words don't mean a thing
You gotta kiss that ring
Hail, hail 'cause the king is gone
Hail, hail 'cause the king is gone
Hail, hail 'cause the king is gone
Hail, hail 'cause the king is, the king is gone
'Cause the king is gone
And if you don't stop believing
We'll keep believing
And get your leather on
And live the life that you're making
Shots that you're taking
So grab the cash and run
And let the suits watch each other
Kill one another
It doesn't matter if the words don't mean a thing
Fist up, head down
Hail, hail to the king!</field>

109 in the sky, but the pigs won't quit!
You're here with me, Dr
Death Defying.
I'll be your surgeon, your proctor, your helicopter.
Pumpin' out the slaughtermatic sounds to keep you live!
A system failure for the masses, antimatter for the master plan!
Louder than God's revolver and twice as shiny.
This one's for all you rock and rollers,
All you crash queens and motor babies.
Listen up!
The future is bulletproof!
The aftermath is secondary.
It's time to do it now, and do it loud.
Killjoys, make some noise!</field>

Mama we're meant for the flies
And right now they're building a coffin your size
Mama we're all full of lies
Well mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
You should have raised a baby girl
I should have been a better son
If you could
coddle the infection
They can amputate at once
You should have been

And if you would call me your sweetheart
I'd maybe then sing you a song
But the shit that I've done
With this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes all along
We're damned after all
Through fortune and flame we fall
And if you can say then I'll show you the way
to return from the ashes you call...
We all carry on
When our brothers in arms are gone
So raise your glass high
For tomorrow we die
And return from the ashes you call...</field>

I have markers,
I seven different shades,
Oh shit,
So what's your favorite color, punk?
[Spoken in background]
Do you wanna hold my hand?
Could you sign this photograph,
Cause I'm your biggest fan,
Would you leave me lying here?
We're not here to pay a compliment,

Oxycodone genocide,
Adolescent suicide,

Ask angels made from neon

"What will save us?"
And the sky opened up
Everybody wants to change the world

So hit the lights, I'll do it again

Slide up the faders when the cabinet slams
And get your hands up
Now get your hands up
Light up the stage and watch me kick out the jams
So throw a fist up
Now throw a fist up
Ain't nobody gonna take my life
Ain't nobody gonna get the best of me
Ain't a preacher gonna save me now
Grab a seat I'm gonna show you how
Everybody hit the pyro cue

Get off the ledge and drop the knife
Not a victim of a victim's life

Let the walls come down, let the engines roar.
We can leave this world, leave it all behind

I'm the only friend that makes you cry
You're a heart attack in black hair die.

Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Sing it out, boy they're gonna sell what tomorrow means
Sing it out, girl before they kill what tomorrow brings
You've got to make a choice
If the music drowns you out
And raise your voice
Every single time they try and shut your mouth
Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Cleaned up, corporation progress
Dying in the process
Children that can talk about it
Living on the webways
People moving sideways
Sell it 'til your last days
Buy yourself the motivation,
Generation nothing!
Nothing but a dead scene
Product of a white dream
I am not the singer that you wanted
But a dancer
I refuse to answer
Talk about the past, sir
Wrote it for the ones who want to get away.
Keep running!
Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
We've got to see what tomorrow brings
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Girl you got to be what tomorrow needs
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world</field>

one way to resolution
I’m put on this medication, rolls down my throat
cause I cant ever sleep at night the same
this medication it controls, enjoys most every day
well! and! and! cause I cant sleep into the night but
cause I close my eyes, I see land
what did I say?
what could I say to put her to sleep?
and fall awake and die
and I’m never going` to bed
back to this day, back into this day
back to another level hotter than hell
said we ain’t savages, until we do it again
back to `another level hotter than hell said that we’re not
savages,
and one last night I'll kiss your lips again
what did I say?
what could I say to put sister to sleep?
fall awake and die
and I’m never going to sleep
I will take the Ferris wheel
and I’m sleep walking back into this hell
oh my darling, for the first time
don’t let me sleep tonight
and get in your way tonight
don’t let me sleep tonight
get in your way
what did I say?
what could I say to put sister to sleep?
I'll never go to sleep
and I wont go back to bed
I will go into your bedroom
I’m sleepwalking back into this hell! oh! god!

Let me go, go on record
Be the first to say I'm sorry
Hear me out,
Well if you take me down
Or would you lay me out
And if the world needs something better
Let's give them one more reason now
We walk in single file
We light our rails and punch our time
Ride escalators colder than a cell
This broken city sky like
Butane on my skin
And stolen from my eyes
Hello Angel, tell me where are you
Tell me where we go from here [2]
And in this moment we can't close the lids on burning eyes
Our memories blanket us with friends we know like fallout vapor
Steel corpses stretch out towards an ending sun, scorched and black
It reaches in and tears your flesh apart
As ice cold hands rip into your heart
That's if you've still got one that's left inside that cave you call a chest
And after seeing what we saw, can we still reclaim our innocence
And if the world needs something better, let's give them one more reason now
This broken city sky like
Butane on my skin
And stolen from my eyes
Hello Angel, tell me where are you

Don’t you breathe for me.

And through it all.
How could you cry
For me
'Cause I don’t feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part is letting go of your dreams
A drink for the horror that I’m in
For the good guys and the bad guys
For the monsters that I’ve been
Three cheers for tyranny,
Unapologetic apathy
'Cause there ain’t no way that I’m coming back again
And through it all.

And carry all this broken bones
Through six years down in crowded rooms

Is something I can't know till now
Till you picked me off the ground
With brick in hand, your lip gloss smile
Your scraped up knees
Cos' if you stay I would even wait all night
Or until your heart explodes, how long?
Until we find our way in the dark and out of harm
You can run away with me
Anytime you want
Terrified of what I'd be
As a kid from what I'd seen
Every single day when people try
And put the pieces back together
Just to smash them down
Turn my headphones up real loud
I don't think I need them now
'Cause you stopped the noise
Cos' if you stay I would even wait all night
Or until your heart explodes, how long?
Until we find our way in the dark and out of harm
You can run away with me

Anytime you want
Anytime you want
Don't walk away (x3)

Just another accident,
Well on the freeway of this life
We're driving on
On and
We're driving on
And on,
And on
I'll remember this night
When you're gone,
You surrender your heart,
I surrender every dream
Every weapon you've got,
Every secret that I keep
We can fight this all you want,
But tonight we lost it
Just another surgery tonight
Well if you amputate the loneliness,
Let anesthesia dim the lights
So dream on
And on,
And on,
And on.
So dream on,
And on,
And on.
And I'll remember your eyes
When you're gone
You surrender your heart
I surrender every dream
Every weapon you've got
Every secret that I keep,
We can fight this all you want
But tonight belongs to me
While I watch you in your sleep
'Cause tonight belongs to me
You can fight this all you want
But tonight belongs to
Ooohh...
Sparks against the railing,
Distant phantoms swelling.
Who the windshields selling
With the air that's failing.
Now,
You surrender your heart,
I surrender every dream,
Every weapon you've got,
Every secret that I keep,
We can fight this all you want
But tonight belongs to me
I watch you in your sleep,
We can fight this all you want
But tonight belongs to me

With all the lies in the books,
To make a citizen out of you.
Because they sleep with a gun,
And keep an eye on you, son,
So they can watch all the things you do.
Because the drugs never work,
They're gonna give you a smirk,
Cause they got methods to keeping you clean.
They're gonna rip off your head,
Your aspirations to shreds,
Another cog in the murder machine.
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me,
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed.
So darken your clothes,
Or strike a violent pose,
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me.
The boys and girls in the clique
The awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid.
But if you're troubled and hurt,
What you got under your shirt,
Will make them pay for the things that they did.
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me,
They could care less as long as someone will bleed.
So darken your clothes,
Or strike a violent pose,
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me.
Whooooaaaaa yeeeeaaaaahh!
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me,
They could care less as long as someone will bleed.
So darken your clothes,
Or strike a violent pose,
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me.
All together now!
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me,
They could care less as long as someone will bleed.
So darken your clothes,
And strike a violent pose,
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts
And make me ill
You're running after something
That you'll never kill
If this is what you want
Then fire at will
Preach all you want but who's gonna save me?
I keep a gun on the book you gave me, hallelujah, lock and load
Black is the kiss, the touch of the serpent sun
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one,
and one,
and one,
and one
You'll never make me leave

You wanna follow something
Give me a better cause to lead
Just give me what I need

She's watching over me
And other times I'm feeling so alone
There's writing on the ceiling
That only I can see
And other times I feel like running home
Cause the time we have is really not so bad
Despite the reservations that you had
I don't care at all, I'm really not so sad
Despite the observation that you had
Some met a guy in cleveland
He said it's not so bad
And other times you feel you wake up dead
And if you get the feeling
You're watching after me
Well here's a clue, it's all just in my head
Cause the time we have is really not so bad
Despite the reservations that you had
I don't give a fuck, it's really not so sad
Despite the observation that you had
These darker days will never get me down
Gotta break, wipe that smile right off your face
We got the right to anything we want
Even if they beat you, no I can't behave
We got the right
Not for anything at all
Even when they kick you when you're
I don't care
Cause the time we have is really not so bad

            <field name="lyrics">So long to all my friends
Everyone of them met tragic ends
With every passing day
I'd be lying if I didn't say
That I miss them all tonight
And if they only knew
What I would say
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
One day, I'll lose this fight
As we fade in the dark
Just remember you will always burn as bright
Be strong, and hold my hand
Time becomes for us, you'll understand
We'll say goodbye today
And we'll sorry how it ends this way
If you promise not to cry
Then I will tell you just what I would say
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
I'll fail and lose this fight
Never fade in the dark
Just remember you will always burn as bright
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your...
Sometimes we must grow stronger and
You can't be stronger in the dark
When I'm here, no longer, you must be stronger
And If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
I failed and lost this fight
Never fade in the dark
Just remember you will always burn as bright
The light behind your eyes...
The light behind your eyes...
The light behind your eyes...
The light behind your eyes...
The light behind your eyes...
The light behind your eyes...
The light behind your eyes...

Remember me (4x)
Where, where will you stand
When all the lights go out
Across these city streets?
Where were you when
All of the embers fell?
I still remember them
Covered in ash
Covered in glass
Covered in all my friends
I still think of the bombs they built
If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you alone
How would you be
Many years after the disasters
That we've seen
What if we learned
Of all the people burning
In purifying flame
I'll say it's okay
I know you can tell
And though you can see me smile
I still think of the guns they sell
If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you alone
The only hope for me
The only hope for me is you (4x)
The only hope is!
If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you alone
The only hope for me is you
(Remember me)
The only hope for me is you alone
(Remember me)
The only hope for me is you
(Remember me)
The only hope for me is you alone
(Remember me)
The only hope for me is you

The only hope for me is you (2x)

            <field name="lyrics">Well it rains and it pours when you're out on your
own.
If I crash on the couch can I sleep in my clothes?
Cause I've spent the night dancing, I'm drunk I
suppose.
If it looks like I'm laughing I'm really just asking
to leave.
This alone
You're in time for the show,
You're the one that I need, I'm the one that you
loathe.
You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose,
Cause I love all the poison, away with the boys in
the
band.
I've really been on a bender and it shows,
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
Give me a shot to remember,
And you can take all the pain away from me.
A kiss and I will surrender,
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead.
A light to burn all the empires,
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me.
There's a place in the dark where the animals go,
You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow.
Juliet loves the beat ant the lust it commands
Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands.
Romeo.
I've really been on a bender and it shows,
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
Give me a shot to remember,
And you can take all the pain away from me.
A kiss and I will surrender,
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead.
A light to burn all the empires,
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me.
Ow!
Give me a shot to remember,
And you can take all the pain away from me.
A kiss and I will surrender,
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead.
A light to burn all the empires,
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me.
Ooooow, whooa [4x]</field>

They burn cause they're all are afraid
For everyone of us, there's an army of them
But you'll never fight alone
Cause I wanted you to know
That the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Well, are you thinking of me now?
These are the nights and the lights that we've faded
These are the words but the words aren't coming up
They burn cause they are hard to say
For every failing sun
There's a morning after
Though I'm empty when you go
I just wanted you to know
That the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me,
Like I'm thinking of you?
I would say I'm sorry though
Though I really need to go
I just wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
I think of you every night, every day
These are the lies and the lives of the taken
These are the hearts
But their hearts don't beat like ours
They burn, cause they are all afraid
When mine beat twice as hard
Cause the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me
Like I'm thinking of you
I would say I'm sorry though
Though I really need to go
I just want you to know
That the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me?
Stop your crying, helpless feeling
Dry your eyes and start believin'
There's one thing they'll never take from you

Never forever

Like ghost in the sun)</field>

Drain all the blood and give the kids a show
By streetlight
This dark night
A seance down the below
There's things that I have done
You never
Should ever know.
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone
Forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone
Forever now
Who walks among the famous living dead
Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed
And if you could talk to me
Tell me if it's so
That all the good girls go
To heaven
Well heaven knows
That without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone
Forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone
Forever now.
Can you hear me cry out to you?
Words I thought I'd choke on
Figure out
I'm really not so with you anymore
I'm just a ghost.
So I can't hurt you anymore
So I can't hurt you anymore
And now
You wanna see how far down
I can sink?
Let me go!
So - you can - well now so - you can
I'm so far away from you
Well now so - you can.
And without you this is how I disappear
And without you this is how I disappear
Forever

They stared us down when me in the emergency room
And in our beds, I could hear you breathe with help from
cold machines
Every hour, on the hour, they drew blood
Well I felt I couldn't take, another day inside this place
From silent dreams we never wake, and in this
promise that we'll make
Starless eyes for heaven's sake, but I hear you anyway
Well I thought I heard you
Say I like you, we can get out
We don't have to stay, stay inside this place
Someday, this day, we kept falling down
Someday, this day, set the ferris wheel ablaze
You left my heart an open wound
And I love you for
This day, someday we kept falling down
One day, this day all we had to keep us safe
And if we never sleep again, it would never end
Well I thought I heard you say to me
We'll go so far, far as we can
And I just can't stay, one day we'll run away</field>

Just find ways to cope with feelings
That you don't understand
Because no one really cares how you feel

My friends, we can do anything with science
Except say goodbye
But I'm trying to hold on to anything
And not mess up everything
Everyone hates me, I hate all of you
I tried to adjust, but I'm young and screwed up
How do you expect me to believe
When you were my age you didn't
My friends, we can do anything with science
Except maybe die
But I'm trying to hold on to everything
And not mess up everything, everything, everything
Why does right and wrong seem so far away?
But if I had my way
But if I had my way we would all be sorry
My friends, we can do anything
But should we?
If things end up so..
blah, blah, blah
I'm trying to hold on to what I love
And not mess up everything
I mess up everything
No one cares anyway</field>

            <field name="lyrics">He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb.
He's always choking from the stench and the fume.
The wedding party all collapsed in the room.
So send my resignation to the bride and the groom.
Let's go down!
This elevator only goes up to ten.
He's not around.
He's always looking at men
Down by the pool.
He doesn't have many friends.
As they are
Face down and bloated snap a shot with the lens.
If you marry me,
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?
So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
She keeps a picture of the body she lends.
Got nasty blisters from the money she spends.
She's got a life of her own and it shows by the Benz
She drives at 90 by the Barbies and Kens.
If you ever say never too late.
I'll forget all the diamonds you ate.
Lost in coma and covered in cake.
Increase the medication.
Share the vows at the wake.
(Kiss the bride)
If you marry me,
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?
So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
And say goodbye to the last parade
And walk away from the choice you made
And say goodbye to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
So say goodbye to the last parade
And walk away from the choice you made
And say goodnight to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank.
To the last parade
When the parties fade
And the choice you made
To the End.</field>

You wanna get it for free
Then say hello to the brush fire, baby
You gotta take it from me
I'm gonna take it from you
Say hello to the good times
And say hello to the sun
They're sitting back on an empire
While the world lays back
Puts a kid behind that gun
If we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
When the mix tape plays
Choke down the words with no meaning
I stopped bleeding three years ago
While you keep screaming for revolution
Me and my surgeons and my street walking friends
We got no heroes 'cause our heroes are dead
Yeah!
Say hello to the program
We're gonna give it for free
Hook up the veins the antibodies
Got it with the disease
We're gonna give it to you
Say goodbye to the good times
You're loading up with the fame
You're dressing up like a virus
But the words get lost when we all look the same
If we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
When the mix tape plays
Choke down the words with no meaning
I stopped bleeding three years ago
While you keep screaming for revolution
Me and my surgeons and my street walking friends
We got no heroes 'cause our heroes are dead
Fell in love with a vampire
Tops off? to the empire
Say hello to the brush fire
The microphone's got a tap wire
Fell in love with a vampire
Tops off? to the empire
Say hello to the brush fire
The microphone's got a tap wire
Yeah, if we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
While the army wives
Choke down the war with no meaning
I stopped bleeding three years ago
While you keep screaming for revolution
Because rebellion ain't a t-shirt you sell
You keep your money and I'll see you in hell</field>

Pressing down on you
No man ask for
Under pressure -
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
That's ok
It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'let me out'
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people -
People on streets
O.k.
Chippin' around
Kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
People on streets
People on streets
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming 'let me out'
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher high high
Pressure on people - people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why - why - why ?
Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love
'cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And loves dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure

Say if the lights are really low enough to play.
Can you catch me when I'm fallin' down?
I'll control the moment if you try to make the most of this,

Would you stay right here then I'll tell you that someone out there loves you?
If you stay right here then I'll tell you that someone out there loves you after all.
Sometimes these things can always be so small,
and sometimes you could live and I can all the time to catch this phrase and
try to make the most of this and could you maybe kiss me when we decimate the stars?
And would you stay right here then I'll tell you that someone out there loves you?
If you stay right here then I'll tell you that someone out there loves you.
If there's no one, no one out there.
If there's no one, no one who cares.
Is there no one, no one out there?
Is there no one like you to share?
But would you ask yourself, would you ask yourself?
Stay!

Hair Back, collar up, jet black, so cool!
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you, c'mon

When you wanna be a movie star (c'mon!)
Play the game and take band real far (c'mon!)
Play it right and drive a Volvo car (c'mon!)
Pick a fight at an airport bar
The kids don't care if you're all right honey
Pills don't help but it sure it's funny
Gimmie gimmie some of that vampire money c'mon!
3-2-1 we got the bomb

And if the sun comes up will it tear the skin right off our bones
And then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks I saw you there
Someone get me to the doctor, someone get me to a church
Where they can pump this venom gaping hole
And you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat
And if they come and get me
You put the spike in my heart

Can you take this spike?
Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless

Will it wash away this jet black feeling?
And now the nightclub set the stage for this they come in pairs she said
We'll shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey they're always there
Someone get me to the doctor, and someone call the nurse
And someone buy me roses, and someone burned the church
We're hanging out with corpses, we're driving in this hearse
Someone save my soul tonight, please save my soul

I'll never let them, I'll never let them
I'll never let them hurt you now tonight
I'll never let them, I can't forget them
I'll never let them hurt you, I promise
Struck down, before our prime
Before, you got off the floor
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
(And these thoughts of endless night
bring us back into the light
and this venom from my heart)
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
(And these thoughts of endless night
bring us back into the light
kill this venom from my heart)
Can you stake me before the sun goes down?

Fatality is like ghosts in snow and you have no idea what you're up against
because I've seen what they look like.
Becoming perfect as if they were sterling silver chainsaws going cascading...)</field>

Dedication, to the places that you never need to hide
Occupations, the opportunity to see yourself in lights
And all the city fires
And the tabloid lies
And the television guys
For the missions and the boulevards
And the way it is when money's all you got
Stop and stare
At the accidents and stars that bore you
We don't dare, sing another song for, California
Anywhere
Where the city lights are hopeless for you
We don't care, I need another song for, California
Shut up and give me a shot
On occasion, to the places that you never want to die
On the station, everybody hears but no one needs to try
On the telephone, on the methane dare
Every minute that you scream
For the errant scars and the dying stars
Every second that you take to fake your life
Stop and stare
At the accidents and stars that bore you
We don't dare, sing another song for, California
Anywhere
Where the city lights are hopeless for you
We don't care, I need another song for, California
Stop and stare
At the accidents and stars that bore you
We don't dare, sing another song for, California
Anywhere
Where the city lights are hopeless for you
We don't care, I need another song for, California</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When I was a young boy,
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band.
He said, "Son when you grow up,
would you be the saviour of the broken, The beaten and the damned?"
He said "Will you defeat them,
your demons, and all the non believers, the plans that they have made?"
Because one day I'll leave you,
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join The Black Parade."
When I was a young boy,
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band.
He said, "Son when you grow up,
will you be the saviour of the broken, The beaten and the damned?"
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me.
And other times I feel like I should go.
When through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets.
and when you're gone we want you all to know
We'll Carry on,
We'll Carry on
And though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I cant contain it
The anthem wont explain it.
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Lets shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end
We hear the call
To carry on
We'll carry on
And though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on
And on we carry through the fears
Ooh oh ohhhh
Disapointed faces of your peers
Ooh oh ohhhh
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all
Do or die
You'll never make me
Because the world, will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
You want it all, we want to play this part
Won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I -- don't -- care
We'll Carry on
We'll carry on
And though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on
Do or die
You'll never make me
Because the world, will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
You want it all, I'm gonna play this part (x2)

In the center of a restaurant...
They say, "Come with your arms raised high!"
Well, they're never gonna get me,
And like a bullet through a flock of doves...
To wage this war against your faith in me,
Your life...will never be the same.
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer...say a prayer!
Now, but I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us,
Well, I can't...well, I can!
Too much, too late, or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish,
I'll kiss your lips again.
They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost,
My cellmate's a killer, they made me do push-ups (in drag)
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself...am I losing myself?!
Well, I miss my mom,
Will they give me the chair,
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope if you dare;
Ah, nobody knows...all the trouble I've seen!
Now, but I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us,
Well, I can't...well, I can!
Too much, too late, or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish,
I'll kiss your lips again.
To your room...
What they ask of you
Will make you want to say, "So long..."
Well, I don't remember,
Why remember...YOU?!
Do you have the keys to the hotel?!
Cause' I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire! (FIRE!!)
Life is but a dream for the dead,
And well I, I won't go down by myself,
But I'll go down with my friends.
Now now now now...now now now...now now take it like a man!!

Run up these streets
Turn up the stereo
Synthetic animals like me never have a home
I'm not the one you will be walking through
And if you kill him for me
Well, then I'll kill him for you
I'll meet you down at the metro station
'Cause motherfuckers got the motivation
Now I'm gonna show you how much I love you
Oh, my magazine is full of ugly things
Don't need the system
We can kill them if we try
Shoot up everything we see
And we'll fight it all for all
I hope you die
Manipulation
Just to form an alibi
You're the one that's right for me
And if heaven wants to take us they can try
Oh ah
Sometimes I sleep
I like to talk about television
Oh, I'm so glad right now
Heartbreak, heartbeats
Got the eyes on you
And I got something to say
'Cause I got something to prove
I don't have much of an education
But I got a knack for elimination
Now turn up the dial
They can try disgrace
Let's go
Right here
Right now
This is the bonus stage!
Don't need the system
We can kill them if we try
Shoot up everything we see
And we'll fight it all for all
I hope you die
Manipulation
Just to form an alibi
You're the one that's right for me
And if heaven wants to take us they can try
I want annihilation
A new design for X and Y
I want your violation
Deflect the system with our mind
Exterminate the dream
Extermination you can
Bye
Don't need the system
We can kill them if we try
Shoot up everything we see
And we'll find it on the wall
I hope you die
Manipulation
Just to form an alibi
You're the one that's right for me
And if heaven wants to take us they can...
I hate you
Kill everybody!
I hate you
Kill everybody!</field>

what will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
i've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
to be a joke and look
another line without a hook
i held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!
i'm not okay

you said you read me like a book

drinking by the mausoleum door

i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
back home
off the run
singing songs that make you slit your wrists
it isn't that much fun
staring down a loaded gun
so i won't stop dying
won't stop lying
if you want i'll keep on crying
did you get what you deserve?
is this what you always want me for?
i miss you

when you go
so never think
i'll make you try to stay
and maybe when you get back
i'll be off to find another way
well
after all this time that you still owe
you're still a good-for-nothing i don't know
so take your gloves and get out
better get out
while you can
when you go
would you even turn to say
"i don't love you
like i did
yesterday"
sometimes i cry so hard from pleading
so sick and tired of all the needless beating
but baby when they knock you
down and out
is where you ought to stay
well
after all the blood that you still owe
another dollar's just another blow
so fix your eyes and get up
better get up
while you can
whoa
whoa
when you go
would you even turn to say
"i don't love you
like i did
yesterday"
well
come on
come on
when you go
would you have the guts to say
"i don't love you
like i loved you
yesterday"
i don't love you
like i loved you
yesterday
i don't love you
like i loved you

they encourage your complete cooperation
send you roses when they think you need to smile
i can't control myself because i don't know how
and they love me for it
honestly
i'll be here for a while
so give them blood
blood
gallons of the stuff!
give them all that they can drink and it will never be enough
so give them blood
blood
blood
grab a glass because there's going to be a flood
a celebrated man amongst the gurneys
they can fix me proper with a bit of luck
the doctors and the nurses they adore me so
but it's really quite alarming cause i'm such an awful fuck
i gave you blood
blood
gallons of the stuff
i gave you all that you can drink and it has never been enough
i gave you blood
blood
blood
i'm the kind of human wreckage that you love</field>

what're you gonna do?
and you can sleep in a coffin

baby
who do you wanna be?
and we are all about to sell it
'cause it's tragic with a capital t. let it be
let it be
let it be!
'cause we all wanna party when the funeral ends. and we all get together when we bury our friends. it's been eight bitter years since i've been seeing your face. and you're walking away
and i will die in this place. sometimes you scrape and sink so low
i'm shocked at what you're capable of. and if this is a coronation
i ain't feeling the love. 'cause we are all a bunch of animals
that never paid attention in school. so tell me all about your problems;
i was killing before killing was cool. you're so cool
you're so cool
so cool!
'cause we all wanna party when the funeral ends. and we all get together when we bury our friends. it's been nine bitter years since i've been seeing your face. and you're walking away
and i will die in this place. you'll never take me alive. you'll never take me alive. do what it takes to survive
'cause i'm still here. you'll never get me alive. you'll never take me alive. do what it takes to survive
and i'm still here. you'll never take me alive. you'll never get me alive. do what it takes to survive
and i'm still here. you'll never get me. you'll never take me. you'll never get me alive. 'cause we all wanna party when the funeral ends. and we all get together when we bury our friends. it's been ten fucking years since i've been seeing
your face 'round here. and you're walking away
and i will drown in the fear.</field>

down your voice
i hear you've been bleeding
make your choice
they say you've been pleading
someone save us
heaven help us now
come crashing down
we'll hear the sound
as you're falling down
i'm at this old hotel
but can't tell if i've been breathing or sleeping
or screaming or waiting for the man to call
and maybe all of the above
cause mostly i've been sprawled on these cathedral steps
while spitting out the blood and screaming
"someone save us!"
heaven help us now
come crashing down
we'll hear the sound
as you're falling down
and will you pray for me?
or make a saint of me?
and will you lay for me?
or make a saint of?
cause i'll give you all the nails you need
cover me in gasoline
wipe away those tears of blood again
and the punchline to the joke is asking
someone save us
heaven help us now
come crashing down
we'll hear the sound
as you fall
and would you pray for me?
(you don't know a thing about my sins
how the misery begins)
or make a saint of me?
(you don't know
so i'm burning
i'm burning)
and will you lay for me?
(you don't know a thing about my sins
how the misery begins)
or make a saint?
(you don't know

i'm burning)
cause i'll give you all the nails you need

you can run away with me anytime you want
terrified of what i'd be

turn my headphones up real loud

where insects hide
king rat on the streets in another life

we don't think it's funny

what have you become

you don't believe in god

your shadow lives on without you

i just wanted you to know

dry your eyes and start believing

never forever

one day i'll lose this fight
as we fade in the dark
just remember you will always burn as bright
be strong and hold my hand
time--it comes for us
you'll understand
we'll say goodbye today

if you promise not to cry
then i'll tell you just what i would say

you can be stronger when i'm gone
when i'm here
no longer
you must be stronger and

she studied sculpture at st martin's college
that's where i. caught her eye
she told me that her dad was loaded
i said "in that case i'll have rum and coca-cola."
she said "fine."
and then in thirty seconds time she said
"i want to live like common people
i want to do whatever common people do
i want to sleep with common people
i want to sleep with common people like you."
oh what else could i do?
i said "i'll see what i can do."
i took her to a supermarket
i don't know why
but i had to start it somewhere
so it started there
i said "pretend you've got no money."
but she just laughed an said "oh you're so funny."
i said "yeah?
well i can't see anyone else smiling in here
are you sure you want to live like common people
you want to see whatever common people see
you want to sleep with common people
you want to sleep with common people like me?"
but she didn't understand
she just smiled and held my hand
rent a flat above a shop
cut your hair and get a job
smoke some fags and play some pool
pretend you never went to school
but still you'll never get it right
`cos when you're laid in bed at night
watching roaches climb the wall
if you called your dad he could stop it all yeah
you'll never live like common people
you'll never do what ever common people do
you'll never fail like common people
you'll never watch your life slide out of view
and then dance
and drink
and screw
because there's nothing else to do
sing along with the common people
sing along and it might just get you through
laugh along with the common people
laugh along even though they're laughing at you
and the stupid things that you do
because you think that poor is cool. like a dog lying in a corner
they will bite you and never warn you
look out. they'll tear your insides out
'cause everybody hates a tourist
especially one who thinks it's all such a laugh
yeah and the chip stain and grease will come out in the bath
you will never understand
how it feels to live your life
with no meaning or control
and with nowhere left to go
you are amazed that they exist
and they burn so bright whilst you can only wonder why. rent a flat above a shop
cut your hair and get a job
smoke some fags and play some pool
pretend you never went to school
but still you'll never get it right
'cause when you're laid in bed at night
watching roaches climb the wall
if you called your dad he could stop it all
yeah. never live like common people
never do what common people do
never fail like common people
never watch your life. slide out of view

            <field name="lyrics">they're selling postcards of the hanging
well they're painting the passports brown
and the beauty parlor's filled with sailors
the circus is in town
oh now look
here comes the blind commissioner
well they got him in a trance
one hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
the other's in his pants
and the riot squad they're restless
they need somewhere to go
as lady and i look out tonight
from desolation row
cinderella
she seem so easy
"well it takes one to know one," she smiles
and she puts her hands in her back pockets
oh bette davis style
and now here comes romeo
moaning
"you belong to me i believe"
and someone says
"you're in the wrong place
my friend
you better leave"
and then the only sound that's left
after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweepin' up
on desolation row
now at midnight all the agents
and superhuman crew
go out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
they're gonna bring 'em to the factory
where the heart-attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene
is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that no one is escaping
to desolation row
'cause right now i can't read too good
don't send me no letters no
not unless you're gonna mail them
from desolation row</field>

still get paid

so fake your death
or it's your blame
and leave the lights on

take off your clothes
and dream that fame
come on and feel that shame

scream "let me out!"

insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
can't we give ourselves one more chance?
why can't we give love that one more chance?
why can't we give love give love give love?
give love give love give love give love give love?
cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care

and love dares you to change our ways
of caring about ourselves
this is our last dance
this is our last dance
this is ourselves under pressure

Scream "are we having fun yet?"
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad

I've kept this bottled inside,
So I'm starting to regret not telling

So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know...
Never gonna be alone!
From this moment on,
If you ever feel like letting go,
I won't let you fall...
Never gonna be alone!
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone.
And now, as long as I can,
I'm holding on with both hands,
Cuz forever I believe that there's
Nothing I could need but you,
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know...
You never gonna be alone!
From this moment on,
If you ever feel like letting go,
I won't let you fall.
When all hope is gone,
I know that you can carry on.
We're gonna see the world out,
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone.
Ooooh!
You've gotta live every single day,
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away,
Could be our only one,
You know it's only just begun.
Every single day,
Maybe our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Tomorrow never comes...
Time, is going by, so much faster than I,
And I'm starting to regret not telling

I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone.
I'm gonna be there all of the way,
I won't be missing a one more day,
I'm gonna be there all of the way,
I won't be missing a one more day.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times
I wonder if It's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in
Oh oh oh
Oh God I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh oh oh
Oh God I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
Everytime I do it makes me</field>

To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be
(Tell me what you want)
I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me
(So what you need?)
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and
James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
[Chorus:]
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
(I'll have the quesadilla, Ah Ha!!)
I'm gonna dress my ass
With the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to
Blow my money for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
[Chorus:]
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars

We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
I'm gonna sing those songs
That offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
[Chorus:]
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

Why weren't we able

Lately there's been too much of this
Dont think its too late
Nothing's wrong
just as long
as you know that someday I will
Someday, somehow
gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
Well I hoped that since we're here anyway
We could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up stringing
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a hollywood horror
Nothin's wrong
just as long as
Guess you know that someday I will
Someday, somehow

And I’ll leave this life behind me
Say it if it’s worth saving me
Heaven’s gates won’t open up for me
With these broken wings I’m fallin’
And all I see is you
These city walls ain’t got no love for me
I’m on the ledge of the eighteenth story

            <field name="lyrics">My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned
Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less travelled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
If today was your last day
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause
There's no second try
So live like you're never livin twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
Would you call those friends you've never seen?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one your dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'll finally fall in love?
If today was your last day
If today was your last day
Would you make it up by mending a broken heart
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
Would you call those friends you've never seen?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one your dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'll finally fall in love?

            <field name="lyrics">Well I know the feeling
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cutting yourself with a jagged edge
I'm telling you that
It's never that bad
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure
You can take this anymore
So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
And you scare yourself
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
Cause I have faith in you
That you're going to make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young
And the best is yet to come
So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
And you scare yourself
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Well everybody's hit the bottom
Everybody's been forgotten
When everybody's tired of being alone
And everybody's been abandoned
I left a little empty handed
So if you're ever barely hanging on
Just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
And you scare yourself
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby</field>

Watch as we all fly away
Someone told me
Love would all save us
But, how can that be
Look what love gave us
A world full of killing
And blood spilling
That world never came
And they say
That a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do
And they say
That a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait

            <field name="lyrics">You call to me, and I fall at your feet
How could anyone ask for more?
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more?
But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, god I'm trying to
Trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more
And this kind of pain, only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go
But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, god I'm trying to
Trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
Was it something that I did?
Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me,
That was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear
Tonight I'm dying to tell you
That trying not to love you, only went so far
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining, from what we've fighting for
If we just keep on trying, we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you, ohhhh
Trying not love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more</field>

Like wounded soldiers in need of healing.
Time to be honest, this time I'm bleeding
Please dont dwell on it,
Cause I didn't mean it
I cant believe I said
I'd lay our love on the ground
But it doesn't matter cause I've made it up forgive me now
Everyday I spend away my souls inside out
Gotta be someway
That I can make it up to you now, somehow.
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me too
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
I was blindfolded, but now im seeing
My mind was closing, now I'm believing
I finally know what just what it means to let someone in
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will
So if your ever lost and find yourself all alone
I'd search forever just to bring you home,
Here and now this I vow
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me too
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you
No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember you know
I'll always come for you
Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,
Yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember
you know I'll always come for you
I'd crawl across this world for you
Do anything you want me to
No matter what, remember
you know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you</field>

And I can see this song will be about you
I can't believe that I can breathe without you
But all I need to do is carry on
The next line I write down
And there's a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one it's standing on
I write lines down, then rip them up
Describing love can't be this tough
I could set this song on fire
Send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you
I'm dying to show you
This could end happily ever after
There doesn't ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along
I write lines down, then rip them up
Impossible describing love
I could set this song on fire
Send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes
Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
I could set this song on fire
Send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this
I wanna sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this</field>

Are you waiting on a lightening strike
Are you waiting for the perfect night
Are you waiting till the time is right?
What are you waiting for?
Don't you wanna learn to deal with fear
Don't you wanna take the wheel and steer
Don't you wait another minute here
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you've gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
Are you waiting for the right excuse?
Are you waiting for a sign to choose
While your waiting it's the time you lose
What are you waiting for? (what are you waiting for?)
Don't you want to spread your wings and fly?
Don't you wanna really live your life?
Don't you want to love before you die?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you've gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
Tell me what you're waiting for
Show me what you're aiming for
Whatcha going to save it for?
So what you really waiting for?
Tell me what you're waiting for
Show me what you're aiming for
Whatcha going to save it for?
So what you really waiting for?
Everybody's gonna make mistakes
But everybody's got a choice to make
Everybody needs a leap of faith
When are you taking yours?
What are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you've gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
What are you waiting for?
Believe in every dream that you got
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you've gotta give it your all
What are you waiting for?
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
What are you, what are you

There's no giving in

Hand in hand forever

That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win

How can we fall asleep at night
When something's cleary wrong
When we could feed the starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
The right thing to guide us
Is right here inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heart beat
The drumbeat carries on
And the drumbeat carries on
(Just like a heartbeat)
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I, I'm driving black on black
Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins
this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite
if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right
ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up
so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see
the parts of you that I've been kissing
Screamin'
No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals
So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in
You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go
by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel
while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her
not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin'
No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals
So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in
We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy
When she whispered "what was that?"
The wind, I think
'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin'
"That's my dad outside the car!"
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while
we were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad
it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin'
No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple animals
So come on baby, get in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in

I wonder what it fells like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up to the end
Until that moment when
I'll find the one that I'll spend forever with
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
Everyone wants to know they're not alone
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Tonight
Out on the street
Out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right
It's just like déjàvu
Me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?
Isn't that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
Everyone wants to know they're not alone
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Ooooo
You can't give up
(When you're looking for)
The diamond in the rough
(You never know)
It shows up
(Make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one
The one you're waiting on
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me
Ohhhhhhh
Nobody wants to do it on their own
Everyone wants to know they're not alone
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there
Everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there</field>

Convincing his belief for what you love
Baiting every hook with filthy lies
Another charlatan to idolize
Is this suppression just in my mind? (just in my mind?)
No more questions, get back in line! (just get back in line!)
You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones
Picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth
While harvesting you to feed the machine
(To feed the machine)
The gears forever turn to grind the mice
Will you become the fuel for sacrifice?
Power absolutely all for show
The piper blows his flute and off you go
Is this obsession behind your eyes?
(Behind your eyes?)
No more questions, get back in line! (just get back in line!)

Amen I, I’m alive

And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We’ll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

We realize how small we are

Imagine what the world could be

            <field name="lyrics">Father's hands were lined with dirt
From long days in the field
And mother's hands are serving meals
In a cafe on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about is
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, It's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk
You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, It's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk
Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
Made it out, still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk
No time, last one, let's go.</field>

We're wound up too tight
I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just beat me
Oohhh
That shit makes me bad shit crazy
We've got no fear, no doubt, all-in, balls out
We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Oohhh
We're screaming like demons,
Swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties, the tequilia just hit me
Oohhh
We got no class, no taste,
No shirt, shit faced
We got'em lined up, shot down,
Firing back straight crown
We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Oohhh
Ticking like a time bomb, drinking till the nights gone
Well get you hands off of this glass,
Last call my ass
Weeelllll no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no friend, no doubt, all-in, balls out
We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light

Take your time rather than hurry
Never too late to write
the best of your story
Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry
Life's no race, it's a companion
Always face with reckless abandon
A ticket to life as my mother
once told me
Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely
Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel
Is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain
Spend your days happy and grateful
Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful
Every good thing will come in moderation
Envy and greed will only lead to frustration
Choose your friends, carefree and kindly
Choose your words, careful and wisely
Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder
One will be there to share again when you're older
Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel
Is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on

Old mistakes committed upon us
Always take a toll on the conscience
Every regret is a gift that you live with
Never forget to remember forgiveness
Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation

You shake your ass around for everyone

I love the way you dance with anybody

And tease them all while sucking on your thumb
You're so much cooler when you never pull it out
'cause you look so much cuter
With something in your mouth
Crafty little lip tricks
Tattoo's on her left hip
She's bending as you're spending
There's no end to it so baby come on
Dressed up like a princess
Bettin' that her skin smells
Better than the scent of every flower in the desert
Come on

We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy
When she whispered "what was that?"
The wind, I think
'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin'
"That's my dad outside the car!"
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while
we were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad
it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin'
No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple animals
So come on baby, get in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Check out the trouble we're in
Get in, just get in</field>

Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead
Your turn, you'd rather leave than live and learn
That’s why, you want an end and so do I
This time, I believe I’ll leave it all behind

I swore not to come, but I'm here after all
I know by the look that I see in your eye
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die
From what you do
What you do, what you do, what becomes of you
What you do, what you do, what becomes of
Now that you did this, you ask for forgiveness
Doctor, could you be my priest?
Say your mistaken, but look what she'd taken
Laugh as you lie through your teeth
From what you do
Because of you
You know I can't be there, each time that you call
I swore not to come but I'm here after all

I love the whiskey, let's drink that shit til it's dry.
So grab a Jim Beam, JD, whatever you need.
Have a shot from the bottle, doesn't matter to me.
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down,
Grab a cup, bottoms up!
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out.
(Bottoms up)
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down,
Grab a cup, bottoms up!
Ohhh, bottoms up
So grab your best friends and make your way to the bar.
But keep your distance, we're gonna light it on fire.
We're drinking black tooth, 80 proof, straight gasoline.
Slam as much as you can take and hand the bottle to me.
'Nother round, fill 'er up,
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out.

'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down,
Grab a cup, bottoms up!
Ohhh, bottoms up.
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until they throw us all out.
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.

Started talking about better days
One says to the other
He'd do it all again
Seems I knew I would

Found I adored it
I didn't want this
Can somebody help me see?
And now I feel it
Feel that I've been there
I didn't need this
Can somebody help me breathe?
Here we are again
Just face to (face)ing
Each other another day
Who wins
Well who cares
It always ends up the same
Seems I knew I would
And now I found it
Found I adored it
I didn't want this
Can somebody help me see?
And now I feel it
Feel that I've been there
I didn't need this
Would somebody help me stand?
And now I've told him
Already warned them
I didn't want this
Can somebody help me breathe?
If I was them
Then I wanna be
What I see
If I could pack my life in a moment
I wanna know do you want me to go?
Gonna give my life never ending
Never stop myself from pretending
That you always knew that I never could
All I ever really wanted was to be the same
Equal treatment never ever comes and here we go again
All I ever really wanted was to be like you
So perfect
So worthless
If i could take it all back think again
I would
And now I found it
Found I adored it

I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just beat me

That shit makes me bad shit crazy
We've got no fear, no doubt, all-in, balls out
We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Oohhh
We're screaming like demons,
Swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties, the tequilia just hit me
Oohhh
We got no class, no taste,
No shirt, shit faced
We got'em lined up, shot down,
Firing back straight crown
We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Oohhh
Ticking like a time bomb, drinking till the nights gone
Well get you hands off of this glass,
Last call my ass
Weeelllll no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no friend, no doubt, all-in, balls out
We're going off tonight

My buddy Bradley's in the middle
he's lookin' out the window
We just got high and hopin' no one could tell
But with the icky and the sticky
it don't matter where the wind blows
Lighter in my hand and I got nothing to burn
Except a little turpentine inside of those five paint cans
Pick up a shotgun and we'll all take turns
But don't you ever say a word
cause you know momma's gonna hate that
The dice that we've been rollin'
Where our lives are bitter stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion
In 3..

We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Our kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg and borrow
A thousand Fahrenheits
And we're about to ignite
(So keep the throttle to the bottom)
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman
Countin' every nickel, dime and five dollar bill
So we've been stealin' gasoline and laying low
out on the backroads
The city lights are glowin' over the hill
And we can make it
but we take the chance of never coming back home
The dice that we've been rollin'
Where our lives are bitter stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion

One for the road and one for those who never leave
One for the Lord and take it from the devil
Don't even try, 'cause you know you can't hide

Each bone broken in his back
All the money and all the gold
Couldn't buy my love at 8 years old
Now I'm in love with a girl thats wrong for me
Ask her, she will disagree
Her father was a small time man
With small time dreams and small time hands
But
But I was there when there was nobody home
Please believe me when I say I dunno
Gone for good in fact but what does it mean
Within a year they always sold and bought
Easy enough to just look at her
Whole world on a silver platter
Was that that bad for me
If I was there the scotch is free
Won round one but its not over
He don't care cause he don't know her
True love is not the same
If I could lend a hand in shame
But I was there when there was nobody home
Please believe me when I say I dunno
Gone for good infact but what does it mean
Within a year they always sold and bought
If I was big
So much easier to see
Don't hide from me
That which i've already seen
You lie to me
More than occasionally
Don't lie to me
You lied to me
I'm as high as i'll ever be
I don't mind, stay and see
They've all gone, why don't we
Holding hands, you and me
But I'm as high as i'll ever be
But later on, lies to see
My past is gone, only from me
I'm alive
But I was there when there was nobody home
Please believe me when I say I dunno
Gone for good infact but what does it mean
Within a year they always sold and bought
Remember when it was me
Driving come down just for me
And then we'll try as we've been</field>

And I remember wanting to be you
And pray to God that we would all pull through
Cause I know why I will always follow you
If you're my brother, then I will follow you
Lifelong friends threw bottle ends
And yell in the air like lifelong enemies
Who's stronger, who's lived longer?
World quarrels and grandkids on your knee

And you know all that I'm thinking
To define or redefine too slow
And it seems all that I'm sinking
Running through the deep
Gonna find the backwoods
I found out
All day long who will be the big men giving some
And you bleed much better than I bleed
And you've shown all that is so good
And your word, much better than my word
And you stand right where a hole should
Running through the deep
Gonna find the backwoods
I found out
All day long who will be the big men giving some
To feel devine
To hold onto ones self
To give and to give and
To never receive by myself
Running through the deep (I want it)
Gonna find the backwoods (I need it)
I found out (much more than he did)
All day long who will be the big men giving some
(give it back somehow)
Giving some (I'm ready to forgive now)
Running through the deep
Gonna find the backwoods
I found out
All day long who will be the big men giving some
Running through the deep gonna find the back backwoods
I found out gonna get it gonna get it
All day long who will be the big men
are you really really gonna get it.</field>

And you leave me after all

You just left me here to die
I stand, I fall, I bounce off these 4 walls
You laugh, you leave
And you leave me here alone,
I'm guilty too for siring all to you
Well, that's my one sin
Sorry for giving in
Didn't mean to waste your time
Thanks for wasting mine
Could have tried to let me be
Would you just set me free?
I stand, I fall, I bounce off these 4 walls
You laugh, you leave
And you leave me here alone,
Is this how its gonna be
It's fine for you and not for me
Did you even care at all

Now that I've seen...not really diggin this!
Did I ask for your input?
How's the taste of your own foot?
To speak and not be right
You'd like to just rewrite
My life and take what you like
And decide with all of it
And to know that if it goes right
You'll never find out if I wanted it
Now that I've seen...not really diggin this!
Now that I know...not really diggin this!
Called him twice today
They said he went away
I never wondered why
They tried to hold him
Ain't never comin' back
Pull out the welcome mat
I never wondered why they tried to hold him
The way that it's going
To laugh without knowing
The way that I'm feelin'
Inside it's unappealing
That's fine hey no I don't mind
I can't find nothin' wrong with it
And to say in your polite way
Oh...by the way...could you get on with it?

[Verse 1]
I make my living off the evening news
Just give me something, something I can use
People love it when you lose
They love dirty laundry
Well, I could've been an actor, but I wound up here
I just have to look good; I don't have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear
Give us dirty laundry

We got the bubble-headed bleached-blonde
Comes on at five
She can tell you 'bout the plane crash
With a gleam in her eye
It's interesting when people die
Give us dirty laundry
Can we film the operation?
Is the head dead yet?
And all the boys in the newsroom
Got a running bet
Get the widow on the set
We need dirty laundry

Dirty little secrets
Dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pies
We love to cut you down to size
We love dirty laundry
We can do the innuendo
We can dance and sing
When it's said and done, we haven't told you a thing
We all know that crap is king
Give us dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up

Don't let it end
Don't ever let it end
Well I got two tickets to the game
It'd be great if I could take you to it this sunday
And I'll walk you home when the whole things done
And if you're there, I don't even care which team won
We can stop at the coffee shop
And make fun of the cops in the parking lot
We can laugh as we both pretend that we're not in love
And that we're just good friends
Well I'm tired of pretending,
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you,
There's nothing I could do
to ever let it end
And I know you feel the same way,
Cause you told me drunk on your birthday
And as you pulled to me whispered in my ear
"Don't ever let it end"
Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't ever let it end
Saturday I'm going to take her out
Because her favorite band is gonna play downtown
Gonna sing the song we've all heard of
Bout those two good friends that should've fell in love
Later on we'll cut through the park
And she can hold my hand cause she hates the dark
We can laugh as we both pretend that we're not in love
And that we're just good friends
Well I'm tired of pretending,
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you,
There's nothing I could do
to ever let it end
And I know you feel the same way,
Cause you told me drunk on your birthday
And as you pulled to me whispered in my ear
"Don't ever let it end"
Don't let it end
Don't let it end
(please promise me that this won't end)
Don't ever let it end
The greatest time we've ever had
It's crazy now, just looking back and laugh
You never know where life's gonna go
Cause we're the only ones who'll ever know
About sunday night just her and I
Sitting side by side in the full moonlight
I pull her close just to hold her tight
And the both of us could tell it just felt right
She looked at me in the sweetest way
Like she could tell
what the hell I was about to say
Must've took a while just to find the words
Cause she cut me off and finally said it first
Well I'm tired of pretending,
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you,
There's nothing
I could do to ever let it end
And you know I feel the same way,
Cause I told you drunk on my birthday
And as you pulled to me whispered in my ear
"Don't ever let it end"
Don't let it end
Don't let it end
(please promise me that this won't end)
Don't ever let it end
Don't let it end
Don't let it end

And Main Street's dying now
It's like there's nothing left of it
No more high school grounds
They tore that building down
And everything with it I miss
I call up my old friends
So long since I've seen them
It's like we're back there instantly to me
We all meet at Shawn's
The backyard fire's on
And we start telling tales of how life used to be
The years have come and gone
But the stories carry on
Looking back they're better than they used to be
'Cause you should have seen the size of the guys we were fighting
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Mama always taught us to never tell a lie, ooh
And every ten-yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
And the story goes on and gets a little better
Every time we're together
It's funny how we change
And some things stay the same
God, I miss the glory days always
With daylight getting near
We shed a few more tears
Lord, I love the memories we've made
The years have come and gone
But the stories carry on
Looking back they're better than they used to be
'Cause you should have seen the size of the guys we were fighting
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Mama always taught us to never tell a lie, ooh
And every ten-yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
And the story goes on and gets a little better

Well you should have seen the size of the guys we were fighting
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Mama always taught us to never tell a lie, ooh

it tasted so clean with every taste of me
You know that every single thing she does
She does for me, because it's what I'm dreaming of
And she likes to take her time
More then fortunate, form of torture
And she likes to touch and tease
It's always fun for me, it's always unbelievable
You and me, sitting in a tree
F-u-c-k-i-n-g
She'll do anything I want
My baby, she's up for anything I wanna do
She's a giver and it gets her off
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do
If it was on tv, or ever in a magazine
She could take the fantasy and make it a reality
She delivers every dirty thought
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do
And she knows every spot
Exactly where it's at, and she could draw a map
But tell her our song is like a weapon
And she's always threatening to be the death to me
You and me, sitting in a tree

My baby, she's into everything I wanna do
So, what you wanna do?
So, what you wanna do?
And me, I'll repay the favor with your favorite thing you love to do
So, what you wanna do?
So, what you wanna do?
I'm about to take it up a notch,
so what what I'm about to do
You and me, sitting in a tree

You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)

Leaving your bones out on the stones
Picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth
While harvesting you to feed the machine

We gotta make love just one last time in the shower
Well something's gotta go wrong

Everytime I turn around

And where it lands is when it should

Sometimes life ain't best if left in the memory
It's better kept inside than left for good
Lookin' back each time they tried to tell me
Well something's gotta go wrong
'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good
And it's like...
Everytime I turn around
I fall in love and find my heart face down
And where it lands is when it should
This time it's like
The two of us should probably start to fight
'cause something's gotta go wrong
'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good
Feelin' way too damn good
I missed you so much
That I begged you to fly and see me
You must've broke down
'cause you finally said that you would
But now that you're here,
I just feel that I'm constantly dreaming
'cause something's gotta go wrong
'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good
And it's like...
Everytime I turn around
I fall in love and find my heart face down
And where it lands is when it should
This time it's like
The two of us should probably start to fight
'cause something's gotta go wrong
'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good
Feelin' way too damn good
I missed you so much
That I begged you to fly and see me
Feelin' way too damn good
I missed you so much
That I begged you to fly and see me</field>

I wanted no one else

I got you to myself

I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons
Well you know my friends
Well they know your enemies
I'd pretend not to hear what they said to me
'cause I got off
Every time you got on to me
Was it wrong
To go along with insanity?
Was it wrong? was it wrong?

It wasn't that hard

And now I know who you are

I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way you're not impressed,
While you put me to the test
I like the wine stains on your dress
I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck
And I love your lack of self respect
While you're passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard

Gone for good, and this is it)

One more anthem for the know it all

In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor
Eight minutes and I'm losing it a little bit
Five minutes and my descriptions
not starting to fit
Here we go

I won't be standing up for long,

Just to follow you home

And every city in between
You can slap me in the face
You can scream profanity
Leave me here to die alone but
I'll still follow you home
I'll still follow you home
You can make a couple calls
And tell your brothers I'm in town
Put a bounty on my head
And tell my parents that I'm dead
And hope to hell I'm never found
You can steal me the keys
To your daddy's Cadillac
You can tamper with the brakes
Call it a mistake

Always a way, gotta get out
Road, I gotta find one
Get me a key, pick me a lock
Gotta be free, ready or not
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
Nowhere to hide, 'cause someone's always gonna find you
Trying to breathe with everybody right behind you
Scattering leaves to try and cover up the footprints
Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance
I'm running for the river
'Cause the river's running high
And there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
I'm running for the river
You can ride, you can fly
You can tell 'em that you tried
But there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
Tell 'em that you tried
But you're never gonna catch me
Let off the hounds, stand off the guards
Never be found, better than bars
"Damn it, he's a fast one"
Not up the trees into the swamp
Gotta be free, so don't ever stop
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
"God damn it, he's a fast one"
Nowhere to hide, 'cause someone's always gonna find you
Trying to breathe with everybody right behind you
Scattering leaves to try and cover up my footprints
Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance
I'm running for the river
'Cause the river's running high
And there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
I'm running for the river
You can ride, you can fly
You can tell 'em that you tried

They'll never catch me
Tell 'em that you tried

He went by jim
A gangster wanna be and baby that was him
He stole his uncles 44 last friday night
Said if I wanted in
We'd have to plan this thing just right
We'll need the gloves, we'll need the bags, a couple masks
We'll need to steal a car with windows tinted black
We picked the nearest bank on main and 17th
We wrote down every line from every movie that we'd seen
Screamin'
This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We're here for all the shit that you don't need no more yeah
We want your cash open the safe get off your phone
Don't be a hero and you might just make it home
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Get 'em, get 'em up
The fresh restored mustang small block 302
Drove past the bank a dozen times this afternoon
The only parking spot was half a block away
It gave us time to practice just exactly what to say
Screamin'
This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We're here for all the shit that you don't need no more yeah
We want your cash open the safe get off your phone
Don't be a hero and you might just make it home
Get 'em up

Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Get 'em, get 'em up
Get 'em, get em up
The only thing I wish that one of us had known
That it was Sunday and the god damn bank was closed
Too bad we didn't see the cops accross the street
We dropped our guns and tried to run
And there went all our dreams
Screamin'
This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We're here for all the shit that you don't need no more yeah
We wanted easy street and now we'll never know
Somebody call my mom and tell her I ain't comin home
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground

Or maybe on a gambling wheel
Lost it in a diamond mind
It's dark as hell and hard to find
Well you can climb to the top of the highest tree
You can look around but you still won't see
What I'm looking for
Where the good times gone
Where the good times gone
All that stupid fun
And all that shit we've done
Where the good times gone
Well I still don't know
Out in the back in the old corn field
Underneath the tractor wheel
Thought I'd dig till I found it first
Broke my back and died of thirst
Well you can bribe the devil
You can pray to God
You can sell off everything you've got
And you still won't know
Where the good times gone
Where the good times gone
All that stupid fun
And all that shit we've done
Where the good times gone
Well I still don't know
Saw it on the silver screen
Preacher says "don't know what it means"
Last page ad in a comic book
Bought me a map, told me where to look
It ain't carved of stone or made of wood
And if you pay for it then it ain't no good
And you still won't know
What I'm looking for
Where the good times gone
Where the good times gone
All that stupid fun
And all that shit we've done
Where the good times gone

Damn it I knew the second that you came up
From underneath the covers say
I wanna meet your mother, your daddy
Your sister and your brother
One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me
But darling my shit ain't moved around the country
And no we're buying diamonds
Saying it's only 20 karats it can't be that hard to find it baby
Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' round and round
She takes light, the sunshine kissing me
Bittersweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
She takes light, the sunshine kissing me
Bittersweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
Light on sunset, can't imagine the two having fun yet
Baby maybe just wait cause I ain't drunk yet
As soon as I look over
Wait a sugar called at you a busy motor phoner
Don't be wrong girl
What you doing nothing wrong girl
Looks like we got another come along girl
If you ain't afraid to try it
You ain't really flying platinum long as I can be
The platinum baby
Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' round and round

Big stuff, big world, hopefully a very cute sexy girl
big tits, big butt, love it
When it goes like a lollipop in her mouth
Yo (ma niggaz) , (yo ma niggaz) , yo, it's Flo Rida
Yo, she got a big ass of a nice cupcake
God gave her that for her queen sake
She can suck my pistol
like a army military missile
She can speak Spanish, English or French
But I get hurt and wrench she she sucks my pistol
So I have say yo, yo she got a big cupcake
Take that for your good sake, yo (ma niggaz)

I wonder what it fells like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up to the end
Until that moment when
I'll find the one that I'll spend forever with
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
Everyone wants to know they're not alone
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Tonight
Out on the street
Out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right
It's just like déjàvu
Me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?
Isn't that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
Everyone wants to know they're not alone
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Ooooo
You can't give up
(When you're looking for)
The diamond in the rough
(You never know)
It shows up
(Make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one
The one you're waiting on
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me
Ohhhhhhh
Nobody wants to do it on their own
Everyone wants to know they're not alone

There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there

            <field name="lyrics">I went out on the town with a friend last weekend
His ex girlfriend's friend was there alone
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling, she could really handle alcohol
Another one down and headed off the deep end
The more we drank, the less that we had them
And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
She smokes a little home drown, drinks a little cuervo
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt
She's got a fast car, hotter then a dance bar
Looking like a rockstar, she'll be the talk of the town
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some
God all mighty look at that body
It looks like a sticker on a new ferrari
She's a scene from a bay watch rerun
Hotter then a barrel from a squeeze machine gun
Well, she can get it lower then a maserati
Never seen somebody move that way
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party
Everybody wants to know her name
And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little cuervo
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt
She's got a fast car, hotter then a dance bar
Looking like a rockstar, and she likes to go out and...
She likes to get her hands up
Anything to stand on
Anything to dance on
She'd be swinging around
Under the hot lights, underneath the spot light
Even going all night
She'll be the talk of the town
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some
God all mighty look at that body
It looks like a sticker on a new ferrari
She's a scene from a bay watch rerun

And I can't see the reason why,
Why there is blood on my sleeve
And all this time, I thought it mine
But it's not, it's yours and
It's not worth it for me,
Gets harder every time call you
This life you lead,
Like us living in a shiny ballroom
Next time you bleed,
Right about this time tomorrow
Next time you steal,
Better ask before you borrow
And I don't see too well, don't sing too well
And so I settle to scream
Just grab your shit, and leave with it
They won't make no statues of you
It's not worth it for me,
Gets harder every time call you
This life you lead,
Like us living in a shiny ballroom
Next time you bleed,
Right about this time tomorrow
Next time you steal,
Better ask before you borrow
This label "theif", find a better title suited for you
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you
This time I've forgotten
I swear this shit was rotten
This time, I believe it
Cause I've seen the shit you're needin
It's not worth it for me,
Gets harder every time call you
This life you lead,
Like us living in a shiny ballroom
Next time you bleed,
Right about this time tomorrow
Next time you steal,
Better ask before you borrow
This label "theif", find a better title suited for you
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you</field>

I am so high, I can hear heaven
Whoa, but heaven, no heaven don't hear me
And they say
That a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
Someone told me
Love would all save us
But, how can that be
Look what love gave us
A world full of killing
And blood spilling
That world never came
And they say
That a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do
And they say
That a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
And they're watching us
They're watching us
As we all fly away
And they're watching us
They're watching us
As we all fly away
And they're watching us
They're watching us

Now and again she sits beneath the tree
The sign above it reads,
Hard work will set you free'
Hold out your hand and ask for some
Hold out your hand and ask for some
Too late for another direction
Always what we've got in store
Hurry back we've all been waiting
We can't take much anymore
Where are the days where brothers are brothers
A childless mother, leave that except for
Leave that except for one
Hold out your hand and ask for some
Hold out your hand and ask for some
Too late for another direction
Always what we've got in store
Hurry back we've all been waiting

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on and hold on
I keep listening to my chest
For a beat but there's nothing left
It's been a week since I've seen you
And I still can't believe it
Cause I'm dying inside alone
And everyday we gotta be apart
I'm like a baby with a broken heart
But the second that I'll see you
You will know how much I need you
Because I'll never be letting you go
(now you know why...)
I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You don't wanna keep going without
If I ain't holding onto you
Then I'll be holding out forever
I've got you now and
I'm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
Cause every moment I'm with you
Is like I'm holding on to heaven
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on and hold on
And if I can write a symphony
Baby you would be my melody
And you would flow like a river
Slowly going on forever
Like a feather that's blowing away
Like every woman needs a fairytale
Like every mother's love that never fails
Like every game that needs a player
And a sinner needs a savior
I'm appealing you willing to say
(now you know why...)
I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You don't wanna keep going without
If I ain't holding onto you
Then I'll be holding out forever
I've got you now and
I'm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
Cause every moment I'm with you
Is like I'm holding on to heaven
And I'm willing to wait
Just to see another day
What I'm waiting for
Will wash this pain away
And it's never too late
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on and hold on
Now you know why...
I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You don't wanna keep going without
If I ain't holding onto you
Then I'll be holding out forever
I've got you now and
I'm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough

Is like I'm holding on to heaven
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
Cause every moment I'm with you
It's like I'm holding on to heaven

And if forever never comes then I

Pills and all enough to kill him while he sleeps
Is this the alley we drag him to
Just off of Hollywood and Normandy
If it worked like she said it would
Just like living in Hollywood
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems
Just like I'm back in emergency
Please don't be too long while you’re gone
There ain't enough to keep me here too long

Should've told her to go, and I know it
But she tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home
I did what I did, can't say hey man, I'm just a kid
Saw the lie in my eyes, couldn't hide it
Cause she tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
But I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone
In a house that's not a home
The pain in my heart's
'Cause we're a thousand miles apart
I've got no one to blame for the shame
'Cause she's waiting back home
I hope she's waiting back home
Stupid to think that I could blame it on the drink
Now I'm trying to stall making calls
To someone back home
I hope there's someone back home
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
But I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone
In a house that's not a home
I walk through the door and there's no light on anymore
Must have known all along I was wrong
Cause there's no one at home
No one's waiting back home
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
But I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar

Scream "are we having fun yet?"
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad

Like wounded soldiers in need of healing.
Time to be honest, this time I'm bleeding
Please dont dwell on it,
Cause I didn't mean it
I cant believe I said
I'd lay our love on the ground
But it doesn't matter cause I've made it up forgive me now
Everyday I spend away my souls inside out
Gotta be someway
That I can make it up to you now, somehow.
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me too
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
I was blindfolded, but now im seeing
My mind was closing, now I'm believing
I finally know what just what it means to let someone in
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will
So if your ever lost and find yourself all alone
I'd search forever just to bring you home,
Here and now this I vow
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me too
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you
No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember you know
I'll always come for you
Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,
Yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember
you know I'll always come for you
I'd crawl across this world for you
Do anything you want me to

And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We’ll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

            <field name="lyrics">My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned
Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less travelled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
If today was your last day
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause
There's no second try
So live like you're never livin twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
Would you call those friends you've never seen?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one your dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'll finally fall in love?
If today was your last day
If today was your last day
Would you make it up by mending a broken heart
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
Would you call those friends you've never seen?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one your dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'll finally fall in love?

It was easy to tell
It was love from above that could
Save me from hell
She had fire in soul it was easy
To see
How the devil himself could be pulled out the me
There were drums in the air as
She started to dance
Every soul in the room
Keeping time with
Their hands we sang
(Chorus)
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like
The angels sing
We're singing
Ai oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we dance on
Into the night
And we danced on
Into the night
Like a piece to the puzzle
That falls into place
You could tell how we felt
From the look on your face
We were spining in circles
With the moon in our eyes
No room left to move
In between you and I
We forgot where we were
And we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced
Through the night
And we sang
(Chorus)
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like
The angels sing
We're singing
Ai oh ay oh ay oh ay

            <field name="lyrics">(Verse 1)
He was my best friend, I tried to help him,
But he traded everything, for suffering,
And found himself alone.
I watched the lying, turn into hiding,
With scars on both his lips, his fingertips...
Were melted to the bone.
(Chorus)
But I can still remember what his face looked like,
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night.
Tell me what you know
Tell me what you've gone and done now
Tell me what you know
Tell me what you've gone and done now
A gun would do the trick
To get it over with
You're better off
To take all that you got and burn it on the spot,
Just to get high-igh, igh, igh (high-igh, igh, igh).
(Verse 2)
Three days no sleeping, he gave up eating,
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing,
And pretended not to know...
He started stealing, to supply the feeling,
Found out he pulled a knife, on someone's wife...
And held it to her throat.
(Extended Chorus)
But I can still remember what his face looked like,
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night
Tell me what you know
Tell me what you've gone and done now
Tell me what you know
Tell me what you've gone and done now
A gun would do the trick
To get it over with
You're better off
To take all that you got and burn it on the spot,
Just to get high-igh, igh, igh (high-igh, igh, igh).
Tell me what you did
Where you got it hid
Show me
Is what you really want
Watching what you've got?
Slowly
Circling the drain
Throw it all away
Just to get high-igh, igh, igh (high-igh, igh, igh).
High-igh, igh...oooooh!
Tell me what you know
Tell me what you've gone and done now
Tell me what you know
Tell me what you've gone and done now
A gun would do the trick
To get it over with
You're better off
To take all that you've got and burn it on the spot,
Just to get high-igh, igh, igh (high-igh, igh, igh).
Tell me what did
Where you got it hid
Show me
Is what you really want
Watching what you've got?
Slowly
Circling drain
Throw it all away
Just to get high-igh, igh, igh, igh
Just to get high-igh, igh, igh, igh
Circling the drain
Throw it all away
Just to get high-igh, igh, igh, igh.</field>

Kiss it goodbye, goodbye,
Hollywood is plastic
But easy on the eyes
Big Apple is fantastic
But cuts you down to size
Treat you like a doormat
Expecting you to fail
Says right across your forehead
Integrity for sale
You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself
That brunettes move to New York
Blondes go California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow all your pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
(Kiss it goodbye)
Stealing comes with practice
Lying comes with ease
But neither one is faster
Than falling to your knees
Money leads to fame
And fame is the disease
The latest epidemic
Reality TV
You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself
That brunettes move to New York
Blondes go California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow all your pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
Fame
What's the last thing you get out of life
Watch your ass and kiss it goodbye
Fame
What's the last thing you get out of life
Watch your ass and kiss it goodbye
So let's move to New York
Or out to California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow all your pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
Fame
What's the last thing you get out of life
Watch your ass and kiss it goodbye
Fame

I am not a leader of men
Since I prefer to follow
Do you think I could have a drink
Since it's so hard to swallow
So hard to swallow
Turn your television off
And I will sing a song
If you suddenly have the urge
You can sing along
I touch your hand I touch your face
I think the fruit is rotten
Give me lessons on how to breathe
Cause I think I've forgotten
I think I've forgotten
One day, up to a cliff
That overlooks the water
I jumped in to save a girl
It was somebody's daughter
And now the ring that's on my hand
Was given to me by her
And To this day we all sit around
And dream of ways to get higher
To get much higher.</field>

Start the loving in the truck
And wind up in the ditch
Then The old man will come a runnin'
With a hickory switch
Oh, no, gotta learn this someday
Why I gotta learn the hard way?
Buddy showed me just
How fast a car can go
I'll race you for your pink slip
Right before this show
Put your girlfriend in the bet
To make things good
'Cause, she's been staring at me
Like no girlfriend should
Bastard's sitting right there
On the starting line
Stuck the sugar in your gas tank
By myself last night
Oh, no, gotta learn this someday
Why I gotta learn the hard way?
Hey, there little darling

We watched the river, take him away

I am the only one left
Tired and afraid lies a saddened man
Knelt beside him with head in hand
And escaped on a lonely breath
But before he died I could have sworn he said
I am the only one
I am the only one left

I am sorry

Used to mean something
But now it means nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember
The pain of December
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry is too late
I'm breaking free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go
You came back to find I was gone
And that place is empty
Like the hole that was left in me
Like we were nothing at all
It's not what you meant to me
I thought we were meant to be
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry is too late
I'm breaking free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I let it go (and now I know)
A brand new life (is down this road)
And when it's right (you always know)
So this time (I won't let go)
There's only one thing left here to say
Love's never too late
I've broken free from those memories
I've let it go, I've let it go
And two goodbyes led to this new life
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Oh, Oh
Oh (don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go)
Won't let you go
Don't let me go</field>

Hurts too much

And now it's just you and me
Borrow one and we will make three
I say we steal one more
Just like we did once before
And now I thought I told her
That she won't get much older
And now I've found a little friend
And now it makes no difference
Cause I am not quite in yet
And now its on the table
Cause she's perfectly able
And now I've found a little friend</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Well I know the feeling
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cutting yourself with a jagged edge
I'm telling you that
It's never that bad
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure
You can take this anymore
So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
And you scare yourself
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
Cause I have faith in you
That you're going to make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young
And the best is yet to come
So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
And you scare yourself
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Well everybody's hit the bottom
Everybody's been forgotten
When everybody's tired of being alone
And everybody's been abandoned
I left a little empty handed
So if you're ever barely hanging on
Just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
And you scare yourself
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby

It's a 50/50 chance that their planning to jump me
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive
Well, my favorite little waitress has ahold of my eye
But there's a shotgun loaded hidden under the bar
Her fingers on the trigger if anybody gets out of line
There's other places that are better to go
But I'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And I can't get enough of the things that she does
She's gonna be my midnight queen
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
She's gonna lick my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't letting go
And I can't get enough of the things that she does, alright
Well, she walks like a model and she talks like a trucker
Doesn't want a lollipop, but she showed us a sucker
They're closing in around her, I'm cutting to the front of the line
She grabbed a bottle of tequila and a light for her lips
Laid her body on the bar and put the salt on her hips
Was lying when I told her that I'm only gonna lick her tonight
Theres other places that are better to go
But I'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And I can't get enough of the things that she does
She's gonna be my midnight queen
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
She's gonna lick my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't letting go
She's gonna be my sex machine
And I can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo
And I can't get enough of the things that she does
And I can't get enough of the things that she does
She's gonna be my midnight queen
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
She's gonna lick my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't letting go
She's gonna be my sex machine
And I can never get her under control

I can see the future burning bright
Is it burning bright?
The ceiling has us mesmerized
It feels like we could never die
Heading for the dark side of the moon
As we lift off into the sky
Invincible and so alive
Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The universe just started slowing down
And suddenly we're travelling
A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
When shadows soon start breaking free
No longer held by gravity
When we get so far from the ground
Speaking to the galaxy
Receiving and sending back to me
I can finally hear the speed of sound
The speed of fucking sound
I like this everlasting pill
Coz time itself is standing still
Why's the room still spinning just the same?
Turn off your phone so no-one calls
Coz you and I are tripping balls
I can still hear ringing in my brain
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The universe just started slowing down
And suddenly we're travelling
A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour

The time gone by, but you still look the same
It felt so real to have you back with me
It's just too bad it's just another dream
Give me just one wish!
If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you that I

I miss you so much
I miss you so so I do
God knows I do, I
I miss you so so I do
I miss you so much
I miss you so so I do
I miss you so so I do
After dark laughing in the rain
Silver heart locket on a chain
Pictures fade and silver turns to grey
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away
Give me just one wish!
If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
And traded it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told you
All the things I left unsaid
I meant to say them before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you that I
I miss you so so I do

I miss you so so I do
I miss you so much
I miss you so so I do
I miss you so so I do
If there was some way you know I would
I'd do it today, I wish I could
I'd call out your name, it does no good
I wish I knew what would
I, I miss you so much
God knows I do
I, I wish my wish was enough
Give me just one wish!
If I could give it all away

Never made promises

I'm always pulling on the threads,
I'm always pulling on the threads,
What a mistake, mistake.

Straight from mom and daddy

Shakin' hands, nice to meet you,
I don't know who you are

Never pleasured from the treasure in a garbage can

Your life's a goddamn fairy tale
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale
One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Stick your diamond ring
Where the sun don't shine
Oh it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've never failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale
Oh it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've never failed
Your life's a fucking fairy tale</field>

            <field name="lyrics">He's drunk again, it's time to fight
She must have done something wrong tonight,
The living room becomes a boxing ring
It's time to run when you see him clenching his hands,
She's just a woman..
Never again
I hear her scream from down the hall,
Amazing she can even talk at all,
She cries to me..
"go back to bed,"
I'm terrified
that she'll wind up dead in his hands,
She's just a woman..
Never again
Been there before but not like this,
Seen it before but not like this,
Never before have I seen it this bad,
She's just a woman..
Never again
Just tell the nurse you slipped and fell,
It starts to sting as it starts to swell,
She looks at you..
she wants the truth,
It's right out there in the waiting room with those hands,
Lookin' just as sweet as he can..
Never again
Seen it before but not like this,
Been there before but not like this,
Never before have I ever seen it this bad,
She's just a woman..
Never again
Father's a name you haven't earned yet,
You're just a child with a temper,
Haven't you heard "don't hit a lady,"
Kickin' your ass would be a pleasure
He's drunk again, it's time to fight,
Same old shit just, just on a different night,
She grabs the gun, she's had enough,
Tonight she'll find out how fuckin tough is this man,
Pulls the trigger fast as she can..
Never again
Seen it before but not like this,
Been there before but not like this,
Never before have I ever seen it this bad,
She's just a woman..
Never again</field>

And I'm starting to regret not spending
all of it with you.
Now I'm, wondering why,
I've kept this bottled inside,
So I'm starting to regret not telling
all of it to you.
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know...
Never gonna be alone!
From this moment on,
If you ever feel like letting go,
I won't let you fall...
Never gonna be alone!
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone.
And now, as long as I can,
I'm holding on with both hands,
Cuz forever I believe that there's
Nothing I could need but you,
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know...
You never gonna be alone!
From this moment on,
If you ever feel like letting go,
I won't let you fall.
When all hope is gone,
I know that you can carry on.
We're gonna see the world out,
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone.
Ooooh!
You've gotta live every single day,
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away,
Could be our only one,
You know it's only just begun.
Every single day,
Maybe our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Tomorrow never comes...
Time, is going by, so much faster than I,
And I'm starting to regret not telling
all of this to you.
Never gonna be alone!
From this moment on,
If you ever feel like letting go,
I won't let you fall.
When all hope is gone,
I know that you can carry on.
We're gonna see the world out,

I'm gonna be there all of the way,
I won't be missing a one more day,
I'm gonna be there all of the way,
I won't be missing a one more day.</field>

Just how many heads I'm tearing
Off of assholes coming on to her
Each night seems like it's getting worse
And I wish she'd take the night off
So I don't have to fight off
Every asshole coming on to her
It happens every night she works
They'll go and ask the DJ
Find out just what would she say
If they all tried coming on to her
Don't they know it's never going to work
They think they'll get inside her
With every drink they buy her
As they all try coming on to her
This time somebody's getting hurt
Here comes the next contestant
Is that your hand on my girlfriend?
Is that your hand?
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
There goes the next contestant
I even fear the ladies
They're cool but twice as crazy
Just as bad for coming on to her
Don't they know it's never going to work
Each time she bats an eyelash
Somebody's grabbing her ass
Everyone is coming on to her
This time somebody's getting hurt
Here comes the next contestant

I'll watch you leave here limping
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping

I'm hating what she's wearing
Everybody here keeps staring
Can't wait 'til they get what they deserve

As long as we're caught in together we're never gonna stop
I wanna go until the neighbors all complain
Cause they heard somebody screamin
And they think we're both in pain
I wanna go so long your parents
Think you died
There gonna call the cops the cia and then the fbi
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down
Hold on here we go
Yeah, we're gonna go untill our legs give out
Round and round we go
Yeah, we're gonna do it hangin upside down
Up and down we go
Yeah, we're getting ready for the next go round
Round and round we go
Shut the windows lock the doors unplug the phone
For all intents and purposes there ain't no body home
Then we can do it till the batteries are gone
And borrow two from the tv remote
to throw this thing back on
I wanna cover you with jello in the tub
We can roll around for hours without ever comin up
I want you naked with your favorite heels on
Slap john deere across my ass
And ride me up and down the lawn
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down
Hold on here we go
Yeah, we're gonna go untill our legs give out

And don't use grandfather as the bait
Down the hall the baby boy just born
Rosary around a crown of thorns
Please excuse me, I'm sorry, I just can't wait
And don't use grandfather as the bait
No...
Can't you see the lady's not ready
Hands and feet are bound and unsteady
In the hall the family's grieving
I'm the one who stays
I'm not leavin' yet.</field>

Alone enough to know my

It appears to be good for me than I'd rather die
And I can't eat, I can't sleep,
oh, but thank you for comin'
And why do we always laugh

Backwoods always lead to somethin'
Bury her 'cause the time was cut thin
All the while, you just stood and stared,
never cared to help
We just got carried away
Too late, it seems like my dreams are startin' to die
It occured to me, on the inside, I guess so have I
And I can't eat; I can't sleep,
oh, but thank you for comin'
And why do we always laugh
while we're the last ones comin'?
Standing right here on my defeat
Enjoy it now 'cause it won't repeat
Someway, somehow, the things that keep me alive
Aren't living here anymore</field>

where'd they all go?
Try to find but no one ever knows
This small town makes you wanna stay
Who the hell would want to anyway?
Well I'm leavin'
And I want it all
Thought I got it all
Then I finally saw
And I found out where it's all at
Sell it all, watch and learn
Sell it all watch it burn
Steal a car we're all headed south
You know the score so just shut your mouth
One more run then I want out
Not like them I'd rather go without
Without needing
And I want it all
Thought I got it all
Then I finally saw
And I found out where it's all at
Now I knew it all
What I never thought

Everytime I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times
I wonder if It's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in
Oh oh oh
Oh God I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh oh oh
Oh God I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
Everytime I do it makes me</field>

I found
I found something
Throw a stone into the water
The ripple is broke
Burn the baby
Just for holding the cradle too close
Take it all back
Search for justice, don't live there anymore
And he said
I need
I don't ask much anymore
I found
I found something
And why do you see me in this way?
The way that I did
I gave him the means to the ends
Yes I did
I bothered not to believe in this way

To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be

I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me
(So what you need?)
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and
James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
[Chorus:]
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
(I'll have the quesadilla, Ah Ha!!)
I'm gonna dress my ass
With the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to
Blow my money for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
I'm gonna sing those songs
That offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

There's never any time

How long it must've been?

Held only you and me
And every song it sings about it
Says that we can't live without it

Dance around this room

I hate to see the moments disappear
But tonight the sand is stopping
Take the hourglass and drop it
So we can stay inside this atmosphere

And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
'Coz Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a woman to treat me right
I could use a little muscle to get what I need
I'll drink a fifth of jack and scream out "She's with me!"
A couple of sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass

Gonna set this town alight
'Coz Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's all right
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's all right

On these hands and knees I’m crawlin’
Oh, I reach for you
Well I’m terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can’t hold my soul in
All I need is you
Come please I’m callin’
And oh I scream for you
Hurry I’m fallin’
Show me what it’s like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I’ll show you what I can be
Say it for me
Say it to me
And I’ll leave this life behind me
Say it if it’s worth saving me
Heaven’s gates won’t open up for me
With these broken wings I’m fallin’
And all I see is you
These city walls ain’t got no love for me
I’m on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And oh I scream for you
Come please I’m callin’
And all I need from you
Hurry I’m fallin’
Show me what it’s like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I’ll show you what I can be
Say it for me
Say it to me
And I’ll leave this life behind me
Say it if it’s worth saving me
Hurry I’m fallin’

That what you just gave
Nothing left to heal
Nothing left to save
Given half a chance
Given what we've spent
I will not repay
I will not repent
I don't wanna leave
I don't wanna stay
Get away from me
Stay the hell away
And I will give up my mind
And I will give my way
And I will pluck out my eyes
Yes I will feel my way
Yes I will
Is there something wrong
With the way I feel
I don't wanna beg
I don't have to steal
Let me prove myself
Let me earn your trust
Let me betray
The way that we discussed
I don't want to thieve
I don't want to snatch
Get away from me
Stay the hell away
And I will give up my mind
And I will give my way
And I will pluck out my eyes
Yes I will feel my way
Yes I will
In open hand, unopened gift
Her broken bones, her head won't lift
A decade since you've been gone
Mend the cracks and say so long
Say so long</field>

Stand off in the back,

Jump on to the bus, ride around with all of us
We'll go out on the town,
and light it up 'til we burn it down, burn it down
Afterhours and alcohol
Every club, we've seen them all
As along as we don't need to stand in line
Party scenes and billboard dreams,
the ladies love those limosines
You know they are going to show up anytime
We'll see you at the show

She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
You grow up quick when you grow up poor
It's the only way to La that she knows
The Hollywood pose: teeth, tips, and toes
Didn't take her long to leave the boulevard
So many five star friends with black credit cards
She'd try anything once
Cause anything goes
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold
(Hey, Hey)
Well she ain't no Cinderella
When she getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it
like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures
working three days a week
Yeah she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker
twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
(Hey, Hey)
I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book
City Hall would probably fall if anyone got a look
Every "A" list player player is a favorite friend
Says they all taste the same in the back of a benz
Her congressman would call her every once in a while
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile
She's done everyone once
And everyone knows
Gotta getta little dirty when you're digging for gold
(Hey, Hey)
Well she ain't no Cinderella
When she getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it
like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far to pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures
working three days a week
Yeah she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker
twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
Someone spilled the beans
and now her name's in the press
Tough to keep it all a secret
when you're one of the best
The judge is going easy
because cause he paid for her cheast
Yeah he loves his naughty wicked witch of the west
Well she ain't no Cinderella
When she's getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it
like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far to pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures
working three days a week
Yeah she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker
twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands</field>

Where the hell's my credit cards
Why's my wallet in the yard

Well now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other
Why's love gotta be so tough
Should see the look on my face
My shit's all over the place
Why's this happening to me
Why'd you take both sets of keys
And still I don't understand
Well now I guess I should've listened

There are no candles in here
Lipstick's still on my mirror

Maybe a little too well
Finger on the trigger, loaded bullet
He hit the stage so full of rage
And let the whole world know it
Six feet away, they heard him say
"Oh God, don't let him pull it"
Please God, don't let him pull it
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched you do it
How could you take his life away?
How could you be so full of hate?
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world all wonder why
I sat at home and on my own,
I cried alone
And scratched your name
On the side of a bullet
And in the wake of his mistake
So many lives are broken
Gone forever from a loaded bullet
And no excuse that you could use
Could pull somebody through it
And to this day so many say
"God why'd you let him do it?"
How could you let him do it?
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched him do it
How could you take his life away?
How could you be so full of hate?
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world

What if we trade it all complacency
For a voice that will be ignored?
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?
A candle's the smallest light
But a handful becomes a lighthouse
Cutting the night
For us, for us, for us, for us
The one with the loudest voice
Is really the one to follow
Silence the noise
So what, so what, so what

Need a few to tag along
Hanging here by a thread
Hear a voice inside my head
I'll lay beside you every night
And dread the day you might be gone
She said "in case you hadn't noticed that
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)
And I ain't about to anymore"
Now the wagon I'm in's paper thin
I think one wheel's coming off
Hey sister sin with that grin, where you been?
So kind of you to help me out
Hanging here by a thread

You moved in last friday night,
And I just couldn't wait
So I tried to call across the hall,
To ask you out someday
But a lineup formed outside your door,
And I was way too late
Well I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like
Some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want
I'm sitting here in second place
Because somewhere
The one I wanna be with's
With somebody else
Oh god, I wanna be that
Someone that you're with
I wanna be that someone
That you're with
And I can talk about it all day long
'til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that
Someone that you're with
I've got to be that
Someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him
Somewhere and just about to kiss
God I wanna be that someone that you're with
Well I hear your favorite songs
You sing along with everyday
And I borrow things that
I don't need for conversation sake
Last night I heard your key,
It hit your lock at 4 am
Instead of being out with me
You must be out with them
Well I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like
Some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want
I'm sitting here in second place
Because somewhere the one
I wanna be with's

With the million dollar body
They say it's over budget,

Needs to hit the big screen,
And shoot a little love scene
If hollywood had called her,
She'd be gone before you holler, come on
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
Every sugar daddy hittin' on her all night long
Doesn't care about the money,
She could be with anybody
Ain't it funny, yea but honey
When you are alone
(you naughty thing)
You're ripping up the dance floor honey
(you naughty woman)
You shake your ass around for everyone
(you're such a mover)
I love the way you dance with anybody
(the way you shake)
And tease them all while sucking on your thumb
You're so much cooler when you never pull it out
'cause you look so much cuter
With something in your mouth
Crafty little lip tricks
Tattoo's on her left hip
She's bending as you're spending
There's no end to it so baby come on
Dressed up like a princess
Bettin' that her skin smells
Better than the scent of every flower in the desert
Come on
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
Every sugar daddy hittin' on her all night long
Doesn't care about the money,
She could be with anybody
Ain't it funny, yea but honey

Who's living for the fun drinking
Over every dance floor like shes the only one
In the spotlight all night kissing everyone
And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb
(so much cooler)
When you never pull it out
(so much cuter)
With something in your mouth
(you naughty thing)
You're ripping up the dance floor honey
(you naughty woman)
You shake your ass around for everyone
I love the way you dance with everybody
(the way you shake)
And tease them all while sucking on your thumb
(you naughty thing)
You're ripping up the dance floor honey
(you naughty woman)
You shake that ass around for everyone
(you're such a mover)
I love the way you dance with everybody
(the way you shake)
And tease them all while sucking on your thumb
You're so much cooler when you never pull it out
'cause you look so much cuter
With something in your...</field>

            <field name="lyrics">The first words that come out
And I can see this song will be about you
I can't believe that I can breathe without you
But all I need to do is carry on
The next line I write down
And there's a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one it's standing on
I write lines down, then rip them up
Describing love can't be this tough
I could set this song on fire
Send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you
I'm dying to show you
This could end happily ever after
There doesn't ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along
I write lines down, then rip them up
Impossible describing love
I could set this song on fire
Send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes
Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
I could set this song on fire
Send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this
I wanna sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this</field>

Serving up the worst regret
Waiting for the chance
Serpents love the circunstance
Speaking to the sky
Sleight of hand and cheap disguise
Naming of your price
Payment for the sacrifice
Demon in your ear
Evil on your breath
You've brought the wolves right here
You've brought the kiss of death
You've just betrayed him (You've just betrayed)
The moment we've all been waiting
No one can save him (No one can save)
You won't believe until he's gone
Go on, go on
Your noose is waiting (No need to wait)
Go on, go on
You've just betrayed him (You've just betrayed)
Committed to your task
Jealousy behind your mask
Pieces are in place
Thirty for your last disgrace
Holding of your tongue
Dealings that can't be undone
Blood on your hands
Pawn inside the master plan
Demon in your ear
Evil on your breath
You've brought the wolves right here
You've brought the kiss of death
You've just betrayed him (You've just betrayed)
The moment we've all been waiting
No one can save him (No one can save)
You won't believe until he's gone
Go on, go on
Your noose is waiting (No need to wait)
Go on, go on
You've just betrayed him (You've just betrayed)
What have you gained? What have you done?
Nothing but shame and there's nowhere to run
Who takes the blame? Why have they come?
What in God's name have you done?
You've just betrayed him (You've just betrayed)
The moment we've all been waiting
No one can save him (No one can save)
You won't believe until he's gone
Go on, go on
Your noose is waiting (No need to wait)
Go on, go on
You've just betrayed him (You've just betrayed)
You've just betrayed
You've just betrayed
You've just betrayed</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Where will you be when the sky comes down?
And what would you do if the strength was found?
Stay right beside me when the ground starts shaking
The only sound you'll hear is the breath we're taking
If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again
This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the ripped-sky-morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming
Once it's started, there's no turning back
And I'll be with you when the sun turns black
'Cause finding faith will always be the hardest
While you're standing in the heart of darkness
If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again
This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the ripped-sky-morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming
Hold it on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold it on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home
Hold it on,
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold it on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on
Hold on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home
Hold on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold it on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on

This is the calm before the coming storm
(If we can find the light)
This is the fight that we've been waiting for

We'll make it till the dawn

            <field name="lyrics">Oh looking like another Bob Marley day
Hitting from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hanging out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and chong probably would've smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon, oh!
(Chorus)
Better hang on if you're taggin along
Cause we'll be doing this till six in the morning
Nothing wrong with going all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you got to
Get up and go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, we'll do it all again
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon
Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass cause I paid the rent
So I doubt, he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Jukebox cranking out the CCR
Had a few to Suzie Q this afternoon, oh!
(Chorus)
Better hang on if you're taggin along
Cause we'll be doing this till six in the morning
Nothing wrong with going all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you got to
Get up and go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, we'll do it all again
Get up, go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, we'll do it all again
Yeah, Just sitting around hanging out this afternoon
Don't want a wristwatch, or an alarm clock
to see what time it is
From the moment I wake up,
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by,
but have the best times
and hope it never ends
We drink all day until we fall down,
so we can do it all again
It's not the human walk, it's the human race
If we were living on the edge,
taking too much space
So I'll doubt I'll figure out just what to do
But to kicking around,
hanging out this afternoon, oh!
(Chorus)
Better hang on if you're taggin along
Cause we'll be doing this till six in the morning
Nothing wrong with going all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you got to
Get up and go out, me and all my friends
Drink up and fall down, we'll do it all again
Get up and go out, me and all my friends
Drink up and fall down we'll do it all again
Just kickin around, hanging out this afternnon
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon</field>

Swing as hard as you can swing it will still mean nothing
Shoulda seen it comin' it had to happen sometime
But you went and brought a knife to an all out gun fight
And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave
You've gone too far (get up, get up)
Who do you think you are (get up, so we can finish this)
Is this what you came for (get up, get up)
Well this means war (get up, so we can finish this)
Say anything you want but talk will get you nowhere
The only thing you brought was psychological warfare
There's no getting out and now you gotta wonder
Who will dig you out when you're six feet under
And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave
You've gone too far (get up, get up)

You know they're gonna know you lied
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know they're gonna burn it down
Wash my hands of this
You notice how god ain't even helping you out
Wash my hands of this
Notice how god ain't even helping you
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know they're gonna burn her down
So keep the way you feel anonymous
And hide it all until the day you die
Your secrets safe, at least you thought it was
You can only keep it for a little while
And now you're terrified
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away
You know they're gonna burn her down
Wash my hands of this
You notice how god aint even helping you out
Wash my hands of this
Notice how god aint even helping you
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know they're gonna burn her down

But nothings wrong, you've got your prom dress on
When they ask you'll say "it isn't mine"
Damn you for thinking we would never know
And damn you for thinking we would never find
Only reason that you made it this far
Never ever lasting, but you never tried
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
Why the hell don't you blow yourself away?
You know they're gonna burn her down
Wash my hands of this
You notice how god aint even helping you out
Wash my hands of this
Notice how god aint even helping you
Wash my hands of this

From long days in the field
And mother's hands are serving meals
In a cafe on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about is
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, It's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk
You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, It's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk
Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
Made it out, still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind

How could anyone ask for more?
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more?
But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, god I'm trying to
Trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more
And this kind of pain, only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go
But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, god I'm trying to
Trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
Was it something that I did?
Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me,
That was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear
Tonight I'm dying to tell you
That trying not to love you, only went so far
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining, from what we've fighting for
If we just keep on trying, we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you, ohhhh
Trying not love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more</field>

Are you waiting on a lightening strike
Are you waiting for the perfect night
Are you waiting till the time is right?
What are you waiting for?
Don't you wanna learn to deal with fear
Don't you wanna take the wheel and steer
Don't you wait another minute here
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you've gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
Are you waiting for the right excuse?
Are you waiting for a sign to choose
While your waiting it's the time you lose
What are you waiting for? (what are you waiting for?)
Don't you want to spread your wings and fly?
Don't you wanna really live your life?
Don't you want to love before you die?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only living once so tell me

You know you've gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You're only living once so tell me

Show me what you're aiming for
Whatcha going to save it for?
So what you really waiting for?
Tell me what you're waiting for
Show me what you're aiming for
Whatcha going to save it for?
So what you really waiting for?
Everybody's gonna make mistakes
But everybody's got a choice to make
Everybody needs a leap of faith
When are you taking yours?
What are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you've gotta give it your all

            <field name="lyrics">One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win
They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's cleary wrong
When we could feed the starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
The right thing to guide us
Is right here inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heart beat
The drumbeat carries on
And the drumbeat carries on
(Just like a heartbeat)
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win</field>

many nights we' VE PRAYED
WITH NO FULL ANY ONE COUL HEAR
IN OUR HEARTS A HOPEFUL SONG
WE BARELY UNDERSTOOD
NOW WE ARE NOT AFRAID
ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THERE'S MUCH TO FEAR WE WERE MOVING MOUTAINS
LONG BEFORE WE KNEW COULD

THERE CAN MIRACLES
WHEN YOU BELIEVE
THOUGH HOPE IS FRAIL
IT'S HARD TO KILL
WHO KNOWS WHAT MIRACLES
YOU CAN ACHIEVE
WHEN YOU BELIEVE
SOME HOW WILL
YOU WILL WHEN YOU BELIEVE
IN THIS WAY OF FEAR
WHEN PRAYED SO OFTEN PROVES IN VAIN
HOPE SEEMS LIKE THE SUMMER BIRDS
TOO SWIFTLY FLOWN AWAY
YET NOW I' M STANDING HERE
MY HEARD 'S SO FULL ,CAN' T EXPLAIN
SEEKING FAITH AND SPEAKING WORDS
I NEVER THOUGH I 'D SAY
THERE CAN BE MIRACLES
WHEN YOU BELIEVE(WHEN YOU BELIEVE)

Lookin for a scapegoat, long past due
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you
I still hear him screaming "where do I hide?"
And he asks and I say "hurry inside"
He said, she said, No she don't
Be back before morning, You know she won't
I remember that summer, like yesterday
And I remember his mother, As he was dragged away
I still hear him screaming "where do I hide?"
And he asks and I say "hurry inside"
A whole lot of memories
Yours and not mine
And he asks and I say "hurry inside"
Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine
Lookin for a scapegoat, long past due
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you

Like walking 'round
with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
And it's alright
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feelin' like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it
then you know I'd lied
But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right
So I'll tell you why don't you and I get
together an' take on the world
and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other,
and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in
When's this fever gonna break ?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
And it's alright
Bouncin' round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied
Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out, everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right
So I'll tell you why don't you and I get together an' take
on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I get together,
and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in
Slowly I begin to realize this is never gonna end
But about the same time you walk by
And I say oh here we go again, oh
Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out, everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right
So I'll say why don't you and I get together an' take
on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I get together,
and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in.</field>

Control is all you really need
And I guess I had it coming,
my fault for not runnin
I just dressed too tempting

And I can't believe it
I can't believe that you didn't see me

They're all laughing at me

Already said goodbye nothing left to say
A tiny church, a tiny town and not a tear was spent
Not how I wanted it I'm hating all of this
Well I'm hating, All of this, I'm hating,
All of this, All of this, All of this
Now I know why I hide my love from you some days
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along and tore this wall down around me
Looks like you found me, now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning
I've been a loser all my life I'm not about to change
If you don't like it, there's the door nobody made you stay
There ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it
Just how I wanted it I'm hating all of this
Well I'm hating, All of this, I'm hating,
All of this, All of this, All of this
Now I know why I hide my love from you some days
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along and tore this wall down around me
Looks like you found me, now I know why

You can hear them
You can tell them by the way they knock
Somebody said the other one had a badge
Who told ya, Who told ya
How bout if I stay and you run away
Well come on back and try to get some today
Well somebody's gonna do it again
Gonna make me turn against all of my friends
So you better have something damn worthy to say
They're growin dope everywhere around the block
You can smell it
You can tell by the way they talk
Somebody stole five for gasoline
Who told ya, Who told ya
How bout if I stay and you run away
Well come on back and try to get some today
Well somebody's gonna do it again
Gonna make me turn against all of my friends
So you better have something damn worthy to say
I'll never do it again (No I wont)
Lets settle it (We dont)
I can't afford my life cause I'm spending it
Since you got just what you wanted
We never do anything anymore
One on the telephone, one on the door
Somebody said revenge was served sweeter cold
I told ya, I told ya
They're growing dope everywhere around the block
You can smell it you can tell it by the way they talk
Somebody stole five for gasoline
Who told ya, Who told ya

I gazed a gazely stare
we walked a million hills

I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines in the pines

Her husband, was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines in the pines

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again till the Fourth of July
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon
Chorus
Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils
Fight to claim them for their own

Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?

I can't complain
I'm on a plain
My mother died every night
It's safe to say don't quote me on that
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
One more special message to go
And then I'm done then I can go home
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?

Everyone is gay
What else could I write
I don't have the right
What else should I be
All apologies
In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married
Buried
I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua sea foam shame
Sunburn with freezerburn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy
In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married
Buried
yeah yeah yeah
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are

Into a place where everyone you see
Has had a time to try to PLAY!
If you go get shot
When you'll be what you name
Protector of your gun
Everyone plays with your gun
Way, way, way, way
Everyone wants to try to gun you gun you down in pain
Want to see you try to play
I want to describe you
Put your name as a national woman
I don't like your coffee
I want to have your friendship
As a jock, and to the top
Way, way, way, way</field>

Not only magnets but I could pry bar it shut
Glueing my manhood in a manhole
like peppy lepew the scent
hey hey had a lightweight clutch
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate
She laughs about it
Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right
Jacking themselves off polyester!
I wanna jump, this isn't right!
Hey, when am I getting it back?
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate
I don't know why,
I got a joke too silly to say
Don't touch the balls
I got a dick, Dick -- hear my fucking hate!
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate
If you're wondering, it's gaining monthly
Fiberglass insulated,
Disguised as cotton candy,
Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate
Feeling can't help me romp
Bill just fuck me, take me anal
Billy's slit reminds me of someone
I'm sick of paying for the love boat
Tony and Tenille say wanna jump rope
And I say look!
I got my titilate spayed
I got my liberty
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
..
Nothing hard
I gotta be around pussy
Don't let me fall
I got a heh-heh ...
Well you can't live
We got my diddly spayed
I got titilate spayed
I got titilate spayed
I got titilate spayed
I got titilate spayed

I don't care what you think unless it is about me.
It is now my duty to completely drain you.
A travel through a tube and end up in your infection.
Chew your meat for you.
Pass it back and forth.
In a passionate kiss
from my mouth to yours,
'cuz I like you.
With eyes so dialated, I've become your pupil.
You've taught me everything without a poison apple.
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student.
Idebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids.
Chew your meat for you.
Pass it back and forth.
In a passionate kiss
from my mouth to yours,
'cuz I like you.
(you, you....)
One baby to another said, "I'm lucky to have met you."
I don't care what you think unless it is about me.
It is now my duty to completely drain you.
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection.
Chew your meat for you.
Pass it back and forth.
In a passionate kiss
from my mouth to yours.
Slappy lips to lips.
You're my vitamins,

We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
And I have a hangover...(Have a hangover) (4x)
Skin the sun
Fall asleep
Wish away
The soul is cheap
Lesson learned
Wish me luck
Soothe the burn
Wake me up

Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see I'm really scared

You know that Annie's back in town.
It won't take long just watch and see,
All the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face is the same,
As it was so long ago.
But from her eyes a different smile,
Like that of one who knows.
Well it's been ten years and maybe more,
Since I first set eyes on you.
The best years of my life gone by,
Here I am alone and blue.
Some people cry and some people die,
By the wicked ways of love.
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With no grace from the Lord above
People talking all around,
About the way you left me flat.
I don't care what the people say,
I know where their jive is at.
One thing I do have on my mind,
If you can clarify please do,
It's the way you call me by another guy's name,
When I try to make love to you.
Work so hard I couldn't unwind,
Get some money saved.
Abuse my love a thousand times,
However hard I tried.
Heartbreaker your time has come,
Can't take your evil way.
Go away heartbreaker..</field>

On we sweep,

Our only goal will be the western shore.

From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
Sultry fields of green,
Whispered tales of lore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war,
We are your overlords.
On we sweep,
With thrashing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.
So now you?d better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day despite all your losing.</field>

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again till the Fourth of July
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon
Chorus
Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils
Fight to claim them for their own

Light my candles, in a daze
'Cause I've found God
yeah yeah yeah (x6)
I'm so lonely, but that's okay, I shaved my head ...
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard ...
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there ...
But I don't care
I'm so horny, but that's okay ...
My will is good

I can't let you smother me
I'd like to, but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing
And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Still smell her on you
Don't - tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone
And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you
Truth! - covered in security

And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We've made a pact to learn from who
Ever we want without new rules
We'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way
To prove they still
Smell her on you (3x)</field>

On the tile floor, like oatmeal pizza
Fill my toilet bowl of a cloudy
Puss, I feel my blood becoming chowder rust.
Only hurts a night, it hurts when I pee
Only hurts a night, until I sleep

stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge

Remained in seclusion

"I'm gonna open myself up a flea market
I'm gonna open myself up a flea market
And you're gonna wish that you did
And retire on the profits
First off
I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs
Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf with my 800 dollar a month tax free Century 21 shop
And then I am going to put my Mrs
Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups I've accumulated over the past 62 years
Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood and cut them up into two by two piece squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap and I'm going to cut them into two by two piece squares and then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach and I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood
And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them onto the plywood and burlap
And sell em for lots of money
People will be paying top dollar for my kids new used new toys and clothing
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that piss stained mattress I've been sleeping on..."</field>

Maybe she would like more food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

Polly says her back hurts
And she's just as bored as me

They choose the path where no one goes.
They hold no quarter.
They hold no quarter.
Walking side by side with death,
The devil mocks their every step.
The snow drives back the foot that's slow,
The dogs of doom are howling more.

To build a dream for me and you.
They choose the path where no one goes.

Invented at your birth?
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
And store it deep inside me
I formulate infinity
And store it deep inside me.</field>

She seems too weak
She takes a week to get over it
She likes the sea
She likes to see
She likes to think she has all of it
She likes the sound
She likes the sand
She likes to stand, she can't afford to sit
She likes to be
She's into guilt
Guilt
She likes to think
she likes to drink
She seems too weak, she takes all the rent
She likes the time
she owns the time
She borrows time to self-invent
She seems too weak

She likes to think she has all of it
She likes the sand
she likes to stand
She likes to sit
she likes to go
Go
She likes to be
She likes to go

One more high to decay my nervous
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way
It's over
One more day to complete my service
One more time here to fade my servant
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way
Over
She seen through me and mine
And I know a later time
We could make it with you
We're the same
Old age (x4)
One more day to complain, my servant
One more doubt here to find a servant
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way
It's over
Wondering how I'm here date my cover
One more doubt here to save my never
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way
It's over
She seemed true, me and mine
And I know a later time
We and we're you to you
Leave the soul
Old age (x4)
Just you need and read you free
Hmmm
And knew
You read
You flew
Ooo
Hmmm
One more day to complete my circuit
One more high here to find my nervous
Someday I'm gonna find a way
It's over
One more doubt here to claim my supper
I can have anything you wanted
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way
It's over
He seemed to read minds
And I know we're out of time
Breathe away here with you
Dream the same on the dew
Breathe the same on her
Breathe to moan on a man
Breathe and shame on you
He's late
Old age (x7)</field>

I got so high that I scratched 'til I bled
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
My mother died every night
It's safe to say don't quote me on that
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
One more special message to go
And then I'm done then I can go home
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain</field>

She pushed food through the door
And I crawl towards the crack of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
A good hosing down
The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twist and masturbate
I said so
Nirvana
Black windows of paint
I scratched with my nails
I see others just like me
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones
They point in my way
They come with a flash of light
And take my family away
And very later I have learned to
Accept some friends of ridicule
My whole existence is for your amusement
And that is why I'm here with you!
To take you with me
You're right

Some belong to strangers and some to folks you

Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in
the sand
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands
Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words
When you've finished with the mop then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work it took was fun
Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words
Many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
Some say it was Greenland and some say Mexico
others decided it was nowhere except for where they
stood
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they
could</field>

Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns
What is wrong with me (x3)
I'm gonna do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns
What is wrong with me (x2)
What do I think of me ?
Hate, hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth

Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice
With a step to your left and a flick to the right
You catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special
And you look like you're the best
Her name is rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh rio rio dance across the rio grande
I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on tv
Two of a billion stars it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you
Hey now look at that did he nearly run you down
at the end of the drive the lawmen arrive you make me feel
Alive, alive, alive
I'll take my chance cause luck is on my side
I tell you something I know what you're thinking
I tell you something I know what you're thinking
Her name is rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh rio rio dance across the rio grande
Her name is rio she don't need to understand
I might find her if I'm looking like I can
Oh rio rio hear them shout across the land
From mountains in the north down to the rio grande</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
And all the flowers are everywhere
Pretty girls are everywhere
"Think of me and I'll be there."
Goodbye, papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
"I don't know all these words
I have bought three turds
With my BB-gun I would kill birds"
We had joy, we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time
All our lives, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hill that we reached
Were just starfish on the beach
Goodbye, michelle, my little one
"I was the apple of the shiny sun.
And I have loved you every week
All my tears are salty
I think that now I will start to leave"
We had joy, we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time
We had joy, we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun
But the hill on the beach
Were just starfish on the beach.
We had joy, we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time
I've had joy, we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars that we reached
Were just starfish on the beach.</field>

Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold
If she floats then she's not
A witch like we had thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot
Serve the servants - oh no
That legendary divorce is such a bore
As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead I had a Dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before
Serve the servants - oh no
That legendary divorce is such a bore</field>

They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please don't go
Grandma take me home (8x)
Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good
Grandma take me home (8x)
She said, well, don't you stop your crying
Go outside and ride your bike
That's what I did, I killed my toe
Grandma take me home (8x)
After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched Tv
I woke up in my mother's arms
Grandma take me home (19x)
I wanna be alone</field>

Never finished his sentence
Remained in seclusion

Family is circuling
He having moved up
All the styles of heresy
Finally he appeared unexpectedly

If we did not have chemicals
You would not be writing my death certificate
Biting is my friend
My dog left me a sand send
One more day than I can plan
Ends safe from you
Biting ass a lie friend
When I will never have a friend
Biting silent as a man
His silence setting up around
And she improvised
And she was supervised
I was a rised
Or arosed
Or a rose
Or a rose
Or aroused
And fine
Fine line
When I
Said night time
When I
Could never kind
And I
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
It's hard and boiled
And sour all again
My milk is your shit
It revolves
It evolves
Cause it's biting out what would
My milk is your shit
My milk is piss
Don't you love that I can bite</field>

You're really nowhere
So wasteful
So foolish
Poppycock!
Who said don't look back?
Don't believe 'em
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant
'Cause they're gonna try and get behind you
Don't you let them do it
You know what I'm talking about?
You hear me talking?
You hear me talking!?
It's pretty scary, it's so revolting (x4)
Naaaah !
Take a step outside the country
And you turn around
Take a look at what you are
It is amazing
Take a good look
You're no big deal
You're so petty
It's a laugh
Take a step outside the planet
Turn around and around
Take a look at where you are
It's pretty scary.</field>

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I've listened to preachers
I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts
Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role
Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words
Yeh-h!
Heirs of a cold war
That's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Crowley, what went on in your head

Crowley, did you talk to the dead
Your life style to me seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
You waited on Satan's call
Mr
Charming, did you think you were pure
Mr
Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth
Mr
Crowley, won't you ride my white horse
Mr
Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear maidens call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall
Was it polemically sent

I wanna know

They cursed and buried him
Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning hell - unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong, so wrong
Oh yeah baby
Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Riding painted horses, oh the kids they love it so
You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow
Minding my own business like my mama always said
But if I don't try to help 'em they could wind up on the front page
I don't mind, draw the line then draw me an arrow
Feelin' fine, then I'll see you my friend

How do I know,
I got left behind
Everyone goes through changes
Looking to find the truth
Don't look at me for answers
Don't ask me
I don't know
How am I supposed to know
Hidden meanings that will never show
Fools and prophets from the past
Life's a stage
And we're all in the cast
Ya gotta believe in someone
Asking me who is right,
Asking me who to follow,
Don't ask me,
I don't know,
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Nobody ever told me
I found out for myself
Ya gotta believe in foolish miracles
It's not how you play the game
It's if you win or lose
You can choose
Don't confuse win or lose,
It's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you
(solo)
People look to me and say
Is the end near,
When is the final day
What's the future of mankind
How do I know,
I got left behind
Everyone goes through changes
Looking to find the truth
Don't look at me for answers
Don't ask me
I don't know
How am I supposed to know
Hidden meanings that will never show
Fools and prophets from the past
Life's a stage
And we're all in the cast

Asking me who is right,
Asking me who to follow,
Don't ask me,

I don't know
I don't know

I keep saying that it's getting too much

Hellraiser,
In the thunder and heat
Hellraiser,
Rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser,
And I'll make it come true
Hellraiser,
I'll put a spell on you
Walking out on another stage,
Another town, another place
Sometimes I don't feel right
Nerves wound up too damn tight
People keep telling me it's bad for my health
But kicking back don't make it
Out of control,
I play the ultimate role
But that's what lights my fire

Although my eyes are open wide
But I know I'll see you once more
When I see you, I'll see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side
Leaving, I hate to see you cry
Grieving, I hate to say goodbye
Dust and ash forever, yeah
Though I know we must be parted
As sure as stars are in the sky
I'm gonna see you when you comes to glory
And I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side
Never thought I'd feel like this
Strange to be alone, yeah
But we'll be together
Carved in stone, carved in stone, carved in stone
Hold me, hold me tight, I'm falling
Far away, distant voices calling
I'm so cold, I need you darling, yeah
I was down but now I'm flying straight across the great divide
I know you're crying but I'll stop you crying
When I see you, I see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side
I'm gonna see you, I'll see you on the other side

Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrow
Away tomorrow
Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone you hang in ruins
Thought you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the master keeper
'Cause you feel life's unreal
And you're living a lie
Such a shame who's to blame
And you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask
"Is there life after birth"?
What you sow can mean hell on this earth
Hell on this earth
Now you live inside a bottle
The reaper's traveling at full throttle
It's catching you but you don't see
The reaper is you and the reaper is me
Breaking laws,
Knocking doors
But there's no one at home
Make your bed,
Rest your head
But you lie there and moan
Where to hide,
Suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about
Wine is fine
But whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrow.</field>

There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Paid for the kill
But it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them
I can hear them Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you
Taught by the powers
That preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen
I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason
But just like the wounded
And when it's too late
They'll remember
They'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
A shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
A shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right.</field>

Ooh yeah

that I can't find
I can't see the things

I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh

Happiness I cannot feel

I tell you to enjoy life

Like chasing a rainbow
I can tell a thing or two
That's true
You've got to believe in yourself
Or no one will believe in you
Imagination like a bird on the wing
Flying, free for you to use
OK baby
I can't believe they stop and stare
And point their fingers doubting me
Their disbelief suppresses them
But they're not blind
It's just that they won't see
I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise.</field>

Living in the thunder
Driving me insane
Can I get a witness to take way the pain
Walking on the water
Going nowhere fast
Feeling like I´m walking with no shoes
on broken glass
You know it
You don't have to leave the lights on
I'm so used to being blind,
No more good-byes or yesterdays
So it's, I'll see you
Tomorrow
Welcome to the sideshow,
I'll cut it to the chase
Yeah I can hear you thinking
It's going all to waste
I don't mean to offend you
When I look you in the eyes
What's all this commotion?
It leaves me mystified
Chasing all the rainbows
Falling from the sky
I know your intentions
Are all a bunch of lies
I'm running out of patience,
Falling off track
You better start to worry,
'Cause I may not make it back
All right now
You don't have to leave the lights on
I'm so used to being blind,
One good reason to blow me away
So it's,
I'll see you tomorrow,
I'll see you tomorrow
Living in the big house,
Dying by the rail
If I wanted your opinion
I'd call you up in hell
Could that be the mailman
Knock' on the door
Or just another lightweight
Finally evening up the score
You know it
You don't have to leave the lights on
I'm so used to being blind,
No more good-byes or yesterdays
So it's,
I'll see you tomorrow
No more reasons to blow you away
So it's,
I'll see you tomorrow</field>

Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
in the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
for the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
that he will soon unfold
Now the time is here
for Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Heavy boots of lead
fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can

No one else to blame but I can't let go
It's calling me, t's calling me
It's calling me, it's calling me
I'm riding on a train that I can't control
See no evil, fear no fright
Never lose the feeling
Keep the targets in your sight
Know the cards you're dealing
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know
Rules meant for breaking and I gotta let,
I gotta let it go
I'm riding on a train that I can't control
No one else to blame but I can't let go
It's calling me, it's calling me
It's calling me, it's calling me
I'm riding on a train that I can't control.</field>

The fear that I hide behind
I hate rejection, it's the worst it greatly hurts me
Living inside my head
I feel like the living dead
I need your affection, it's the best, it greatly helps me
With my back against the wall
Trying so hard not to fall
Guess I'm tired of sleeping around
Hopeless, in dispair, don't know if I'm here or there
Feeling like I'm up when I'm down
But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
You know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here
Well I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
I don't want to die
A head full of tragic schemes
What keeps me alive is dreams
I dream that someday i'll find the key that sets my mind free
You may think i've lost control
The man with the broken soul
I'm not here to try and make excuses just believe me
With my back against the wall
Trying so hard not to fall
Guess I'm tired of sleeping around
Hopeless, in dispair, don't know if I'm here or there
Feeling like I'm up when I'm down

I don't have any plans to go anywhere
You know I'm alive

Well I'm still alive

Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Sweet guy, don't wanna stay alive when you're 25
Wendy's stealing clothes from marks and sparks
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
Funky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man I need tv when I've got t
rex
All the young dudes (hey dudes)
Carry the news (where are ya)
Boogaloo dudes (stand up come on)
Carry the news
All the young dudes (I want to hear you)
Carry the news (I want to see you)
Boogaloo dudes (and I want to talk to you all of you)
Carry the news
Now jimmy looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
We can love
And my brother's back at home
With his beatles and his stones
We never got if off on that revolution stuff
It was such a drag, too many snags
Well I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around me, or is it in my head?
All the young dudes (hey dudes)
Carry the news (where are ya)
Boogaloo dudes (stand up)
Carry the news
All the young dudes (I want to hear ya)
Carry the news (I want to see you)
Boogaloo dudes (and I want to relate to you)
Carry the news
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man I need tv when I've got t

Carry the news (let's hear the news come on)
Boogaloo dudes (I want to kick you)
Carry the news
All the young dudes (hey you there with the glasses)
Carry the news (I want you)
Boogaloo dudes (I want you at the front)
Carry the news (now you all his friends)
All the young dudes (now you bring him down cause I want him)
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes (I want him right here bring him come on)

Like reincarnation
My soul will endure, ohhhh
Back on earth
Back on earth
Back on earth
The spirit it never lets go
Like fountains of sorrow the faces are crying
I'm witnessing all of their pain
Death is so final for only the living
The spirit will always remain
Bury me deep just to cover my sins
My soul is redeemed as the journey begins
Back on earth
(you feel me)
Back on earth
(reveal me)
Back on earth
The spirit it never lets go

Another dimension, a river of light
I'm twisting,
I'm turning,
My soul is in flight

Where are you going to hide?
Watching the grains of the hourglass falling
Clutching the hands of time
Preachers sell god for money
Cause everything has a price
American milk and honey
I'll never be bitten twice
Bang bang you're dead
So come and join the living
More tears are shed
Don't be the unforgiven
Bang bang you're dead
Watching tv but the ads are better
Craving for passion online
Blaming the crimes on a video horror
It's happening all of the time
Military rules and honor
They're playing games with your head
Sycophant schools and scholars
Will sell the death to the dead
Bang bang you're dead
So come and join the living
More tears are shed
Don't be the unforgiven
Bang bang you're dead
(and I saw 17,000 kids which raised their hands like this,
Which is the sign of the devil, and they said ozzy, ozzy, ozzy...)

Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the moon
Hahaha
Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the moon
Hey yeah bark at the moon
They cursed and buried him
Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning hell - unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong, so wrong
Oh yeah baby
Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the moon
Hey yeah

Hey yeah bark at the moon
Oh oh yeah bark at the moon

Dreams that I have shattered
May not have mattered
Take another point of view
Doubts will arise though
Like chasing a rainbow
I can tell a thing or two
That's true
You've got to believe in yourself
Or no one will believe in you
Imagination like a bird on the wing
Flying, free for you to use
OK baby
I can't believe they stop and stare
And point their fingers doubting me
Their disbelief suppresses them
But they're not blind
It's just that they won't see
I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise.</field>

Contaminating the ground.
The human race is dying.
The dead are scattered around.
What is the price of a bullet?
Another hole in the head.
A flat right over a coffin.
Another soldier is dead.
How many victims have fallen?
How many more have to die?
People dying in masses.
Angel of Death standing by.
We've got our marching orders,
Defenders of the home and
our pride.
We've crossed too many borders.
Military suicide.
War, killing sons and daughters,
Another failed attack, there is no turning back.
Blood, running down like water.
You´ll think you got away,
Until the judgment day comes
Politicians confuse me.
I watch the body count rise.
Why are the children all marching,
Into the desert to die?
The human psyche is twisted,
The madness rising again.
Another empire falling.
I watch them dying in vain.
We've got our marching orders,
Defenders of the home and
our pride.
We've crossed too many borders.
Military suicide.
War, killing sons and daughters,
Another failed attack, there is no turning back.
Blood, running down like water.
You´ll think you got away,
Until the judgment day comes
Are you ready??
Black rain, black rain.
Black rain, black rain.
War, killing sons and daughters.
Another failed attack, there is no turning back.
Blood, running down like water.
You´ll think you got away
Until the judgment day
You´ll think you got away,
Until your judgment comes.

Black skies, black skies, in time, black skies
Staring at the madness, nothing is for sure.
Will the rich give, what the blind man saw ?
So i wander aimlessly, will i ever know ?
Can the wise man repe, what his children sew ?
Fighting the fear, along with the sorrow.
Hiding behind, a vail of tomorrow.
Hiding the fear, along with the sorrow.

Nowhere left for me to hide
Waiting for my paranoia
Way too late to change my mind
No-one wants to beat me
Locked away no place to go
Everything is disappearing
Angels rush to meet the foolish
No-one comes to meet me
I'm just buried alive
Nowhere else left to hide
No-one knows me inside
No-one gets out alive
(Alive) again don't breathe a word
Listen hard and hear the silence
Starve the poor and feed the rich
There´s no revolution
Build me up then knock me down
Watch my life collapse around me
Prison cells with no release date
There is no resolution
No-one gets out alive
Nowhere else left to hide
No-one knows me inside
I'm just buried alive
Come and get me and take me away
I don´t want you to go
I´m locked in a nigthmare
Where you never stay
It can´t be the end of the show
Head for the wings and then run for your live
I hope you have somewhere to hide
The devil, no longer has all the best tunes
We've all been buried alive
No-one wants to be me
No-one cares if I´m free
Only God knows that we´re all buried alive
No-one wants to come and save me
No-one wants to save my face

CAN YOU HEAR THEM?
ALL THE VOICES IN MY HEAD….THEY FREAK ME OUT
CAN YOU HEAR THEM?
THEY WON’T BE HAPPY TILL I’M DEAD….THEY FREAK ME OUT.</field>

There's no future
I don't even know about the past
It's all timeless and never ending
To take it in
It's all to vast
It goes
Forever and ever
You thought you knew
But you never
There goes
Tomorrow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
The time is coming but also going
And it's leaving never to return
Maybe heaven could be forever
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn
It goes
Forever and ever
You thought you knew
But you never
There goes
Tomorrow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
I got to travel forever
It's all within my mind
An endless path to endeavor
But forever is a long long time
There's no secrets and no corruption
In the centre of infinity
There's no limits in nonexistence
And no beginning to my destiny
It goes
Forever and ever
You thought you knew
But you never
There goes
Tomorrow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity.</field>

I've lost the best friend that I ever had,
She was my woman, I loved her so,
But it's too late now, I've let her go
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
We shared the years, we shared each day,
In love together We found a way,
But soon the world had its evil way
My heart was blinded
Love went to spread
I´m going through changes
I´m going through changes
It took so long to realize,
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Now all my days, are filled with tears,
Wish I could go back and change these years
I´m going through changes
I´m going through changes</field>

Against the world in which they have to live
and all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
and love comes flowing through
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?
So you children of the world,
listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
spread the words today
Show the world that love is still alive
you must be brave
Or you children of today are
Children of the Grave, Yeah!

They can call it justice, a retribution,

Self inflicted
So addicted,
Our habits are hard to break.

Try to civilize the Universe.

Without the righteous,
Without the faithful,
We would never accept the obscene.
A false confession, and priest's obsession
Is the demon the light to be seen.
Burn the witch and hang his head as,
There's only one choice to be made.
With thought restricted,
And heart afflicted,
The truth be so hard to take.
I'm alive.
Watching better turn to worse.
(Watching better turn to worse)
One more time,
Try to civilize the Universe.

The righteous and the faithful,
Give the good man to the blind.
The world full of confusion,
From every disease confined.

Is it love that is on my mind or is it fantasy

What am I supposed to do with a child of tragedy

If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain unchanged
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain the same
Sometimes it's hard to hold on, so hard to hold on to all my dreams
It's not always what it seems when you're face to face to me
Like a dagger you stick me in the heart or taste the blood from my blade
And when we're asleep would you shelter me in your
warm and dark grave
(Chorus:)
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain unchanged
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain the same
Will you ever take me
No I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me
No I'll never feel the same
I know I've been so hard on you
I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish
I would wipe the cobwebs from my eyes
(Chorus:)
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain unchanged
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain the same
Oh yeah
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
You gotta close your eyes for me...</field>

Finally here at last?
You may see the mushroom,
But you won't hear the blast.
Don't need a self made prophet
Don't need a holy war
Don't need another d-day,
To even up the score.
I'm cursed with living on a goldmine.
The doomsday clock was built by mankind.

I've listened to preachers
I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts
Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role
Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words
Yeh-h!
Heirs of a cold war
That's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair
Mental wounds not healing

A sickened mind and spirit
The mirror tells me lies
Could I mistake myself for someone
Who lives behind my eyes
Will he escape my soul
Or will he live in me
Is he tryin' to get out or tryin' to enter me
Voices in the darkness
Scream away my mental health
Can I ask a question
To help me save me from myself
Enemies fill up the pages
Are they me
Monday till Sunday in stages

Ignore a new genocide
So come on, Jesus
We're all here waiting just for You
How long must we keep on waiting?
The faithful and blind are keepin' me keepin' me down
How long 'cause my faith is breaking
The pure and divine are diggin' me diggin' me down
Do You live in the light or in the dead of the night?
Sanctimonious promises broken
Hypocritical sin dying slowly within
Is the sacred truth forever unspoken?
Life ever after bohemian rapture
Beware the dark side of the son
You're just a self-made messiah
Selling brimstone and fire
So come on, Jesus
Don't keep us waiting just for You

I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days
Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ
It doesn't really matter much to me
Without each others help there ain't no hope for us
I'm living in a dream of fantasy, oh yeah yeah yeah
If only we could all just find serenity
It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger hate and bigotry be done
I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away, today
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days, oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer
Who's searching for the way, today
I'm just a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, oh yeah yeah yeah</field>

To a future after life
To the final resurrection
And to eternal paradise
But then I'm blinded with temptation
And to every mortal sin
Is it God that sits there waiting?
Or will the darkness suck me in
Let's wake up the dead
Oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed
Oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
That I'm facing hell
Oh the children sit and listen
The belief was in their eyes
In a land without tomorrows
Through the night you hear their cries
But then your eyes just skip the pages
Of a book that never ends
Is it God that sits there waiting?
Do you hear the call again?
Let's wake up the dead
Oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed
Oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
That I'm facing hell
It's just crazy world we live in
And I'm out of my mind
You pray tomorrow but your leaving today
Evil one is coming and he's knocking your door
Cause todays the day you'll pay
Let's wake up the dead
Oh yeah

suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked throught the window and surprised what I saw
Fairy boots were dancin' with a dwarf, all right now!
Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!
So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
he said "Son, son, you've gone too far.
'cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do."

I am the god of hell fire and I bring you...
Fire, I'll take you to burn.
Fire, I'll take you to learn.
I'll see you burn!
You fought hard and you saved and learned,
But all of it's gonna burn.
And your mind, your tiny mind,
You know you've really been so blind.
Now's your time burn your mind.
You're falling far too far behind.
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, you gonna burn!
Fire, to destroy all you've done.
Fire, to end all you've become.
I'll feel you burn!
You've been living like a little girl,
In the middle of your little world.
And your mind, your tiny mind,
You know you've really been so blind.
Now's your time burn your mind,
You're falling far too far behind.
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no,
Fire, I'll take you to burn.
Fire, I'll take you to learn.
You're going to burn!
You're going to burn!
You're going to burn!
You're going to burn! burn! burn! burn!
Fire, I'll take you to burn.
Fire, I'll take you to learn.

So it's no wonder that he grew up to be so wild
So he protected his feelings in walls he imagined
But castles crumble exposing the frightened child
Fire in the sky,
Can't you see that all my castles are burning
Fire in the sky,
Won't you help me now my castles are burning
In solitude he couldn't deal with his own existence,
The burning questions in the castles have still remained
God only knows how he searched in vain for the answers,
Now castles crumble exposing his naked flames,
Yeah
Fire in the sky,
Can't you see that all my castles are burning
Fire in the sky,
Won't you help me now my castles are burning

It's something that I enjoy
'Cause you can't see
What my eyes see
I can see it,
I can see it
And you can't be inside of me,
Flying high again
I can see through the mountains
Watch me disappear
I can even touch the sky
Swallowing colours of the sound I hear
Am I just a crazy guy
You bet
Momma's gonna worry

No use sayin' sorry

If you could be inside my head
You'd see that black and white is read

Flying high again come on and join me.
Flying high again

Flying high again come on and join me.
Daddy thinks I'm lazy

Never saw inside my head

Never heard a thing I said

Is there a reason for the way that you are
Or does it just come naturally
To have an idiosyncrasy and be a fool like you
That's true
You're hearing what you want to hear
Misunderstanding all you see
And attitude in all of us
Is it really you and me
He is hiding residing deep within the crowd
A hand out he'll pull you down
You've been found guilty Committed ever crime
But still they say you must go free
Looks like haunted I will be by a fool like you

You think i'm kinda crazy, but i gotta few regrets
Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits
We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget
I'm just a poor little white boy, showin my respect
Like willie mays
My eyes purple haze, my solar razor burn through shades
My grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the everglades
Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow i, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the richter
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before i lose ya
Verbal high i leave stars in the eyes of medusa
Top ten, parley like cochran, it's often
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like roberta flack
Words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks
You think i'm kinda crazy, but i gotta few regrets
Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits
We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget
I'm just a poor little white boy, showin my respect
Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelmin the populace from the entry
The wu-tang dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet
I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of mc's at these fake ass industry niggaz
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off and spray
An array of shots that travel downwind
Just respect pyrhiffic pen
As i send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power i blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our cream
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned
You think i'm kinda crazy, but i gotta few regrets
Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits
We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget
I'm just a poor little white boy, showin my respect
Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Dissapear from here, my year, drop the stupid lp's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, rza and true collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
Cats that made that watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranged with cyrus
Wu pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverand, put the best work in
Oh, baby
Oh, baby

What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everyone's wrong
People speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind
Yeah, stop children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
What a field-day for the heat
Ten thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away
Stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
You better stop!

Poison the air that we breathe.

Destroy the soul that you steal, the radiation is real.

            <field name="lyrics">I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock'n roll
Sometimes it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough
I keep saying that it's getting too much
But I know I'm a liar
Feeling all right in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire
Hellraiser,
In the thunder and heat
Hellraiser,
Rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser,
And I'll make it come true
Hellraiser,
I'll put a spell on you
Walking out on another stage,
Another town, another place
Sometimes I don't feel right
Nerves wound up too damn tight
People keep telling me it's bad for my health
But kicking back don't make it
Out of control,
I play the ultimate role
But that's what lights my fire
Hellraiser,
In the thunder and heat
Hellraiser,
Rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser,
And I'll make it come true
Hellraiser,
I'll put a spell on you
I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock and roll
Sometimes it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough
Feeling all right in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire
Hellraiser,
In the thunder and heat
Hellraiser,
Rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser,
And I'll make it come true
Hellraiser,
I'll put a spell on you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I remember all the good times...
sometimes I'd wonder would it last
I used to dream about the future.
But now the future is the past.
I don't wanna live in yesterday,
Cross my heart until I die
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring,
Because today has just begun,
No matter whatever else I've done
I'm here for you
I'm here for you.
So now I sit here and I wonder,
Whatever happened to my friends
Too many bought a one way ticket
But I'll be with you till the end
I don't wanna live in yesterday
Cross my heart until I die
Dont wanna know just what tomorrow may bring
Because today has just begun,
No matter whatever else I've done
I'm here for you
You're my religion, you're my reason to live.
You are the heaven in my hell
We've been together for a long long time
and I just cant live without you
No matter what you do I'm here for you.
I don't wanna live in yesterday
Cross my heart until I die
Dont wanna know just what tomorrow may bring
Because today has just begun,
No matter whatever else I've done
I'm here for you...
I'm here for you...
I'm here for you...
I'm here for you.</field>

I don't want to ever let you down,
No I don't want to let you down
I can try to take you higher,
But I don't want to wear your broken crown,
Ya know it brings me down
Don't think you'll ever understand me
I don't even understand me
Don't have the power to annoint you
And I don't want to disappoint
The fools no more
The fools no more
I couldn't answer all your questions,
And if your're lost
I couldn't find your way
I couldn't find your way
You know you have to face the music,
You change your tune
And don't know what to play,
So don't you run away
Everybody's talking crazy
Some think I am a dare
And I may be
I don't want to hear about it
Don't want to have to scream and shout at
The fools no more
The fools no more
(solo)
So I don't want to be a hero,
Don't want to sit upon your crippled throne,
I've got a life of my own
I am not your destination,
Or a road that's gonna lead you home,
So baby please don't go</field>

Oh no, oh no
You know life can be long

And the world is so tough

How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving?
How can I give love when I just don't know how to give?
How can I give love when love is something I ain't never had?
Oh no, oh no
You know life can be long
You've got to be so strong
And the world she is tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough
How can we go forward when we don't know which way we're facing?
How can we go forward when we don't know which way to turn?
How can we go forward into something we're not really sure of?
Oh no, oh no

            <field name="lyrics">When i was young i was the nicest guy i knew
I thought i was the chosen one
But time went by and i found out a thing or two
My shine wore off as time wore on
I thought that i was living out the perfect life
But in the lonely hours when the truth begins to bite
I thought about the times when i turned my back and stalled.
I ain't no nice guy after all
When i was young i was the only game in town
I thought i had it down for sure
But time went by and i was lost in what i found
The reasons blurred, the way unsure
I thought that i was living life the only way
But as i saw that life was more than day to day
I turned around, i read the writing on the wall.
I ain't no nice guy after all
I ain't no nice guy after all
In all the years you spend between your birth and death
You find there's lots of times you should have saved your breath
It comes as quite a shock when that trip leads to a fall.
I ain't no nice guy after all
I ain't no nice guy after all</field>

Your soul is burning
Your future's fading
I Can't Save You
Your demon's waking

I can’t save you now, now, now, now…
The years are passing
The time goes fast
You’re in denial
With your head up your ass
Can’t take it with you
Leave it behind
So many ways to live
There’s one way to die
Your god is calling
Your tears are falling
You’re head’s exploding
I can’t save you
No use in trying
You can’t stop crying
You feel like dying
I can’t save you now, now, now, now…
(You’ve got to save yourself)
I can’t save you now, now, now, now…
(You’ve got to save yourself)
I can’t save you
Tempted by your twisted mind
You destroyed your self-control
For fame and fortune you gave it all
No one said you had to sell your soul

Everybody is walkin' but nobody's talkin'
It looks a lot better from here
All my life I've been over the top

All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way
Don't make me
I don't wanna stop
Why don't they ever listen to me
It's just a one way conversation
Nothing they say is gonna set me free
Don't need no mental masturbation
Too many religions but only one god
I don't need another saviour
Don't try to change my mind
You know I'm one of a kind
Ain't gonna change my bad behaviour

If I close my eyes forever

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same

Sometimes it's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems
When you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger
And you stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep would you shelter me
In your warm and darkened grave
repeat CHORUS

Will you ever take me
No, I just can't take the pain
But would you ever trust me
No, I'll never feel the same...Ohh.
I know I've been so hard on you.
I know Ive told you lies.
If i could have just one more wish.
I'd wipe the cobb webs from my eyes.

            <field name="lyrics">It Starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuble thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the days
The clock ticks life away
It's So Unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on
But didn't evn know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter
One thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how i tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even reckognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter
I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I could go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter</field>

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
in the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
for the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
that he will soon unfold
Now the time is here
for Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Heavy boots of lead
fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!</field>

[Children of the Grave]
Revolution in their minds - the children start to march
Against the world they have to live in
Oh! the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
and love comes flowing through
Yeah!
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in peace in any way
Must they live in constant shadow of atomic fear
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? Yeah!
So you children of the world listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in spread the world today
Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave
Or your children of today are children of the grave
Yeah!</field>

Die alone out in the fog

Iron head- exterminate
Iron head- liberate and crucify you
What is my name?

Laugh in your face and
Break because you don't belong
Vent upon the brink
Appear another demi-god
Suddenly forever knows
What it takes and where it goes
Paint it black inside your head
I defy what you have said

My thoughts get louder after dark
Oh the lies
The crazies tell me this much
Aha!
It's a simple enough task boys
To find a living miracle
But the living ain't easy
I need a shot of medecine
Start the day, the day
My head denies I'm breathing
It likes to say
Am I here or leaving me?
There's a want I ask all the time
Possesion of my right mind
You're not deaf but I still have to shout
Watch out there's a lot of thieves about
All along the way
I stand beside myself
And look at all my world
No need to tell me
I see dead men playing
I hear cries from many
I hear tears and then some
I hear hop I'm hoping
I'm caught with all the shutters down
Who's looking through my window?
I had to close the saddest eyes
You've got to be a winner
You've got to be cool
I see me inside you
I hear fear and then some
I see children playing
I see hope I'm hoping
Far away
I hear a memory calling me
I'd like to stay
But my obsession wants to play</field>

Another week to back break
Keep him alive all the day
High and dry I wonder will he survive
I broke a mirror and it started us out
It was an all night shelter of love
He swallowed down another fantasy pill
To give himself a push and a shove
Tonight's the night he's going to jump the moon
I hope it'll never crush a man to soon
He's just an image of a lie tonight
He's just a press we follow
Live today like he'll be gone tomorrow
Another daylight foreigner
He's just a weekend warrior
Come Monday play like anyone
Not around and turned around
He only listens to the voice in his head
That separate the truths from the lies
A wounded creature that just won't fall down
You can tell by the look in his eyes
Tonight's the night he's going to jump the moon
I hope it'll never crush a man to soon
He's just an image of a lie tonight
He's just a press we follow
Live today like he'll be gone tomorrow
Whoa..
He's flying high with his silver spoon
OH..
He's here to try to jump the jump the
yeah! jump the moon
Tonight's the night he's going to jump the moon

Addicted to death
You don't give a fuck if it means your last breath
You try to so hard to quit, but you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie
You crave for the needle to stick in your vein
Can't wait for the poison to kill all the pain
You buy a cheap ticket to take a short ride
That beautiful flower is eating your mind
You try to so hard to quit, but you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie
Your name means nothing, you don't know the score
Body is aching you still crave for more
Sometimes you wish that you'd never been born
Tormenting came with a crown full of thorns
Your chasing the dragon, you're chasing the high
A bird with one wing who's still trying to fly
You're all out of spirit, a dead man alive
A born again junkie, you'll never survive
You try to so hard to quit, but you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie

And God's name blaspheme
Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Marches of protest not stopping the war
Or the killer of giants
The killer of giants
Mother nature
People state you case without it's worth
Your seas run dry
Your sleepless eyes are turning red alert
Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Rising so proudly it has nowhere to fall
This killer of giants

Mountains of madness standing so tall

Another pill, you spiral down deeper,
Another cut by a surgical butcher,
It's just a way of prolonging the torture
I won't say I don't know what I'm doing,
I won't say that I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
I can't bring you back,
I can't leave you helpless (helpless),
I'll make the pain rest in peace (rest in peace)
I'll turn off the lights,
Swallow your last breath (last breath),
So close your eyes, fall asleep (close your eyes)
I'll never hurt you (hurt you),
I'll never hurt you (hurt you)
The sun shines on this deadly new morning,
The church bells ring an early warning,
Your eyes shine as I turn on the motor,
The tears fall as the mercy gets closer
I won't say I don't know what I'm doing,
I won't say that I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
I can't bring you back,
I can't leave you helpless (helpless),
I'll make the pain rest in peace (rest in peace)
I'll turn off the lights,
Swallow your last breath (last breath),

I'll never hurt you (hurt you),
I'll never hurt you (hurt you)

I haven't been (there) when you needed me
I didn't deserve the love you gave

Give me your pain
Give me your anger
Let me be your rock
I can be the pillar of strength that you need
I help you keep it all together
It's better late than never
Lay your world on me
I can take the weight
Don't let it twist you up inside
Time never fails to make the heartache stop
You've gotta let those feelings go
I'll give you everything i can
If you say the word
Give me your pain
Give me your anger
Let me be your rock
I can be the pillar of strength that you need
I help you keep it all together
It's better late than never
Lay your world on me
I can take the weight
We'll leave and we'll cry
We'll hurt the same inside
we'll fall down
Then we lose faith and who we really are
But if we bend and celebrate
The choice for us is to make it together
Lay your world on me
I help you keep it all together
It's better late than never

It all comes down to you
Try to just let it go
Know that justice moves slow
But it comes in the end
Rise, the guilty will fall
Stay, they can't take it all
They want the unimportant
It's love they leave behind
Stand up
Aim true
Keep heart
The future looks to you
Every second you throw away
Every minute of every day
Don't get caught in a memory
Life won't wait for you
No life won't wait for you my friend
I'm watching the change
Who will carry the flame?
It all feels very strange
Dreams that men can be good
Faith to live as we should
And know we're all connected
We give ourselves the power
Stay strong
Stay true
Be brave
It all comes down to you
Every day that you wait
You're falling faster
No slight of hand, no twist of fate
No ever after
When it's gone it's gone
A fight 'til the bitter end
Life won't wait for you no
Life won't wait for you my friend
Life won't wait for you my friend</field>

Tell your mamma that you're gonna be late
But not to worry we'll just be rockin' all night

We're becoming the children of the night

As all turns to gold
In my head voice screaming
And I'm being told
If you will only listen you will hear them too
I won't stop

Would never fight it
Demons and curses that play on our soul
Like something ignited
You never imagined such a fate could follow you
You never thought it was true
And when it's your time
I wonder how you'll do

I gave you all that you wanted, and still you come back for more
You say that you're brokenhearted, but then you walk out the door
Maybe it is time for us to say goodbye
Where are the tears you never cried
Hey baby what you got on your mind
Are you looking for some sympathy
I can tell you if it's a truth or a lie
'Cause it's just like living, living with the enemy
You got me going in circles
I'm slowly loosing my head
What did I do to deserve this
You make me wish I was dead
Tell me I'm wrong and i'll be on my way
See you around another day
Hey baby what you doin' tonite
Are you giving me the perfect dream

Living with the enemy, living with the enemy, enemy

I wonder who died today
I feel so numb I might as well be dead
I live on hope and legal dope
Addicted to the system
Is it real or does it just live within my head
I guess they lied to make me feel afraid
I can?t believe a single word they say
Cry another tear
'Cause the devil will not wait
Living in fear
Why do people love to hate
Love to hate
Desensitized and victimized
The action never stops
Could it be a smokescreen to keep us satisfied
Insecure and paranoid
I?m trying to survive
I can?t tell if I?m hearing truth or lies
I?ll never make it to the Holy Gates
No ones gonna matter, the fire of hell awaits
Cry another tear
'Cause the devil will not wait
Living in fear
Why do people love to hate

Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine
Mississippi queen, if you know what I mean

This lady she asked me, if I would be her man
You know that I told her, I'd do what I can
To keep her lookin' pretty, buy her dresses that shine
While the rest of them dudes were makin' their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was losin' mine
I was losin' my mind, on the Mississippi Queen

Crowley, did you talk to the dead
Your life style to me seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
You waited on Satan's call
Mr
Charming, did you think you were pure
Mr
Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth
Mr
Crowley, won't you ride my white horse
Mr
Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear maidens call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall
Was it polemically sent

I wanna know

A killer's smile with
A psycho star dream
Behind the mask
Things aren't what they seem
Unholy soldier
Disciple of sin
What kind of mind are you living in
You're preaching revolution
Don't you mean genocide?
Behind this resolution
My Jekyll doesn't hide
Waiting to die for the very first time
All right, that's right
Waiting to die for the very first time
I don't give a damn,
'Cos I think it's my time, my time
The symbiosis
Of murder and lies
What do I see looking through your disguise?
Fourth Reich dementia
Subversion ideals
God only knows what your secret conceals
Who'll be the first offender?
Who will be victimized?
In your perverse agenda

I'd like to keep you with me all your life,
But I know I can't do that
So I must try to teach you wrong from right,
To keep the vulture from your back
Go to sleep my little man
Don't you weep my little man
And when you're dreaming
You can talk to angels
So wipe the tears from your eyes
And if there's demons
That try to steal your breath away,
You can't believe that,
Know my spirit will be standing by your side
You saved me,
You gave me,
The greatest gift of all
Believe me,
Believe me,
There ain't no mountain that's too tall
I will gladly carry your cross for you,
To take your pain away,
But what I can't carry is my love for you,
Beyond my dying day
So be strong my little man
When I'm gone my little man
You got to be my little man
So don't you weep my little man
Go to sleep my little man

You've searched your soul for feeling
Over and over now over and over now
There is now use in dreaming
Over and over now over and over now
It is the chain that you're dragging
That was once your relief
That's like everything that's born die
And the birth of a doubt that was once your belief
Is drowning in the tears that you cry
It all remains a mystery
Forever and ever now
Ever and ever now
The things that were are history
Forever and ever now
Ever and ever now
It's never too late to cry
It's never too late for good-byes
It's never too late to cry
You know you were born to die
If the Messiah is coming
Will he be too late
To reconcile our tears with our hate
And the memory of freedom
That imprisons our heart
As we're greeted by the cold hand of fate
It's never too late to cry
It's never too late for good-byes

Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold back, `till it's ready, taking it slow
Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
Don't you ever say die

Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, throwing us a die
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine

There's no need to wonder why

Promise me the truth and I'll be saved

And then now as the sabbath begins
It wakes your nightmare again,
So run away if you can, so just run, run as fast as

I'm not guilty inside.
I won't give up,
After all I'm still crazy.
I'm not going away.
I'm not going..
You tried so hard to break me,
But all your diamonds turn to sand.
I'm not going away.
I'm not going..
Say goodbye forever,
I'll wait for you in no man's land.
Get out of my way.
There's nothing you can do to change what I say.
I won't ever let go.
I've got the answer, but you'll never know.
I got my eyes opened wide,
Ain't gonna slip up or slide,
Can't take me down,
After all I'm still crazy.
I'm not going away.
I'm not going..
You tried so hard to break me,
But all your diamonds turn to sand,
I'm not going away.
I'm not going..
Say goodbye forever,
I'll wait for you in no man's land.
(Guitar)
I'm not going away.
I'm not going away.
I'm not going away.
I'm not going away.
I'm not going away.
I'm not going away.
I'm not going away
I'm not going away.
I'm not going away.!
I'm not going..
Tried so hard to break me,
But all your diamonds turn to sand.
I'm not going away.
I'm not going..
Say goodbye forever,
I'll wait for you in no man's land.
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going..
Say goodbye forever,
I'll wait for you in no man's land.</field>

Making it so hard for me
Now you've laid it down for all to see
Can I ask a question,
D'ya think you can take a blow
This is why I always come and go
Now you see it, now you don't
Careful of words that get caught in your throat
Face the music, take it like a man
Givin' it to me anyway that you can
Everybody's feeling everything you've got to feel
I've got something that you can conceal
Now you see it
Now you don't
Now you see it
Now you don't
Give me central heating
Hope that I can pay the bill
Making me forget my fear of hell
Must be luck in odd numbers
Now you face me upside down
I'm so far up I'm afraid to come back down</field>

Big baby in the mother fucking house

Unh, come on
I don't walk, i stalk, livin' foul like pork
Shuttin' down underground streets of new york
Hawk is what them niggas call me, 'cause they all be
Suckin' my dick and on my mother fucking balls, g
I know the half, so i laugh wit' 'em
Blood bath went i let the fuckin' rap hit 'em
Full clip, but only half did 'em
That's all it took, another crook
Taken out over a dirty look
I bag game with niggas i leave shot dead
You're only taken a piss from me with hot led
You know my style nigga, 'cause i'm always schemin'
In jail, niggas holdin' a sink screamin'
Police, but you got no peace
Yo, was that you big man, and alot mo' grease
All i gets is pounds, you ain't want none of this
Back streets are like track meets 'cause i be runnin' this
Ain't nowhere to run ('cause i be runnin' this)
Ain't nowhere to hide (come on)
Ain't nowhere to go ('cause i be runnin' this)
Reaper saved your soul (come on)
Surronded by the colors, i see crimson, black and blue (come on)
Locking open doors again, i'm still afraid of you (straight up, mother fucker)
Light to dark, then light again, i always thought i knew (come on)
Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do? (straight up)
Center of the universe, collecting me in time (come on)
I'm falling down upon the earth, and singing truth in rhyme (come on)
If i was a rolling stone, i'd roll until i'm through (come on)
And if i was a garden i would bloom in black for you (dirt dog in effect)
Ahhhh, yi yi yi yi (come on)

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
What you mother fuckers invented

Most know, don't front on ol' dity bastard

There's no obstacles that you have to jump
There's no walls that you have to climb
This is real, this is elementary dear
Elementary, watson, elementary
Ahhhhh
I ain't no pictue on your fore wall, necklace wearin' beard
You don't want this money till it's rich
Buy my album, coded by dirty, set you free
Go against the grain, i got the p
I know you don't recognize me now
I dunked your tongue
How many lightening bulbs do it take to light up a fuck mode?
Brothers, people, you'd better get the fuck off of me
We don't need it, it gets more ugly
Fools tryin' to bust their ass
Tryin' to get away from me when i said my real name
I call myself in the niggas butthole
All the same, all the same, all the same
Ain't nowhere to run
Ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to go
Reaper saved your soul
Ahhh yi yi yi yi
What, mother fucker?
Don't try to psychology my shit, mother fucker
'cause you'll never psychology it, mother fucker
Never, never, never, mother fucker, never</field>

Maybe I'm just better off not knowing who knew

Are we doin' all right in old L.A

Those summer nights when I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Who could imagine such a thing could happen to you?
It's gonna be all right in old L.A

Something in my vision, something deep inside
Where did I wander, where d'ya think I wandered to
I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through.
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars
And said I'd show them how.
Over and over always tried to get away
Living in a daydream only place I had to stay
Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide
People around me talking to the walls inside
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars
And said I'd show them how.
Don't need no astrology it's inside of you and me
You don't need a ticket to ride with me - I'm free.
Over and under in between the ups and downs
My mind's carpet magic ride goes round and round.
Over the mountain kissing silver inlaid clouds
Watching my body disappear into the crowd.
Don't need no astrology it's inside of you and me
You don't need a ticket to fly with me - I'm free.</field>

Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life

Feelin' fine, and I'll see you my friend
Over and over again
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Riding painted horses, oh the kids they love it so
You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow
Minding my own business like my mama always said
But if I don't try to help 'em they could wind up on the front page
I don't mind, draw the line then draw me an arrow
Feelin' fine, then I'll see you my friend

Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again, again
Wake me when it's over, tell me it's all right
Just keep on talking baby, I've been doing this all night
How much did you give me, tell me it'll be all right

When I look up to the sky
I see your eyes
In a funny kind of yellow
I rush home to bed, I soak my head
I see your face
Underneath my pillow
I wake next morning
Tired still yawning
See your face come peering
Thro' my window

Pictures of matchsick men and you
Images of matchstick men and you
All I ever see is them and you

Windows echo your reflection
When I look in their direction gone
When will this haunting stop
Your face it just won't leave me alone

Pictures of matchsick men and you
Images of matchstick men and you
All I ever see is them and you

You in the sky with this guy
You make me cry, you lie

Pictures of matchsick men

Silver starlight breaks dawn from night

Psycho man, psycho man

Psycho man, psycho man
He's the killer
Addicted to the madness
The taste of death that lives within
He loves it when he takes their final breath
Stalking gives him pleasure
Killing is the final act
He takes no pity with his lust for death

He's the killer
Playing in his twilight zone
He knows that he's the best
Creeping through the streets alone
Till he finds his victims next
Killing gives him pleasure
Sleeping gives him pain
The only time he's feeling good
Is when he's killed and killed again
When he's killed again (6x)
Watch out!

I'm breaking the rules and its for me and for you
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They think I worship the devil
They only see through his eyes
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel
They live their lives in fear and insecurity
And all you do is pay for their prosperity
The ministry of fear that won't let you live
The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive
Do what you will to try and make me conform
But I'll make you wish that you had never been born
Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll do as I please
I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'm as free as the breeze

The know it rules you head
They only feel what bigotry feels
They won't fool with me again (oh no)

God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious
Is it because that they manifest the incubus

The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed
When it's all boiled down and the days at an end

And we don't need the ladies

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Well he's tellin' us this,
He's tellin' us that,
Changin' it everyday
Say's it doesn't matter
Bases are loaded and casey's at bat
Playin' it play by play
It's time to change the batter
And we don't need the ladies
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad

            <field name="lyrics">Been around this world so many times,
if you could only see my mind
I watch my secret heaven turn to hell.
Faith alone has guided me,
the ghost of my own destiny
I haven't even got a soul to sell
All the things I put me through,
I wouldn't wish my hell on you
you´ll never know what's going on inside.
(Chorus:)
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I´m running out of time, running out of time.
(Solo: Zakk Wylde)
Trouble always seems to find,
a way to live inside my mind
My haunted head and me remain alone
Underneath my masquerade
a simple man who´s so afraid
I tried to find a light to guide me home.
Mama please just hold me tight
feelin´ so afraid tonight
'Cause you're the only one that really knows
(Chorus:)
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I´m running out of time, running out of time.
Fighting for my sanity,
many nights of tragedy
Got to leave my wretched ways behind
(Chorus:)
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I´m running out of time, running out of time,
I´m running out of time, running out of time</field>

Finally found a way of thinking
Tried the rest found the best
Stormy day won't see me sinking
I can't conceal it like I know I did before
I got to tell you now the ship is ready
Waiting on the shore
Dare to look face the test on the eve
When you set sailing
What you've learned what you've earned
Ship of joy will stop you failing
I can't conceal it like I know I did before
I got to tell you now the ship is ready
Waiting on the shore
Wind is high so am I
As the shore sinks in the distance
Dreams unfold seek the gold
Gold that's brighter than sunlight
Sail away see the day
Dawning on a new horizon
Gold's insight shining bright
Brighter than the sun that's rising
3000 sails on high are straining in the wind
A raging sea below
Is this voyage coming to an end.</field>

Silence broken, but there s nothing said
I go a nightmare from a fantasy
Will the voices ever set me free

I can hear em, I can hear em
Someone wake me when it s over
I can see em, I can see em
I can see em over and over again

I saw it happening like deja- vu
They tried to tell me but they couldn t get through
In my hear I hear the voices scream
I need someone to tell me what it means

( Refrão)

Whoa - Who turned off the lights?
Whoa - Shadow in the night
Whoa - It wasn t meant to be
I can t take this alone
Don t leave me on my own tonight
Oh no Ican t take it alone
Don t leave me on my own to night

Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass
I wonder if tonight will my last
I need an angel who can rescue me
To save me from my mental symphony

( Refrão)

Whoa - Who turned out the lights?
Whoa - Shadows in the night
Whoa - It wasnt ment to be
I can take this alone
Don t leave me on my own tonight
No, no I can t take it alone

Loser, I'm a secret loser
Loser, I'm a secret loser
Fighting a losing battle
Pretending to win
Repenting to holy unknowns

There is no winner
There's nothing left to win

I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill
But it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them
I can hear them Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you
Taught by the powers
That preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen
I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason
But just like the wounded
And when it's too late
They'll remember
They'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
A shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
A shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right.</field>

Makes my reality fade away!
There is no future waiting.
There is no morning ever.

My anti drugs get trashed, yeah.
This paranoia stops my mind from sinking.
I don't know if I'm awake or if I'm dreaming.

My eyes are blind but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel there's no place freezing me
Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling glow
Don't you think I know what I'm doing
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one who's really a loser
This is where I feel I belong
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turns my day to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?.</field>

But when you look
The spider's not in sight
Spiders reappear
Taking people's names
Everything is taken down in sane
There's no way out
And there's no key
But here's a clue
The spider's really me
You're written in his book
The spiders won't forget
You won't forget the spiders in the night
The end is growing nigh
Eensy weensy friends
The spider's disappearing from the night
You think he's gone
You think he's dead

walk im a women's man no time to talk
Music loud and women warm,
I've been kicked around since I was born.
It's all right, I'ts okay,

We can try to understand
the New York Times' effect on man.
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
and you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,
ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.
Oh,
Every one one on the dance floor darling
Where going to dance with the devil
Well, now I get low and I get high,
and if I can't get either, I really try.
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes,
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose.
You know, it's all right, it's okay,
I'll live to see another day.

Love will flow like wine tonight
Give your love and it will come to you
If you feel that you and me
Could escape and hold the key
To a paradise that's true and free
Steal away,
Steal away
Steal away - the night
Now I've met your honesty
You are here and I am free
Broken chains have fallen all around
Point my finger at the fools
Broken chains and broken rules
Let it be rebellion rules tonight
Steal away,
steal away
Steal away - the night
Can it be a dream come true
Now that I am here with you
Tearful eyes of joy is something new
Runaway with me tonight
Dream the dream,
Light the light
Happiness is what you give to me
Steal away,
steal away
Steal away - the night.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Wine is fine
But whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrow
Away tomorrow
Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone you hang in ruins
Thought you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the master keeper
'Cause you feel life's unreal
And you're living a lie
Such a shame who's to blame
And you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask
"Is there life after birth"?
What you sow can mean hell on this earth
Hell on this earth
Now you live inside a bottle
The reaper's traveling at full throttle
It's catching you but you don't see
The reaper is you and the reaper is me
Breaking laws,
Knocking doors
But there's no one at home
Make your bed,
Rest your head
But you lie there and moan
Where to hide,
Suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about
Wine is fine
But whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrow.</field>

It's getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I'll soon be with you my love
To give you my dawn surprise
I'll be with you darling soon
I'll be with you when the stars start falling
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love
I'm with you my love,
The light's shining through on you
I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two
I'll be with you darling now
I'll be with you till my seas are dried up
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love
I'm with you my love,
The light's shining through on you

I'll be with you till my seas are dried up..

When I first met you didn't realize
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
Oh yeah Babe!
Come on now - try it out
My life was empty forever on a down
Until you took me showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf - though you can't hear
Oh yeah Babe!
Come on now - try it out
Straight people don't know what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf
Oh yeah Babe!
Try it out!
All right! Oh yeah!
I want to die with the sweet leaf
Oh yeah! All right now!
Try it out!
I love you sweet leaf
Oh yeah!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I stuck around St
Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah
I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
I shouted out,
"Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down
Woo, who
Oh yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!
Tell me baby, what's my name
Tell me honey, can ya guess my name
Tell me baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo, who
Ooo, who
Ooo, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who

Mother moon is calling me back to her silver womb
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seventh night the unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah
Take my hand, my child of love come step inside my tears
Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years
When our love will ride away into eternal skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah
Oh my child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means
Take my hand and we'll go riding through the sunshine from above
We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love.</field>

Tailor made for the insane

And nobody wants to play

Today was tomorrow yesterday
It's funny how the time can slip away
The face of the doomsday clock
Has launched a thousand wars
As we near the final hour
Time is the only foe we have
When war is obsolete
I'll thank God for the war's defeat
But any talk about hell freezing over
Is all said with tongue in cheek
Until the day the drums beat no more

Everytime I pray
Look into my eyes
Distant voices cry
Is there light in me
Tell me what you see
You are what I have
Can't get something that I never had
Can't get something that I never had
Should I think about tomorrow ohh
Should I live for just today
Take the light that burns inside you
Let it burn away
Let it burn away
Let it burn away
Will I see the day
Will I have to pay
What's inside of me
You will never see
Won't you let me in
Don't you let me see

Give me something that I never had

Burning bridges in the rain

I seem so blissfully insane
But still the pain won't go
Save me, all my life I've been a liar
Sacred words the angels wait for me
They'll set me free
But I can see the joke's on me
Babies crying other peoples tears
And in their eyes
They have reflected wasted years
You ask me who I really am
I still say I don't know
The doors have all been tightly slammed
The poison seeds are sown
Save me, all my life I've been a liar
Dying angels falling from above
I've had enough I cannot laugh
The joke's on me
Shattered dreams you cannot realize
Won't sympathize, it's in your eyes
Why can't you see?
Am I the liar?
Tell me who's the liar</field>

Bury your anger and bury your dead
Or you'll be left with nothing and no one
There's no point in screaming 'cos you won't be heard
Now that tables have turned
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin

I warned you then and I'm warning you now
If you mess with me you're playing with fire
Winds of change that are fanning the flames
Will carry you to your funeral pyre

Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine
Never talking
Just keeps walking

Destroys the lives you're using

The stigma of delusion
Confirms your self illusion
And after all this could be you
When you hear thunder underground
Here we go now
Could it be that I have found my mind
Or have I gone insane
Roller coaster of the madness and there's only me to blame
The ever faithful hand of doom will take the pain away
I'll never know the answer to it all 'til my dying day

Dying by the rail

I'd call you up in hell
Could that be the mailman
Knock' on the door

Finally evening up the score

It never rains unless it pours
Try to get back on my feet again
I hear the raging thunder as it roars
Tonight, tonight is it just a rhapsody
Or am I right
Tonight, tonight is it all a mystery
I just can't fight no more
I hear the questions surface my mind
Of the mistakes that I have made.
Times and places have left behind
And am I ever gonna make the grade
Tonight, tonight is it just a rhapsody
Or am I right
Tonight, tonight is it all a mystery
I just can't fight no more
As I beat my head against the wall
Running around in circles in vain
I'm feeling three foot tall
You don't understand I'm fading away
Don't want your pity or your sympathy
It isn't gonna prove a thing to me
Good intentions pave the way to hell
Don't worry when you hear me sing
Tonight, tonight is it just a rhapsody
Or am I right
Tonight, tonight is it all a mystery
I just can't fight no more.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Can you see your reflection
False strength, hollow protection
Run from pain and rejection
The truth stabs again
Till the skin is broken
And the cut is open
And the words once spoken
Just fade away
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Big head leads to confusion
Strong heart pumps up delusion
Tough talk, one voice communion
Medicate the pain
Justify your ego
Living with denial
And the thoughts so vile
Won't fade away
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
It's coming
You're falling
You're on your own with no one left to blame
Can't sleep? 'cause you've made your own bed
The sentence of the helpless
Sink deep to the trial in your head
The court of the selfish
Why? Tell me why?
Can't evade or escape the reality
A true lie and a broken promise
A Judas and a doubting Thomas
A tragedy just to keep you honest
Guilty always fall
Through the trap door
Fear the trap door
Through the trap door
The trap door, the trap door
No fear, too scared to look up
Can't win, nothing but bad luck
Clock ticks, your time to face up
You can't run for long
When your world is broken
Your trap door is open
The very words you choke on
Just fade away
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door</field>

Inside your midnight eyes I'm staring into space
I don't understand, what kind of man do you think I am
I'm falling out of control, you took my body and you tore out my soul
I don't understand, I'm just a simple man I am, I am
I don't really give a damn, you take me just the way I am
Only I have the answer
I'm not owned by Uncle Sam
I'm just still guessing who I am I
I'm your voodoo dancer, voodoo dancer
Consider my feelings just one time
I've done my sentence even though there was no crime
I'm an innocent man
I've should have learned to walk before I ever ran, I'm still running
I don't really give a damn, you take me just the way I am
Only I have the answer
I'm not owned by Uncle Sam
I'm just still guessing who I am
I'm your voodoo dancer, voodoo dancer
You never know the secrets that I have inside my head, I'm clever
My crystal ball it tells me all the things I wanna know forever
Now I'm feeling the emptiness inside still concealing all the things
I try to hide
I don't understand
I don't really give a damn, you take me just the way I am
Only I have the answer
I'm not owned by Uncle Sam
and now you know just who I am
Yes I'm your voodoo dancer, voodoo dancer
I don't really give a damn, you take me just the way I am
And I have the ultimate answer
I'm not owned by any man
And now you know just who I am
Yes I'm your voodoo dancer, voodoo dancer, voodoo dancer, your voodoo dancer
Would you like to come and play it, my fantasy
There be no one there, baby just you and me</field>

Deafened by silence
Doesn't anybody hear

Playing with fire
But they're screaming
When they're burned
Out of the sunlight
Hasn't anybody learned
I know what they find
Is in their mind
It's what they want to see
spare me from the light
Here comes the night
And here I'll stay
Waiting for darkness
Promise me rebirth
And then you tear me from the womb
Give me my freedom
And then you lock me in a tomb
I'm waiting for darkness
You gotta believe, you gotta believe it's true
I'm waiting for darkness
I just can't conceive why darkness is overdue
Who knows the answers
Is it friend or is it foe
Don't ask me questions
There are things you shouldn't know.</field>

who had a daughter
She learned her lessons well,
but still i taught her
She followed willingly,
as lambs to slaughter
We shared forbiden fruits,
and things i brought her
You may say i'm a miracle mannequin,
Here i come with my mystical plan again,
Although you think i can, i'm just a man
And I don't walk on water (oh no)
I don't walk on water (oh no)
I followed willingly,
a sweet temptation
She had me hypnotized,
and still i'm waiting
My dromedary dreams
as wet as oceans
With sand dunes bearing seeds
she set in motion
You may say i'm a cynical charlatan
There i go with my whimsical ways again
Although you think i can, i'm just a man
And i don't walk on water (oh no)
I don't walk on water (oh no)
I don't walk on water (oh no)
I don't walk on water (oh no)
Kaliedoscopial eyes
as you look in the mirror
And the long is getting
shorter as the far is now nearer
Are you just a mirror
standing in front of me?
Am i blind,
can my eyes really see?
You may say i'm a miracle mannequin,
Here i come with my mystical plan again,
Although you think i can, i'm just a man

sorcerers of death's construction

as the war machine keeps turning
death and hatred to mankind
poisoning their brainwashed minds, oh lord yeah!
Politicians hide themselves away
they only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah!

Now in darkness, world stops turning
ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs of the power
Hand of god has sturck the hour
Day of judgement, god is calling
on their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings

Without warning, the wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell
Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic
Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by
Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine
Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic

Who could have known tonight would be your last
Now I'm left with just your memory
You won't be coming home tonight
A wasted driver twisted in your path
Your life was taken from you in a flash
There ain't no reason, just insanity
Without the answer how can I be free?
I can see you, I can see you
Someone wake me when it's over
I can see it, I can see it, I can see it over and over again
I saw it happening like deja-vu
I tried to tell you but I couldn't get through
And now the victim, what a waste of life
I wish to god that you had seen the light
I can see you, I can see you
Someone wake me when it's over
I can see it, I can see it, I can see it over and over again

Ohhhh - a shadow in the night
Ohhhh - it wasn't meant to be

No no, you won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight

As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me</field>

And I listen, again
Twisting the truth
And they're playin' around with my head O.K.
The things they will do
And the things they will say
When they don't really understand
Tears fill my eyes when I hear all the cries
For the reason today
And they don't really know
Even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve.
Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change,
May think it's strange
You can't kill rock'n'roll
It's here to stay.
Looking through eyes of time
Mirrors reflecting their
stories untrue
Promises promises,
Telling me all of my glories overdue.
How many times have I heard it before
And I'll probably hear it again
King of a thousand knights,
Pawn in a table fight Losing to you.
And they don't really know
Even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve.
Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change,
May think it's strange
You can't kill rock'n'roll it's here to stay.
Even the rhymes that they give me in times of confession
ain't true
Outcome is obvious
All for them none for us meaning you too
The things they will do
And the things they will say
When they don't really understand
Fear of rejection I need their protection
I'm making a stand
And they don't really know
Even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve.
Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change,
May think it's strange
You can't kill rock'n'roll it's here to stay
Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more

Look at yourself instead of looking at me
With accusation in your eyes
Do you want me crucified
For my profanity
Concealing your crimes behind a grandeur of lies
Tell me where do I begin
If you think that you're without sin
The first to cast the stone
Living my life in a way that I choose
You say I should apologize
Is that envy in your eyes reflecting jealousy

Tell me the truth and I'll admit to my guilt
If you'll try to understand
But is that blood that's on your hand from your democracy.</field>

Till it was too late
And I was empty within
Hungry feeding on chaos and living in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself
And no love for another
Searching to find a love upon a higher level
Finding nothing but questions and devils
Cause I'm losing my sight
Losing my mind,
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight,
Losing my mind,
Wish somebody would tell I'm fine
Nothing's alright
Nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm crying
I'm crying(x4)
I can't go on living this way
Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck
If I cut my arm bleeding
Would it be wrong
Would it be right?
If I took my life tonight
Chances are that I might.
Mutilation out of sight.
And I'm contemplating suicide.
Cause I'm losing my sight
Losing my mind,
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight
Losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing's alright
Nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm crying
I can't go on living thing this way
Can't go on
Living this way
Nothing's al...right</field>

My weakness is that I care too much
My scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
Drunk and I'm feeling down
and I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home
Cause you channel all your pain
and I can't help to fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is
Chorus
I tear my heart open, I sow myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
Our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
I tried to help you once
A kiss will only advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand
Chorus
I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
and I just wanna be alone
You shouldn't ever come around
Why don't you just go home?
Cause you're drowning in the water
and I tried to grab your hand
and I left my heart open
but you didn't understand
but you didn't understand
Go fix yourself!!
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life

You're everything I'm not in my life
We're indestructable, we are untouchable

You are so beautiful, it should be criminal

And we will make it out alive
I'll promise you this love will never die!
No matter what, I got your back
I'll take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to god that in the bitter end
We're gonna be the last ones standing
So believe me when I say, you're the one
They'll never forgive us for the things we've done
And we will make it out alive
I'll promise you this love will never die!

We'll never fall, we'll never fade
I'll promise you forever and my soul today
No matter what until the bitter end
We're gonna be the last ones standing
And everybody said that we would never last
And if they saw us now I bet they'd take it back
It doesn't matter what we do or what we say
Cause nothing matters anyway!
No matter what, I got your back
I'll take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to god that in the bitter end
We're gonna be the last ones standing
We'll never fall (we'll never fall)
We'll never fade (we'll never fade)

No, I will not be a victim

No, I don't need permission
To elevate with precision
I'm 'bout to break through the ceiling
'Cause I need something to lift me up

Watch me elevate
Woah, lift me higher
Woah, when I get down
Woah, lift me higher
Woah, oh (Watch me elevate)
I know they say that
The best is always yet to come
But nothing happens
I can't sit and wait until I'm numb
I get that feeling in my soul
Then I cut and run
'Cause I can't take another second
Watch me elevate, like hey, woah
Yeah, I'm taking this vision
My God body has risen
No, I can't stop with this rhythm
And I'm like "hey, woah"
No, my mind ain't a prison
I won't succumb to these villains
They keep attacking my feelings
I need something to lift me up when I'm down
I get lost in my head for so long
I can't get out
When I'm feeling like I'm crawling in my skin

I need something to lift me up
I wanna elevate

Watch me elevate like [?]

Running from the light, ah

End all the noise up inside my head

It's over

I'm watching all the moves you make
Can't turn back now, it's too late
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending
I'm counting all of your mistakes
Caught up in a crossfire hurricane
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending

I did it, took a second, but I realized
I been looking for a reason just to sever ties
Only seeing what I wanna see
Got me questioning the things

Paranoid from the drama in my life, uh

I had a chip on my shoulder then

On a California highway
I was grope but I always had time to spare
You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one
You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
I used to wanna run away, back when I was young
Found a way to go for couple drugs and down the sun
Never wish that I can take back
When the only thing we cared about
Was nothing and I'm not the only one
Yeah, I got demons
But so does everybody else
Man, it's cold, we turn the heat up
Just to feel what it's like in hell
Tired of everybody preachin'
That ain't doing shit for themselves
Talkin' to me like I need it
Maybe 'cause I said that I needed help
You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long

Tryna find our way through the mazes

Wll this be amputation?

I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not!
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not!
Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
Until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say sometimes
She says she loves me not
I hesitate
To tell her i hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over
Line for line
Rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fightin' all the goddamn time
It's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid mad
On the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl
We're tearing up each other's world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's all right baby we can scream and shout
(Chorus)
Life's not fair!
Life's not fair!
I'm the jerk!
Life's not fair!
She loves me not!
Loves me not!</field>

All alone
I can't seem to fight these feelings
I'm caught in the middle of this
My wounds are not healing
I'm stuck in between my parents
I wish I had someone to talk to
Someone I could confide in
I just want to know the truth
I just want to know the truth
Want to know the truth
Broken home
All alone
I know my mother loves me
But does my father even care
If I'm sad or angry
You were never ever there
When I needed you
I hope you regret what you did
I think I know the truth
Your father did the same to you
Did the same to you
I'm crying day and night now
What is wrong with me
I cannot fight now
I feel like a weak link
I'm crying day and night now
What is wrong with me
I cannot fight now
I feel like a weak link
A weak link

All alone
It feels bad to be alone
Crying by yourself, living in a broken home
How could I tell it so all y'all could feel it
Depression strikes me hard like my old earth would tell it
To me, her son, she told me I'm the one
Pain bottled up about to blow like a gun
Stories that I tell are nonfiction
And you can't take it back
'Cause it's already done
Broken home
Broken home
Can't seem to fight these feelings
Caught in the middle of this
My wounds are not healing
I'm stuck in between my parents

It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
take these memories
that are haunting me
of a paper man cut into shreds
by his own pair of scissors
he'll never forgive her...
he'll never forgive her...
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Sitting by the fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl..
little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroin-
In this moment I'm lonely
fullfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs, all these women
I'm never forgiving...
this broken heart of mine
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go

Only obsession, I don't need that shit,
Take my money, Take my obsession,
I just want to be heard,
Loud and clear are my words,
Comin' from within man,
Tell 'em what you heard
It's about a revolution in your heart,
And in your mind,
You can't find the conclusion,
Lifestyle and obsession,
Diamond rings get you nothing,
But a life-long lesson,
And your pocketbook stressin',
You're a slave to the system,
Working jobs that you hate,
For that shit you don't need,
Its too bad the world is based on greed,
Step back and see,
Stop thinking 'bout yourself,
Start thinking 'bout,
There's no money, There's no possession,
Only obsession, I don't need that shit,
Take my money, Take my possession,
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit,
'Cause everything is nothing,
And emptiness is in everything,
This reality is really just a fucked-up dream,
With the flesh and the blood,
That you call your soul,
Flip it inside out, Its a big black hole,
Take your money, Burn it up like an asteroid,
Possessions they are never gonna fill the void,
Take it away and learn the best lesson,
The heart, The soul, The life, The passion,
There's no money, Theres no possession,
Only obsession, I don't need that shit,
Take my money, Take my possession,
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit,
Money, Posession, Obsession,
Present yourself,
Press your clothes,
Comb your hair,
Clock in,
You just can't win,
Just can't win,
The things you own,
Own you,
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
Take my money, take my posession,
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit,
Fuck your money, Fuck your posession,
Fuck your obsession, I don't need that shit,
Money, Posession, Obsession,
I don't need that shit....</field>

I thought I saw you in an hourglass
I'm not sure where the time is gone
But I know it's been too long
We used to say we'd never change
Now we're trying not to show our age
I know, you said you needed space
So, you moved all the furniture around this place
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
It's getting dark in sunset park
I see the marks on your broken heart
I'm trying not to let it get to me
But it's hard with all our history
Leaving town while the city sleeps
You know, I always had bigger dreams
I keep looking in the rearview mirror
You know, I wasn't happy here
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
And now I'm running to you
Trying to find myself
But I don't even know where to start
I can't sit tight as I wait
I've keeping nothing the same
'Cause I don't even know who you are
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home

To risk everything and still survive
When you're standing on the battlefield

That you must have done something right
'Cause you never felt so alive
I'm holding out for more than I deserve
I'm hanging on to all your careless words
Maybe it's time I cut the chord
Maybe I stay and take some more
I've become the leader of the broken hearts
And now I finally know what it feels like

Nobody ever taught me how to live
I'm feeling like I'm lost like i'll never be found
I'm twisted and I'm turned around
Nobody ever taught me how to love
I'm hurting everybody I'm hurting myself
I'm desperate
So what do you do when it all comes down on you?
Do you run and hide or face the truth?
If you were to tell that i'd die today
This is what i'd have to say
I never really had the time to live
And if you were to give me just another chance
Another life, another dance
All I really want to do is love
I'm hurting everybody, I'm hurting myself
I'm desperate
So what do you do when it all comes down on you?
Do you run and hide or face the truth?
When all is said and done
You could be the one
With open arms and open eyes
Your jumping off the edge
And hoping you can fly
Accept ur fate for it is
Into the great unknow
(yeah!)
So what do you do when it all comes down on you?
Do you run and hide or face the truth?

Got a one-way ticket on a hell-bound train

Remember the girl
Abused with forks, knives, and razor blades?
She finally left him
Had enough of her man's rage
Band-aids covered her scars she left him bloodied
Beat his ass with a bat
Face sunk in like silly putty
Y'all can sit back so I could study
Destruction of the family design
And how the morals of society decline
Essentially it’s beats to rhyme like grapes to wine
It's alright
We're in love
Can't live with
Or without
You see she can't live with him
And can't live without him
Stress got her down she need to deal with the problem
As the drama gets deeper
I puff on the reefer
Took the last step and sent his ass to the reaper
Chaos, is what she saw in the mirror
Scared of herself and the power that was in her
It took over
And weighed heavy on her shoulder
Militant insanity is now what controlled her
It's alright
We're in love
Can't live with
Or without
It's alright
We're in love
Can't live with
Or without
We’re in love
We’re in love
Kill it before it reaches you
Missiles won't work it's approaching the mainland
What if it reaches the metropolitan areas?
Cosmopolitan areas
Secure the lines and prepare for departure
Calm, calm, calm,
It is a, a big business
And seems to be
Advancing underground
Cuz my style is yo, is underground
I'm green
With my red eyes mad tint
Flea fly flo
Rapido, rapido
She feeds plentiful
Electrifying the nation
Electrifying the nation!
Don't you see that we’re in danger?
How will we stop it?
She is attacking
Don't you see that we are in danger?
How will we stop it?
She is attacking
Sucka!
Danger danger!
Sucka!
Danger danger!
Sucka!
Danger danger!
Sucka!
Danger danger!
Running out
We’re running out
(Running out of time)
Running out
We’re running out

Running out
We’re running out
(Running out of time)
Running out
We’re running out
It's alright
We're in love
Can't live with

To living in a nightmare, ruining a good thing
Probably couldn't tell you how I got here
Bottom of the barrel, I been hanging here a lot
I've always done what I want
Just give me one more chance to mess it up
I got pain in my mind and heart
I can never stop it once it starts
Something in the way, I could pull our charge
But only ever hurt myself
I got, I got problems
I got, I got problems
I know, I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
When I do, I put a scratch on the silver lining
If I'm being honest, I've been lying
I wanna tell the truth 'cause I'm sick of what
I'm hiding
I've always done what I want
I know, I've done my share of messing up
I got, I got problems
I got, I got problems
I'm sorry for the times I trip and I fall
You blame yourself, but it isn't you fault then

How can I be strong?
You know all the weaknesses I got
Come and fill the spaces in my thoughts
Are you ready or not?
Bring me down on my knees with your cross

A love deprivation
I've got a jet black heart that's all fucked up and it's fallin apart

Woah!!! I'll never give in
Woah!!! I'll never give up
Woah!!! I'll never give in
And I just wanna be

I've got another confession, I fell to temptation
And there is no question, there was some connection
I've got to follow my heart no matter how far
I've gotta roll the dice, never look back, and never think twice

Woah!!! I'll never give in
Woah!!! I'll never give up
Woah!!! I'll never give in
And I just wanna be
Wanna be loved
Take the past, burn it up and let it go
Carry on I'm stronger than you'll ever know
That's the deal you get no respect
You're gonna get yours
You better watch your fucking neck /2x

We're tearing down the white picket fences
A soldier bleeds and a soldier dies
Have you ever thought that war was a sickness?
Im a son of it, fucked up from it
Casualty of my family 'cause of it
We dare to dream or live to die
Reunited by the truth at the right time
Something's wrong here
Or so it seems
Cause Im not sleeping
In American Dreams, American Lies
We're trying to see
Through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
Cause it's harder to breathe
When you're buried alive
By American Dreams
With every bullet hole, there's a blood stain
Another family that's struggling to keep sane
Cause their neighborhood ain't a safe place
Got us all wearing black every sunday
And Im growing numb to the violence
Sing along to the sound of the sirens
We're trying to keep ourselves alive
But it's hard to get by when it feels like
Somenthing's wrong here
Or so it seems
Cause Im not sleeping

Shackle and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an itch on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin out propaine
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin in the fast lane
In the rain and I'm might just hydroplaine
[Apl.De.Ap]
I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealin with somethin thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats
[Papa Roach]
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
[Apl.De.Ap (Fergie, Will.I.Am and Taboo]
My head keeps runnin away my brother
The only thing makin me stay my brother
But I won't give into it bro (no, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God, I can't let my mind be
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only I know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryna gain my sanity
Everywhere I turn its a dead end infront of me
With nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin strange paranoia took over me
And its weighin me down
And I can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground
I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealin with somethin thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats
[Papa Roach]
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety

I don't remember last night, I'm getting sick of this
I hit the bottle when I got off stage
and got piss drunk stupid and I went in a rage
I think I mighta got in a fight
Because my knuckles were bloody and I don't feel alright
I hit the bottom and I don't even care
You say I'm going to hell but I am already there
Pre-Chorus:
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Chorus:
I wanna be free from this ball and chain and
Be free from this life of pain and
be free from this ball and chain
I wanna be free from you
Now I'm full of guilt and shame
I can't point a finger cause theres no one to blame
So I say you'll never do it again
But when the sun goes down, you are my only friend
I think that I am starting to see
I have become everything I never wanted to be
I'm really getting sick of myself
Cause when I look into the mirror, I see somebody else
Pre-Chorus
Chorus x2
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
So sick and tired of being sick and tired
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
So sick and tired of being sick and tired

I'm giving it a go alone
I'm begging on my knees
Is there a God to save me
I've been a wretched soul
From my heart down to my toes
I was lost in my disease
And you were right there screaming
Don't change when it's too late
Maybe I said the right things wrong
But one last shot was too far gone
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die
Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die
From the valley of the dead
I'm hearing every word you said
I'm trying to apologize
But I can't feel my feelings
Are you diving us some room to grow
Or digging us a deeper hole
You're killing any shred of hope
For us to believe in
Don't change when it it's too late
Maybe I said the right things wrong
But one last shot was too far gone
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die
Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die
I'm out here on my own
I'm sick of being here alone
I know where I belong
But I can't find my way home
Find my way home
Find my way home
Find my way home
Find my way
Maybe I said the right things wrong
But one last shot was too far gone
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die
Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
But if I can I swear that I

Hits my heart like a drug, lift me up

Make me feel like it's better than life
How can I be strong?
You know all the weaknesses I got
Come and fill the spaces in my thoughts
Are you ready or not?
Bring me down on my knees with your cross
Make me feel like it's better than life
Make me feel like it's better than life
It's better than life

Take my money, Take my obsession,
I just want to be heard,
Loud and clear are my words,
Comin' from within man,
Tell 'em what you heard
It's about a revolution in your heart,
And in your mind,
You can't find the conclusion,
Lifestyle and obsession,
Diamond rings get you nothing,
But a life-long lesson,
And your pocketbook stressin',
You're a slave to the system,
Working jobs that you hate,
For that shit you don't need,
Its too bad the world is based on greed,
Step back and see,
Stop thinking 'bout yourself,
Start thinking 'bout,
There's no money, There's no possession,
Only obsession, I don't need that shit,
Take my money, Take my possession,
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit,
'Cause everything is nothing,
And emptiness is in everything,
This reality is really just a fucked-up dream,
With the flesh and the blood,
That you call your soul,
Flip it inside out, Its a big black hole,
Take your money, Burn it up like an asteroid,
Possessions they are never gonna fill the void,
Take it away and learn the best lesson,
The heart, The soul, The life, The passion,
There's no money, Theres no possession,
Only obsession, I don't need that shit,
Take my money, Take my possession,
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit,
Money, Posession, Obsession,
Present yourself,
Press your clothes,
Comb your hair,
Clock in,
You just can't win,
Just can't win,
The things you own,
Own you,
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
Take my money, take my posession,
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit,
Fuck your money, Fuck your posession,
Fuck your obsession, I don't need that shit,

These black clouds following me
So I look for signs of light,
But rarely I see them
I return to my shelter and I crawl in a bottle
I'm losing my will for this, so over-emotional
Black clouds, they rain down,
but they can't kill the sun
Confession of depression, this life I'm second
guessing
Like ashes to ashes, I always seem to fall down
I'm tired of running, it's time to face my demons
Confession of depression, this life I'm second
guessing
My emotions are storming
And tears fall just like rain
Pain strikes like lightning,
despair is becoming my friend
I return to my shelter and I crawl in a bottle
I'm losing my will for this, so over-emotional
Black clouds, they rain down,
but they can't kill the sun (the sun)
Confession of depression, this life I'm second
guessing
Like ashes to ashes, I always seem to fall down
I'm tired of running, it's time to face my demons
Confession of depression, this life I'm second
guessing
Black clouds, they rain down,
but they can't kill the sun ..
inside
Still looking for signs of life
These black clouds keep following me!
I return to my shelter and I crawl in a bottle
Black clouds, they rain down,
but they can't kill the sun
Confession of depression, this life I'm second
guessing
Like ashes to ashes, I always seem to fall down
I'm pushing myself to a point of self destruction
Confession of depression, this life I'm second
guessing
I'm tired of running, it's time to face my demons
Confession of depression, this life I'm second

            <field name="lyrics">(If I loose it all)
(If I loose it all)
I got my back to the wall
And now Im slipping
Been trying to deal
With the thought's in my condition
And still I try to hang on to what Im missing
But something's setting me off
Somebody listen
I've been running from fate
Without a lifeline
But now Im at the wrong place
At the wrong time
Trying to find an escape
Looking to get by
From never getting a break
Cutting the break lines
I've been hanging by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
If I slip and loose it all
Nothing's gonna break the fall
If I loose it all
Nothing's gonna break the fall
I got my head on the game
Im on a mission
But everyday is the same
A demolition
We are the marginalized
But not the victims
Fighting the fight of our lives
To make you listen
You got me loosing my breath
Its been a long run
Im trying hard to forget
But I know the outcome
I got a thousand regrets
And now Im on one
I might be loosing my head before the song's done
I've been hanging by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
If I slip and loose it all
Nothing's gonna break the fall
Gotta keep my head together, my head together
I've been trying to keep my head together
I beat down
Gotta keep my head together, my head together
I've been trying to keep my head together
I beat down
Gotta keep my head together, my head together
I've been trying to keep my head together
I beat down
Gotta keep my head together, my head together
I've been trying to keep my head together
I beat down
I've been hanging by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
If I slip and loose it all
Nothing's gonna break the fall
Break the fall!
If I loose it all
Nothing's gonna break the fall</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Why you all gotta learn the hard way?
Why you all gotta burn those bridges down?
Now that I feel so numb
Can I just be me for fuck sake?
Maybe I don't have a purpose
Maybe I cut way too deep
Or maybe I scratch the surface
To find out that I'm not worthless
And I've never been so alive
I feel the fire burning underneath my skin, nothing
I breathe in, I breathe you in
I feel the freedom from this hopelessness within, nothing
I breathe in, I breathe you in
I should've stopped when I saw you breakin'
I should've stopped but I had to see it through
Now that I've come undone
I know why I feel so shacken
Maybe I'm too weak to hold you
Maybe I'll just stay in range
So sorry I suffocate you
It must feel like I hate you
But I have never been so alive
I feel the fire burning underneath my skin, nothing
I breathe in, I breathe you in
I feel the freedom from this hopelessness within, nothing
I breathe in, I breathe you in
I've been afraid to show you what I'm neither
Knew all of this time why was I so afraid of
You never did anything to make me feel this way
To make me feel this way..
I feel the fire burning underneath my skin, nothing
I breathe in, I breathe you in
I feel the freedom from this hopelessness within, nothing
I breathe in, I breathe you in
I'll breathe you in, I'll breathe you in</field>

From the secrets we hide
Disaster is our master as
We lay here burning in bed
But something tells me
I cannot give up on you yet
I will not give up on you today
I will forgive and forget
Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left its the emptiness inside of me
You murder my heart
Broke my trust and watch me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me
You always play the victim
And you just cant decide
If the vicious way we love each other
Fucked up our lives
When we standing in the aftermath
Our emptiness is what's left
And if you really loved me
Will you love me to death?
I will love until the end
I will forgive and forget
Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left its the emptiness inside of me
You murder my heart
Broke my trust and watch me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me
Just as broken as
You're just as broken as me
I've been a slave
You've been a slave
I've been a slave to the
Hatred in you, in me
I see
You're just as broken as me
I will forgive and forget
Cause I know that it will set me free
And all that's left its the emptiness inside of me
You murder my heart
Broke my trust and watch me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me</field>

All alone
Broken home
All alone
I can't seem to fight these feelings
I'm caught in the middle of this
My wounds are not healing
I'm stuck in between my parents
I wish I had someone to talk to
Someone I could confide in
I just want to know the truth
I just want to know the truth
Want to know the truth
Broken home
All alone
I know my mother loves me
But does my father even care
If I'm sad or angry
You were never ever there
When I needed you
I hope you regret what you did
I think I know the truth
Your father did the same to you
Did the same to you
I'm crying day and night now
What is wrong with me
I cannot fight now
I feel like a weak link
I'm crying day and night now
What is wrong with me
I cannot fight now
I feel like a weak link
A weak link
(Push it back inside)
(Push it back inside)
(Push it back inside)
(Push it back inside)
Broken home
All alone
It feels bad to be alone
Crying by yourself, living in a broken home
How could I tell it so all y'all could feel it
Depression strikes me hard like my old earth would tell it
To me, her son, she told me I'm the one
Pain bottled up about to blow like a gun
Stories that I tell are nonfiction
And you can't take it back
'Cause it's already done
Broken home
Broken home
Can't seem to fight these feelings
Caught in the middle of this
My wounds are not healing
I'm stuck in between my parents
Broken home

Lying, cheating, so deceiving.

Running away from the light
Gotta burn all the bridges in my head

I can't move on, I can't live on
Carry me
Why don't you carry me?
I can't save me, I am crazy, without you
It takes horns to hold up my halo
And strength to get through the fight
Now I'm laying my cards on the table
Praying everything will be alright
I question my own existence
Question the meaning of life
Why don't you carry me?
Why don't you carry me?
I can't move on, I can't live on

Is the rattle race draging you down?
Are you stuck in that dead end town?
Are you looking for the way out?

You gotta change or die, the answer is for you to do what's right

What is your sign sweetcakes? Have I seen

Can I check your tags?
I swear you were made in Heaven!

Papa Roach
Composição: Papa Roach
I was scatterbrained
When I found the time to find
That times that are evil
Sick and disjointed
My skin is thick
Thick and calloused
I'm ready to shed the shell
Ready to shed the shell
So you think you have figured me out
A young man lost in his problems
Some problems aren't that easy to solve
and you can't break our code of energy
I'm bent out of shape
There is no happy ending
I've come to a point
Where I just don't give a fuck
My skin is thick
Thick and calloused
I'm ready to shed the shell
Ready to shed the shell
Code..
of energy
Ready to shed the shell
(3x)
Code..
of energy
So you think you have figured me out
A young man lost in his problems
Some problems aren't that easy to solve
but you can't break our code of energy
Code..

Code of energy!
Code of energy!
Hi
I'm paranoid
Goodbye
I'm in the void
Haunted by insecurity
Bipolar Asymmetry
Our new vision of passion and obsession
Is planetary ingestion
And there is no time for question...
We don't need any special equipment
No descrambler, no black box
Our antennas are up, aligned, and ready to recieve
We are all just searching, searching for satellite signal
Waiting for the channel to come in loud and clear
So you think you have figured me out
A young man lost in his problems
Some problems aren't that easy to solve
and you can't break our code of energy

1859, he started to burn
Corn field, coffee bean, started to swing in my sink
Started a swing in my sink
I gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta get another sip
Of the funky full flavor, automatic drip
Funky full flavor, automatic drip
Me myself and I, an odd combination
Open bread and beedy bread
I think I can bear too, I think for me I can bear too
Wash me clean with coffein!

Tryna find your way through the dark days
But you don't know how
You clip the world upside down
And right now, you don't wanna show it
'Cause you don't think that anyone will notice
Until you tell someone
You'll feel like you're the only one
And everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright
Everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright
I know we're not alright
It's always dark as just before the light
I know your silence is a deadly sound
It's never easy when you're breaking down
But I'll be there when you come around
(When you come around)
Face down in the days that we wasted
Tryna find our way through the mazes
We can wait this out
Or walk through that fire somehow
You tryna put together all the pieces
When you should turn around now and leave 'em
'Cause you can lose your mind
Trying to live back in time
And everybody says they're fine

That we'd never make it our whole lives through
That we'd be stuck in this dead end town
With the whole world against us we set out on our own
To find our way of life, and our way around
They tried to say we'd be nothing, they only said it just to keep us down
They were never gonna get me down, they were never gonna keep us down
You can't take this time away ..
Cause I am everything I said I'd ever be
So f*ck you and f*ck your town cause I got dreams
I'm gonna conquer the world, just you wait and see
I'm proving you wrong every single day
I remember as if it was yesterday, the good old days back in nineteen-nighty-three
Through thick and thin you are my blood brother
We all got drunk and sang our songs, it's what we did for fun
They tried to say we'd be nothing, they only said that just to keep us down
But you can't hold me down, they keep runnin' their mouths
Saying something that I don't need to hear
Cause I am everything I said I'd ever be
So f*ck you and f*ck your town cause I got dreams
I'm gonna conquer the world, just you wait and see
I'm proving you wrong every single day
Now we're older and we'll never be the same
We don't live by the rules, and that will never change
Cause I am everything I said I'd ever be
So f*ck you and f*ck your town cause I got dreams

Bloody knuckles paint the whole place red
Straightjacket, straight tie me to the bed
All alone in a room full os misfits
Cold blooded, cold hearted on a hit list
Paranoid, struggling, I gotta get this
Everybody's looking at me, staring at me
Everybody's looking at me
Terrified, paralysed
Something's got a hold on me
Let me go, I can't speak
Im choking on my crooked teeth
Wake me up, if I sleep
Cause Im haunted by my dreams
Crying out, but I can't speak
Cause Im choking on my
Choking on my crooked teeth
My crooked teeth
Caved in, hyperventilating
Cutting way to close to my skin
I feel the devil try to creep back in
I feel the devil try to creep back in
Im possessed by the everyday stress
Flash back and Im trying to forget
Bloody hell, bloody knife, bloody mess
Terrified, paralysed
Something's got a hold on me
Let me go, I can't speak
Im choking on my crooked teeth
Wake me up, if I sleep
Cause Im haunted by my dreams
Crying out, but I can't speak
Cause Im choking on my
Choking on my crooked teeth
Everybody's looking at me, staring at me
Everybody's looking at me
Everybody's looking at me, staring at me
Everybody's looking at me
Terrified, paralysed

Let me go, I can't speak

Wake me up, if I sleep

Crying out, but I can't speak

Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug em in and then turn it on

Do you have emotions?
Is your heart freezing?
Seizin, this opportunity to speak
Ya didn't say nuttin but turn your fuckin cheek
Dead cell!
Dead cell!
Sick in the head
Livin but dead
Hear what I said
Learn a lesson from the almighty dread
Jah, nutty warrior
Nuthin's scarier
Kids are gettin sick like malaria
Situation gets hairier
I’m throwing up all types of barriers
I'm tellin ya
The kids are getting singled out
Let me hear the dead cell shout

Stop pointing fingers cause we all are guilty
Of clean cut lies and the truth that's filthy
Believer is the root of the word
Out comes lie when it's cut into thirds
I don't believe what my eyes behold
No!

I'm never there for you or me
Can't you read the story of our lives
Death to me, and life for you
Something isn't right
And I need some space to clear my head to think about my life
And I can't be alone
I just need some space to clear my head and think about my life
With or without you
We fight it out, we work it out
Give me some time to unwind
We fight it out, we work it out
Give me some time to unwind
I must confess I'm falling apart, breaking your heart
Crying with you on the phone
We're walking on thin ice
I hope it doesn't break
And I need some space to clear my head to think about my life
And I can't be alone
With or without you
We fight it out, we work it out
Give me some time to unwind
We fight it out, we work it out
Give me some time, with or without you
Mile by mile we're farther apart
And it's one empty bottle and two broken hearts
Night after night we are falling apart
Now it's two broken bottles and four empty hearts

The blood shedding like never before
But I finally see your face
Its just a mirror looking back at me
My reflection is all I see
I don't wanna finish what we started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are, who the devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not asleep to your temptation
'Cause I know who you are and who the devil is
There's nowhere safe to hide
I can feel your presence
But we've been waging war
Since you fell from the heavens
I fuck this every night
It feels like I've already been here before
Well I'm looking into your eyes
And my reflection is looking back at me
And the devil is all I see
I don't wanna finish what we started

I had enough of you
Cause you took enough away from me
The lies I lived, became everything I believed
But the truth is that, the devil in you is me
The devil in you is me
The devil in you is me

Auction me off like a bicycle

I'll knock you on the ground
I'll hit you in the head
And you'll still be my friend
I'm a dirtycutfreak
Livin in the fourth dimension
Not payin attention to the fools around me
I sling fat rhymes see
Your head is bouncin up and down
All around
So high on life your feet
Can't reach the ground
Our music's not for
The weak at heart
Got the power from the flower
Cause we never act hard
Just flowin on freakstyle
All the while
I will go thousands of miles
To make your booty smile
I give peace and love to all my peoples
Tthat's down and all my brothers and sisters
Wanna give them a pound

Then I cut and run

Watch me elevate, like hey, woah
Yeah, I'm taking this vision
My God body has risen
No, I can't stop with this rhythm

Back in the day my father was a fuck up
Absolutely insane
He washed out the door straight out of my life
And he stole my innocence like a thief in the night
I had a hand full of cards, start to catch me
Mom was blacked out, I couldn't tell if she loved me
I gave up cause I didn't have a a family
I fell hard with nobody out to catch me
Somebody catch me
(Fear) I'm hopeless
(Hate) I'm helpless
(Love) I'm powerless
Gotta get out of this
(Fear) No choice in
(Hate) This crisis
(Love) Its hard and I'm so sick of this
Why did you abandoned me?
How could you just walk away?
(Fear) I'm hopeless
(Hate) I'm helpless
(Love) I'm powerless
Gotta get out of this
Now I'm out here
Walk in the streets
I'm a fatherless child
I'm a social disease
There's no love living in broken home
I never ever thought I have to live in alone
And then I talk to God, said I was empty
How could anybody ever possibly love me
I know that it hurts at the minute
It'll drag you to hell if you let it
Drag you to hell if you let it

Gotta get out of this

How could you just walk away?

(Love) I'm powerless
Gotta get out of this
I've lost my innocence
You tried to take my hope
You tried to take me down
I found myself again
No, you cant take my heart
No, you cant take me down
Cause karma comes around
I'm hopeless,I'm helpless,I'm powerless
I gotta get out of this, gotta get out of this
(Fear) I'm hopeless
(Hate) I'm helpless
(Love) I'm powerless
Gotta get out of this
(Fear) No choice in
(Hate) This crisis
(Love) Its hard and I'm so sick of this
Why did you abandoned me?
How could you just walk away?
(Fear) I'm hopeless
(Hate) I'm helpless
(Love) I'm powerless
Gotta get out of this
Gotta get out of this
Fear!
Hate!
Love!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">It's been a while since we crossed paths
I thought I saw you in an hourglass
I'm not sure where the time is gone
But I know it's been too long
We used to say we'd never change
Now we're trying not to show our age
I know, you said you needed space
So, you moved all the furniture around this place
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
It's getting dark in sunset park
I see the marks on your broken heart
I'm trying not to let it get to me
But it's hard with all our history
Leaving town while the city sleeps
You know, I always had bigger dreams
I keep looking in the rearview mirror
You know, I wasn't happy here
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
And now I'm running to you
Trying to find myself
But I don't even know where to start
I can't sit tight as I wait
I've keeping nothing the same
'Cause I don't even know who you are
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Feel like home</field>

            <field name="lyrics">In the brightest hour
Of my darkest day
I realized
What is wrong with me
Can't get over you
Can't get through to you
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
take these memories
that are haunting me
of a paper man cut into shreds
by his own pair of scissors
he'll never forgive her...
he'll never forgive her...
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Sitting by the fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl..
little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroin-
In this moment I'm lonely
fullfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs, all these women
I'm never forgiving...
this broken heart of mine
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss</field>

I know that I'm fucked up and infected
I've been hiding and I feel rejected
Thank God that you finally found me
‘Cause you gotta get me outta here
I've been sick disconnected
I've been loving like I've been neglected
All the walls coming down around me
And you gotta get me outta here
I can't take anymore
I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna die
I can't feel, I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
I can't breathe, I can't fight
I will feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
I know I'm a walking contradiction
I'm a truth that you wish was fiction
And it's hard ‘cause I know you hate me
I just wanna disappear
I've been on a self-inflicted mission
To destroy everything I'm giving
Thank God that you finally found me
‘Cause you gotta get me outta here
I can't take anymore
I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna die
I can't feel, I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
I can't breathe, I can't fight
I will feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
You took my pride
You took control
It's not that sacred anymore
Give back what's mine
Give back my soul
I don't wanna breathe but I don't wanna die
I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna die
I can't feel, I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
I can't breathe, I can't fight
I will feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna die

Some sacred questions

Some marijuana
If you want some
Gouge away
You can gouge away
And stay all day
If you want to
Sleeping on your belly
You break my arms
You spoon my eyes
Been rubbing a bad charm
With holy fingers
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
Chained to the pillers
A three day party
I break the walls
And kill us all
With holy fingers
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to

            <field name="lyrics">I was there on the day truth died
Blood on my hands, throw them up in the sky
I was a number one sinner no less
My life was a lie and my wish was a death
I fell in love with the ways of the world
Money and the fame, the booze and the girls
But I couldn't stay faithful if I tried
I'd turn into a devil you could see it in my eyes
I blacked out, told you everything I ever did
I couldn't take all the lies I was living with
I broke your heart, broke up the next day
My bags outside yelling get the hell away
You're not a husband, not a father just a pig
And you can never change all the things that you did
That's when I knew it, it wouldn't last
You'll never get away when you're running from the past
And we fly...
Fly into outer space
I float away but you're my gravity
Die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity
I'm a broken man, I'm full of sin
I'm sick of all this hell that I'm livin' in
I can't escape it ? this is how it feels
When you try to numb the pain with a thousand pills
You tore me down and wished that I was dead
Said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
But when I push you away, you only pull me closer
It's only over when we both wanna say it's over
I gotta change ? this is not who I am
I wanna start over, wanna try this again
You're everything I need, everything I'm not
So pull the trigger give me one more shot
And we fly...
Fly into outer space
I float away but you're my gravity
Die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity
You love me, you hate me, you kiss me, you break me
You lifted me up just to watch as you dropped me
You promised me, looked me straight in the eyes
No matter what you say, I don't know the truth from the lies
I held you up, like I always do
I forgave you for your sins and I carried you through
No matter how hard we fall, we always knew
You will bleed for me and I will bleed for you
Fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
(Baby, we can float away) die, to love another day
(We can rise again)we rise again, and loose our gravity
And we into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
And we die, to love another day
We rise again, and loose our gravity
And we fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
And we die, to love another day
We rise again, and loose our gravity
Baby, we can float away</field>

Gerber bottle is fixture, to the fit he was living
Was blown, captain of motherland, laughed on by brother's hand
Gotta make that hook-up to come through, you didn't know you got lied to
Hit the ceiling of the sky
You thought you could fly, but your wings are made of wax
I cannot see you, you cannot see me

Another boy shot tonight
I can't believe what I am seeing
A body bag, a mother cries
It seems like this is never ending
I've had enough so I decide
The time has come for me to face it
I can't refuse the war inside
'Cause we have had enough
All the violence has touched every part of our lives
Our innocence is gone tonight
I don't know if I can hide it
I know the truth it's only lies
The president will deny it
The body count, a steady rise
In my head there is a riot
Change the world, no one dies
The time has come for us to fight it
You can't refuse the war inside
'Cause we have had enough
All the violence has touched every part of our lives
Our innocence is gone tonight
'Cause we have had enough
All the violence has touched every part of our lives
Our innocence is gone tonight
I know that you can change the future
I know that we can make it happen
In my head there is a riot
and i dont think that I can fight it
'Cause we have had enough
All the violence has touched every part of our lives
Our innocence is gone tonight
'Cause we have had enough
All the violence has touched every part of our lives
Our innocence is gone tonight
We have had enough
We have had enough
We have had enough

In a million lies
It was all my fault

I keep finding myself
Replaçes the life
With my soul
So pull out my hand
And i ask for some help
Rejoin the walls
I feel soround myself
I was suck by the light
I fell to the ground
I'm Hanging on
I am not where i wanna be
I keep finding myself
Replaçes the life

I had nine lives and I’ve got one left

I’ve been to heaven, I’ve been to hell x2
I never thought I’d need someone’s help

‘Cause I’ll handle it all and do it by myself
(I’ll do this by myself)
i'm never alone ‘till I hit rock bottom
(I’m not afraid to fall)
I’m so fucking stubborn and so fucking rotten

passed out on the floor
I'm sorry but the party's over
Cocain nose and trendy clothes
Gotta send her to rehab
She found out she's got no soul
But it really doesn't bother her
White trash queen
American dream
Oh, what a role model
Thowing a fit
Making a scene
Like no tomorrow
Hollywood whore
Passed out on the floor
Can't take it no more
I'm sorry but the party's over
The talk of the town
And she's going down
I'm sorry but the party's over now
Awake by noon, drunk by 4
Sucked up into showbiz
Your so lame
Your such a bore
I wanna kick your teeth in
Plastic smile to match your style
We can tell you got a face lift
Your so vain, oh so vile
Your a number one hit
Hollywood whore
Passed out on the floor
Can't take it no more
I'm sorry but the party's over
The talk of the town
And she's going down
I'm sorry but the party's over now
The cameras are gone
And nobody screams
She couldn't survive her 15 minutes of fame
Her friends are all gone
She's going insane
She'll never survive without the money and fame
It's all going down the drain
Hollywood whore passed out on the floor
I'm sorry but the party's over
The talk of the town and she's going down
I'm sorry but the party's over
Wake up!
The parties over
Wake up!
The party's over
Wake Up!
The party's over
Wake Up!
The party's over now!

Don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya honey!

I'm not counting on myself
I've been reeking all this habit
Cause I started to go on
Never careful what I wish for
Never careful with what I say
Always begging for attention
In my sick and twisted way
If I could reach the stars
This hope for the hopeless
Now that I know this
You can be the strength to carry on
The voice in the silence
Who's crushing the violence
Its giving me chance to right this wrongs
I will never quit, this is it
This is hope for the hopeless
Hope for the hopeless
I'm sitting in the shadows
As the bodies hit the floor
And I don't need another reason
Why I cant take anymore
I'm so sick of this excuses
Tired of living in the dark
And I wont be another victim
Starving from a empty heart
I'll rise to reach the stars
This hope for the hopeless
Now that I know this
You can be the strength to carry on
The voice in the silence
Who's crushing the violence
Its giving me chance to right this wrongs
I would never quit, this is it
This is hope for the hopeless
I wont suffocate in pride
I wont die in apathy
I stood out on the edge
And faced eternity
So freedom in the fall
When I finally believe
I'll never be alone
This hope for the hopeless
Now that I know this
You can be the strength to carry on
The voice in the silence
Who's crushing the violence
Its giving me chance to right this wrongs
I would never quit, this is it
This is hope for the hopeless
Hope for the hopeless</field>

I love it when you're down on your knees
And I'm a junkie for the way that you please
You shut me up, and you swallow me down
My back to the wall you're going to town
I Almost told you that I loved you
Thank god I didn't cause it would have been a lie
I say the damnedest things
When you're on top of me
I Almost told you that I loved you
I hate to say it, but It has to be said
You look so fragile as I fuck with your head
I know it shouldn't but it's scaring me off
If sex is the drug then what is the cost?
I Almost told you that I loved you
Thank god I didn't cause it would have been a lie
I say the damnedest things
When you're on top of me
I Almost told you that I loved you
If I'm the one that you want
The one that you need
My love is like a fucking disease
You can give me your hand
You can make your demand
I'm the hardest motherfucker to please
I Almost told you that I loved you
Thank god I didn't cause it would have been a lie
I say the damnedest things
When you're on top of me
I Almost told you that I loved you
I Almost told you that I loved you
Thank god I didn't cause it would have been a lie
I say the damnedest things
When you're on top of me
I Almost told you that I loved you</field>

Its time to say hello goodbye (hello goodbye)
to fade away fade away alone (motherfuck it, goodbye!)
i just want you to take, take me back home
to a better place that i've never known, that i've never known

I've killed my fears a thousand times

And found another reason to confess
I set on fire what's out my house
So I can see the mess
Just take it all and burn it all
until there's nothing left
I suffer well
I suffer well
I suffer well
I suffer
Got amnesia, more than ever
'cause I feel possessed
Razor blades can never heal this heart
it's such a mess
A mess
I suffer well, I suffer well
I suffer well, I suffer

MY head full of wreckage
A Mouth full of lies
My mind is in the gutter
I feel like i wanna die
Im the king of nothing
with a broken crown
Im gonna take it and beat it
but i wont back down
free me from myself
shut down my mind
A So long revolution
Into the light
This spear is a weakness
and its wearing me out
im burning the sickness
it feels like im going down
and align my affliction
and i run from the light
its a lowly condition
Fuck all this madness
put it aside
out of the shadows
into the light
free me from myself
shut down my mind
Out of the shadows
Into the light
Out of the shadows
Into the light
free me from myself
shut down my mind
A So long revolution

Breaking down feeling weak
Thinkin about the higher ground that I wish to
seek
For safeness
For realness
I'll break it down simple for my people to hear this
Cause my shit is for realness
For my people to hear this
Six years of age when I first got my rage
Father broke out
Then I turned a new page of my life
Changed
Then it was crazy
Thanx to my mom cause she stuck by to raise me
Since I was a baby
She stuck by to raise me
There is no sound
Coming up from the ground
No way
Not this time
Buried deep inside
There is no evidence
Feelings that I hide
Sometimes are too intense
Silent
In the dark I think I'm nutty
Vicious swords of emotion slash
And leave me bloody
I said you fucking die.</field>

hard times,good times
two ways to go
i've got my problems
god only knows
it came faster than a blink of an eye
fire, rain, indapendce, 4th of july
give in, give into tradition
one thing i'd like to say is
fuck superstition
my independence day
is wiped from my face
maybe i gave it away
maybe i've got a secret hiding place
i love you

A ball and chain chew my arm off to get away
Don't fight, or it deny it, invite it cause when it
Feels like a kick in the teeth, I can take it
Throw your stones and you won't see me break it
Say what you want, take your shots
You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth

Kick in the Teeth (na na na na na na)
I gotta say thanks cause you kick me when I'm down
I'm bleeding out the mouth
I hope you know I'm stronger now
I'm taking the hate, I'm turning it all around
I won't go down 'til I'm six feet underground
Don't fight, or it deny it, invite it, cause when it

This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck
If I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck
If I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care
If I died bleeding?
Would it be wrong
Would it be right
If I took my life tonight
Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide
Cause I'm losing my sight,
Losing my mind,
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, Losing my mind,
Wish somebody would tell I'm fine
I never realized
I was spread too thin
Till it was too late
And I was empty within
Hungry feeding on chaos and living in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself
And no love for another
Searching to find a love upon a higher level
Finding nothing but questions and devils
Cause I'm losing my sight
Losing my mind,
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight,
Losing my mind,
Wish somebody would tell I'm fine
Nothing's alright
Nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm crying
I'm crying(x4)
I can't go on living this way
Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck
If I cut my arm bleeding
Would it be wrong
Would it be right?
If I took my life tonight
Chances are that I might.
Mutilation out of sight.
And I'm contemplating suicide.
Cause I'm losing my sight
Losing my mind,
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight
Losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing's alright
Nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm crying
I can't go on living thing this way
Can't go on
Living this way
Nothing's al...right</field>

I'm holding out for more than I deserve
I'm hanging on to all your careless words

Maybe I stay and take some more

Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
So I put out my hand

We tore down the walls I built around myself
I was struck by the light
Aand I fell to the ground
I've been looking for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
Is there anybody out there?
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair?
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
You know a heart of gold
Won't take you all the way
And in a world so cold
It's hard to keep the faith
I'm never gonna fade away!
Yeah!
I've been looking for a lifeline

I saw this cat running with his hand on his 9mm
He's got a small peter
Got 2 kids and a wife plus he beats her
Nod ya head as if my shit was the dog catcher
P-Roach comin through sick
I'm gonna have to betcha my last dollar That you
come on back
You getting weak in the knees while you
smokin the cess
Oh yes
Word to God
I know his son is the best
He helps me out when I'm down or when I'm
crazy ill stressed
I confess
I'm not as good as the rest
But I get down for my crown and I don't
crack under stress
But I'll be careful though cause the girl is
memorizing
She takes off her clothes
And er body is mad surprising
Slangin
Bangin
Her two breasts was firm and not hangin
Listen to this rhyme that I'm slangin
Hooked up with this girl
Her name is Kelly
For really
The hip hop body and a piercing through her
belly
I knew she was mine when I saw her
working on the line
Servin pasta and salad and she's still lookin fine
But enough of that though
I give a shot out to Happy
He's partying down and getting props in this
rap
See cause I'm the type of cracker that'll get
straight down to beat that you hear
It's the Pee-Roach sound
Abused with forks
Knives
Cut with razor blades
That shit is absurd
His temper's flaring
Now he's twice as mean
Now I am talking about this fool
Beats his wife thinks he's cool
She cries so hard
She's trembling
This time he beats her and he's twice as mean
Silence in her rage
She should recognize next time he is gone she
should pack her bags and leave.</field>

I'm better of without you
All is well
I rather be alone
To have you
To hold you
And Never know cause
You sold me out
You never gonna live this down
Never gonna live this down
How do you look in the mirror
How do you stand outside of your face
If madded any clearer
I could seen right thru the hade
And ill never think about you
While I'm sleeping with all of your friends
And I'm hoping that you found out
Cause love is the sweetest revenge
How could you decieve me
I'm begging you to leave me
Go To hell
I'm better of without you
All is well
I rather be alone
To have you
To hold you
And Never know cause
You sold me out
You never gonna live this down
Never gonna live this down
I always thought i could trust you
I always thought i could trust you
Go!!!
I always thought i could trust you
I always thought i could trust you
So go To hell
I'm better of without you
All is well
I rather be alone
To have you
To hold you
And Never know cause
You sold me out
You never gonna live this down
Never gonna live this down

Love me till it hurts
Love me till it hurts
You are the poison
You are the pain
The one chemical inside my veins
Its true
I've been infected by you
I'm not a killer, no I'm not a saint
And there's nobody left that I can blame
Its true
I am the poison in you
Will you love me till it hurts
Never leave me at my worst
Break this cicle, break this curse
Love me till it hurts
We are gather, we deserve
Tell me do I have your word?
Break this cicle, break this curse
Love me till it hurts
Love me till it hurts
We fell in love but then we went to war
Now I'm the enemy,I'm at your door
Its true
I'm only fighting for you
We thought that we can make it through the storm
Hell broke loose and then you fell from my arms
Its true
I couldn't hold on to you
Will you love me till it hurts
Never leave me at my worst
Break this cicle, break this curse
Love me till it hurts
We are gather, we deserve
Tell me do I have your word?
Break this cicle, break this curse
Love me till it hurts
Will you love me till it hurts
Never leave me at my worst
Break this cicle, break this curse

Peculiar it seems
Some thrive on hate
Some love and dream
Everyone's got a purpose and wants to be loved
I think I found my purpose
I think I found love
Hidden inside myself
Tragedy
Strikes when you least expect it
Hate and destruction crashed down on our world
The stars and the stripes
The boys and the girls
It's sad it took a war just to bring us together
I believe in love
I believe in forever
Hidden inside ourselves
You better run
You better run
You better run
For your life
For your life
Shed a tear
Shed a tear
Live in fear[2x]
Love Hate Tragedy[2x]
Tragedy
Strikes when you least expect it
Tragedy day

Only 'cause I got rock 'n' roll

Only 'cause I got rock 'n' roll
C'mon
Baby c'mon
Yeah

Break it
Crazier than I ever was
I'm bloodied up I beat my skull in
Comin' home in a body bag
And I'm ready to die for rock 'n' roll
I can't change the world
I can only change myself
I'm as sharp as a knife
As high as a kite
Demented as the night is long
I'm strong and fearless
Only 'cause I got rock 'n' roll
I'm knee-deep in our blood
Only 'cause I got rock 'n' roll
I'm not sheddin' a tear
I'm blowin' some steam
Stuck in between
Living a dream
I'm not sheddin' a tear
I'm blowin' some steam
Stuck in between
Living a dream

My head is spinnin'
think I might've lost control
I look around the room
and I'm thinking "how'd I get here? "
Yeah
Was I the life of the party, was I a maniac?
I try to remember but nothing's coming back
Somebody, call a doctor, better call the doctor
'Cause I think I'm losing it
Face flushed down this train again
(I think I'm losing it)
Chasing problems in my head
Everybody says that I'm losing my shit
I should calm down, but you know I can't quit
(I'm losing it)
Face flushed down this train again
Stranded at a hotel, lookin' in the mirror
'Cause everything's hazy and nothing seems clear
Am I a manic depressive, am I a maniac?
I see the reaper in people
until they fade to black
Somebody, call a doctor, better call the doctor
'Cause I think I'm losing it
Face flushed down this train again
I think I'm losing it
Chasing problems in my head
Everybody says that I'm losing my shit
I should calm down, but you know I can't quit

Face flushed down this train again

Is it real or am I going insane
Am I ever gonna change my ways?
Isolated, separated
Sick of the mess I've created
The pressure keeps rising
When the truth is what I'm finding
We march out of the darkness
We revel in the flames
The mission is accomplished
We're ready for the changes
And the only thing that will set us free
Is living through the pain
And the only thing that we cannot take
Will never be the same
It feels like I'm still in a cage
And I scream 'til I'm blue in the face
Is it real or is it a phase
I think the time is gonna change my ways
I'm ready, I'm willing
To take what I've been given
The pressure keeps rising
'cause the truth is what I'm finding

It's ok, it's alright
Just let go, you'll be fine
It's ok, it's alright
Just let go, you'll be fine

            <field name="lyrics">i want to let you in on a story
that i got to tell
about good dreams in heaven not
bad dreams in hell
started with punk rock
and then evolved to hip hop
the party popped off
like the fireworks on my block
alonzo is the street that i take dweel
a little white trash
and a little bit swell
i take you back
and take a step down
july was the month
i was born 8 pounds
my bad side
my sign is leo defraud the hoax with a ruby
king of the jungle yet i try to be humble
but i should to let yall know what im' about
attack your brain fast drop knowledge
the i'm out i'm a freak but i got some class
i'll bring the fucking ruckus
and you can bring the grass
have a session
good times is the lesson
the men will cease fire and
the girls could stop stressin
come on baby doll please jerk me off
perverted state of mind
baby help me get my nut off
whats wrong girly
don't know the art of a quicky
my balls hang low
and they produce something icky
from my dick to your skin
hands rub it in
i know you love lotion baby
thats how i begin
sexual feeding in my dreams
she was screaming down on her knees
as she eating on my seamen
i've this problem
i don't wanna say
but to tell you the truth everybody
i be doing it every day
you may think i'm stupid
you may think im queer
but to tell you the truth everybody
jackin off is better than beer!!!!!!

You can have this guilt this misery I wear so well
I wave my flag, I sound the alarm
somebody stop me before I do any harm
I surrender, I know I've been a pretender
I'm living a dead life im staring into the headlights
of a getaway car that'll take me out of my mind tonight
crash and burn S.O.S
somebody help me get out of this mess
of a dead life im burning under the spotlight
My heart is a fist
Drenched in blood
My Soul will fight again
My heart is a fist
Drenched in blood
My Soul will fight again
Take a look at these hollow eyes
one last look before I say goodbye
To this candle-lit nightmare I feel I can never escape
so watch me fall from grace
watch me carve my hate
In the heart of a lover I feel I never escape my fate
My heart is a fist
Drenched in blood
My Soul will fight again
My heart is a fist
Drenched in blood
My Soul will lose again
I see you on your cloud looking down
im on my knees today
but you don't notice me
I see you on your cloud looking down
im on my knees today
but you don't notice me
you don't notice me
you don't notice me!
Im screaming while I pray
while I pray
while I pray
you dont notice me
im sick of you...
God, I am done with you...
I see you on your cloud looking down
im on my knees today
but you don't notice me
My heart is a fist
Drenched in blood
My Soul will fight again
My heart is a fist
Drenched in blood
My Soul will rise again

Fucked in the head
From all the things that we did
But I will never forget
I need you
My medication!
Have you ever had enough of it?
Straight over it?
Sick of it?
Cant get a hold of it?
Like a drug I need another fix
Im a moth to a flame
And Im burning for the hell of it
Gotta stop, cause I lost the fight
Everytime I take a breath
Its like Im loosing my life
Fuck it!
Why am I so dysfunctional?
So irrational?
I don't know what to do
So I push you away
Until you beg me to stay
Just fot the thrill of the chase
You got me intoxicated
Fucked in the head
From all the things that we did
But I will never forget
I need you
My medication!
Oh! Are you living with the enemy?
Are you affected by the devil's
That are trying to be a friend of me?
Im in a place that I don't wanna be
But if I find a way to turn it all around
Would you follow me?
Im alive but I lost the fight
Its like the better half of me
Its on the edge of the knife
Cut It!
Why am I so emotional?
Uncontrollable?
I don't know what to do
So I push you away
Until you beg me to stay
Just fot the thrill of the chase
You got me intoxicated
Fucked in the head
From all the things that we did
But I will never forget
I need you
My medication!
I push you away
Until you beg me to stay
Just fot the thrill of the chase
You got me
Fucked in the head

Never enough, Never enough
Do I deserve what I got?

and this seems natural, to me a fuck up everyday
somebody put, me in my place

Cause when you took your last breath
I was high, I was running away
You always call me on the phone
But I never pick up
I never wanted you to know
I was running out of love
You didn't walk out, you didn't give up on me
So even if you're coming out
I'm not giving up on you
We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just wanna say, that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you say its true
Then I would never have to call on you
In every single way
You're ripping every day
So we never have to say
We never have to say goodbye
We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye
I didn't have the strength that I needed at the end of the day
Cause I was popping every pill
The only one that I was fooling was me
You always loved me when I couldn't even love myself
No, you never turned away when I was begging for help
I should've said thanks
For never given up on me
So even if you're coming out
I'm not giving up on you
We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just wanna say, that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you say its true
Then I would never have to call on you
In every single way
You're ripping every day
So we never have to say
We never have to say goodbye
We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye
I can hear your voice when I walk through the pain
Show me how to live
Show me that I can change
I can feel you catch me when I fall away
We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just wanna say, that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you say its true
Then I would never have to call on you

The wicked game that you play so good
I'm falling high
Just like you knew I would
This wont last its to good
I cant stop but I know I should
Days of war and the nights of love
Heaven is on fall And I'm on the run
Dancing with the devil in the midnight sun
I'm falling in love
I'm coming undone
I'm coming undone
I'm out of my head
And a memory of you
Ill never forget what you put me through
It wasn't right what you did
But I was just wrong as you
Days of war and the nights of love
Heaven is on fall And I'm on the run
Dancing with the devil in the midnight sun
I'm falling in love
I'm coming undone
Days of war and the nights of love
Heaven is on fall And I'm on the run
Dancing with the devil in the midnight sun
I'm out of my head
I'm coming undone
I'm on the outside looking in
I turn my back on myself again
I'm in the edge of calling out
Somebody better come and thought me down
I said ill never do it again
But I keep on given them
I gotta turn my world around
Because its keep on knocking me down
Knocking me down
I fell hard
It fell good
This wont last
I wish it would
It wasn't right what you did
But I was just wrong as you
Days of war and the nights of love
Heaven is on fall And I'm on the run
Dancing with the devil in the midnight sun
I'm falling in love
I'm coming undone
Days of war and the nights of love
Heaven is on fall And I'm on the run
Dancing with the devil in the midnight sun

I'll promise you this love will never die!

So believe me when I say, you're the one
They'll never forgive us for the things we've done

And if they saw us now I bet they'd take it back
It doesn't matter what we do or what we say

Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets no more lies
Yeah ! What goes around comes around , baby

Boarded up the windows in the house

I Don't want no
Take me to church
Cause I've been blessed with a curse
I arrived in a limo
And I left in a hearse
They're speaking in tongues
Feels like we're coming undone

of the church bells ringing out
In this quiet little town
i am dreaming.
i woke up to the sound
of an angel crying out
gotta leave this little town
gotta move on
im not coming home, not coming home
this christmas i am all alone
im not coming home, not coming home
i am out here on the road
im not coming home, not coming home
this christmas i am all alone
im not coming home, not coming home
i am out here on the road
gotta phonecall from my son
he said, dad, youre number one
mommy's going nuts, think shes crazy
put your mother on the phone
ive gotta tell her shes not alone
shes sick of waiting around
then i tell her these words
im not coming home, not coming home
this christmas i am all alone
im not coming home, not coming home
i am out here on the road
im not coming home, not coming home
this christmas i am all alone
im not coming home, not coming home
i am out here on the road
keep holding on,
it wont be long
but for now
im not coming home, not coming home
this christmas i am all alone
im not coming home, not coming home

            <field name="lyrics">I pray you're the best and I run from the past
I pick up the bones to find I'm alone
It's wearing me out in the way that my seems
Killed the faith that I had so it's time I begin
Back to this darkness to see how it feels
I was the one with the dark you could heal
Now that it's over it's time to move on
‘Cause I was the righteous and you were the wrong
Every time I try to run and hide I feel you haunting me
I'm addicted to the games that you play
You make me feel so pitiful
Like you're so beautiful
Your heart is beating me to death every day
But I am not that pitiful
You're not that beautiful
I slide from the side just to feel I'm alive
I bury the truth ‘cause I know it's a lie
I never said all the things that you say
‘Cause you were the master and I was a slave
If I could find me a truck to forget you
I'd only take some day that I met you
Kill every time and it's time to move on
‘Cause I am the righteous and you were the wrong
Every time I try to run and hide I feel you haunting me
I'm addicted to the games that you play
You make me feel so pitiful
Like you're so beautiful
Your heart is beating me to death every day
But I am not that pitiful
You're not that beautiful
I'm not that pitiful
You're not so beautiful
Every time I look at your eyes I see a demon in disguise
You fucking make me sick, you are the one that I despise
You take me, you break me, you feed me lies
And only to gain in return was my demise
So maybe I'm just crazy for believing this shit
But goddamn I can't believe I'm fucking dealing with this
It's like a nightmare and I can't wake up
I just can't wake up
I'm addicted to the games that you play
You make me feel so pitiful
Like you're so beautiful
Your heart is beating me to death every day
But I am not that pitiful
You're not that beautiful
I'm not that pitiful
You're not so beautiful</field>

I was angry at the world
I felt like I was a loser
I had a chip on my shoulder then
In a low place
Whishin' I was anywhere else but there
On a California highway
I was grope but I always had time to spare
You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one
You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
I used to wanna run away, back when I was young
Found a way to go for couple drugs and down the sun
Never wish that I can take back
When the only thing we cared about
Was nothing and I'm not the only one
Yeah, I got demons
But so does everybody else
Man, it's cold, we turn the heat up
Just to feel what it's like in hell
Tired of everybody preachin'
That ain't doing shit for themselves
Talkin' to me like I need it
Maybe 'cause I said that I needed help
You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one
You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Found a way to go for couple drugs and down the sun

Deep down it hurts that I cant do a thing
My eyes are bleeding
They're glued to the screen
Headlines and monster that everyone honors
Blink if it hurts you
To see what I see
Both eyes have witness this catastrofy
Stand at the altar
Swing me a promisse
Don't you surrender, no
There's no surrender
Nothing's ever gonna change
If you don't stand up and you don't say nothing
Waiting on better days
But they wont show up
If you don't do nothing
You're not safe
Put a nail in your coffin
Counting on you're losses
You're not safe
If you want it gotta stand up
Stand up!
Facing the truth
With the demons we see
Fist to the skyes
Tell me what you believe
Put down your weapons
Put down your weapons
If you've been kicked dow
Get back on your feet
No turning back now
No, there's no retreat
When they hear us running
They're know were coming
Don't you surrender, no
There's no surrender
Don't you surrender, no
There's no surrender
Nothing's ever gonna change
If you don't stand up and you don't say nothing

Don't know which one I'm gonna be tonight (be tonight)
I know you think I'm crazy
You think I've lost my mind
I'm locked and loaded
Got you in my sights
You are my nemesis
The one I can't resist
I got a one track mind
Turn the lights out
Lay your head down
Now you got me
Where you want me
I'm the pain and
You're the pleasure
Can't you read the signs
I got a one track mind
(I got a one track mind)
I got a one track mind
I'm numb I've got no conscience
Can't get you off my mind
You're in my line of fire everytime
You narcissistic lover
You complicate my life
But then I find myself with you tonight
You are my nemesis
The one I can't resist
I got a one track mind and
I'm losing it
I need another fix
I think you could be it
I got a one track mind
Turn the lights out
Lay your head down
Now you got me
Where you want me
I'm the pain and
You're the pleasure
Can't you read the signs
I got a one track mind
(I got a one track mind)
I got a one track mind
I wanna love you till the bitter end
Get underneath your skin
I wanna pleasure every part of you
And take you from within
Turn the lights out
Lay your head down
Now you got me
Where you want me
Turn the lights out
Lay your head down
Now you got me
Where you want me
I'm the pain and
You're the pleasure
Can't you read the signs
I got a one track mind
Turn the lights out
I got a one track mind
Turn the lights out
I got a one track mind
I got a one track mind
I got a one track mind
I got a one track mind

Kick it with that rebel cat and

I'm looking up from the ground
While confusion strains my mind
I contemplate this time
Thinking about a future
Hemming it with a suture
Dog shitting on the sign could the head below be
mine
Remember the palms
Orange drive is where these palms lie
Making me sick
Making me want to get high under the palms.</field>

It's not my ballsac
I'm talkin about my dick
This shit is so wack
I cannot hold my piss
I drown myself in piss on my best friend's couch
I could not stop peeing on myself

You don't wanna hear these words
It's only gonna make it worse
You don't wanna live that curse
You're telling me to keep my hope
Cause you got a heart of gold
But maybe you should let me go
I love you through a periscope
You wear you heart so fearless
Its like it doesn't breath
You push away my demons when they torture me
Dont think that I can fight this pressure
Pulling me underneath
It's like I got the whole world
tied arround my feet
I don't wanna dive in first

I got pain in my mind and heart
I can never stop it once it starts
Something in the way, I could pull our charge
But only ever hurt myself
I got, I got problems
I got, I got problems
I know, I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
When I do, I put a scratch on the silver lining
If I'm being honest, I've been lying
I wanna tell the truth 'cause I'm sick of what
I'm hiding
I've always done what I want
I know, I've done my share of messing up

Stand up this is renegade music

A house in flames its not contained

But no one moves, they live by rules
That gives no options
They dont prevail, can tell no tales

Remember the girl
Abused with forks, knives, and razor blades?
She finally left him
Had enough of her man's rage
Band-aids covered her scars she left him bloodied
Beat his ass with a bat
Face sunk in like silly putty
Y'all can sit back so I could study
Destruction of the family design
And how the morals of society decline
Essentially it’s beats to rhyme like grapes to wine
It's alright
We're in love
Can't live with
Or without
You see she can't live with him
And can't live without him
Stress got her down she need to deal with the problem
As the drama gets deeper
I puff on the reefer
Took the last step and sent his ass to the reaper
Chaos, is what she saw in the mirror
Scared of herself and the power that was in her
It took over
And weighed heavy on her shoulder
Militant insanity is now what controlled her
It's alright
We're in love
Can't live with
Or without
It's alright
We're in love
Can't live with
Or without
We’re in love
We’re in love
Kill it before it reaches you
Missiles won't work it's approaching the mainland
What if it reaches the metropolitan areas?
Cosmopolitan areas
Secure the lines and prepare for departure
Calm, calm, calm,
It is a, a big business
And seems to be
Advancing underground
Cuz my style is yo, is underground
I'm green
With my red eyes mad tint
Flea fly flo
Rapido, rapido
She feeds plentiful
Electrifying the nation
Electrifying the nation!
Don't you see that we’re in danger?
How will we stop it?
She is attacking
Don't you see that we are in danger?
How will we stop it?
She is attacking
Sucka!
Danger danger!
Sucka!
Danger danger!
Sucka!
Danger danger!
Sucka!
Danger danger!
Running out
We’re running out
(Running out of time)
Running out
We’re running out

Running out
We’re running out

Running out
We’re running out
It's alright

Fire away!
I've lost control, Im blown away
I got shot down by the ricochet
Sold my soul, no escape
(Im running from the ricochet)
I wont let go, I'll sufocate
Live to die another day
No control
Im runnig from the ricochet
Im somewhere in between
The living and the dead
I've been so blind
That I can see where I've been led
I feel so hopeless
And Im tired of giving in
I"ll crucify myself to
Feel alive again
Hold!
Steady!
Aim!
Ready!
Load!
Fire away!
I've lost control, Im blown away
I got shot down by the ricochet
Sold my soul, no escape
(Im running from the ricochet)
I wont let go, I'll sufocate
Live to die another day
No control
Im runnig from the ricochet
I've lost control, Im blown away
I got shot down by the ricochet
Sold my soul, no escape
(Im running from the ricochet)
I wont let go, I'll sufocate
Live to die another day
Im runnig from the ricochet
Oh!
Running from the ricochet
Run from the ricochet</field>

I'm feeling like i can't do wrong
I'm thinking everything is fine
I'm caught up in the smokin mirrors
People that you think are your friends
Might be the people that want to drag you down
You've got to look out for yourself tonight
Don't get lost in the smokin' mirrors
Line after line, time after time
It's the same old sad story
He's lost- he's out of his fucking mind
It's the same old sad story
He's lost...
I'm trippin'
I'm over the edge
I'm falling and i got no wings
I'm praying, i'm making through tonight
I'm caught up in the smokin' mirrors
Living in a prison's cell I'm strung out in downtown hell
I'm looking for myself tonight
I got lost in the smokin' mirrors
Line after line, time after time
It's the same old sad story
He's lost- he's out of his fucking mind
It's the same old sad story

My weakness is that I care too much
My scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
Drunk and I'm feeling down
and I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home
Cause you channel all your pain
and I can't help to fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is
Chorus
I tear my heart open, I sow myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
Our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
I tried to help you once
A kiss will only advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand
Chorus
I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
and I just wanna be alone
You shouldn't ever come around
Why don't you just go home?
Cause you're drowning in the water
and I tried to grab your hand
and I left my heart open
but you didn't understand
but you didn't understand
Go fix yourself!!
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life

You set me off with every word you say
Talking down on me

You set me off with all the lies you told
Your shit is getting old
Why don't you sing a prayer
You set me off
You set me off
I'm against the wall, against the rest
I give it all, you got nothing left
You never stop, you never learn
You want to watch me crash and burn
But I won't take the fall
Crash and burn and lose it all
I'll rise above, rise against
I'll slay it all, it's self-defense
You set me off with every word you say

Wll this be amputation?

I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not!
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not!
Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
Until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say sometimes
She says she loves me not
I hesitate
To tell her i hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over
Line for line
Rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fightin' all the goddamn time
It's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid mad
On the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl
We're tearing up each other's world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's all right baby we can scream and shout
(Chorus)
Life's not fair!
Life's not fair!
I'm the jerk!
Life's not fair!
She loves me not!
Loves me not!</field>

Simple for my people to hear this
For my people
Silent in the dark
I think I'm nutty
With your swords of emotions
Slashing and leave me bloody
Now I'm trippin
My problems turn to battles
I'm up shit creek
And guess what with out a paddle
6 years of age
Is when I first got my rage
My father broke out
And then I turned a new page of my life
The change but then I was crazy
And thanks to my mom
Cuz she has stuck by
To raise me
I was fighting all the time
But with god help
Releasing all my tension
Through my knockin my hand
I'm coming out
I'm a freaked out cat
Coming out stony
And wet
Gonna be picking it up
For the boys who got slack in a band
Papa Roach four fingers
Of a hand
Retarded
Shut up n die
Shut up n die
I said you fucking die.</field>

Willing to make the change
Surrender the flesh and bones

Pushing beyond the limits of ourselves

We're losing our minds

Living forever

Flesh and blood, and broken bones
Burn away the sins
We all have our skeletons
We all have our skeletons
I have lost myself in my addictions
There's no faith in fear or self destruction
Falling out, falling down
And I'm crawling to you to confess my intentions
Suffer the violence, comfort in silence
Lost in self deception

Through my area when the darkness has fallen

They stab you in the back no shame that's right, what, what
I keep my distance cause they're makin me crazy
Stealin from me, you know those fuckers are lazy
My blood boils, fat turns to oil
Step the fuck back or you'll get buried in soil
Over trauma, or you could sleep with the fishes
My clutches are tight and I'll take your last wishes
One for your money
Two for your girl
Three for your life
Now I fucked up your world
Do you like how it feels
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills?
Do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
I don't like how it feels check it
Do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
Break it down
Yo, it's kinda funny how you're runnin your mouth man
You're caught in a lie and then there's no way out, come on
Betray your friends and your peeps and your family
Livin like a snake Livin like a bloody thief
Check my speech cuz it's deep like the sea
From me to y’all, and then from y’all back to me, Ha!
Danger danger, I slay snakes like a ranger
Military style fears god not a stranger
Now tell me, tell me who's crew’s sicker?
Mine's sicker, get on your knees you be a dick licker
One for your money
Two for your girl
Three for your life
Now I fucked up your world
Check it!

Father said that I best stop trying
Stand down it will be ok
You don't have to fight
There's a picture hanging on the wall

I don't want to make this hell my home
I would rather die than sell my soul
I would rather lie than let you go
There's a voice screaming in my head
Telling me that I best stop crying
Stand up it will be ok

Put yourself in my shoes, would you stand up for your rights?

Because I won't take this anymore (these walls)

There's a time to lead and a time to follow...
I see the walls are closing in and I feel I am in danger
My enemy is not alone, in the mirror there's a stranger
As I tried to break out my panic led to fear
Hopeless, I am alone, I'm afraid the end is near

            <field name="lyrics">I was young
And I was reckless, man
Moved out at seventeen
And made my momma mad
I thought I had it all figured out
A pocket full of pills
And a forty in my mouth
Peeled out in my big black Chevy
Flipped six times
And I knew that I was ready
To straighten up because my best friend died
I didn't wanna carry on living that life
And now Im running from the scene
Cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me everytime
And Im trying not to scream
But It's eating me alive
Im still hunted by the best years of
The best years of my life
Yeah, Let me take y'all back
I was young
And I was helpless, man
Self-medicating my own depression, man
I drank a bottle after breakfast
Took a look in the mirror
Riped the rosery of my neckless
Damn!
I lost my job, so I lost faith
I just saw a baby bump in my girl's waist
I need a drink to feel right
Party with my homies
To escape from real life
Yeah, we had it all figured out
A pocket full of pills
And a forty in my mouth
But, I never should've let
My best friend drive
Cause he's the reason my child
Will never see me alive
Damn!
Now Im running from the scene
Cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me everytime
And Im trying not to scream
But It's eating me alive
Im still hunted by the best years of
The best years of my life
All the sudden nothing matter's enymore
He lost it all
He's life was scattered on the floor
And now he's family trying
To pick up all the pieces
I am locked up in a box, I am a monster
Im the reason that he's gone
Wish I could take it all back
Press rewind and take a picture of the past
Pause it!
Feel my heart turn black
My lungs are smoldering
And Im breathing in the ash
Now Im running from the scene
Cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me everytime
And Im trying not to scream
But It's eating me alive
Im still hunted by the best years of
The best years of my life
Im still hunted by the best years of
The best years of my life
Im still hunted by the best years of</field>

because the best thing is life

i take fat hits
and i take fat shits
i cap on the girls
who give out 10$ thigh splits
yo all i want is respect
in this game
cause the papa roach style is wild
and not plain
know what i'm saying
put us through your speakers
cuz i know that we are banging
positivity and negativity
we saying that you
can't get the ying
without the yang
confidence and style
mix it up with some slang
and make it grimy
just like my little nigga stimey
step up was up
i came to make friends to the end
and back again
and show your stacks again
because sometimes i'm x-rated
sometimes i'm g-rated
sometimes i bugded crowds
act wild
and get faded
whether its monday
or tuesday
or thursday
or friday
i'm getting down
everyday
because its my way
to express the onion hardcore slang
a boogedy bang bang
boogedy bang bang

Can I even trust somebody
Cith the same last name, uh?
Tons of crazy people
Running from the light, ah
Bad decisions that could
Come around and bite ya
Wish I could write just a little less
Wish I could cry
End all the noise up inside my head
When it's over, it's over, it's over
It's over

I'm watching all the moves you make
Can't turn back now, it's too late
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending
I'm counting all of your mistakes
Caught up in a crossfire hurricane
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending

I did it, took a second, but I realized
I been looking for a reason just to sever ties
Only seeing what I wanna see
Got me questioning the things
That I started to believe
Paranoid from the drama in my life, uh
Trust issues make it hard to sleep at night, uh

I'm running from the enemy inside

It's not the TV screen
It's not my family
I'd still be damaged even if I grew up perfectly
It's something deep inside
Something I cannot explain
It's like I've got a disease without a fucking name
I think I've lost my way

I'm crying for help
I'm living a lie
I'd do anything

In and out of desire
I gotta love you I gotta have you
Don't want to let you down again
When I kiss you like a lover
That is when we discover
We are burning in the fire
This love will never tire
When I tell you that I need you
Please believe that I won't leave you
You're a diamond I'm a heart
Living in this house of cards
Fly around the fire
In and out of desire

I can't control myself
I kill the rhyme again
I'm coming sick and on time again
Words manifest from deep inside where people hide within
It's chemical unbalanced on the triple beam, what?
Fuck what you heard it's about what I seen
I seen it happen back hand brand to face smackin
Definite disorder now his mindset is blackened
The doctors say he got the brain of a murderer
This rugged style steals your brain
My heart is bleeding and this pain will not pass
It's not receding and my body's going numb
A bad trip child rolling stoned keeping high
He don't know what he's doing he just keep getting by
Thrown away
I want to be thrown away
He's born sick nothing in his hands but his dick
He couldn't handle pressure he couldn't handle shit
For the life he was leading led him down the wrong path
Where guns blast don't give a shit about the gods wrath
Don't want to talk to the counselor Doctor
To tell'em what's real, to tell'em what's proper
The situations unclear like gray and I know it gets worse everyday
My heart is bleeding and this pain will not pass
It's not receding and my body's going numb
A bad trip child rolling stoned keeping high
He don't know what he's doing he just keep getting by way
Thrown away
I want to be thrown away
I am a mess I've made a huge mess I can't control myself
I'm losing it I've lost it I've spilt all my marbles
(Aaaaahhhh!)
cause I see you inside of me sometimes I want to be thrown away
cause I see you inside of me sometimes I want to be thrown away
a hyper spaz and that is me sometimes I want to be thrown away
Thrown Away! Thrown Away! Thrown Away! Thrown Away!
Thrown Away! Thrown Away! Thrown Away! Thrown Away!
Voices in my head, voices in my head
Don't tell me to do it cause I will
No!
Don't tell me to do it cause I will
No!

I will tip-toe down that line, but
I will feel unstable

There is nothing to save me now, so
I will not look down
And again
And again
And again
And it happens again
And again
And again
Theres no beginning
There is no end
There is only change
Progression, backwards
Is this were we are heading?
Take back your soul
Forget your emptiness

Falling to the ground
Down to the ground
Yeah
I speak of madness, my heart and soul
I cry for people who aint got control
Lets take our sanity, lets take compassion
And be responsible for every action
Hell no
No how
Away, away, away no how

It doesn't matter if I am your best friend
I don't think so
You're not that smart
Over and over it breaks my heart
The cycle continues time for your crime
The pain comes back in an ugly design
Her makeup smears
The tears that she cries
Over and over every night
Emotional swords slash my soul
And now the pain takes control
I think about you
I think about me
I think about the way that it used to be
I need a bottle
I need some pills
I need a friend
I need some thrills
A shoulder to cry on a friend to depend on
When life gets rough
Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me
Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me
It's like a fight every single day
It's always easy when you have it your way
Deep in my heart
In the depths of my soul
My selfish ways are out of control
I'm sorry that it comes down to this
I punch through the wall as I break my fist
The makeup smears
Tears that we cry
Over and over every night
Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me
Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me
You're so selfish
You're making me want to end this relationship
You're making me want to end this
Loving ties unwind
Lost time behind
Loving ties unwind

Taking it back to a hardcore level

A love deprivation
I've got a jet black heart that's all fucked up and it's fallin apart

Woah!!! I'll never give in
Woah!!! I'll never give up
Woah!!! I'll never give in
And I just wanna be
Wanna be loved
I've got another confession, I fell to temptation
And there is no question, there was some connection
I've got to follow my heart no matter how far
I've gotta roll the dice, never look back, and never think twice

Woah!!! I'll never give in
Woah!!! I'll never give up
Woah!!! I'll never give in
And I just wanna be
Wanna be loved
Take the past, burn it up and let it go
Carry on I'm stronger than you'll ever know
That's the deal you get no respect
You're gonna get yours
You better watch your fucking neck /2x

I've got these secrets I keep
Is it obvious
They've got me down on my knees
Yeah, just let me go
I keep reliving the scene
Oh, it's so traumatic
Traumatic
There's a darkness inside
Of this crack headed mind
Locked inside this asylum I'm done
All my secrets are safe
So if you summon fate
Can you read through the lines on my tongue
You're playing broken records
It's like they're on repeat
I know those words you're singing
Before you even speak
I can see right where you are
You don't need to hide in the dark
Oh, it's so traumatic
I've got these secrets I keep
Is it obvious
They've got me down on my knees
Yeah, just let me go
I keep reliving the scene
Oh, it's so traumatic
Traumatic
Put me back in my cage
If I try to escape
I'm a countdown away from the truth
After all of these talks
Are you ready to stop?
With this twisted traumatic abuse?
You're playing broken records
It's like they're on repeat
I know those words you're singing
Before you even speak
I can see right where you are
You don't need to hide in the dark
I can see right where you are
You don't need to hide in the dark
Oh, it's so traumatic
Oh, it's so traumatic
Oh, it's so traumatic
Traumatic
Oh, it's so traumatic
I've got these secrets I keep
Is it obvious
They've got me down on my knees
Yeah, just let me go
I keep reliving the scene

Our culture has become complacent, and has no desire (take back, take back our empire), and the ethical slaughter of
truth needs to be retired, retired

It's the death of outrage!! I want to turn a new page!! I mourn the death of our age, the obituary's on the front page!!
Since the death of outrage, I want to turn a new page!! I mourn the death of our age, the obituary's on the front page,
it's the death of outrage, i mourn the death of our age, the obituary's on the front page

Had even one I believed
In one I believed that you were right
I'm so caught up
Caught up in a world that I cut you out of
Now I'm hating myself, I'm hating myself
I never should've shut you out
We are the walking dead
Swallow the lives we fed
Uncover your eyes, uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize
We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead
It might take some time
But I really think we could start things over
Take a look at our lives
Take a look at how fucked up we've become
In your blood-shut eyes
All I see is pain and devastation
And now I'm hating myself, I'm hating myself
I never should've shut you out
We are the walking dead
Swallow the lives we fed
Uncover your eyes, uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize
We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead
Can anything bring us back to life?
I'm ready to make us right
Can anything bring us back to life?
I'm ready to make us right
‘Cause further that we're falling apart
The more that it breaks my heart
We are the walking dead
Swallow the lives we fed
Uncover your eyes, uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize
We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead
Uncover your eyes, uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize
We are the walking dead
Swallow the lives we fed
Uncover your eyes, uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize

Digging through myself
I would die, die for you
I'd walk right through barbed wire
Good luck in your next life
Walk as tall as the trees
Be gentle as the spring winds
And have the warmth of the summer sun
Bloody faced, kissing death
Walking through barbed wire
I'll let you go, let me go
Digging through myself
I would die, die for you
I'd walk right through barbed wire
I blame myself for
Your death, it's tearing me apart
I would die, I die for you

Yes I would

I'm standing on the front lines
I'm fighting for my soul
I've walked the self-destructive lonely road
I read the warning signs but I was to blind to see
I had to feel the pain till I believed
I have a purpose
This is war, this is war
Since the day I was born
I would die just to live, just to bleed
I will fight for my life
Turn my darkness to light
This is war, its a war over me
War over me
War over me
My petty feeds destruction
My hunger turns to greed
But nothing ever fills this hole in me
No peace on the horizon
No peace in anything
I had to hurt myself till I believed
I have a purpose
This is war, this is war
Since the day I was born
I would die just to live, just to bleed
I will fight for my life
Turn my darkness to light
This is war, its a war over me
I'm caught up in the crossfire
I'm caught up in the pain
This gift of desperation
Is exactly what I need
I'm falling like an empire
I'm calling out your name
I'm locked in my own prison
Tell me help is on the way
Tell me help is on the way
I will fight for this life
Turn my darkness to light
This is war, its a war over me
This is war, this is war
Since the day I was born
I would die just to live, just to bleed
I will fight for my life
Turn my darkness to light
This is war, its a war over me
This is war, its a war over me
War over me

Illuminate our lives we are eternal
Denying in ahead a collision
We sacrifice ourselves for the mission

Madness coming
Surrounds me as im falling
Imagine if happens to all of us
It actually a felt like a gun on me
You I know I didn't last this long beeing (what?)
Anything less then a warrior
Average!
Savage!
Better that then
Has been part of me
We are the warriors!
We are the warriors!
We are the warriors!
To the right to the left so shine your light
So shine your light

Nobody ever taught me how to love
I'm hurting everybody I'm hurting myself
I'm desperate
So what do you do when it all comes down on you?
Do you run and hide or face the truth?
If you were to tell that i'd die today
This is what i'd have to say
I never really had the time to live
And if you were to give me just another chance
Another life, another dance
All I really want to do is love
I'm hurting everybody, I'm hurting myself
I'm desperate
So what do you do when it all comes down on you?
Do you run and hide or face the truth?
When all is said and done
You could be the one
With open arms and open eyes
Your jumping off the edge
And hoping you can fly
Accept ur fate for it is
Into the great unknow

Do you run and hide or face the truth?

I'd prey for mercy but I love the fear
I should have listened while the angels were living here

I gave you control
It feels I'm hanging at the end of my rope
I wanna believe that there is still hope
Now I'm hanging in the balance alone
Heaven better tell me where the hell did the angels go!
Every day I ask myself if this is real
I only hurt myself to show you that I can feel
Are you the cancer that I can survive
I should have listened when the angels were still alive
I'm sick to my soul
I gave you control
It feels I'm hanging at the end of my rope
I wanna believe that there is still hope
Now I'm hanging in the balance alone
I don't wanna be the last to know
Maybe I should breathe and let it go
Heaven better tell me where the hell did the angels go
My demons are stronger than ever
This lifetime is harder than ever
But I've become somebody better
Somebody better

As he stares deep into space, he knows he will be dying soon
He looks into the light, and realizes he really doesn't wanna die
He wants to live on, have some kids
As he lay on his patients bed, his family sitting around him
Looking at him, hoping for the best
But he cares less about them, and more about his friends
People around him who really matter, who really cared
So from that bottomless hole he climbed
Slowly, slowly outta that bottomless hole
He made some new friends and went to a rock show
Made a couple of enemies but made a few more friends,
felt a little better about himself
See thats the key, finding new friends
And feeling better about yourself,
and like my man Jerry said, "inside yourself"
I've sat down with this guy one day,
and these are his exact words ...</field>

Papa Roach
This is the moment that I've feared the most
Helplessly watching as return to ghosts
Is it over?
Tell me if it's over
This is the hardest thing I've ever done
Hopelessly waiting as you turn and run
Is it over?
Is it really over?
I promise you that I will change
Then I broke it in a million ways
I alone take the blame
While you take the pain
Why can't we stop this over?
What have we done to us?
You say that you need closure
I am just giving up on us
I refuse to fade away
As you're trying to forget me
Take my heart and walk away
Like you wish you never met me
Now that I know that you're not on my side
What good is love if it's always denied
Is it over?
Is it really over?
I swore to God that I could change
But I let you down a million ways
I alone take the blame
While you take the pain
Why can't we stop this over?
What have we done to us?
You say that you need closure
I am just giving up on us
I refuse to fade away
As you're trying to forget me
Take my heart and walk away
Like you wish you never met me
Like you wish you never met me
Like you wish you never met me
Like you wish you never met me
Do you wish you never met me?
Why can't we stop this over?
What have we done to us?
You say that you need closure
I am just giving up
Why can't we stop this over?
What have we done to us?
You say that you need closure
I am just giving up on us
I refuse to fade away
As you're trying to forget me
Take my heart and walk away
Like you wish you never met me
I refuse to fade away
As you're trying to forget me
Take my heart and walk away

Would you feel that this world is looking down upon you?
The only way you drop it in, you change, you kinda wanna

And It's okay if you break down and break through
I'll be here if you need me to remind you
You're not the first and you're not the last
It only gets worst if you're living in the past
Open your eyes and you will see
‘Cause I still believe sometimes you gotta lose everything
To find out that you've always been running blind
Gotta keep your head up with the world ‘round low
Sometimes you gotta leave everything
To find out what you'd do while I leave behind
You gotta keep your head up
When the world won't let up
So when you feel like everybody's out to get you
L-O-V-E and something will protect you
And when the dust settles in you'll have your breakthroughs
And you are til ER roll the fate
It will set you free, everybody like me
Just reach for the skies when you'll rise and you'll see
You're not the first and you're not the last
It only gets worst if you're living in the past
Open your eyes and you will see
‘Cause I still believe sometimes you gotta lose everything
To find out that you've always been running blind
You gotta keep your head up
When the world won't let up
Sometimes you gotta leave everything
To find out what you'd do while I leave behind
You gotta keep your head up
When the world won't let up
Hey hey even though it hurts like hell we have to bleed
Hey hey even when we fight for air we keep on breathing
Hey hey even if you lost yourself you still have me
Hey hey even if you hurt yourself but have no reason
I still believe it..
I still believe it..
I still believe it..
I still believe it..
Sometimes you gotta lose everything
To find out that you've always been running blind
You gotta keep your head up
When the world won't let up
Sometimes you gotta leave everything
To find out what you'd do while I leave behind
You gotta keep your head up
When the world won't let up
You gotta keep your head up
‘Cause the world won't let up
Keep your head up
You gotta keep you
You gotta keep your head up

Keep your head up
You gotta your head up

Kick out the demon that's living inside

You play your self loathing symphony

Dig out the stranger that's buried inside

Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall.
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
"You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still lady!"
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
(oof!)
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.
Parte 2
We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave us kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave us kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
"Wrong, Guess again! 2x
If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?
You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddie!"
Parte 3
I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No! Don't think I'll need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish
How I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here</field>

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move
but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Ok
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going, through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move
but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I have become comfortably numb</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run,
You missed the starting gun.
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun
But it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way
The time has gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells</field>

Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Standing in the aisle
With itchy feet and fading smile
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in, without a fight
Hey you
Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you
With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only, fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how hard he tried
he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain
Hey you
Out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you
Out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall</field>

You shone like the sun.
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on, you crazy diamond
You were caught in the crossfire
Of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target
For faraway laughter;
Come on you stranger, you legend,
You martyr, and shine
You reached for the secret
Too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Well, you wore out your welcome
With random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions;
Come on you painter, you piper,
You prisoner, and shine
Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Pile on many
More layers
And i'll be joining you there
Shine on, you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion,
And shine.</field>

Get a good job with more pay and you're okay.
Money, it's a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team.
Money, get back.
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit.
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet.
Money, it's a crime.
Share it fairly
but don't take a slice of my pie.
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today.
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
giving none away.

"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
"I was just telling him,
he couldn't get into number 2
He was asking
why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling and
screaming and telling him
why he wasn't coming up on freely.
It came as a heavy blow,
but we sorted the matter out"</field>

Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses real
A fatal attraction holding me fast how
Can I escape this irresistible grasp?
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings
I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul
Right through the roof of the night
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I</field>

Might like to go to the show.
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow.
Tell me is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise.

"Drop it, drop it on 'em! Drop it on them!!!!!"
The Thin Ice
Momma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too.
And the sea may look warm to you babe
And the sky may look blue
But ooooh Baby
Ooooh baby blue
Oooooh babe.
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet.
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice.
Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall.
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.

The Happiest Days of our Lives
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
"OOF!"
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town, it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.
Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)
We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
"Wrong, Do it again!"
"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding
How can you

Goodbye Blue Sky
"Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky"
Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the
promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?
Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all gone, but the pain lingers on.
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

To fill the empty spaces
Where we used to talk?
How shall I fill

How can I complete the wall
Young Lust
I am just a new boy,
Stranger in this town.
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman.
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl.
Will some cold woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oooh, baby set me free.
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman.
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl.

Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer?"

"Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?"
"This place is bigger than our apartment!"
"erm, Can I get a drink of water?"
"You want some, huh?"
"Oh wow, look at this tub? Do you wanna take baaaath?"
"What are watching?"
"Hello?"
"Are you feeling okay?..."
Day after day, love turns grey
Like the skin of a dying man.
Night after night, we pretend its all right
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder and
Nothing is very much fun any more.
And I can feel one of my turns coming on.
I feel cold as a razor blade,
Tight as a tourniquet,
Dry as a funeral drum.
Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favorite axe.
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase,
One of my bad days.
Would you like to watch T.V.?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would'ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?
Don't Leave Me Now
Ooooh, babe
Don't leave me now.
Don't say it's the end of the road.
Remember the flowers I sent.
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooooh Babe.
Dont leave me now.
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooooh Babe.
How could you treat me this way?
Running away.
I need you, Babe
Why are you running away?
Oooooh Babe!

"The Bulls are already out there"
Pink: "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrgh!"
"This Roman Meal bakery thought you'd like to know."
I don't need no arms around me
And I dont need no drugs to calm me.
I have seen the writing on the wall.
Don't think I need anything at all.
No! Don't think I'll need anything at all.
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall.
Goodbye Cruel World
Goodbye cruel world,
I'm leaving you today.
Goodbye,
Goodbye,
Goodbye.
Goodbye, all you people,
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind.
Goodbye.
Hey You
Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you, dont help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight.
Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with you ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home.
But it was only fantasy.
The wall was too high,
As you can see.
No matter how he tried,
He could not break free.
And the worms ate into his brainHey you, standing in the road
always doing what you're told,
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall,
Breaking bottles in the hall,
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall.

I've got a little black book with my poems in.
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in.
When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in.
I got elastic bands keepin my shoes on.
Got those swollen hand blues.
Got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V
to choose from.
I've got electric light.
And I've got second sight.
And amazing powers of observation.
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home.
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm.
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt.
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers.
I've got a silver spoon on a chain.
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains.
I've got wild staring eyes.
And I've got a strong urge to fly.
But I got nowhere to fly to.
Ooooh, Babe when I pick up the phone
"Surprise, surprise, surprise..."
There's still nobody home.
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
and I got fading roots.

Hello?
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?
Come on, now,
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.
I'll need some information first.
Just the basic facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
O.K.
Just a little pinprick.
There'll be no more aaaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's woring, good.
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown,
The dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.
The Show Must Go On
Ooooh, Ma, Oooh Pa
Must the show go on?
Ooooh, Pa
Take me home
Ooooh, Ma
Let me go
There must be some mistake
I didnt mean to let them
Take away my soul.
Am I too old, is it too late?
Ooooh, Ma, Ooooh Pa,
Where has the feeling gone?
Ooooh, Ma, Ooooh Pa,
Will I remember the songs?
The show must go on.
In The Flesh
So ya
Thought ya
Might like to
Go to the show.
To feel that warm thrill of confusion,
That space cadet glow.
I've got some bad news for you sunshine,
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you folks really stand.
Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall!
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me,
Get him up against the wall!
That one looks Jewish!
And that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint,
And another with spots!
If I had my way,
I'd have all of you shot!
Run Like Hell
"Pink Floyd, Pink Floyd"
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run,
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run.
You better make your face up in
Your favorite disguise.
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes.
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart.
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past.
With your nerves in tatters
When the conchshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down the door.
You'd better run.
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run,
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run.
You better sleep all day
And run all night.
Keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside.
And if you're taking your girlfriend
Out tonight
You'd better park the car
Well out of sight.
Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks,
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box.
You better run.
"Hey, open up! HaHaHaHaHaaaaaaaaaa!"
"Hammer, Hammer"
Waiting for the Worms
"Ein, zwei, drei, alle!"
Ooooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by.
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come.
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come.
We're {waiting to succeed} and going to convene outside Brixton
Town Hall where we're going to be...
Waiting to cut out the deadwood.
Waiting to clean up the city.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Waiting to put on a black shirt.
Waiting to weed out the weaklings.
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors.
Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Waiting to turn on the showers
And fire the ovens.
Waiting for the queers and the coons
and the reds and the jews.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms.
Would you like to send our colored cousins
Home again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms.
"The Worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station.
We'll be moving along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road
twelve minutes to three we'll be moving along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge.
Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge we're in
Westminster {Borough } area
It's quite possible we may encounter
some {.....} by the way we go
{..
..}."
Stop
Stop!
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform
And leave the show.
But I'm waiting in this cell
Because I have to know.
Have I been guilty all this time?
The Trial
Good morning, Worm your honor.
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature;
This will not do.
Call the schoolmaster!
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honor.
If they'd let me have my way I could
Have flayed him into shape.
But my hands were tied,
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder.
Let me hammer him today?
Crazy,
Toys in the attic I am crazy,
Truly gone fishing.
They must have taken my marbles away.
Crazy, toys in the attic he is crazy.
You little shit you're in it now,
I hope they throw away the key.
You should have talked to me more often
Than you did, but no! You had to go
Your own way, have you broken any
Homes up lately?
Just five minutes, Worm your honor,
Him and Me, alone.
Baaaaaaaaaabe!
Come to mother baby, let me hold you
In my arms.
M'lud I never wanted him to
Get in any trouble.
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honor, let me take him home.
Crazy,
Over the rainbow, I am crazy,
Bars in the window.
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in.
Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy.
The evidence before the court is
Incontrivertable, there's no need for
The jury to retire.
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving
Of the full penaltie of law.
The way you made them suffer,
Your exquisite wife and mother,
Fills me with the urge to defecate!
"Hey Judge! Shit on him!"
But, my friend, you have revealed your
Deepest fear,
I sentence you to be exposed before
Your peers.
Tear down the wall!
Outside the Wall
All alone, or in two's,
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall.
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands.
The bleeding hearts and artists
Make their stand.
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall.
"Isn't this where...."

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
(oof!)
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night,
their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.</field>

Don't be afraid to care.
Leave, but don't leave me.
Look around, and choose your own ground.
For long you live and high you fly,
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry,
All you touch and all you see,
Is all your life will ever be.
Run, rabbit run.
Dig that hole, forget the sun,
And when at last the work is done,
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one.
For long you live and high you fly,
But only if you ride the tide,
And balanced on the biggest wave,
You race towards an early grave.
1st Complement : (Time)
Home, home again,
I like to be here when I can...
When I come home cold and tired,
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.
Far away, across the field,
The tolling of the iron bell,
Calls the faithful to their knees,
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.

With your head down in the pig bin,
Saying "Keep on digging."
Pig stain on your fat chin.
What do you hope to find.
When you're down in the pig mine.
You're nearly a laugh,
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry.
Bus stop rat bag, ha ha charade you are.
You fucked up old hag, ha ha charade you are.
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass.
You're nearly a good laugh,
Almost worth a quick grin.
You like the feel of steel,
You're hot stuff with a hatpin,
And good fun with a hand gun.
You're nearly a laugh,
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry.
Hey you, Whitehouse,
Ha ha charade you are.
You house proud town mouse,
Ha ha charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street.
You're nearly a real treat,
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
You gotta stem the evil tide,
And keep it all on the inside.
Mary you're nearly a treat,

While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change
were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous
but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight..

Got to keep the loonies on the path.
The lunatic is in the hall.
The lunatics are in my hall.
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more.
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.
The lunatic is in my head.
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear.
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant tide
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine
And no one calls us to the land
And no one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and
Something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
And no one speaks
And no one tries
And no one flies around the sun
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Comes streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky</field>

when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly
and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had began
Along the long road and on down the causeway
Do they still meet there by the cut
There was a ragged band
that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures
trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder
Looking beyond the embers of bridges
glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder,
and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest that you've sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down alone
Dragged down by the stone.
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake of this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one had a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone</field>

Like paper doves in flight
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret,
Cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of gray
I woke to the sound of drums
The music played,
The morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitted residue slipped away...

You lock the door.
The book falls to the floor.
As darkness falls
The waves roll by,
The seasons change
The wind is wry.
Now wakes the owl
Now sleeps the swan
Behold the dream
The dream is gone.
Green fields, a cold rain
Is falling, near the golden dawn.
And deep beneath the ground,
The early morning sounds,
And I go down.
Sleepy time, and I lie,
With my love by my side,
And she's breathing low.
And I rise, like a bird,
In the haze, as the first rays
Touch the sky.

Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall.
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
"You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still lady!"
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
(oof!)
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.
Parte 2
We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave us kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave us kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
"Wrong, Guess again! 2x
If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?
You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddie!"
Parte 3
I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No! Don't think I'll need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall.</field>

Feeling good at the top
Shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
To meet the people
She's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
I love she
She loves me
See you (x3)
music
(fadely) apples and oranges (x5)
Thought you might like to know
I'm the lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the river side
feeding ducks in the afternoon tide

You can ride it if you like.
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good.
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it.
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.
I've got a cloak
It's a bit of a joke.
There's a tear up the front
It's red and black.
I've had it for months.
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.
I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.
I don't know why
I call him Gerald.
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.
I've got a clan of gingerbread men.
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.
Take a couple if you wish
They're on the dish.
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.
I know a room full of musical tunes.
Some rhyme, some ching
Most of them are clockwork.
Let's go into the other room and make them work..</field>

The lunatic is on the grass.
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs.
Got to keep the loonies on the path.
The lunatic is in the hall.
The lunatics are in my hall.
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more.
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.
The lunatic is in my head.
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear.
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

Don't be afraid to care.
Leave, but don't leave me.
Look around, and choose your own ground.
For long you live and high you fly,
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry,
All you touch and all you see,
Is all your life will ever be.
Run, rabbit run.
Dig that hole, forget the sun,
And when at last the work is done,
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one.
For long you live and high you fly,
But only if you ride the tide,
And balanced on the biggest wave,
You race towards an early grave.
1st Complement : (Time)
Home, home again,
I like to be here when I can...
When I come home cold and tired,
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.
Far away, across the field,
The tolling of the iron bell,
Calls the faithful to their knees,
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.

Moving on and changing sides.
Dreaming of a new day,
Cast aside the other way.
Magic visions stirring,
Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eyes.
The doorway stands ajar,
The walls that once were high.
Beyond the gilded cage,
Beyond the reach of ties.
The moment is at hand.
She breaks the golden band..</field>

Perhaps the price is just too steep.
Is your conscience at rest
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart.
Just one man beneath the sky,
Just two ears, just two eyes.
You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories.
Childhood's end, your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities.
And then as the sail is hoist,
You find your eyes are growing moist.
All the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice.
Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die
Beneath one infinite sky.
There'll be war, there'll be peace.
But everything one day will cease.
All the iron turned to rust;
All the proud men turned to dust.
And so all things, time will mend.
So this song will end..</field>

Waving to the river daughters,
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds.

The little minute gong
Coughs and clears his throat

Hey ho, never be still

Grasshoppers green herbarian band
And the tune they play is "in us confide"
So trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro'

Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

Isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood
Meant even less to me than I thought
With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed...
The madcap laughed at the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the talbot
The winds they blew and the leaves did wag
They'll never put me in their bag
The raging seas will always seep
So high you go, so low you creep
The wind it blows in tropical heat
The drones they throng on mossy seats
The squeaking door will always squeak
Two up, two down we'll never meet
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!
Sit up, touching hips
To a madcap galloping chase
"cheat" he cried shouting kangaroo
It's true in their tree they cried
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!
The madcap laughed at the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the talbot</field>

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move
but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Ok
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going, through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move
but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I have become comfortably numb</field>

While the days slipped by from my window watching
Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say
and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change
were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous
but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight..
into the shining sun</field>

Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red, and blue
He found it in the zoo.
Dear, dear were they really sad for me?

Mrs

Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain
He's never been the same
No one is to blame

Recieved his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the queen
His boots were very clean.

In the shadow under the trees
Down by a stream in a hollow
Turn your head feel the breeze
And the red Queen was waiting for the news
For the white King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight
They let him in by a backway
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read
Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
and this is what she told the gathered round
Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint take all the white
Make up a newborn colour
Cover your neighbor we'll be all right
There will be no game today, she cried across the board
Everyday will be a holiday
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad
And the Pink Queen sat
and smiled at the cat who smiled back.</field>

in a smile I saw a single eagle in the sky
wheeling, soaring, gliding high
On a hill there lived a man with many shining things
shiny gold, shiny car and shiny diamond rings
wining, dining, shining king
Now the eagle flies in clear blue skies
drinking in the clear blue well
back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies
but fifty more come rolling off the floor production line
Then a man commuting like a village on the sand
in his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land
screaming, dealing, movie man
Here we go, hold your breath to see if something blows
close your eyes, count till ten and see the sunrise rise
gliding high into the sky
By the holy mansion, let the guardian rise
upon the finger of the king
on high the eagle flies, that glitter all of gold
then wheeling in a cloudy sky, he flies into the sun.</field>

And the drop is shear and very high.
The ravens all are watching
From a vantage point nearby.
Apprehension creeping
Like a tube-train up your spine.
Will the tightrope reach the end?
Will the final couplet rhyme?
And it's high time,
Cymbaline.
It's high time,
Cymbaline.
Please wake me.
A butterfly with broken wings
Is falling by your side.
The ravens all are closing in
And there's nowhere you can hide.
Your manager and agent
Are both busy on the phone,
Selling coloured photographs
To magazines back home.
And it's high time
Cymbaline.
It's high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me
The lines converging where you stand,
They must have moved the picture plane.
The leaves are heavy around your feet.
You hear the thunder of the train.
And suddenly it strikes you
That they're moving into range.
Doctor Strange is always changing size;
And it's high time,

            <field name="lyrics">You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder,
and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest that you've sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down alone
Dragged down by the stone.
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake of this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one had a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone</field>

Engine taken from a 707
Sounds like showed the way to heaven
In his pocket, 5 pounds of lead
Skipped Bo Diddley from getting dead
Only thing that held Bo keeping alive
Was a snuff no sweating Wesson Colt 45
Well Bo drank gallons of rye and bourbon

Martini so dry the shaker burst
Bo killed on his sight, and died at first</field>

Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine
And no one calls us to the land
And no one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and
Something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
And no one speaks
And no one tries
And no one flies around the sun
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Comes streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky</field>

Merciless the magistrate turns 'round

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime.
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die.
Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long cold rest.
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye:
Eighty years, with luck, or even less.
So all aboard for the American tour,
And maybe you'll make it to the top.
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, 'cause I know
You may find it hard to get off.
You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son.
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole.
And everyone is still in the run.
And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime.
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself till you die.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">"Icy wind of night be gone
This is not your domain"
In the sky a bird was heard to cry.
Misty morning whisperings
And gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence
That lay all around.
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher
Flashing to the water.
And a river of green
Is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea.
In the lazy water meadow, I lay me down.
All around me golden sun flakes
Settle on the ground.
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon,
Bringing sounds of yesterday
Into this city room.
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher
Flashing to the water.
And a river of green
Is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea.
In the lazy water meadow, I lay me down.
All around me golden sun flakes
Settle on the ground.
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon,
Bringing sounds of yesterday
Into this city room.
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher
Flashing to the water.
And a river of green
Is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea.</field>

Shade my eyes and I can see you.
White is the light that shines trough the dress
That you wore.
She lay in the shadow of a wave.
Hazy were the visions overplayed.
Sunlight in her eyes,
But moonshine made her blind every time.
Green is the colour of her kind.
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind.
Envy is the bond between the hopeful
And the damned.</field>

You're gonna go far,
You're gonna fly high,
You're never gonna die,
You're gonna make it if you try;
They're gonna love you.
Well I've always had a deep respect,
And I mean that most sincerely.
The band is just fantastic,
that is really what I think.
Oh by the way, which one's Pink?
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy,
We call it Riding the Gravy Train.
We're just knocked out.
We heard about the sell out.
You gotta get an album out.
You owe it to the people.
We're so happy we can hardly count.
Everybody else is just green,
Have you seen the chart?
It's a helluva start,
It could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team.
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy,
We call it Riding the Gravy Train..</field>

Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Standing in the aisle
With itchy feet and fading smile
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in, without a fight
Hey you
Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you
With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only, fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how hard he tried
he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain
Hey you
Out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you
Out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Beyond the horizon of the place we lived
when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly
and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had began
Along the long road and on down the causeway
Do they still meet there by the cut
There was a ragged band
that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures
trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder
Looking beyond the embers of bridges
glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever</field>

I've lived every line that you wrote.
Take me down, take me down,
From the shelf above your head
And build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind.
I live where I'm left,
On the shelf like the rest.
And the epilogue reads like a sad song.
Please pick up your camera
And use me again.
And build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the storyline is kind

Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand
Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall!
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall!
That one looks Jewish!
And that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint
And another with spots!
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot!</field>

Reading all about the plane that’s landed
Upside down?
And no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say
It would be so nice......
To meet sometime
It would be so nice....
To meet sometime
Everybody cares about the weather
And everybody should know better
What a waste of time
Everybody lives beneath the ceiling
Living out a dream that sends them reeling
To a distant place
But no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say</field>

And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song.
I don't care if the sun don't shine
And I don't care if nothing is mine
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you
I'll do my loving in the winter.

And I love the queen

And what exactly is a joke?</field>

I can't seem to speak now

My words won't come out right

turn around on a chain

A fatal attraction holding me fast how
Can I escape this irresistible grasp?
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings
I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul
Right through the roof of the night
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted

The living soul of Hereward The Wake

Waiting there for me
The outer lock rolls slowly back

While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night
To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
because ther'll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door
Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over the door
So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just can't win</field>

An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
Gonna tap out the rhythm

Oh, go, little girl
I'm in love with you, Lucy
You got my heart, you got my heart, oh no
You tear me apart, you just won't let me go
You hold on so tight, so tight I just can't breathe
Now Lucy leave, Lucy
Leave when I ask you to leave, little girl
Please fall away from me, little girl
Yeah, go, little girl
See that I'm so broke up about you, Lucy
Yeah, girl</field>

His majesty was in command.
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showers silver on the people.
Oh Mother, tell me more.
Why'd'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They're scribbly black and everything shines.
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time.
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning.
Yes they did.
For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high on
Clouds of sunlight floating by.
Oh Mother, tell me more
Tell me more.
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah</field>

Get a good job with more pay and you're okay.
Money, it's a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team.
Money, get back.
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit.
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet.
Money, it's a crime.
Share it fairly
but don't take a slice of my pie.
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today.
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
giving none away.
"HuHuh! I was in the right!"
"Yes, absolutely in the right!"
"I certainly was in the right!"
"You was definitely in the right.
That geezer was cruising for a bruising!"
"Yeah!"
"Why does anyone do anything?"
"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
"I was just telling him,
he couldn't get into number 2
He was asking
why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling and
screaming and telling him
why he wasn't coming up on freely.
It came as a heavy blow,
but we sorted the matter out"</field>

When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in.
I got elastic bands keepin my shoes on.
Got those swollen hand blues.
Got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V
to choose from.
I've got electric light.
And I've got second sight.
And amazing powers of observation.
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home.
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm.
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt.
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers.
I've got a silver spoon on a chain.
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains.
I've got wild staring eyes.
And I've got a strong urge to fly.
But I got nowhere to fly to.
Ooooh, Babe when I pick up the phone
"Surprise, surprise, surprise..." (from Gomer Pyle show)
There's still nobody home.
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
and I got fading roots.</field>

I used to read books but.....
It could be the news
Or some other abuse
Or it could be reusable shows.
Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Got to compete with the wily Japanese.
No need to worry about the Vietnamese.
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees.
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear.
Maybe the Swedes.
We showed Argentina
Now let's go and show these.
Make us feel tough

And the words they say
Which we won't understand
"Don't accept that what's happening
Is just a case of others' suffering
Or you'll find that you're joining in
The turning away"
It's a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting it's shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we're all alone
In the dream of the proud
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
And mesmerised as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night
No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It's not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there'll be
No more turning away?</field>

Day after day, love turns grey
Like the skin of a dying man.
Night after night, we pretend its all right
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder and
Nothing is very much fun any more.
And I can feel one of my turns
Coming on.
I feel cold as a razor blade,
Tight as a tourniquet,
Dry as a funeral drum.
Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favorite axe.
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase,
One of my bad days.
Would you like to watch T.V.?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would'ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?</field>

A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend
I will, I will she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I lead the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won't forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight
Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you will never forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight</field>

Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
Drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink
What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been
Far away
Away - away - away - away - away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget
The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do - I can't think what to say
She sees through anyway
Away - away - away - away - away
Out of the front door I go
Traffic's moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be
Be - a - be - a - be - a - be - a - be
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget.</field>

Behind paranoid eyes.
You put on your brave face
And slip over the road for a job.
Fixing your grin
As you casually lean on the bar.
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world
With the boys in the crowd.
You can hide, hide, hide
Behind petrified eyes.
You believed in their stories of fame,
Fortune and glory.
Now you're lost in a haze
Of alcohol soft middle age.
The pie in the sky
Turned out to be miles too high.
And you're hide, hide, hide
Behind brown and mild eyes.</field>

You radiate cold shafts of broken glass.

Almost worth a quick grin.

You're hot stuff with a hatpin,
And good fun with a hand gun.

And do you feel abused?
You gotta stem the evil tide,
And keep it all on the inside.

Jumps into his cosmic flyer
Pulls his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand well back, he cried
This is my last goodbye
Point me at the sky and let it fly
And if you survive 'till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe in
People pressing on my sides is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate
Point me at the sky and let it fly

Without the morning's kiss
Queen - you shall be it if you wish
Look for your king
Why can't we play today
Why can't we stay that way
Climb your favorite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother's gun
Dream yourself away
Why can't we reach the sun
Why can't we blow the years away
Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember.</field>

In your favorite disguise,
With your button-down lips,
And your roller blind eyes.
With your empty smile,
And your hungry heart,
Feel the bile rising,
From your guilty past.
With your nerves in tatters,
As the cockleshell shatters,
And the hammers batter,
Down your door,
You better run.
You better run all day,
And run all night.
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside.
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight,
You better park the car well out of sight.
Cause if they catch you in the back seat,
Trying to pick her locks,
They're gonna send you back to Mother,
In a cardboard box.
You better run!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">As I reach for a peach
Slide a rind down behind the sofa in San Tropez.
Breakin' a stick with a brick on the sand.
Ridin' a wave in the wake of an old sedan.
Sleepin' alone in the drone of the darkness,
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love,
Deep in my dreams
and I still hear her callin'
"If you're alone, I'll come home."
Backward and homebound,
The pigeon, the dove,
Gone with the wind
And the rain, on an airplane.
Owning a home with no silver spoon,
I'm drinking champagne
Like a good tycoon.
Sooner than wait for
A break in the weather,
I'll gather my far-flung thoughts together.
Speeding away on the wind to a new day.
And if you're alone
I'll come home.
And I pause for a while
By a country style
And listen to the things they say.
Diggin' for gold
With a hoe in my hand.
Open a book
Take a look at the way things stand.
And you're leading me down
To the place by the sea.
I hear your soft voice
Calling to me.
Making a date for later by phone
And if you're alone
I'll come home.</field>

His head did no thinking his arms didn't move
Except when the wind cut up rough
And mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he's resigned to his fate
'Cause life's not unkind
He doesn't mind
He stood in a field where barley grows.</field>

Picking up his sister, he makes his way in to the see-saw land
All the way she smiles.
She goes up while he goes down, down.
Sits on a stick in the river.
Laughter in his sleep.
Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit.
He doesn't know, so then,
She goes up while he goes down, down.
Another time, another day.
A brother's way to leave
Another time, another day
She'll be selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon.
Picking up weeds, she hasn't got the time to care.
All can see he's not there.
She grows up for another man, and he's down.
Another time, another day.

Morning to birth is born into shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his questions to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening

In the grassland away;
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air.
You better watch out,
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem.
What do you get for
pretending the danger's not real.
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors
into the valley of steel.
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes.
Now things are really what they seem.
No, this is no bad dream.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green
He leadeth me the silent waters by.
With bright knives He releaseth my soul.
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places.
He converteth me to lamb cutlets,
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger.
When cometh the day we lowly ones,
Through quiet reflection
And great dedication,
Master the art of karate,
Lo, we shall rise up,
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.
Bleating and babbling
I fell on his neck with a scream.
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of
Obscurity, into the dream.
Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told.
Get out of the road if you want to grow old.</field>

Blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target
For faraway laughter;
Come on you stranger, you legend,
You martyr, and shine
You reached for the secret
Too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Well, you wore out your welcome
With random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions;
Come on you painter, you piper,
You prisoner, and shine
Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Pile on many
More layers
And i'll be joining you there
Shine on, you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion,

Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers,
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise
He's chained forever to a world that's departed
It's not enough, it's not enough
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river rolls
It's not enough it's not enough
His hand has faltered
...
...
......
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words,
Of promises broken</field>

To sheath the sacrificial knifes.
But now
She stands upon Southampton dock.
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock,
Clings to her wet body in the rain.
In quiet desperation knuckles
White upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again.
And still the dark stain spreads between
His shoulder blades.
A mute reminder
Of the poppy fields and graves.
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made.
But in the bottom of our hearts
We felt the final cut.</field>

We met just six hours ago,
The music was too loud.
From your bed I gained a day
And lost a bloody year.
And I would like to know
How do you feel? (x3)
Not a single word was said,
Delights still without fears
Occasionally you showed a smile
But what was the need?
I felt the cold far too soon - the wind of '95
My friends are lying in the sun,
I wish that I was there.
Tomorrow brings another town
And another girl like you.
Have your time before you leave
To greet another man
Just you let me know
How do you feel? (x3)
Good-bye to you...

heading from the fire to his waiting canoe.
Chattering Squaw untied the wigwam door,
the chief blew smoke rings two by two!
The land in silence stands...
Swan Lee, his boat by the bank in the darkness,
loosened the rope in the creek is entwined.
A feather from the wing of a wild young eagle,
pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find
The land in silence stands
Swan Lee paddled on from the land of his fathers,
his eyes scanned the undergrowth on either side.
From the shore hung a hot, heavy, creature infested
tropic, Swan Lee had a bow by his side
The land in silence stands
Swan Lee kept time, half on land, half on water,
Grizzly bear and raccoon his fare.
He followed his ears to the great water fall,
Swan Lee knew deep down that his squaw was there!
The land in silence stands....
Suddenly the rush of the mighty great thunder,
confronted Swan Lee as his song he sang,
In the dawn, with his squaw, he was battling homewards
It was all written down by Long Silas Lang.
The land in silence stands...
The land in silence stands...
The land in silence stands..</field>

I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness; and the earth was on fire
She could take it back, she might take it back some day
So I spy on her, I have lied to her,
I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me,
I take all that I can take
And I push her to the limit to see if she will break
She might take it back, she could take it back some day
Now I had seen the warnings, screaming from all sides
It's easy to ignore them God knows I've tried
All of this temptation,
you know it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn't see the danger or hear the rising tide
She Could take it back, she will take it back some day
She Could take it back, she will take it back some day
She will take it back; She will take it back some day</field>

I'm in bed
Achin' head
Gold is lead
Choke on bread
Underfed
Gold is lead
Jesus bled
Pain is red
Are goon
Grow go
Greasy spoon
You swoon
June bloom
Music seems to help the pain
Seems to cultivate the brain.
Doctor kindly tell your wife that
I'm alive - flowers thrive - realize - realize
Realize.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Breathe
Breathe, breathe in the air.
Don't be afraid to care.
Leave but don't leave me.
Look around and choose your own ground.
Long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be.
Run, rabbit run.
Dig that hole, forget the sun,
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave.
On The Run
[female announcer, announcing flights at airport]
"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me,
HaHaHaaaaaa!"
Time/Breathe Reprise
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for soemone or something to show you the way.
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch
the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to
kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind
you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting
gun.
So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but
it'ssinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're
older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the
time.
Plans that either come to nought or half a page of
scribbledlines
Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.
Breath Reprise
Home, home again.
I like to be here when I can.
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.
The Great Gig in the Sky
"And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do,
I
don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime."
"I never said I was frightened of dying."
Money
Money, get away.
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay.
Money, it's a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team.
Money, get back.
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit.
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet.
Money, it's a crime.
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today.
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that
they're
giving none away.
"HuHuh! I was in the right!"
"Yes, absolutely in the right!"
"I certainly was in the right!"
"You was definitely in the right
That geezer was
cruising for abruising!"
"Yeah!"
"Why does anyone do anything?"
"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
"I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number
2
He wasasking
why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling
and
screaming and telling him why he wasn't coming up on
freely.
It came as a heavy blow, but we sorted the matter out"

Us and Them
Us, and them
And after all we're only ordinary men.
Me, and you.
God only knows it's noz what we would choose to do.
Forward he cried from the rear
and the front rank died.
And the general sat and the lines on the map
moved from side to side.
Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who.
Up and down.
But in the end it's only round and round.
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried.
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside.
"I mean, they're not gunna kill ya, so if you give 'em
a quickshort,
sharp, shock, they won't do it again
Dig it? I mean
he get off
lightly, 'cos I would've given him a thrashing - I
only hit himonce!
It was only a difference of opinion, but really...I
mean goodmannersdon't cost nothing do they, eh?"
Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about.
With, without.
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind.
For the want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died.
Any Colour You Like

Brain Damage
The lunatic is on the grass.
The lunatic is on the grass.
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs.
Got to keep the loonies on the path.
The lunatic is in the hall.
The lunatics are in my hall.
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more.
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.
The lunatic is in my head.
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear.
And if the band you're in starts playing different
tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.
"I can't think of anything to say except..."
"I think it's marvellous! HaHaHa!"
Eclipse
All that you touch
All that you see
All that you taste
All you feel.
All that you love
All that you hate
All you distrust
All you save.
All that you give
All that you deal
All that you buy,
beg, borrow or steal.
All you create
All you destroy
All that you do
All that you say.
All that you eat
everyone you meet
All that you slight
everyone you fight.
All that is now
All that is gone
All that's to come
and everything under the sun is in tune
but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.
"There is no dark side of the moon really
Matter of
fact it'sall dark."</field>

What Do You Want From Me
As you look around this room tonight
Settle in your seat and dim the lights
Do you want my blood, do you want my tears
What do you want
What do you want from me
Should I sing until I can't sing any more
Play these strings till my fingers are raw
You're so hard to please
What do you want from me
Do you think that I know something you don't know
What do you want from me
If I don't promise you the answers would you go
What do you want from me
Should I stand out in the rain
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you
I'm not the one you need
What do you want from me
You can have anything you want
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water
Anything you want
You can own everything you see
Sell your soul for complete control
Is that really what you need
You can lose yourself this night
See inside there is nothing to hide
Turn and face the light
What do you want from me
Poles Apart
Did you know..
it was all going to go so wrong for you
And did you see it was all going to be so right for me
Why did we tell you then
You were always the golden boy then
And that you'd never lose the light in your eyes
Hey you..
did you ever realize what you'd become
And did you see that it wasn't only me
you were running from
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes
The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you and the years
and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know...
I never thought that you'd lose the light in your eyes
Marooned
A Great Day for Freedom
On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised
a cry for freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret,
cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their blooded hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey
I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residue slipped away..
slipped away
Wearing the Inside Out
From morning to night I stayed out of sight
Didn't recognise I'd become
No more than alive I'd barely survive
In a word..
overrun
Won't hear a sound (He's curled into the corner)
From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)
I've spent too long (With and endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out (..
curse the place)
My skin is cold (In a sea of random images)
To the human touch (The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart's
(Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much
I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don't even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile
I'm creeping back to life
My nervous system all awry
I'm wearing the inside out
Look at him now
He's paler somehow
But he's coming around
He's starting to choke
It's been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth
And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again
I'm holding out (He's standing on the threshold)
For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds
(And hurled into the furnace he'll)
Have blown away (..
curse the place)
I'm with you now
(He's torn in all directions)
Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)
Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)
Ourselves again
Take it Back
Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness, t
he earth was on fire
She could take it back
he might take it back some day
So I spy on her, I lie to her,
I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me,
I take all that I can take
And I push her to the limit to see if she will break
She might take it back,
she could take it back some day
Now I have seen the warnings,
screaming from all sides
It's eay to ignore them and G-d knows I've tried
All of this temptation, it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn't see the danger
or hear the rising tide
She can take it back, she will take it back some day
She can take it back, she will take it back some day
She will take it back, she will take it back some day
Coming Back to Life
Where were you when I was burned and broken
While the days slipped by from my window watching
Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say
and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous
but irresistable pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight..
into the shining son
Keep Talking
For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happened
which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk
There's a silence surrounding me
I can't seem to think straight
I'll sit in the corner
No one can bother me
I think I should speak now
(Why won't you talk to me)
I can't seem to speak now (You never talk to me)
My words won't come out right
(What are you thinking)
I feel like I'm drowning
(What are you feeling)
I'm feeling weak now
(Why won't you talk to me)
But I can't show my weakness
(You never talk to me)
I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking)
Where do we go from here (What are you feeling)
It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do
is make sure we keep talking
Why won't you alk to me
(I feel like I'm drowning)
You never talk to me
(You know I can't breathe now)
What are you thinking
(We're going nowhere)
What are you feeling
(We're going nowhere)
Why won't you talk to me
You never talk to me
What are you thinking
Where do we go from here
It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do
is make sure we keep talking
Lost for Words
I was spending my time in the doldrums
I was caught in a cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralysed
I thought that everythign else would just wait
While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision, reality fades
Like shadows into the night
To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
Because there'll be no safety in numbers
When the Right One walks out of the door
Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over your door
So I opened my door to my enemies
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just can't win
High Hopes
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived
when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed
constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut?
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took
our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures
trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights
of that dreamed of world
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever</field>

With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather 'round and haggle
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
Even our masters don't know the web we weave
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ..
One world
Invisible transfers, long distance calls,
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ..
One world
The dogs of war don't negotiate
The dogs of war won't capitulate,
They will take and you will give,
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door,
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain.
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ..

Of tear stained eyes
I can barely define
The shape of this moment in time.
And far from flying high
In clear blue skies.
I'm spiralling down
To the hole in the ground where I hide.
If you negotiate
The minefield in the drive,
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold
Electronic eyes.
And if you make it
Past the shotgun in the hall,
Dial the combination, open the priesthole,
And if I'm in I'll tell you
What's behind the wall.
There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines.
He wonders if you're sleeping
With your young found faith.
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?
And if I show you my dark side,
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings,
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but
Just then the phone ring
I never had the nerve to make the final cut.
"Hello? Listen, I think I've got it.
Okay, listen its a Haha!"</field>

They can polish their medals
And sharpen their smiles,
And amuse themselves playing games for awhile.
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead.
Safe in the permanent gaze
Of a cold glass eye.

A gnome named Grimble Crumble.
And little gnomes stay in their homes.
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine.
He wore a scarlet tunic,
A blue green hood,
It looked quite good.
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass
Fresh air at last.
Wining, dining, biding his time.
And then one day - hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Oooooooooomray.
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Winding, finding places to go.
And then one day - hooray!

I don't care if we get there on time.
Everybody's searching for something, they say.
I'll get my kicks on the way.
Over the mountains, across the seas
Who knows what will be waiting for me?
I could sail forever
To straits unnamed.
Faces of people and places don't change.
All I have to do
Is just close my eyes
To see the seagulls wheeling
In the far distant skies.
All I want to tell you,
All I want to say
Is count me in on the journey,
Don't expect me to stay.</field>

In the space between the heavens
and in the corner of some foreigh field
I had a dream.
I had a dream.
Goodbye Max.
Goodbye Ma.
After the service when you're walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold november air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream.
A place to stay
"Oi! A real one ..."
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And whats more no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door.
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no-one kills the children anymore.
And no one kills the children anymore.
Night after night
Going round and round my brain
His dream is driving me insane.
In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight.
What's done is done.
We cannot just write off his final scene.
Take heed of his dream.
Take heed.</field>

(oof!)
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night,
their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.</field>

Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape.
When I was their age all the lights went out.
There was no time to whine or mope about.
And even now part of me flies over
Dresden at Angels One Five.
Though they'll never fathom it behind my
Sarcasm desperate memories lie.
Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep? Good.
'Cause that's the only time
That I can really speak to you.
And there is something that I've locked away.
A memory that is too painful
To withstand the light of day.
When we came back from the war the banners and
Flags hung on everyone's door.
We danced and we sang in the street and
The church bells rang.
But burning in my heart
My memory smoulders on
Of the gunners dying words
On the intercom.</field>

The darkness in the North
Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before
But if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way
Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know, the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way
Pull your thoughts back many years
To the time when there was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the light will be as clear as on that morning
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you

Close your ears and eyes, be on your way</field>

When I saw the lady smile.
I would take her out for a while,
For a while.
Oh, my tears wept like a child.
How her golden hair was blowing wild.
Then she spread her wings to fly,
For to fly.
Soaring high above the breezes,
Going always where she pleases.
She will make it to the islands in the sun.
I will follow in her shadow
As I watch her from my window.
One day I will catch her eye.
She is calling from the deep,
Summoning my soul to endless sleep.
She is bound to drag me down,
Drag me down.</field>

His arms didn't move except when the wind cut up
Rough and mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows.

But now he's resigned to his fate

Good morning, Worm your honor.
The crown will plainly show
the prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings,
Showing feelings of an almost human nature.
This will not do.
Call the schoolmaster!
Schoolmaster
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honor.
If they'd let me have my way I could
Have flayed him into shape.
But my hands were tied,
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today?

Crazy,
Toys in the attic I am crazy,
Surly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away

You little shit your in it, now
I hope they throw away the key.
You should have talked to me more often
Than you did, but no! You had to go
Your own way, have you broken any
Homes up lately?
Just five minutes, Worm your honor,
Him and Me, alone.
Mother
Baaaaaaaaaabe!
Come to mother baby, let me hold you
in my arms.
M'lud I never wanted him to
get in any trouble.
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honor, let me take him home.

Crazy,
Over the rainbow, I am crazy,
Bars in the window.
There must have been a door there in the wall
when I came in.

The evidence before the court is
Incontrovertible, there's no need for
the jury to retire.
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving
Of the full penalty of law.
The way you made them suffer,
Your exquisite wife and mother,
Fills me with the urge to defecate!
"Hey Judge! Shit on him!"
Since, my friend, you have revealed your
Deepest fear,
I sentence you to be exposed before
Your peers.

Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?

The Happiest Days of our Lives
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
"OOF!"
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town, it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.
Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)
We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

Mother will they put me in the firing line?
Mother is it just a waste of time?
Hush now baby, baby, dont you cry.
Mother's gonna make all your nightmares come true.
Mother's gonna put all her fears into you.
Mother's gonna keep you right here under her wing.
She wont let you fly, but she might let you sing.
Mama will keep baby cozy and warm.
Ooooh baby ooooh baby oooooh baby,
Of course mama'll help to build the wall.
Mother do you think she's good enough -- to me?
Mother do you think she's dangerous -- to me?
Mother will she tear your little boy apart?
Mother will she break my heart?
Hush now baby, baby dont you cry.
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you.
Mama wont let anyone dirty get through.
Mama's gonna wait up until you get in.
Mama will always find out where you've been.
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean.
Ooooh baby oooh baby oooh baby,
You'll always be baby to me.
Mother, did it need to be so high?
Goodbye Blue Sky
"Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky"
Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the
promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?
Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all gone, but the pain lingers on.
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

Make me feel like a real man?

Day after day, love turns grey
Like the skin of a dying man.
Night after night, we pretend its all right
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder and
Nothing is very much fun any more.
And I can feel one of my turns coming on.
I feel cold as a razor blade,
Tight as a tourniquet,
Dry as a funeral drum.
Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favorite axe.
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase,
One of my bad days.
Would you like to watch T.V.?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would'ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?
Don't Leave Me Now
Ooooh, babe
Don't leave me now.
Don't say it's the end of the road.
Remember the flowers I sent.
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooooh Babe.
Dont leave me now.
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooooh Babe.
How could you treat me this way?
Running away.
I need you, Babe
Why are you running away?
Oooooh Babe!

And I dont need no drugs to calm me.

Don't think I need anything at all.
No! Don't think I'll need anything at all.

All in all you were all just bricks in the wall.
Goodbye Cruel World
Goodbye cruel world,
I'm leaving you today.
Goodbye,
Goodbye,
Goodbye.
Goodbye, all you people,
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind.
Goodbye.
Hey You
Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you, dont help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight.
Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with you ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home.
But it was only fantasy.
The wall was too high,
As you can see.
No matter how he tried,
He could not break free.
And the worms ate into his brainHey you, standing in the road
always doing what you're told,
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall,
Breaking bottles in the hall,
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall.

When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in.
I got elastic bands keepin my shoes on.
Got those swollen hand blues.
Got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V
to choose from.
I've got electric light.
And I've got second sight.
And amazing powers of observation.
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home.
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm.
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt.
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers.
I've got a silver spoon on a chain.
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains.
I've got wild staring eyes.
And I've got a strong urge to fly.
But I got nowhere to fly to.
Ooooh, Babe when I pick up the phone
"Surprise, surprise, surprise..."
There's still nobody home.
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
and I got fading roots.

Hello?

Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?
Come on, now,
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.
I'll need some information first.
Just the basic facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
O.K.
Just a little pinprick.
There'll be no more aaaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's woring, good.
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown,
The dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.
The Show Must Go On
Ooooh, Ma, Oooh Pa
Must the show go on?
Ooooh, Pa
Take me home
Ooooh, Ma
Let me go
There must be some mistake
I didnt mean to let them
Take away my soul.
Am I too old, is it too late?
Ooooh, Ma, Ooooh Pa,
Where has the feeling gone?
Ooooh, Ma, Ooooh Pa,
Will I remember the songs?
The show must go on.
In The Flesh
So ya
Thought ya
Might like to
Go to the show.
To feel that warm thrill of confusion,
That space cadet glow.
I've got some bad news for you sunshine,
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you folks really stand.
Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall!
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me,
Get him up against the wall!
That one looks Jewish!
And that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint,
And another with spots!
If I had my way,
I'd have all of you shot!
Run Like Hell
"Pink Floyd, Pink Floyd"
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run,
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run.
You better make your face up in
Your favorite disguise.
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes.
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart.
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past.
With your nerves in tatters
When the conchshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down the door.
You'd better run.
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run,
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run.
You better sleep all day
And run all night.
Keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside.
And if you're taking your girlfriend
Out tonight
You'd better park the car
Well out of sight.
Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks,
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box.
You better run.
"Hey, open up! HaHaHaHaHaaaaaaaaaa!"
"Hammer, Hammer"
Waiting for the Worms
"Ein, zwei, drei, alle!"
Ooooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by.
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come.
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come.
We're {waiting to succeed} and going to convene outside Brixton
Town Hall where we're going to be...
Waiting to cut out the deadwood.
Waiting to clean up the city.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Waiting to put on a black shirt.
Waiting to weed out the weaklings.
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors.
Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Waiting to turn on the showers
And fire the ovens.
Waiting for the queers and the coons
and the reds and the jews.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms.
Would you like to send our colored cousins
Home again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms.
"The Worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station.
We'll be moving along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road
twelve minutes to three we'll be moving along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge.
Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge we're in
Westminster {Borough } area
It's quite possible we may encounter
some {.....} by the way we go
{..

Stop
Stop!
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform
And leave the show.
But I'm waiting in this cell
Because I have to know.
Have I been guilty all this time?
The Trial
Good morning, Worm your honor.
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature;
This will not do.
Call the schoolmaster!
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honor.
If they'd let me have my way I could
Have flayed him into shape.
But my hands were tied,
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder.
Let me hammer him today?
Crazy,
Toys in the attic I am crazy,
Truly gone fishing.
They must have taken my marbles away.
Crazy, toys in the attic he is crazy.
You little shit you're in it now,
I hope they throw away the key.
You should have talked to me more often
Than you did, but no! You had to go
Your own way, have you broken any
Homes up lately?
Just five minutes, Worm your honor,
Him and Me, alone.
Baaaaaaaaaabe!
Come to mother baby, let me hold you
In my arms.
M'lud I never wanted him to
Get in any trouble.
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honor, let me take him home.
Crazy,
Over the rainbow, I am crazy,
Bars in the window.
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in.
Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy.
The evidence before the court is
Incontrivertable, there's no need for
The jury to retire.
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving
Of the full penaltie of law.
The way you made them suffer,
Your exquisite wife and mother,
Fills me with the urge to defecate!
"Hey Judge! Shit on him!"
But, my friend, you have revealed your
Deepest fear,
I sentence you to be exposed before
Your peers.
Tear down the wall!
Outside the Wall
All alone, or in two's,
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall.
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands.
The bleeding hearts and artists
Make their stand.
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall.
"Isn't this where...."

            <field name="lyrics">Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run,
You missed the starting gun.
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun
But it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way
The time has gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells</field>

The sun is going down.
Sinking behind bridges in the road.
And I think of all the good things
That we have left undone.
And I suffer premonitions,
Confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come.
The rusty wire that holds the cork
That keeps the anger in
Gives way and suddenly it's day again.
The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done.
Two suns in the sunset
Hmmmmmmmmmm
Could be the human race is run?
Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slied towards the big truck
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear.
"Oh no!"
And you'll never hear their voices
"Daddy, Daddy!"
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore.
And as the windshield melts
My tears eveaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend.
Finally I understand the feelings of the few.
Ashes and diamonds
Foe and friend
We were all equal in the end.
"...and now the weather.
Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers
spreading from the east ..
with an expected
high of 4000 degrees Celsius..."</field>

And after all we're only ordinary men
Me, and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
Forward he cried from the rear
and the front rank died
And the general sat and the lines on the map
moved from side to side
Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round..
and round
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside
"I mean, they're not gunna kill ya
so if you give 'em a quick short
sharp, shock, they won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off
lightly, 'cos I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
but really..
I mean good manners
don't cost nothing do they, eh? "
Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of a tea and a slice
The old man died</field>

Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man how are you?
So I've changed my dear, and I find my knees,
And I covered them up with the latest cut,
And my pants and socks all point in a box,
They don't make long of my nylon socks,
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole,
And all the lot is what I got,
It's what I wear, it's what you see,
It must be me, it's what I am,
Vegetable man.
I've been looking all over the place for a place for me,
But it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere.
Vegetable man, vegetable man,
He's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can,

Ooooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by.
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come.
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come.
We're {waiting to succeed}
And going to convene outside Brixton
Town Hall where we're going to be...
Waiting to cut out the deadwood.
Waiting to clean up the city.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Waiting to put on a black shirt.
Waiting to weed out the weaklings.
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors.
Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Waiting to turn on the showers
And fire the ovens.
Waiting for the queens and the coons
and the reds and the jews.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms.
Would you like to send our colored cousins
Home again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms.
All you have to do is follow the worms.
The Worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station.

love, my love, got no care
no care, no, no, pressing my feet to the ground
stand up right where you stand
call to you and what do you do
laying back in a chair?
she's so high on the air
she's so high on the air
half and half, half and half
all you have to do to call
is hold her hand, stand a while
and then smile and we'll understand
yes we do - yes, yes we do!
Oh what a girl I've got too!
Oh what a girl I've got too!
with her slinky look she held her tie to her hair
(and I) could see everywhere
no-one in the land, no-one
no-one in the land, no-one
but it rains on Saturday - cats and dogs in the way
stormy day, hey, hey
and you shouldn't try to be
what you can't be
and you shouldn't try to be
what you can't be
call to you and what do you do
There will be shoulders pressing in the hall
and I won't know if you're here at all
there will be wine and drinking in the yard
there won't be anybody very hard
there will be lots of things that we can do
and all and more will be for you
everything I knew I tried with you
but everything to you was never easy
so I went ahead around my world
I saw the things you do arriving by your side
to see you looking too
but I know this
I know, I never lied to you
it's been just like you're gone
for just one day for so long!
It's been so hard to bear with you not there
but though I think of you, the things you do
when I'm with you, to be with you,
to be alone...can only think:
"Why I am here? What's meant to be?".</field>

Didn't recognise I'd become
No more than alive I'd barely survive
In a word, overrun
Won't hear a sound
(He's curled into the corner)
From my mouth
(But still the screen is flickering)
I've spent too long
(With an endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out
(curse the place)
My skin is cold
(In a sea of random images)
To the human touch
(The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart's
(Waiting for the waves)
Not beating much
(to break)
I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don't even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile
I'm creeping back to life
My nervous system all awry
I'm wearing the inside out
Look at him now
He's paler somehow
But he's coming around
He's starting to choke
It's been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth
And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again
I'm holding out
(He's standing on the threshold)
For the day
(Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds
(And hurled into the furnace he'll)
Have blown away
(curse the place)
I'm with you now
(He's torn in all directions)
Can speak your name
(And still the screen is flickering)
Now we can hear
(Waiting for the flames)
Ourselves again

You bought a guitar to punish your ma,
And you didn't like school, and you
know you're nobody's fool,
So welcome to the machine.
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
What did you dream?
It's alright we told you what to dream.
You dreamed of a big star,
He played a mean guitar,
He always ate in the Steak Bar.
He loved to drive in his Jaguar.
So welcome to the Machine.</field>

Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you
I'm not the one you need

You can have anything you want
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water

One miserable morning
in black forty-four.
when the forward commander was told to sit tight
when he asked that his men be withdrawn.
And the generals gave thanks as the other ranks
Held back the enemy tanks - for a while.
And then the Anzio beachhead was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives.
And kind old King George sent mother a note
When he heard that father was gone
It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll
with golden leaf and all.
And I found it one day in a drawer of old photographs,
Hidden away.
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp
It was dark all around
There was frost in the ground
When the tigers broke free
And no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers Company C.
They were all left behind.
Most of them dead,
The rest of them dying
And that's how the High Command
Took my Daddy
From me.</field>

all enmeshing, hovering...

all the animals laying trail

mild the reflecting electricity eyes...
tears, the life that was ours
grows sharper and stronger away and beyond

And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside lookin' out
Hear me shout "Come on in,
What's the news, and where you've been?"
Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Yet Another Movie
One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed
The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best
And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse,
A pointless life has run its course,
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun</field>

You gotta keep your kids and your car clean
You gotta keep climbing, you gotta keep fit
You gotta keep smiling, you gotta eat shit
You gotta be small to be a big shot
You gotta eat meat to stay at the top
You gotta be trusted, gotta tell lies
You gotta be able to narrow your eyes
You gotta beleive they've gotta beleive you
You gotta appear easy to see through
Gotta be sure you look good on the TV
Gotta resemble a human being
You gotta keep one eye over your shoulder
Gonna get harder as you get older
Gotta fly south and hide in the sand
Gotta forget that you're gonna get cancer
And when you loose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to loose the weight
You used to need to throw around
So have a good drown
As you go down
Alone
Dragged down by the stone
Gotta be sure, you gotta be quick
Gotta divide the tame from the sick
Gotta keep some of us docile and fit
You gotta keep everyone burying this shit
You gotta get you started early
Processed by the time you're thirty
Work like fuck 'till you're sixty five
And then your time's your own until you die
I gotta admit to a lot of confusion
Pain in the head is the child of collusion
Gotta resist the creeping malaise
You gotta beleive in the way you get out of the maze
But you, you just keep on pretending
You can tell a sucker from a friend
But you still raise the knife to
Stranger, lover, friend and foe alike
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was sent out to play on his own
Who was raised on a diet of shame
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with bridle and bit
Who was given a seat in the stand
Who was forcing his way to the rails
Who was offered a place on the board
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone</field>

Some brighteyed and crazy,

A warning to anyone still in command
Of their possible future, to take care.
In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
With cattle trucks lying in wait
For the next time.
Do you remember me?
How we used to be?
Do you think we shoud be closer?
She stood in the doorway,
the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face
Like a cheap hotel sign.
Her cold eyes imploring
The men in their macs
For the gold in their bags
Or the knives in their backs.
Stepping up boldly
One put out his hand.
He said: "I was just a child then,
Now I'm only a man."
Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?
By the cold and religious
We were taken in hand.
Shown how to feel good
And told to feel bad.
And strung out behind us
The banners and flags of our possible pasts
Lie in tatters and rags.
Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?</field>

Up (up, up, up, up)

And in the end it's only round 'n round (round, round, round)
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

"I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again. Dig it?
I mean he get off lightly, 'cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion, but really
I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?"

Down (down, down, down, down)
And out (out, out, out, out)
It can't be helped that there's a lot of it about
With (with, with, with), without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way
It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price
Of tea and a slice

Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash. 
New car, caviar, four star daydream, 
Think I'll buy me a football team. 

Money, get back. 
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack. 
Money, it's a hit. 
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit. 
I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set 
And I think I need a Lear jet. 

Money, it's a crime. 
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie. 
Money, so they say 
Is the root of all evil today. 
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're 
giving none away.

            <field name="lyrics">Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. 
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. 

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. 

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking 
Racing around to come up behind you again. 
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, 
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. 

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time. 
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines 
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way 
The time is gone, the song is over, 
Thought I'd something more to say.</field>

Ancient bonds are breaking, 
Moving on and changing sides. 
Dreaming of a new day, 
Cast aside the other way. 
Magic visions stirring, 
Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eyes. 

The doorway stands ajar, 
The walls that once were high. 
Beyond the gilded cage, 
Beyond the reach of ties. 
The moment is at hand. 
She breaks the golden band.</field>

In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before times took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
When friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some in a tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever</field>

Morning to birth is born into shadow 
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Who is the man who arrives at the wall?

Blown on the steel breeze

Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze

Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine</field>

Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle</field>

You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears

If you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

Cast your thoughts back many years
To the time when there was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the light will be as bright as on that morning

If you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you

And brought me here instead dressed in red 
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song

I don't care if the sun don't shine 
And I don't care if nothing is mine 
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you 
I'll do my loving in the winter

And the sea isn't green 
And I love the queen 
And what exactly is a dream 
And what exactly is a joke</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
A drink, a drink, a drink, a drink

What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been
Far away
Away, away, away, away, away, away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do, I can't think what to say
She sees through anyway
Away, away, away, away, away, away

Out of the front door I go
Traffic's moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be
Be, a-be, a-be, a-be, a-be, a-be
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Hey Eugene
This is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say
That I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me
And hide with me, baby

Isn't it strange
How little we change
Isn't it sad we're insane
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands 

Jumps into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back

He cried
This is my last goodbye

Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in (breathe in, breathe in, breathe in)

People pushing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate

Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags
It's goodbye
Hey Jean look at the screen and it's goodbye
Julian hey, the milky way and it's goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
I am going to say goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, goodbye</field>

Counting the leaves which tremble and turn
Lotus's lean on each other in union
Over the hills where a swallow is resting
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine 
Morning to birth is born into shadow 
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Who is the man who arrives at the wall? 
Making the shape of his questions at asking
Thinking the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving? 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man how are you?

So I've changed my dear, and I find my knees,
And I covered them up with the latest cut,
And my pants and socks all point in a box,
They don't make long of my nylon socks,
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole,
And all the lot is what I got,
It's what I wear, it's what you see,
It must be me, it's what I am,
Vegetable man

I've been looking all over the place for a place for me,
But it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere
Vegetable man, vegetable man,
He's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can,

Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oh!
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth
Mama, oh!
(Anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
But sometimes wish
I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouette of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche
Will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me
Galileo
Galileo
Galileo
Galileo
Galileo, Figaro
Magnifico!
I'm just a poor boy
And nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy
From a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstruosity
Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go?
Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go!)
Will not let you go
(Let me go!)
Never, never let you go
(Let me go!)
Never let me go, oh!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me, for me
So you think you can stone me
And spit in my eye
So you think you can love me
And leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah!
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

I'd sit alone
And watch your light
My only friend
Through teenage nights
And everything
I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all
Those old time stars
Through wars of worlds
Invaded by Mars
You made em laugh
You made 'em cry
You made us feel
Like we could fly
Radio
So don't become
some background noise
A backdrop for
the girls and boys
Who just don't know
or just don't care
And just complain
when you're not there
You had your time
you had the power
You've yet to have
your finest hour

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo

Radio what's new?
Radio someone still loves you
We watch the shows
we watch the stars
On videos
for hours and hours
We hardly need
to use our ears
How music
changes through the years
Let's hope you never
leave old friend
Like all good things
on you we depend
So stick around
cos we might miss you
When we grow tired
of all this visual
You had your time
you had the power
You've yet to have

No man ask for.
Under pressure.
That burns a building down.
Splits a family in two.
Puts people on streets.
That's okay.
It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about.
Watching some good friends
Screaming "Let me out!".
Pray tomorrow gets me higher.
Pressure on people, people on streets.
Okay.
Chippin' around,
Kick my brains around the floor.
These are the days it never rains,
But it pours.
People on streets.
People on streets.
It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about.
Watching some good friends
Screaming "Let me out!".
Pray tomorrow gets me higher.
Pressure on people, people on streets.
Turned away from it all like a blind man.
Sat on a fence but it don't work.
Keep coming up with love,
But it's so slashed and torn.
Why? Why? Why?
Love, love, love, love, love.
Insanity laughs.
Under pressure we're cracking.
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love?
Give love, give love.
Give love, give love.
Give love, give love.
Give love, give love.
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word.
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night.
And loves dares you to change our way
Of caring about ourselves.
This is our last dance.
This is our last dance.
This is ourselves
Under pressure.
Under pressure.
Pressure.</field>

With his brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready hey are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat look out
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey I'm gonna get you too

Hey
Oh take it - Bite the dust bite the dust
Hey Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust ow
Another one bites the dust he he
Another one bites the dust haaaa
Ooh shoot out
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust yeah
Hey I'm gonna get you too

Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to Rock'n'Roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool relax get hip!
Get on my track's
Take a back seat
Hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready

you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes
well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
She's a killer queen
gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime.

Insatiable an appetite
wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
if you're that way inclined (she's a
killer queen)
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
She's a killer queen
gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Drop of a hat she's as willing as
playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild...
She's all out to get you
She's a killer queen
gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind

Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My make - up may be flaking

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for ?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning learning learning)
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning turning turning)
Round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on

Ooh, inside my heart is breaking

Across the wire across the land

Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time

We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall
Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way -
Build your muscles as your body decays.
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the Hammer to Fall.
Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Baby now your struggle's all vain.
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder
What the hell are we fighting for ?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the Hammer to Fall.</field>

So the pound has dropped,
And the children are creating.
The other half run away.
Taking all the cash,
And leaving you with the lumber.
Got a pain in the chest.
Doctors on strike.
What you need is a rest.
It's not easy, love,
But you've got friends you can trust.
Friends will be friends.
When you're in need of love,
They give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends.
When you're through with life,
And all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand.
'Cause friends will be friends,
Right till the end.
Now it's a beautiful day.
The postman delivered a letter from your lover.
Only a phone call away.
You tried to track him down,
But somebody stole his number.
As a matter of fact,
You're getting used to life,
Without him in your way.
It's so easy now,
'Cause you got friends you can trust.
Friends will be friends.
When you're in need of love,
They give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends.
When you're through with life,
And all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand.

You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did

            <field name="lyrics">In the year of thirty-nine
Assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out
into the blue and sunny morning
The sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back
never feared
never cried
Don't you hear my call
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I'll take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
In the year of thirty-nine
Came a ship from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey
Little darlin' we'll away
But my love this cannot be
Oh so many years have gone
Though I'm older than a year
Your mothers eyes
from your eyes
cry to me
Don't you hear my call
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I'll take your hand
In the land that our grand-children knew
Don't you hear my call
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life
still ahead
pity me</field>

The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
The rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be will soon be
Will soon be done

This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

Like a juke box playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling this world is using me
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let down
Coming to this town honey is a show down
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping some sunshine ray
Through a crack in the shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still there's a feeling this world is using me
Action this day action this night
Oh we've gotta learn to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day action this night
Oh you've got the power you've got the power
You've got the power to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your minds living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping
Like a juke box playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling that just won't quit
This world is using me

All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone all dead
All dead all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead and gone
Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child
All dead all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to ev'ryone
All dead all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe

She won our hearts the arts she loved
Is painting pictures for free
When she was done she hung them up
For all the children to see
Goodbye April lady
It's been good to have you around
Goodbye April lady
You've done a lot for the folks in this town
The children learned to read
She strung their beads
It's sorry she was the one
As you can see isn't she good
She don't leave nothing undone
Goodbye April lady
It's been good to have you around
Goodbye April lady
You've done a lot for the folks in this town
She taught them all to love
She was their cream
And we don't want her to go

She fell in love
And there's no stopping her so

Here the night creatures call
In the cold breath they howl
And the hollow tears, they're calling you
I'll be there, though maybe you wont see my babe
I'll still care, no mater where I'll still be there
When you make to the other side
Lord I'm going back, back to the light
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul
Deep, deep in the night
When the world fils with tears
And the wind grows, colder and colder it grows
And the fire dims, with the same old fears
I'll be there, no matter what you're going through
In the dark I care, I'm holding on, I'm hoping on
It's still the same old me inside#
Lord I'm going back, back to the light
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul
On and on, searching for the clearer view
Winning and loosing an inner war
Wondering what we do it for
Though the road seems never ending
Hold on to the hope I'm sending through
No matter where you're going to
I'll be there
I'm holding on, believe it
We'll be walking in the light
'Cos there'll be no place left to hide
Back to the light
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul</field>

Viva
I had this perfect dream
Un sueño me envolvió
This dream was me and you
Talvez estás aqui
I want all the world to see
Un instincto me guiaba
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming true
The wind is a gentle breeze
El me habló de ti
The bells are ringing out
El canto vuela
They're calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish my dream would never go away
Barcelona - It was the first time that we met
Barcelona - How can I forget
The moment that you stepped into the room
you took my breath away
Barcelona - La musica vibró
Barcelona - Y ella nos unió
And if God willing we will meet again someday
Let the songs begin
Dejaló nacer
Let the music play
Ahh
Make the voices sing
Nace un gran amor
Start the celebration
Vien a mi
And cry
Grita
Come alive
Vive
And shake the foundations from the skies
Ah, Ah, Shaking all our lives
Barcelona - Such a beautiful horizon
Barcelona - Like a jewel in the sun
Por ti sere gaviota de tu bella mar
Barcelona - Suenan las campanas
Barcelona - Abre tus puertas al mundo
If God is willing
If God is willing
If God is willing
Friends until the end

All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone
Never dared to take a chance
Goin' home alone
But it gets so fucky cold
When it's late at night
Leave the foxholes on their own
Do you sleep well at night?
Body count, feeling hot
Body count, keeping warm
Friends are playing with danger
They don't know where it's found
With their casual letters
It's just another chain
You've lost the innocence
That you've never found
Standing in the DMZ
Don't get turned around
(chorus)
Body count, feeling hot
Body count, Vietnam
It's not the game, it's a scar
And they won't let you wear your khakis
And your Izods anymore
You can go get shot to hell
They don't want you anymore because
All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone
Never dare to take a chance
You're going home alone
Military metaphors
Are metaphors no more
Keeping up with protocol
You're dancin' off to war
(repeat chorus)
Do you sleep well at night?
Body count, Vietnam
They can say what they want
But you have your doubts
It's not what you've lost
It's what your without
When I ran so far
And they just turned away
I doesn't bother me by the light of day
But at night, I hear your call
Late at night, I hear your call
I saw the mirror that you broke today
I saw the ceiling falling down your way
When they looked at you, you could turn away
You didn't bother then by the light of day, you'll stay
But at night, I hear your call
Late at night, I hear your call
You said that you could turn away
I knew that you going to stay
The walls are falling all around
They pinned you down onto the ground
But at night, I hear your call.</field>

A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oh!
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth
Mama, oh!
(Anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
But sometimes wish
I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouette of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche
Will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me
Galileo
Galileo
Galileo

Galileo, Figaro
Magnifico!
I'm just a poor boy
And nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy
From a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstruosity
Easy come, easy go

No, we will not let you go

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me, for me
So you think you can stone me
And spit in my eye
So you think you can love me
And leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah!

Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Turn my heart inside and out for you now

Speaks books to me,

Happy little day Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell
Jenny will you stay tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us
Tell me love what do you say?
Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell
Oh rock of ages do not crumble
Love is breathing still
Oh lady moon shine down
A little people magic if you will
Jenny pines away writes a letter ev'ry day
We must ever be together
Nothing can my love erase
Oh no I'm compromised
I must apologize if my lady should discover
How I spent my holidays.</field>

Someplace better than were you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'
In a little cafe just around the bend
I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you
A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we both know that a change is coming
Come on closer, sweet release
I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you

Feeling the beat of my heart huh!
Feeling the beat of my heart
Ooh you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Ooh messing with the beat of my heart yeah!
Ooh you used to be a mean kid
Ooh making such a deal of life
Ooh you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen? happen no!
You're speeding to fast slow down
Slow down you'd better slow down slow down
You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove
Cool cat tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh just cruising
Driving along like the swing king

Let there be rock 'n' roll
It's a Saturday night and I'm home alone
With the music on quiet I'm flying solo
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat
Put the music up loud hear it in the street
Then the neighbours start banging on my front door
Throw the door wide open saying what's your point
Come on in let's rock this joint
We got the whole house rocking
We got the whole house rocking
We got the whole house rocking
We got the whole house rocking
We got the whole house rocking
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll
We dance out of the door, dance into the street
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat
We rock down the road and down to the town
And all the people stare and smile and get down
Then the police man is saying "stop this noise"
But the beat takes over now he's one of the boys
The beat's taken over now he's one of the boys
Come on down let's rock this town
We got the whole town rocking
We got the whole town rocking
We got the whole town rocking
We got the whole town rocking
We got the whole town rocking
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll
Let's go
Let it roll
Are you ready?
Said are you ready?
The cosmos rocks
Across seven seas through the Panama,
Now they're rockin' on beaches
and they're rockin' in bars
Don't ask me how and don't ask me why
From Miami Beach down to old Bondi
There's a rock 'n' roll fever
in every place
Next thing you know
They'll be rockin' out in space
Come on down let's rock this place
Come on down and
Sock it to me
We got the whole world rocking
We got the whole world rocking
We got the whole world rocking
We got the whole world rocking
We got the whole world rocking
To the mighty mighty mighty power
We got the cosmos rocking
We got the cosmos rocking
We got the universe rocking
We got the cosmos rocking
We got the cosmos rocking
To the might power of rock 'n' roll "</field>

There goes my baby
She knows how to Rock'n'Roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool relax get hip!
Get on my track's
Take a back seat
Hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready

Ain't got no black coat
Ain't got no tie

Come on baby you gotta know why

And come and ride with me? Cool

You break the law and you preach.
Screw my brain till it hurts.
You've taken all my money,
And you want more.
Misguided old mule,
With your pig headed rules.
With your narrow minded cronies.
Who are fools of the first division.
Death on two legs.
You're tearing me apart.
Death on two legs.
You've never had a heart of your own.
Kill joy, bad guy.
Big talking, small fry.
You're just an old barrow boy.
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss
My ass goodbye.
Feel good? Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
(I think you should)
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? Feel good?
You talk like a big business tycoon.
You're just a hot air balloon.
So no one gives you a damn.
You're just an overgrown schoolboy.
Let me tan your hide.
A dog with disease.
You're the king of the 'sleaze'.
Put your money where your mouth is,
Mister know-all.
Was the fin on your back part of the deal?
(Shark)
Death on two legs.
You're tearing me apart.
Death on two legs.
You've never had a heart of your own.
(You never did)
(Right from the start)
Insane, you should be put inside.
You're a sewer rat,
Decaying in a cesspool of pride.
Should be made unemployed.
Then make yourself null and void.
Make me feel good, I feel good.</field>

Hello, John here
I hope you're having a good time.
And Jacky, in return for us doing this musical offering for you,
is after we've finished she's going to come on and do a strip for you.
Hey, I hope everybody's having a good time (good time good time good time)
I hope everybody's having a having a good time (good time good time good time)
Having a good time, yes, before I heard all this nonsense.
Where's the microphone, which one? Hello it's Brian here.
Fraid I've lost my voice because I've been bellowing.
God, I wish someone would shut that bloody guitarist up, it's dreadful.
Well actually we'd love to be with you, we're sorry we're not with you but we're too busy
making silly noises and thinking up new chords like this one and having mid life crises and things.
You see it's all very easy for you but we have a lot of work to do so we're going to play you this song instead.
It does like this..</field>

Where will I be this time tomorrow?
Jumped in joy or sinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right

Looking round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
There ain't time in all the world
Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway I've got to hide away

If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kinda nothing
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
You feel the need to find some answers
You can leave it for another day
Don't try so hard
But if you fall and take a tumble it won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble
Thank your lucky stars
Just savour every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging round you
Stay right where you are
Oh don't try so hard
Oh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard
One day you'll be a sergeant major
Oh you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dress as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try to stand out from the crowd
Oh what a beautiful world
This is the life for me
Oh what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me
Oh don't try so hard
Oh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools - they make these rules

Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
And left me like a broken toy
Oh it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playin' to
Honey though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm wakin'
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you
Oh take me take me take me
To the dreamer's ball
Mmm, I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me take me
Promise not to wake me till it's morning
It's all been true
What do you say about that then honey ?
Are you gonna take me to that dreamer's ball ?
I'd like that
Right on that forty second street
Way down down town we must go
Oh take me take me take me
I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me remember I'll be dreamin' of my baby
At the dreamer's ball
Oh, take me hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball
I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball

Oh - everything I do I do for you
Oh yeah
We touch and you're afraid of me and
We burn and now I'm at your feet
High speed,but you know you're in safe hands
In the dark we make a brighter light
From one spark to the horizon wide
We trust and together we tame the land - yeah
You'd be forgiven if you think you're dreaming
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true
- yeah
Everything I do is driven by you
Oh - come on babe
Oh well it's tough to make a journey through
The right stuff is dead ahead of you and me
And you know we've still got time
Hold on tight to the driving wheel
This ride is really out of line
Raw deal, but there's no other that's worth a dime
You know I love you but you drive me crazy
'Cos you're saying all the things I want to say to you
You say
Everything I do is driven by you
Everything we do (4x)
Everything we do is driven by you
Inner children lost their way
Now they know the price you pay
I'm holding on to life with you
'Cos life without you just won't do
Driven by you
You know I'm never going to know who's dreaming
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true

            <field name="lyrics">It's the sad-eyed, goodbye, yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street, weak-kneed partings I recall
It's the mistier mist
The hazier days
The brighter sun
And the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all
It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleading, to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle aged years
It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason for living or dying
When you're young and your troubles are all very small
Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
And half of the time
We'd broaden our minds
More in the poolhall than we did in the schoolhall
With the downtown chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun
Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a smalltown boy
It ain't easy at all
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he looks good
Let's try William The Conqueror
Now who else do I like?</field>

I might be at a table
And suddenly I'll catch
A fleeting vision of her crystal seas
Or I might be standing in a crowded dockyard faraway
Underneath the sun I've never seen
'Cos I have seen many worlds
For what it's worth
But I'll never see again the planet earth
My earth
I might be chasing waves of light
Out towards the rim
Where stars are sparse
And the cold of space seeps in
But I might be in a bar room
Drinking methylated gin
And thinking of the places I have been
Yes I have seen many worlds
For what it's worth
But I'll never see again the planet earth
My earth
I have seen many worlds
For what it's worth
But I'll never see again the planet earth
My earth
Cast adrift amongst the stars
I float from sun to sun
Dreaming of the world that gave me birth
All the places I have been
Remind me there is none
To match the green living hills of earth
'Cos I have seen many worlds
For what it's worth
But I'll never see again the planet earth</field>

A word in your ear
From father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you
Fought on your side
Long before you were born
Joyful the sound
The word goes around
From father to son to son
And the voice is so clear
Time after time it keeps
Calling you calling you on
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building on the ground
That's been won
Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
From father to son to son
Won't you hear us sing
Our family song?
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Now we hand it on
But I've heard it all before
Take this letter that I give you
Take it sonny hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die
A word in your ear
From father to son
Funny you don't hear
A single word that I say
But my letter to you
Will stay by your side
Thru' the years
Till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will
But the air you breathe
I live to give you
Father to son father to son
Father to son father to son
Joyful the sound
Word goes around
Father to son to son
Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son to son
Joyful the sound
Word goes around
Father to son to son
Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around

Castrate your human pride ooh
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you 'till you've dried

Work my fingers to my bones

Cross collateralise big time money money

So the pound has dropped,
And the children are creating.
The other half run away.
Taking all the cash,
And leaving you with the lumber.
Got a pain in the chest.
Doctors on strike.
What you need is a rest.
It's not easy, love,
But you've got friends you can trust.
Friends will be friends.
When you're in need of love,
They give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends.
When you're through with life,
And all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand.
'Cause friends will be friends,
Right till the end.
Now it's a beautiful day.
The postman delivered a letter from your lover.
Only a phone call away.
You tried to track him down,
But somebody stole his number.
As a matter of fact,
You're getting used to life,
Without him in your way.
It's so easy now,
'Cause you got friends you can trust.
Friends will be friends.
When you're in need of love,
They give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends.
When you're through with life,
And all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand.

Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things
At any time anywhere
If you gotta make love do it everywhere
That's what love is that's what love is</field>

Get down, make love
You take my body
I give you heat
You say you hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind
You blow my head
Make love - (make love)
Inside your bed - everybody get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Everytime I get hot
You wanna cool down
Everytime I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Everytime I get a - get down, get down
Get down, make love
Oh, sss, hah
I can squeeze - you can shake me (get down, make love)
I can feel - when you break me (get down, make love)
Come on so heavy - when you take me (get down, make love)
You can make love, you can make love, you can make love, you can make love

You can make everybody get down, make love
Get down, make love
Everytime I get high

Gimme some lovin' everyday.
Hey!
My head's a-spinning
And I'm floating to sound
Too much is happening
'Cause you're not around
It's been a hard day
And nothing went too good
I'm gonna relax
Like everybody should
And I'm
So glad you made it
So glad you made it
You gotta

Hey!
I feel so good
Everything is gettin' higher.
You better take some time out
'Cause the place is on fire.
Better stop baby
I have so much to do.
We made it, baby.
And it happened to you.
So glad you made it

I think I'm going back
To the things I learnt so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more colouring books
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can't play the game of life to win
I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
And every day can be
My magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years
Then everyone debates
The true reality
I'd rather see the world
The way it used to be
A little bit of freedom's all we lack
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back</field>

Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company oohoo oohoo
Take care of those you call your own and keep good
company
Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her
Won't you keep me company?
Oohoo oohoo oohoo oohoo
Come marry me for evermore
We'll be good company
Now marriage is an institution sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year by and by disappeared
But we're safe enough behind our door
I flourished in my humble trade my reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours but when my time
was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own Limited Company
I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me
Now I'm old I puff my pipe but no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own.</field>

We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be your valentino just for you
Ooh love - ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy
Ooh let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
Ooh ooh can you feel my love heat
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after-all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word - your wish is my command
Ooh love - ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Write my letter
Feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone
When I'm not with you
I think of you always
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
I miss you
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you - love you
Hey boy where do you get it from
Hey boy where did you go ?
I learned my passion in the good old
Fashioned school of loverboys
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely
(One two three four five six seven eight nine o' clock)
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (come on and get it)
Ooh love, (There he goes again just like a good old-fashioned lover boy)
Ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Everything's all right
Just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned fashioned lover boy</field>

Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty-first of May
Died syphilis forty-four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Now hear this
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg will I borrow?
I don't care I don't care anyway
Come on, come on, the time is right
This man is evil and that is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And that's no lie oh no no no
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Show me
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realise tomorrow
No I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like you see?</field>

Lady Mercy won't be home tonight.
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall
Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way -
Build your muscles as your body decays.
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the Hammer to Fall.
Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Baby now your struggle's all vain.
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder
What the hell are we fighting for ?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the Hammer to Fall.</field>

Wait a little longer
Tomorrow brings another feast
Don't let go don't lose your reputation
Thank God you're still alive
You're still in one piece
Hang on in there don't lose your appetite
Hang on in there forget the danger signs
Pray for that magical moment (straight ahead) and it will
appear
Don't fight for lost emotions
Wait for the sunrise
And everything will seem so clear
(Look straight ahead look straight ahead)
Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Your wish will be granted
All your problems will disappear
Don't be a fool you haven't reached your peak
You got a fast car racing up inside you
Your life is incomplete
Hang on in there hang on in there
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear
(Wait for that moment)
Wait for the sunrise
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear
Let's go let's go
OK now do the change now
Yeah hang on in there

Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap `B' movie
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
They start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned

Cause reason's out the window
Better hold on tight - you're rushin'..

Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day
Just minding my business thinking my thoughts
Nothing much to say
When suddenly I got hit
Imagine my suprise
Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you
Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights what do I see
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat out of hell
I get to eat her dust
I never had known anything to compare with her laugh
I'd never known anything that counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Steals my heart
Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Look at the cities
Look at the streets what do you see
Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be
Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you know you won't let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Oooee baby what's become of me
You hijacked my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
Hijack my heart.</field>

I took my baby dancing - to see a heavy band
But I never saw my baby 'til the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't wanna cry cos I had to be cool
I didn't wanna tell you that you're much too cruel
Did you have to run off with that doggone fool...
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby...
I wouldn't mind the postman - if the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man,electric man,man to fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock'n'roll clone
Leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?
Go ahead fool
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby.
So I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more
I don't wanna go and see Queen no more no more
I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more
I don't wanna go and see Queen no more no more
Now I don't wanna hurt you - like you been a-hurting me
But you know I'll be watchin'
Rolling on the floor next time you're on TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoilt brat
To think I nearly let you get away with all that
No way man
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby.
Ooh you'd better stay away from me baby
Baby baby crazy crazy crazy crazy....</field>

Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt

Gotta find me a future move out of my way
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
But just give me, huh, what I know is mine
People do you hear me, just gimme the sign
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth
I want it all (give it all - I want it all)
I want it all (yeah)
I want it all and I want it now
I want it all (yes I want it all)
I want it all hey

So much to do in one lifetime (people do you hear me)
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all
Oooh oh yeah yeah - ha ha ha ha ha
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah

But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without,
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey

I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree

I'm in love with my car
Gotta feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal
Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks sayin'
This is the end now
Cars don't talk back
They're just four wheeled friends now

All I hear is your gear

Don't let them get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone
Hangin' around for someone to call
Ooh they won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said
Give as good as you get
If you can't beat 'em,join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em,join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself
Come on
Get up
You're feelin' good
Keep your fingers off my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around
Invite me to your little contract Ha! Ha!
Rumour has it that you could play dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do about that
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah!
If you can't beat 'em,join 'em
You'd better do it

Monday the start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away ooh
Tuesday I saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me
Wednesday I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name
I never thought that this could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade
I wish Friday would last for ever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there
Saturday just twenty four hours
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday</field>

It's so easy but I can't do it
So risky but I gotta chance it
It's so funny there's nothing to laugh about
My money that's all you want to talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the gods
Wo wo la la la
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
No beginning there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me life goes on and on and on
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong
You say I (you can do it) can't (you can do it
You can go and) set you free from me
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the gods
Wo wo la la la

Oh we'll keep on tryin yeah

While we live according to race,

While we rule by blind madness

Our lives dictated by tradition,
superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'

Oh oh we'll keep on tryin'
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Through the sorrow all through our splendour
Don't take offence at my innuendo
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into
anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo be free be free
Surrender your ego be free be free to yourself
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions
we feel bound to ask
Show yourself - destroy our fears -
release your mask
Oh yes we'll keep on trying
Hey tread that fine line
Yeah we'll keep on smiling yeah (yeah yeah)
And whatever will be will be

Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God up in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done

That's turning my mind away
Oh how I could love you
If I could let you stay
It's late - but I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - is it just my sickly pride?
Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through
It's late - but it's driving me so mad
It's late - yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's
Too late - save our love you can't turn out the lights
So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late
- I've been so long
- You've been so long
- We've been so long tryin' to work it out
- I ain't got long
- You ain't got long
- We gotta know what this life is all about
Too late much too late
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life alright?
It's late - but it's time to set me free
It's late - yes I know but there's no way it has to be
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late - so let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late it's late it's late it's late
It's late it's late
Oh, it's all too late</field>

The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock, everybody, rock n roll tonight
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"
Let's rock, everybody rock n roll tonight
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing
Dancing
Jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the jailhouse Rock</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Oh how wrong can you be?
Oh to fall in love
Was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love too see?
Oh jealousy look at me now
Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous guy
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not
If I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy</field>

The beggars shouted the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about him
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
Then came a man before His feet he fell
Unclean said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now go now you're a new man instead
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus

Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need
Love is all you need
Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure?
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing ev'rything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Do you know how it feels when you don't have a friend
Without a job and no money to spend?
You're a stranger
All you think about is suicide
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight
You'd better keep out of danger - yeah!
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside
Keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
Oh get yourself together
Things are looking better everyday
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need
Love is all you need
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need - yeah
Love is all you need
Baby - love is all you need

Little better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Well they say your folks are telling you
To be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive
Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me ev'rything I need
To feed my body and my soul
Well I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Take your all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive

Take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Do you think you're better ev'ry day?
No I think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive mm
You take your time and take more money

Who said that my party was all over
Huh huh I'm in pretty good shape
The best years of my life are like a supernova
Huh huh perpetual craze I said that
Everybody drank my wine - you get my drift
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's ship - well
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy
We was bad we was blitzed
All in all it was a pretty good trip
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head
Wanted to get me I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey
He pulled out a gun wanted to arrest me
I said uh uh uh babe
Now listen no-one stops my party
No-one stops my party
No-one no-one no-one stops my party
Just like I said
We were phased we was pissed
Just having a total eclipse
That's good
This one's on me so let us do it just right
This here one party don't get started 'till midnight
Everybody party to the left - party to the right
????? do it all night alright alright
Should I lay my hands on you all right (???????????)
Left - right.</field>

'Let them eat cake' she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
for Khrushchev and Kennedy
And anytime an invitation
you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes
well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
She's a killer queen
gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime.
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
if you're that way inclined (she's a
killer queen)
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
She's a killer queen
gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Drop of a hat she's as willing as
playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild...
She's all out to get you
She's a killer queen
gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind

One foolish world so many souls
Senselessly hurled through
The never ending cold
And all for fear and all for greed
Speak any tongue
But for God's sake we need
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Let me know this night and evermore
This room is bare
This night is cold
We're far apart and I'm growing old
But while we live
We'll meet again
So then my love
We may whisper once more
It's you I adore

And I slam the door
And I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games
I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man
Don't it look that way
Shakin' dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way back home (no way back home)
Oh but I have to say
Leavin' home ain't easy
Oh I never thought it would be easy
Leavin' on your own
Oh is the main thing calling me back
Leavin' home ain't easy
On the one you're leavin' home
Stay my love my love please stay
Stray my love what's wrong my love?
What's right my love?
Oh leavin' home ain't easy
I thought how could I think of leavin'
Leavin' on your own
Still tryin' to persuade me that
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way
Leavin' home ain't easy
But may be the only way.</field>

If you dig the New York scene
We'll have a son of a bitch of a time

I brought it on myself
I will price it I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breast feeding myself
What more can I say?
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it I can taste it
Life is real life is real
Life is real
Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in ev'ry pore
Life is real life is real
Life is real so real
Life is cruel life is a bitch
Life is real so real
Life is real life is real yeah
Life is real</field>

I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no
Neptune of the seas an answer for me please
The lily of the valley doesn't know
I lie in wait with open eyes
I carry on thru' stormy skies
I follow ev'ry course my kingdom for a horse
But each time I grow old
Serpent of the Nile relieve me for a while
And cast me from your spell and let me go
Messenger from seven seas has flown
To tell the king of Rhye he's lost his throne
Wars will never cease
Is there time enough for peace?
The lily of the valley doesn't know</field>

You might believe in heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway?
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way
Did we leave our way behind us?
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day
Take heart my friend we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million light's above you
Smile down upon your home
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here,I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live I could not live this way
Did we leave our way behind us?
Such a long long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long long way such a long long way
Such a long long way I'm looking for
Still looking for that day.</field>

With the morning I face the sun
I lift my head and smile for everyone
Every afternoon you'll find me working on
I got my new shoes on
Got to be moving on
That's what they say
Every night I'm tossed
And I shake my fevered brow
Thinking of my lost opportunity
Yes every morning I face the sun
I get so positive with everyone
Every afternoon you'll find the cracks showing through
They know what I'm going through
Oh yes they do
Every evening finds me
The optimist behind me
On with my lost opportunity.</field>

Machines...
It's a machines world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for rock and roll
They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man
They freeze me they burn me
They squeeze me they stress me
With smoke blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no one but no one but no one can wrest me away
Back to humans
We have no disease no trouble of mind
No thank you or please no regard for the time
We never cry we never retreat
We have no conception of love or defeat
What's that machine noise?
It's bytes and megachips for tea
It's that machine boys
With random access memory
Never worry never mind
Not for money not for gold
It's software is hardware
It's heartbeat is time-share
It's midwife's a disc drive
It's sex life is quantised
It's self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised
Back to humans
Back to humans
Back to machines
Machines...
Living in a new world
Thinking in the past
Living in a new world
How you gonna last?
Machine world
Back to humans
It's a machines world
Thinking in the past (back to humans)
Living in a new world
How you gonna last?
Machine world
It's a machine's world
Back to humans
Living in a new world
How you gonna last?
Machine world.</field>

Been here before a long time ago
But this time I wear no sandals
Ages past I gave all you people
Food and water
Three feet tall so very small I'm no trouble
I bring thunder lightning sun and the rain
For all the people in the land
A message of love
I bring you from up above
All good children gather around
Come join your hands and sing along
They call me mad the swine
I guess I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
I woke up on the water just as before
I'll help the meek and the mild and believers and the blind
And all the creatures great and small
Let me take you to the river without a ford
Oh and then one day you realise
You're all the same we've been in life
All I've come to say just like before
They call me mad the swine
I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Ooh
Oh now
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Don't ever fail me
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
I've come to save you save you
Oh now
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Hands and praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
I'll get down on my knees and praise the Lord.</field>

Go crazy driving is the fast lane

She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely
So come home come home

I just wanna be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass

Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall
Well I hope that big new baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temp'rature down
And the juke box blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin'
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll
Get your high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world's
Gonna know just who you are
Look out
Modern times rock and roll.</field>

More no more of that jazz
Give me no more

Only football gives us thrills
Rock'n'roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs get on your feet
Lay on the floor
Can't help thinkin' I've heard that line before
Just more more

More no more of that jazz
Give me no more

Oh no matter
Fool got no business hanging round and tellin' lies

I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet -
Mother Love
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and the say that I'm strong
But me heart is heavy, and my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside
I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all that sweet -
Mother Love
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet -
Mother Love</field>

In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever
Lions den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wines so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on
My fairy king can see things
He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong
Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin of the promised land
They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming rain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes
Someone someone just drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the wings and wronged the tides
Mother mercury mercury
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run
I cannot hide</field>

Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew
So come and get me
Let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low - So
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cos I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood so now move over
Let me take over
With my melancholy blues
I'm causing a mild sensation

So come into my enclosure
And meet my

No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I don't wanna feel like a stranger no
'Cos I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her
I only hope as time goes on I'll forget her
My bodies aching can't sleep at night
I'm to exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cos I love her
Love her love her love her
Come on baby let's get together
I'll love you baby I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard to stay away
What made you change? What did I say?
Ooh I need your loving tonight
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving babe tonight
Hit me
Ooh I need your loving tonight
No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
Can't be no warning how could I guess?
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving.</field>

The seas have gone dry
And the rain's stopped falling
Please don't you cry any more
Can't you see
Listen to the breeze
Whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore
Even the valley's below
Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me? (nevermore)
Why did you deceive me? (nevermore)
You sent me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Ah ah nevermore nevermore</field>

An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in heaven
Do you want us to cry?
And everywhere the broken-hearted
On every lonely avenue
No-one could reach them
No-one but you
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying
too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you
Another tricky situation
I get the drowin' in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do?
Yes, it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin'
too close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever
And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was in the way it was planned?
And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never
never sayin'
goodbye
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin'
too close to the sun
Cryin' for nothing
Cryin' for no-one
No-one but you</field>

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight
Whatever came of you and me?
America's new bride to be
Don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yes she made me live again Yeah!
A thin moon me in the smoke screen sky
Where the beams of your love light chase
Don't move don't speak don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so don't I love him so?
Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memories with you
Now I'm here (now I'm here.)
Think I'll stay around around around
(Around around around around..)
Down in the city just you and me
(Down in the city just you and me..)
Don't I love you so?

Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on the table
And if the black crow flies
To find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight
He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
And the palm of his hand incredible size
One great big eye has to focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah!
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight
Ah ah ah ah ah
The ogre men are still inside
The two way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down
Right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
Keep a look out
The ogre men are coming out
From the two way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south
Ogre men are coming home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle</field>

A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
But a cold wind blows
And a dark rain falls
And in my heart it shows
Look what they've done to my dream
So give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready
There's only one direction
One world, one nation
Yeah one vision
No hate, no fight

All through the night

in your arms
Is like a shooting star

It's always a rainy day
without you
I'm a prisoner of love
inside you
I'm falling apart
all around you
yeah
My heart cries out
to your heart
I'm lonely
but you can save me
My hand reaches out
for your hand
I'm cold
but you light the fire in me
My lips search for your lips
I'm hungry for your touch
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment just surrender
And no one ever told me
that love would hurt so much
(Oooh yes it hurts)
And pain is so close to pleasure
And all I can do is surrender
to your love
(Just surrender to your love)
Just one year of love
Is better than

Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all
your life
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another
all the time
When I was young and just getting started
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new relation
So in love but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and
affection
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure yeah yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all
your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh ooh pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light
But inside of your mind you have to put up a fight
Where are the answers that we're all searching for
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse so let's make the best of the rest of our
years
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all
your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure yeah yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all
your life
All your life
Pain - pleasure ....</field>

We had a good night jamming away
There was a full moon showing
And we wanted to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
Party was over uh uh
The party was over
We got love and we got style
And we got sex and I know I know we got what it takes
Oh oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh
Why don't you come back and play
Come back and play (hey hey) come back and play
We got all night all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play come back and play
Come back and play come back and play
Play play it play it
Go get 'em boy - let's party
Yeah
Give it give it
We had a food fight in somebody's face
We were up all night singing (singing)
And giving a chase
But in the cold light of day next morning
Everybody was hung over
Hey come back and play (come back and play) come back
and play
We got all night all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play (and play) come back

We got all night we got all day
We got all night to play

Makes the children's eyes light up to see him there
Amongst the tinsel he gives everyone a smile
To see him as you'd see a star
Love him from where you are
He's not for, not for, not for sale
Past an open window walks the pretty girl
Does she see me at her feet it's hard to tell
But if I ask her she might turn her smile away
To see her as I'd see a star
Love her from where you are
She's not for, not for, not for sale
I guess I'll learn to look
Without a grasping hand
Minor contentment wears a smile
I love her from where I lie
He's not for,not for,not for sale</field>

But I can prove you wrong,

They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy
He disappointed me
So I got my hand gun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
And I had to make him pay
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out baby it's the season
For the mad masquerade
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Don't believe what your grand-daddy said
She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution's right on my side
'Cause I caught my lover in the neighbours bed
I got retribution
Filled 'em all full of lead
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire put out the fire baby put out the fire
And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds
You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead
Shoot shoot...</field>

And watch your light
My only friend
Through teenage nights
And everything

I heard it on my radio
You gave them all
Those old time stars
Through wars of worlds
Invaded by Mars
You made em laugh
You made 'em cry
You made us feel
Like we could fly

So don't become
some background noise
A backdrop for
the girls and boys
Who just don't know
or just don't care
And just complain

You had your time

You've yet to have
your finest hour

We watch the shows

On videos
for hours and hours
We hardly need
to use our ears
How music
changes through the years
Let's hope you never
leave old friend
Like all good things
on you we depend
So stick around
cos we might miss you
When we grow tired

You had your time

I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizzare
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious honey
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall
No problem
Uh
Be cool now
Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have the position
To call the shots and name the price honey
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall
Flo Jo
You lead a fairy tale existance
But into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool
Hah
Kiss kiss
Others seem to think
You are over dramatising
Problems at work
So it's hardly suprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions honey
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool
Get serious
Alright
Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool
That's good
One more time
Aha
I like it.</field>

Live life on the razor's edge
(Hey hey hey)
Gonna ride the whirlwind
It ain't dangerous - enough for me
Get your head down baby (yeah) we're gonna ride tonight
Your angel eyes are shining bright
I wanna take your hand - lead you from this place
Gonna leave it all behind
Check out of this rat race
Ride the wild wind (hey hey hey)

It ain't dangerous - enough for me
Tie your hair back baby
We're gonna ride tonight (yeah)
We got freaks to the left
We got jerks to the right
Sometimes I get so low - I just have to ride
Let me take your hand
Let me be your guide
Ooh ride the wild wind

Babe are you feeling sore?
It ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more
It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say?
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way?
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you
Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
You know that I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down my friend
Sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again
Hot child don't you know you're young
You got your whole life ahead of you?
And you can throw it away too soon
Way too soon
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody's
Gonna love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you</field>

I clothed myself
In your glory and you love
How I loved you

The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived a lie
I love you till I die
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home
The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart I'm cold inside
I have no real intent
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oooh
I'm naked and I'm far from home
Each night I cry
I still believe the lie
I love you till I die
Yeah, save me, save me
Forever save me

When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it's not true

Could be happening to you
Could be happening to me
It's hard not to cry
It's hard to believe
So much heartache and pain
So much reason to grieve
The wonders of science
All the knowledge we've stored
Magic cocktails for lives
People just can't afford
Say it's not true
You can say it's not right

Over and over and over again
So let them know when they start,
it's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air
and tell me what do they care
It's only a life to be twisted and broken

Deeper and deeper and deeper inside

What you feel inside
Meanwhile,
I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous
I feel so romantic
Can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime
(Oh, I'd like that)
Fantastic c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season
The Mediterranean
This time of year it's so fashionable
I feel like dancing in the rain
Can I have a volunteer?
(Just keep right on dancing)
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact
So 'tres charmant' my dear
Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea
Reminiscing every night
Meantime,
I ask you to be my Valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy
If you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial
Start a sensational
(Seaside rendezvous)
So adorable
(Seaside rendezvous)
Oh

Give us a kiss</field>

See what a fool I've been
Oh Lord what a fool I've been
Yes I did - too much
Didn't leave didn't leave no letter
Didn't leave no warning (you naughty thing you)
I guess I'm all to blame oh Lord
I guess I'm all to blame (see you later....right now you) -
take it
My little dog ain't too hungry no no he just kept on barking
viciously
Just don't seem the same oh no no
It just don't seem the same (oh see you later)
Now hit it - like that
Coming on strong
Well I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbour
She said mm mm mm mm mm
Oh Lord what a fool I've been
And she told me what to do
She said go home
Well she's gone gone this morning
See what a fool I've been oh Lord.</field>

I swear that you'll be mine

Sister I live and lie for you
Mister do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
Belong to you forever
Storm the master marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive
I'll survive I'll survive
Then I'll defy the laws of nature
And come out alive
Begone with you you shod and shady senators
Give out the good leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
And with a smile...

I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home
So round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Here sonny won't you sign
Right along the dotted line
What you sayin' are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home
(Now I tell you what happened...)
They took me to a room without a table
They said 'blow your trumpet into here'
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year
I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a missin'
All the people want to listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man
And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
(Have to have some fun...)
Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
An' I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here
I'm back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game
I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry and
I sure do wanna go home
(Yeah).</field>

Funny how the pages turn
And hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you
And you shall be a queen
Today the cloud it hangs
Over us and all is grey
But someday one day
When I was you and you were me
And we were very young
Together took us nearly there
The rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs
Over us and we're alone
But some day one day

How can it be she has it all
Her pride is headed for a fall
Ooooo ooo yeah ..
All things that glitter can't be gold
Oh lord what races we run
Seeking our place in the Sun
Reaching and hoping we'll find the right one
Now every day a new joy brings
My butterfly grew golden wings
It seems we find as we grow old
Some things that glitter may be gold
Ooooo ooo yeah ..
Some things that glitter may be gold
Solo ...
So let us mind what's there to see
Before our hearts become too cold
In spite of all that we've been told
Some things that glitter may be gold

Some things that glitter may be gold
Ooooo ooo yeah ..

Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man
for having your fun
Now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?
I want you to be a woman
Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?
Well I travelled all round the world
A brand new word for day
Watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
What'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you to be a woman</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
'Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar'
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
'Cos you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
He spends his evenings alone
In his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world
Nothing would make him stay
Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
'This could be my last chance'
His boss said to him 'now listen boy
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition
You won't get very far
Sammy boy don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy
at the Emerald bar?'
So honey
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
'Cos you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
Come on honey</field>

Hang on that's folly

You're just a bad memory
My life was going to be better
My why could I never ever see she'd step on me
Well I talked to your friend just the other day
I was gonna look and raise a smile
And she hid a smile and she ain't like you
Been asleep from all the journeys a little while
My life was going to be better
My why could I never ever see she'd step on me
Step on me,step on me,step on me
Now it's so good I won't waste my time
On a two year old picture of you
Oh now that you're gone everything's fine
But you probably think that we're through

Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round
Gotta clear outa town
I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the law gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never never I never want it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy stone cold crazy you know
Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore anymore cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy stone cold crazy you know
Walking down the street
Shooting people that I meet
With my rubber Tommy water gun
Here come the deputy
He's gonna come and get me
I gotta get me up and run
They got the sirens loose
I ran right outa juice
They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?.</field>

My new purple shoes
Bin amazin' the people next door
And my rock'n'roll forty fives
Bin enragin' the folks on the lower floor
I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best to be a real individual
And when we go down to smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual
Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outa this place
I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy
Young and you're crazy...
Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car.</field>

When I'm gone no need to wonder
If I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows for both of us
And time is but a paper moon
Be not gone
Though I'm gone it's as though
I hold the flower that touches you
A new life grows
The blossom knows there's no one else
Could warm my heart as much as you
Be not gone
Let us cling together as the years go by

In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned

The fairy folk have gathered round the new-moon shine
To see the Feller crack a nut at night's noon-time
To swing his axe he swears, as it climbs he dares
To deliver...
The master-stroke
Ploughman, "Waggoner Will", and types
Politician with senatorial pipe - he's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown, dirty fellow
What a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter - he's my hero, aah
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow "can we see the master-stroke"
What a quaere fellow
Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailer, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and Titania watched by the harridan
Mab is the Queen and there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow
The ostler stands with hands on his knees
Come on Mr
Feller, crack it open if you please</field>

So you feel that you ain't nobody
Always needed to be somebody
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world's for your taking
So you feel it's the end of the story
Find it all pretty satisfactory
Well I tell you my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation
Is yours for the making
Yes you're a hero.</field>

And you might get fried
Gun in my pocket
Don't get me wrong
I'll be your hitman
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a head shredder
That's better
Baby baby baby
I'm a hitman hitman hitman
Yeah - trouble in the East troubled in the West
Struggle with the beast - what a thief what a pest
Come back mother

Are you ready for the sting
Gonna waste that thing (hitman)
Hitman is king
Go go

I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me
Freddie Mercury
When you hear a sound that you just can't place
Feel somethin' move that you just can't trace
When something sits on the end of your bed
Don't turn around when you hear me tread
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can see right through you
John Deacon
Now I'm in your room and I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life and I'm in your head
Like the Cia or the Fbi
You'll never get close never take me alive
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can see right through you
Hah hah hah hello
Hah hah hah Ok
Hah hah hah hello hello hello hello
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or a girl
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl
So I make my mark from the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
Brian May Brian May
Now I'm on your track and I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back but don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought I'm your darkest fear
But I'll never get caught you can't shake me shake me dear
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me
Watch me
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can see right through you
Look at me look at me

Mama's got a problem
She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy
Has just left home today
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend ooh
She washed and fed and clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is Goodbye Ma
And the night times for her tears
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend ooh
So listen mothers ev'rywhere
To just one mothers son
You'll get forgotten on the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets and just remember
It's not so long since you were young
You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll chose their new shoes
That's not far to bend.</field>

Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you and where do you go?
You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it-
And the world will so allow it
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkies praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby
You can be my honey-chile, yes
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings, you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will and a why
and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power-
Now do the march of the black queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be your bad boy - I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils, and she bakes, and she never dots her Is
Forget your sing-alongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone forever</field>

Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love ev'rywhere
Give a little love to me
(I wanna) Take a little love from me
I want to share it with you
Feel like a millionaire
Once we were mad we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember my love
How we danced and played?
In the rain we laid
I wish that we could stay there
for ever and ever
Now I am sad you are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me
How I long for your love
Come back to me
Be happy like we used to be
Come back come back to me
Come back come back to me
Oh come back to me oh my love
How I long for your love
Won't you come back to me?
My fine friend
Take me wiz you unt love me forever
My fine friend
Forever forever

Mothers, fathers dead and gone,

We're having a miracle on earth,

The wonders of this world go on,
The hanging gardens of Babylon
Captain Cook and Cain and Able,
Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle (4 times)
The one thing we're all waiting for
Is peace on earth and an end to war
It's a miracle we need - the miracle,
The miracle we're all waiting
For today
If every leaf on every tree,
Could tell a story that would be a miracle
If every child on every street,
Had clothes to wear and food to eat,
That's a miracle
If all God's people could be free,
To live in perfect harmony,
It's a miracle
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
Open hearts and surgery,
Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting,
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling
It's a miracle (3 times)
The wonders of this world go on
It's a miracle (4 times)
The one thing we're all waiting for
Is peace on earth and an end to war
It's a miracle we need,
The miracle, the miracle
Peace on earth and end to war today
That time will come,
One day you'll see,
When we can all be friends....</field>

Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand to the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
'I see no day' I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal
Oh oh people of the earth!
'listen to the warning' the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand
Ah ah children of the land
Quicken to the new life take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babes
Late too late all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break
And death all round will be your dowry
Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan
Oh oh oh oh and two by two my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain
Oh flee for your lives who heed me not
Let all your treasures make you fear for your life
Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you
Ah people can you hear me?
And now I know and now I know
And now I know and now I know
That you can hear me
And now I know and now I know
And now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know
The earth will shake in two will break
Death all around around around around
Around around around around
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know
Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo

And peace all around may be your fortune

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for ?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning learning learning)
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning turning turning)
Round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life
There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
I live in hope for a world filled with love
Then we can all just live in peace

The rest of my life's been just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow
Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change
Those were the days of our lives - yeah
The bad things in life were so few

I still love you

I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long
I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In me tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you
Every time
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you
Every time
Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end...
In the end..</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Pressure.
Pushing down on me.
Pressing down on you.
No man ask for.
Under pressure.
That burns a building down.
Splits a family in two.
Puts people on streets.
That's okay.
It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about.
Watching some good friends
Screaming "Let me out!".
Pray tomorrow gets me higher.
Pressure on people, people on streets.
Okay.
Chippin' around,
Kick my brains around the floor.
These are the days it never rains,
But it pours.
People on streets.
People on streets.
It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about.
Watching some good friends
Screaming "Let me out!".
Pray tomorrow gets me higher.
Pressure on people, people on streets.
Turned away from it all like a blind man.
Sat on a fence but it don't work.
Keep coming up with love,
But it's so slashed and torn.
Why? Why? Why?
Love, love, love, love, love.
Insanity laughs.
Under pressure we're cracking.
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love?
Give love, give love.
Give love, give love.
Give love, give love.
Give love, give love.
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word.
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night.
And loves dares you to change our way
Of caring about ourselves.
This is our last dance.
This is our last dance.
This is ourselves
Under pressure.
Under pressure.

the dogs will howl
Look out of your window,
I'll be on the prowl
I'm not usually
a gambling man
But oh
I just wanna hold up
my hands
And say I'm taking
a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking
a chance on you love
I'm not superstitious
and I don't wear no charm
I don't carry my heart
on the sleeve of my arm
Seven years of bad luck,
please, don't worry me
'Cause when I look
in the mirror,
here's the future I see
I'm taking a chance
on you love
Woah,
I'm taking
a chance on you love
Place your bets, better yet
Don't forget, what I said
Roll the dice, spin the wheel
Always remember,
you've got to keep it real
Don't believe in voodoo,
black magic was never my style
But I believe you do,
and it won't take much time
To gather the portions
that weave your magic spell
The moon on the ocean
has a secret to tell
But anyway
I'm taking
a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking
a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking
a chance on you love</field>

It's such a pity

See them marching two by two
When it all comes down
they know exactly what to do
Here come the war,
war, warboys
Warboys,
children and their toys
Warboys,
make a lot of noise
Warboys,
when the lightning explodes
I pray for your soul
Well they look so fierce
gonna tear out your heart
When they get near
gonna see what they got

What is there left for me to do in this life
Did I achieve what I had set in my sights
Am I a happy man or is this sinking sand
Was it all worth it was it all worth it
Yeah now hear my story let me tell you about it
We bought a drum kit blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit thought we were perfect
Was it all worth it
Giving all my heart and soul and staying up all night
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock'n'roll a godforsaken life
Was it all worth it was it all worth it all these years
Put down our money without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won if we lost
Yes we were vicious yes we could kill
Yes we were hungry yes we were brill
We served a purpose like a bloody circus
We were so dandy we love you madly
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock'n'roll this godforsaken life
Was it all worth it was it all worth it
When the hurly burly's done
We went to Bali saw God and Dali
So mystic surrealistic
Was it all worth it yeah yeah
Giving all my heart and soul staying up all night
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock'n'roll this never ending fight
Was it all worth it was it all worth it
Yes it was a worthwhile experience.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I believe
there's no evil out there
we didn't have a hand in
You believe it's a time
for peace and a time
for understanding
Some of us believe
that we are chosen
And if God is on our side
we'll win the game
And some of us believe
that there's a heaven
When the trumpets sound
and the judges call your name
But let's get it straight
I believe there's just once chance
in this world to hear our brothers
You believe there's a better way
to listen to each other
We don't get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we don't understand
So around the world the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame
and the same old tragedy goes down
We believe there's a better way to fight
There's a way to make our children safe at night
We believe there's a war we could be winning
But the only way to win
is to give what we need to receive
I believe we need a hero to step
boldly from the shadows
You believe there must be someone
on the scene that fits the bill
A man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes
Match the intent with the deed
We believe there's a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation - in our time
We believe there's not a minute we should be wasting
When the darkness falls it's too late to fix the crime
It's peace that we need
Every father every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get
We believe there's a song that's worth the singing
It's a song of truth we're bringing
There's a way to share the Earth with everyone
We believe every creature has a being
Has a right to respect and feeling
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun
That's what we believe</field>

You took away the sight to blind my simple eyes
White man White man
Where you gonna hide from the hell you've made
Oh the red man knows wars
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies oh yeah
Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by ev'ry god's name
Say a prayer for your race oh yeah
White man White man
Our country was green and all our rivers wide
White man White man
You came with a gun and soon our children died

Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed?

In sorrow known
The white queen walks
And the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair
Heeding unheard pleading one word
So sad my eyes she cannot see
How did thee fare what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait
My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait
Dear friend goodbye

Who needs well I don't need who needs you?
Oh I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face
Reaching out reaching out for a helping hand
Where is that helping hand?
I like it I like it
Well I don't need you
How I was pushed around
Don't let it get you down
You walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget
Reaching out for a helping hand
When I met you you were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were oh so so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say
I had to swallow my pride
So naive you took me for a ride

Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering my heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight come tomorrow
When ev'rything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright)
No no no come tomorrow 'cause then
We'll be waiting in the moonlight
We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay awhile
You know I never could forsee the future years
You know I never could see
Where life was leading me
But will we be together forever?
What will be my love?
Can't you see that I just don't know
No not tonight not tomorrow
Ev'rything's gonna be alright (sunny and bright)
Wait and see if tomorrow we'll be
As happy as we're feeling tonight
We'll go walking in the moonlight (we'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight
I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
(Just you and I) just you and I
Just you and I
Can't you see that we've gotta be together
Be together just you and I just you and I
No more questions just you and I.</field>

Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die if you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away
So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time

Oh you're my best friend
Ooo you make me live
Ooh I've been wandering round
But I still come back to you
In rain or shine
You've stood by me girl
I'm happy at home
You're my best friend
Ooo you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooo you make me live now honey
Ooo you make me live
You're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
You're my best friend
Ooo you make me live
I'm happy at home
You're my best friend
Oh you're my best friend
Ooo you make me live</field>

A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if youre looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured
Silent play in the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The cameras eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the fistagons the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks
Who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above fuck it cut the cord
Lights out guerilla Radio
Turn that shit up
Contact I highjacked the frequencies
Blockin the beltway
Move on Dc
Way past the days of bombin Mcs
Sound off Mumia guan be free

Army of pigs try to silence my style
Off em all out that box its my radio dial

The needle I thread it
Radically poetic
Standin with the fury that they had in '66
And like e-double I'm mad, still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it could never come close to the rage
Built up inside a me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocracy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak movements sieze when their heads are flown
Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police the judges the feds
Networks at work keepin people calm
You know they went after King, when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot
With poetry my mind I flex
Flip like Wilson, vocals never lack and dat finesse
Who I got ta who I got to do to wake you up
To shake you up to break the structure up
Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos
Mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the grove
Then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the stutter step Then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, the group of several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream
And put it to an end
Ya betta beware
Of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X
And tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot
Urrrgh
What was the price on his head
What was the price on his head
I think I heard a shot x5
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot
Black Nationalism
He may be a brave contenner for this position
Should he abandon it supposed obediance to the

And embrace black nationalism

Through counter intelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential

And the business that burned us all
See through the news and views that twist reality
Enough

On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite

Hardline, hardline after hardline

So serene on the screen

Cellular phones soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold
Turn ya to stone before ya realise
They load the clip in omnicolour

Oily silence mocks the legless

We found your weakness
And it's right outside our door
Now testify
With precision you feed me
My witness I'm hungry
Your temple it calms me
So I can carry on
My slaving sweating the skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire I'm choking on the smoke that fills my home
The wrecking ball rushing
My witness your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs
While on the corner
The jury's sleepless
We found your weakness
And it's right outside your door

Who controls the present now controls the past
Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now?

Bring That Shit In
Yeah, the movement's in motion
With mass militant poetry
Now check this out...
in the right light, study becomes insight
but the system that dissed us teaches us to read and write
so-called facts are fraud
they want us to allege and pledge and
bow down into their god
lost the culture, the culture lost
spun our minds and through time
ignorance has taken over
we gotta take the power back
bam, here's the plan
mother fuck uncle sam
step back I know who I am
raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
it's the beats and lyrics they fear
the rage is relentless
we need a movement with a quickness
you are the witness of change and to counteract
we gotta take the power back
Chorus:
we gotta take the power back
C'mon! C'mon!
we gotta take the power back
the present curriculum
I put my fist in 'em
eurocentric every last one of 'em
see right through the red, white and blue disguise
with lecture I puncture the structure of lies
installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
we've got to take it back
'cause holes in our spirit are causin tears and fears
one-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? who's inferior?
yeah, you needa check the interior
of the system who cares about only one culture
and that is why
we gotta take the power back
Chorus
the teacher stands in front of the class
but the lesson plan he can't recall
the students eyes dont perceive the lies
bouncing off every fucking wall
his compusure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
the complacent students sit and listen to the bullshit
that he learned in school
europe, aint my rope to swing on
cant learn a thing from it
yet we hang from it
gotta get it, gotta get it together then
like the motherfucking weathermen
to expose and close the doors on those who try
to strangle and mangle the truth
'cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
we gotta take the power back

And I'll drop the style clearly

Yeah
Hey yo, and dick with this...uggh
Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D the E the F the I the A the N the C the E
Mind of a revolutionary
So clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The land of the free?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
We're the renegades in this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Since the prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
On down through the Middle Ages
When the earth kept going through changes
Then the renaisance came, times continue to change
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne
Doctor Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were renegades of the time and age
So many renegades
We're the Renegades of Funk
From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen
And groove from land to land singing electonic chants like
Zulu Nation
Revelation
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Now renegades are people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the renegades, we're the people with our own philosophies
We change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the renegades of funk

Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
poppin', sockin', rockin'with a side of hip-hop
We're the renegades of funk
We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of
electronics
With the bass, and the treble
The horns and our vocals
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh (c'mon!)
There was a time when our music
Was something called the big street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the bass sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man on the dance floor
Say jam sucker
Say jam sucker
Say groove, sucker
Now groove, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Say move, sucker
Now move, sucker
We're the renegades of funk</field>

from the pain in my home
hatred passed on, passed on,passed on
a world of violent rage
but its one that i can recognize
having never seen the color of my father's eyes
yes i dwell in hell, but its a hell that i can grip
i tried to grip my family but i slipped
to escape from the pain and an existence mundane
i gotta 9 a sign a set and now i gotta name
read my writing on the wall
no one's here to catch me when i fall
but death is on my side
suicide
a jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
hatred passed on, passed on and passed on
a world of violent rage
but its one that i can recognize
having never seen the color of my father's eyes
yes i dwell in hell but its a hell that i can grip
i tried to grip my family but i slipped
to escape from the pain and an existence mundane
i gotta 9 a sign a set and now i gotta name
read my writing on the wall
no one's ever catch me when i fall
caught between my culture and the system
Genocide
read my writing on the wall
no one's ever catch me when i fall
if ignorance is bliss
then knock the smile off my face
Yeahhhhhh
if i dont take action now }
we settle for nothing later } x4
we will settle for nothing now}
and we`ll settle for nothing later }</field>

Silence
Something about silence makes me sick
'Cause silence can be violent
Sorta like a slit wrist
If the vibe was suicide
Then you would push da button
But if ya bowin' down
Then let me do the cuttin'
Some speak the sounds
But speak in silent voices
Like radio is silent
Though it fills the air with noises
Its transmissions bring submission
As ya mold to the unreal
And mad boy grips the microphone
Wit' a fistful of steel
Yeah...and mad mad boy grips the microphone
Wit' a fistful of steel

Wit' a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
Wit' a fistful of steel
Wit' a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)

It's time to flow like the fluid in ya veins
If ya will it, I will spill it
And ya out just as quick as ya came
Not a silent one
But a defiant one
Never a normal one
'Cause I'm the bastard son
With the visions of the move
Vocals not to soothe
But to ignite and put in flight
My sense of militance
Groovin', playin' this game called survival
The status, the elite, the enemy, the rival
The silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'
Give ya a glimpse of the reality I'm grippin'
Steppin' into the jam and I'm slammin' like Shaquille
Mad boy grips the microphone
Wit' a fistful of steel
Yeah...and mad boy grips the microphone
Wit' a fistful of steel

Wit' a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
Wit' a fistful of steel
Wit' a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)

Ahh shit
And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question
And if the vibe was suicide
Then you would push da button
But if ya bowin' down
Then let me do the cuttin`
Yeah!
Come on!
A .44 full of bullets
Face full of pale
Eyes full of empty
A stare full of nails
The roulette ball rolls alone on the wheel
A mind full of fire
And a fistful of steel
And if the vibe was suicide
Then you would push da button
But if ya bowin' down
Then let me do the cuttin'
Yeah! Wit' a fistful of steel!
Come on!
Uggh!
Wit' a fistful of steel!
Uggh!.</field>

A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
I Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
Yo Z you was packin? You know was strapped
Posse kept rollin it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin niggaz
What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train
that can head up your mission, suckers who be dissing
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Givin best wishes to the best MC
And when the spot is blown and yo you know it's me
Because I'm housin
'Cause I'm housin

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Coolin' at a party, no better yet disco
Head feelin' mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move...
To crush and fry a sucker MC like crisco
Gimme the cue, check one two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
You treatin me the Z to the D, like a stepchild
Let me tell you homeboy you're livin foul
MC's, you know who you are
On the bandwagon Why Z? Cuz you a star
This is the year when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin
'Cause I'm housin
'Cause I'm housin

No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I wake up in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain.
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane
It's a shame
the way she makes me
scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on, nah
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
nah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
And he hands you a dime
And he asks you with a grin
If you're havin' a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for, nah
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
I ain't gonna work, nah
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
And everybody says
Shes the brains behind pa
Shes sixty-eight, but she says shes twenty-four
I ain't gonna work for, nah
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They sing while they slave and just get bored
I ain't gonna work on, nah</field>

He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back
The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner
Welcome to the New World Order
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest
No job, no home, no peace, no rest, NO REST!
And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad
He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts
And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the Ghost of old Tom Joad
Guitar Solo
Now Tom Said; "Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me ma'
I'll be there
Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes ma,
You'll see me! (repeat 8 times)
And the highway is alive tonight
nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes

Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun
Bangin' this bolo tight on this solo flight
Can't fight alone
Funk tha track
My verbs fly like tha family stone
Tha pen devils set that stage for tha war at home
Locked wit out a wage ya standin' in tha drop zone
The clockers born
Starin' at an empty plate
Momma's torn hands cover her sunken face
We hungry but them belly full
The structure is set ya neva change it with a ballot pull
In tha ruins there's a network for tha toxic rock
School yard ta precinct,
Suburb ta project block
Bosses broke south for new flesh and a factory floor
The remains left chained to the powder war
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So make a move and plead the fifth
'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yes I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun
Bare witness to tha sickest shot
While suckas get romantic
They ain't gonna send us campin'
Like they did my man Fred Hampton
Still we lampin' still clockin' dirt for our sweat
A ballots dead so a bullet's what I get
A thousand years they had tha tools
We should be takin' 'em
Fuck tha G-ride I want the machines that are makin' em
Our target straight wit a room full of armed pawn to
Off tha kings out tha west side at dawn
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth
'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun

Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
The rungs torn from the ladder can't reach the tumour
One god, one market, one truth, one consumer
Just a quiet peaceful dance!
Just a quiet peaceful dance!
Just a quiet peaceful dance!
Just a quiet peaceful dance!
Just a quiet peaceful dance

I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, " Yes y'all!"
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab ...without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one, then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, Cuz it's sort of...an addiction,
Magnatized by the mixing

But back to the problem, I gotta habit,
You can't solve it, you silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
unawareness? Beware, it's the reanamator!
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone.
Cause I take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up

You're missing the hootah
Of the funky buddha

Of your fucked-up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws stridin'
While suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when you see me drivin'
By
Hanging out the window
With my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco
I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid from my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
I'm ignoring all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around my gat straight humming
Hummin', Coming at ya
Yeah ya know I had to gatt ya
Time for some action
Just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance
To run the interference
Into your satellite
Shining a battle light
Sen got the gatt and I know that he'll gatt you right
Here's an example
Just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome
I said, "Yo, it's on!"
Take cover son or you're assed-out
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway
That young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I had to establish
To lite
My spliff ignite
You with insight
So if you ain't down, bullshit!
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the One-time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next you hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming coming at ya
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gatt ya!
How you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome
Just for a bucket
Or a fast duck it
Just to stay alive, yo I got to say "fuck it!"
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man[x6]
How I could just kill a man..

Touches tha surface of sand
On northern land
As human contraband
some rico from Jalisco
Passed her name to tha boss
She stuffed ten to a truckbed
She clutches her cross
Here comes tha exhaust
And it rips through her lungs
She's off fast to pasture
Like cattle she'll cross
Degree 106
Sweat and vomit are thrown
And she prays and suffocates
Upon tha memories of home
Of yanqui guns for blood debts on tha loans
Of smoldering fields rape rubble and bones
Of granes hidden trapped up in visions of war
Of nothing no one nobody no more
These are her mountains and skies
And she radiates
And through history's rivers of blood
She regenerates
And like tha sun dissapears only to reappear
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but there
To tear away at tha mask
And now she got a quota
Tha needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across tha new line
of Mason Dicon
Rippin' through denim
Tha point an inch from her vein
Tha foreman approach
His steps now pound in her brain
His presence it terrifies
And eclipses her days
No minutes to rest
No moment to pray
And with a whisper
He wips her
Her soul chained to his will
"My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"
Her arms jerks
Tha sisters gather round her and scream
As if in a dream
Eyes on tha crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to tha floor
Of nothing no one nobody no more
These are her mountains an skies
And she radiates
And through history's rivers of blood
She regenerates
And like tha sun dissapears only to reappear
Maria she's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here.</field>

So wake up bright anew and take up arms,
'Cause more is necessary than vocabulary war,
'Cause the toxic rock (crack) import's hitting on your door.
CIA, I'll see you later 'cause your time is coming soon.
I flip this shit like Pacino and it's your dog day afternoon.
Attica, Attica, drug agents you bring your static-a.
My alphabet will slash and then can flip you automatic-a,
Dramatic like Ali-Shaheed Mohammed* brought the vibes.
I bring the sun at red dawn upon the thoughts of Franz Fanon.
So stand at attention devil ???,
You'll never survive choosing sides against the Wretched of the Earth (Fanon's book).
The infiltrator,
??? intoxicator,
People incarcerator,
Liberation movement annihilator.
We got you clocked pushing rocks and it fell.
We got brothers trooping subways like the Ho Chi Minh trail.
We got the truth addict, Last Emperor, KRS and history manifested.
Tomorrow tha next lesson.
You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that.
You know the cops, they got a network for the toxic rock.
You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that .
So get that flashlight outta my face.
You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that.
The Last Emperor, KRS-One and Big Zack.
As free-market capitalism and technology expands,
The third world's fertile soil becomes a desert wasteland.
So it takes ??? to demand the government provide answers,
When Lady Liberty has me bewitched like Samantha,
And poverty is one of the most malignant forms of cancer.
To all my black magik romancers and acid rain dancers,
Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza.
We fear no man and throw jams that attack counter-intelligence programs.
Exciting like the epic adventures of Conan,
I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians.
Now what hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us?
I bring ancient relics like Wyclef did to zealots.
I saw an iron curtain called hip-hop and got it open like Boris Yeltsen.
Whirlwind tornadoes in the rain forest if you say so.
KRS and the Last Emperor war like the Green Hornet and Kato.
Zack de la Rocha brings the enraged flow.
But all three drop science and become the most powerful alliance since NATO.
Need I say the CIA be criminals in action,
Cocaine crack-unpacking, high surveillance-tracking.
Prominent blacks and whites giving orders for mass slaughters.
I want all my daughters to be like Maxine Waters.
When they flooded the streets with crack cocaine I was like Noah,
Now they ???? 'cause the whole Cold War is over.
Communism fell to the dollars you were grabbing.

Oh my goddess, mother, you can fix this.

Yo, this is the message to all that can hear it.
If you got secret information now's the time to share it.
Call your congresswoman, your senator, your Mayor.

Rearrange and see, times is definitely changing, G.
They used to tap the phone now they tapping while you paging me

Who's left?

Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait?
Come on, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state
Get a check up
This is a stick up
Our freedom or your life
Lord, I wish I could be peacful
But there can be no sequel

Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg or South Central
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

Yeah, what about that sucker?
Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hardlines
That fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought
And lessons taught
Yes I'll display the fitness
And flip like a gymnast
Raise my fist and resist
Asleep, though we stand in the midst
Of the war
Gotta get mine
Gotta get more
Keepin' the mic warm against the norm
'Cause what does it offer me?
I think often it's nothin' but a coffin
Gotta get wreck
'Till our necks never swing on a rope
From here to the cape of no hope

Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg or South Central
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm (4 times)
(Guitar solo)
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm (4 times)
What's it gonna take?
Euuurrrggghhhhh!
Shackle their minds when they're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackle their minds when they're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost, lost, lost!
Shackle your minds and you're left on the cross!
When ignorance reigns, life is lost!
Just shackle your minds when you're bent on the cross!
When ignorance reigns, life is lost, lost!

Ghosts of progress
Dressed in slow death
Feeding on hunger
And glaring through the promise
Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle
A mass of nameless at the oasis
That hides the graves beneath the master's hill
Are buried for drinking
The river's water
While shackled to the line
At the empty well
This is the new sound
Just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound
Over the new ground
Listen to the fascist sing
'Take hope here
War is elsewhere
You were chosen
This is god's land
Soon we'll be free
Of blot and mixture
Seeds planted by our
Forefather's hand'
A mass of promises
Begin to rupture
Like the pockets
Of the new world kings
Like swollen stomachs
In Appalachia
It's the priests that f**k you
As they whisper holy things
A mass of tears have transformed to stones now
Sharpened on suffering
And woven into slings
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
Taking today what tomorrow never brings
This is the new sound
Just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound
Over the new ground
Ain't it funny how the factory doors close
Round the time that the school doors close
Round the time that the doors of the jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper
Ain't it funny how the factory doors close
Round the time that the school doors close
Round the time that the doors of the jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper

Guess I'm left with

From the pulpit I'm yellin'
Inspired by gunshots from a township rebellion
Word is a rough mix

Grab the microphone and say a check one two
The kid's solo
Unafraid of any crew

Always in control
Taking no shit like I was Manute Boll

Now break it down...
Auto logic
On auto pilot
Silence equals death
And death equals silence
The crew that doesn't choose to speak their mind
Is a crew that looses power over time
And now that ya finally woke up
Yo wish your mother fuckin' ass would have spoke up
Voices in full
The balled of the bullet
The mic is a trigger and I pull it
Droppin' and smashin'
Thrashin' and bashin' the set
Mentally and spiritually correct

Hardline, hardline after hardline

Locked armed guard posts
Safe from the screams

Gates, guns and alarms
Shape the calm of the dawn
Peering down into the basin
Where death lives on
Where young run foaming at the mouth with hate
Where burning batons beat the freezing who shake
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
Their walls deny the terror faced by the children born as ghosts
Born as ghosts
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our words
Born as ghosts
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our words
Born as ghosts
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our words
Born as ghosts
Were the children born as ghosts
Born as ghosts
One book and forty odd
Stuffed in a room
Ah, the school as a tomb
Where home is a wasteland
Taste the razor wire
And thought is locked in the womb
The tales that tear at the myth of the dream
(myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
A suffering that shocks the lives off the screen
(myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
Born as ghosts

CIA, I'll see you later 'cause your time is coming soon.
I flip this shit like Pacino and it's your dog day afternoon.
Attica, Attica, drug agents you bring your static-a.
My alphabet will slash and then can flip you automatic-a,
Dramatic like Ali-Shaheed Mohammed* brought the vibes.
I bring the sun at red dawn upon the thoughts of Franz Fanon.
So stand at attention devil ???,
You'll never survive choosing sides against the Wretched of the Earth (Fanon's book).
The infiltrator,
??? intoxicator,
People incarcerator,
Liberation movement annihilator.
We got you clocked pushing rocks and it fell.
We got brothers trooping subways like the Ho Chi Minh trail.
We got the truth addict, Last Emperor, KRS and history manifested.
Tomorrow tha next lesson.
You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that.
You know the cops, they got a network for the toxic rock.
You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that .
So get that flashlight outta my face.
You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that.
The Last Emperor, KRS-One and Big Zack.
As free-market capitalism and technology expands,
The third world's fertile soil becomes a desert wasteland.
So it takes ??? to demand the government provide answers,
When Lady Liberty has me bewitched like Samantha,
And poverty is one of the most malignant forms of cancer.
To all my black magik romancers and acid rain dancers,
Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza.
We fear no man and throw jams that attack counter-intelligence programs.
Exciting like the epic adventures of Conan,
I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians.
Now what hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us?
I bring ancient relics like Wyclef did to zealots.
I saw an iron curtain called hip-hop and got it open like Boris Yeltsen.
Whirlwind tornadoes in the rain forest if you say so.
KRS and the Last Emperor war like the Green Hornet and Kato.
Zack de la Rocha brings the enraged flow.
But all three drop science and become the most powerful alliance since NATO.

Like Baldwin home from Paris.
Like Steel from a furnace
I was born landless...
It's the native son
Born of Zapata's guns.
Stroll through the shanties
And the cities remains.
Same bodies buried hungry,
But with different last names.
These vultures rob everything;
Leave nothing but chains.
They Pick a point on the globe,
Yes the pictures the same!
There's a bank, there's a church, a myth and a hearse,
A mall and a loan, a child dead at birth.
There's a widow pig parrot,
A rebel to tame,
A whitehooded judge,
A syringe and a vein.
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard
Whatcha say,
Whatcha say,
Whatcha say,
What!
Calm like a bomb!
This ain't subliminal.
Feel the critical mass approach horizon.
The pulse of the condemned
Sound off America's demison.
The anti-myth rhythm rock shocker -
Yes I spit fire.
Hope lies in the smoldering rubble of empires.
Yes, back through the shanties and tha cities remains,
The same bodies buried hungry,
But with different last names.
The vultures rob everyone,
Leave nothing but chains.
Pick a point here at home,
And the picture's the same.
There's a field full of slaves,
Some corn and some debit.
There's a ditch full of bodies,
The check for tha rent.
There's a tap, the phone, the silence of stone
The numb black screen,
That be feelin' like home.
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard...
Whatcha say,

Whatcha say,
What!
Calm like a bomb!
There's a mass without roofs,
A prison to fill,
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills.
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill.
There's a right to obey
And there's a right to kill.</field>

Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?
'Cause they're working for the clampdown
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you+ACE-
When we're working for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers
The judge said five to ten-but I say double that again
I'm not working for the clampdown
No man born with a living soul
Can be working for the clampdown
Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
D'you know that you can use it?
The voices in your head are calling
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think someone could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so boy get runnin'
It's the best years of your life they want to steal
You grow up and you calm
down
You're working for the clampdown
You start wearing the blue and brown
You're working for the clampdown
So you got someone to boss around
It makes you feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
You made your first kill now
In these days of evil presidentes
Working for the clampdown
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For working for the clampdown
But ha Gitalong Gitalong
And I've given away no secrets
Who's barmy now?.</field>

Hey yo!
Let me be front
This is real and not a stunt
I'm comin' to the forefront
Shovel for the rapper and clear the lane
'Cos this jam is like a tomahawk chop
Teach ya I'll never stop droppin' topics
Vocal power?
(a)yes I got it
On central but their trying to clamp it down
Flag was waving the wrong way so I shot it...down!
Get down, and at the same time...
Come up...down!
This is a crime that shut us up
I don't give a fuck
'Cos the words and the thoughts still hit
And like I said
It's not a skit
Jump another hit
Yeah
Ya know I don't need a drum kit
Make 'em say awwww shit!
The rebellion is true and legit
Down! Get down!...and clear the lane
Down! Get down!...and clear the lane
Down! Get down!...and clear the land
Down! Get down!...yeah!
The rebel
You'll never disable
Defiance
With the cards upon the table
Pulling cards
Keep the governements in check
Yo!
I think we need a new deck
Never could trust a phillabusta'
The mic is like a fist and it'll bust ya
With words cold hittin' with the underground
And now you're checkin' out the new sound
Live hit
A live pop
Live rock
And ya don't stop
It goes on and on and on
Who's a threat?
C'mon, the war is on!
Down! Get down!...and clear the lane
Down! Get down!...and clear the lane
Down! Get down!...and clear the lane
Down! Get down!...and clear the lane
(guitar solo)
Start droppin'
Our words are never safe
Fighting myself
'Till I'm where I gotta be
I challange, don't sweat it
Now don't you forget it
Check me? What? Wait
You better slow down!
Realize I can't confine my rhyme to a beat
I need cash so when I'm cool I'm never ever weak
Places are fluid and diluted and complete
Check me once, calm down and take a seat
Strip the chains the freedom's there but then it's gone!
Ugh...clear the lane
Ugh...clear the lane
Ugh...clear the lane
Ugh...clear the lane
Defiance
Rippin' up the south set
Every time I'm grippin' the mic it is a sound threat
Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in
Timmy C
Bring that bass in!
Ugh...clear the lane
Ugh...clear the lane
Ugh...clear the lane
Ugh...clear the lane

Causing innocent blood to flow
Entire culture lost in the overthrow
They came to see, take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease
People were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide
AIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
But these governments, they don't mind the procrastination.
They say we'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation
My peoples' culture was strong and was pure
And if not for that white greed, it would have endured
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system
Their minds did slay
Their souls they cage
You feel the rage
This brutality can never be undone
But the sun has not yet set
The bass and drums and microphone a threat
That's when you've got to get the cry from the inside
And see that they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide
You jam your culture down my throat
Say I'm inferior when apon it I choke
You fill my mind with a false sense of history
And then you wonder why I have no identity
We'll strike a match and it'll catch
And spread the insight we need
A tiny fire burning bright
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
A yes yes yall and you don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
A yes yes yall and you don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

These people ain't seen a brown skin man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun
Bangin' this bolo tight on this solo flight
Can't fight alone
Funk tha track
My verbs fly like tha family stone
Tha pen devils set that stage for tha war at home
Locked wit out a wage ya standin' in tha drop zone
The clockers born
Starin' at an empty plate
Momma's torn hands cover her sunken face
We hungry but them belly full
The structure is set ya neva change it with a ballot pull
In tha ruins there's a network for tha toxic rock
School yard ta precinct,
Suburb ta project block
Bosses broke south for new flesh and a factory floor
The remains left chained to the powder war
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So make a move and plead the fifth
'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yes I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun
Bare witness to tha sickest shot
While suckas get romantic
They ain't gonna send us campin'
Like they did my man Fred Hampton
Still we lampin' still clockin' dirt for our sweat
A ballots dead so a bullet's what I get
A thousand years they had tha tools
We should be takin' 'em
Fuck tha G-ride I want the machines that are makin' em
Our target straight wit a room full of armed pawn to
Off tha kings out tha west side at dawn
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth
'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun

Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
The rungs torn from the ladder can't reach the tumour
One god, one market, one truth, one consumer
Just a quiet peaceful dance!
Just a quiet peaceful dance!
Just a quiet peaceful dance!
Just a quiet peaceful dance!
Just a quiet peaceful dance
For the things we'll never have
Just a quiet peaceful dance

Silence
Something about silence makes me sick
'Cause silence can be violent
Sorta like a slit wrist
If the vibe was suicide
Then you would push da button
But if ya bowin' down
Then let me do the cuttin'
Some speak the sounds
But speak in silent voices
Like radio is silent
Though it fills the air with noises
Its transmissions bring submission
As ya mold to the unreal
And mad boy grips the microphone
Wit' a fistful of steel
Yeah...and mad mad boy grips the microphone
Wit' a fistful of steel
Wit' a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
Wit' a fistful of steel
Wit' a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop cause I know the power of the question)
It's time to flow like the fluid in ya veins
If ya will it, I will spill it
And ya out just as quick as ya came
Not a silent one
But a defiant one
Never a normal one
'Cause I'm the bastard son
With the visions of the move
Vocals not to soothe
But to ignite and put in flight
My sense of militance
Groovin', playin' this game called survival
The status, the elite, the enemy, the rival
The silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'
Give ya a glimpse of the reality I'm grippin'
Steppin' into the jam and I'm slammin' like Shaquille
Mad boy grips the microphone
Wit' a fistful of steel
Yeah...and mad boy grips the microphone
Wit' a fistful of steel
Wit' a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
Wit' a fistful of steel
Wit' a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)
Ahh shit
And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question
And if the vibe was suicide
Then you would push da button
But if ya bowin' down
Then let me do the cuttin`
Yeah!
Come on!
A .44 full of bullets
Face full of pale
Eyes full of empty
A stare full of nails
The roulette ball, rolls along on the wheel
A mind full of fire
And a fistful of steel
And if the vibe was suicide
Then you would push da button
But if ya bowin' down
Then let me do the cuttin'
Yeah! Wit' a fistful of steel!
Come on!

It's set up like a deck of cards

With poetry I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away

Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall
Playin' tic-tac-toe?
Yo, check the diagonal
Three brothers gone
Come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?
Spoken quietly: "Anger is a gift"
Come on!

Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall

Yo, check the diagonal
Three million gone
Come on
'Cause they're counting backwards to zero
Environment
The environment exceeding on the level
Of our unconciousness
For example
What does the billboard say
Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement
Spoken quietly: "Anger is a gift"
Yeeeaaahhhh!

We want to just quickly send a nice friendly message
to uh, Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia.
Here's something nice and friendly,
Here's something nice and friendly,
Here's something nice and friendly,
and it goes something like this.
Fuck tha police,
Comin straight from the underground.
Young nigga got it bad cuz I'm brown,
And not the other color so police think,
They have the authority to kill a minority.
Fuck that shit, cuz I ain't tha one,
For a punk mutha fucka with a badge and a gun,
To be beatin on, and throwin in jail.
We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell.
Fuckin with me cuz I'm a teenager,
With a little bit of gold and a pager.
Searchin my car, lookin for the product.
Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics.
You'd rather see me in the pen,
Then me and Lorenzo chilling in the Benzo.
Beat tha police outta shape,
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape,
To mark off the scene of the slaughter.
No controller, bread and water.
A young nigga on a warpath,
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath,
Of cops, dyin in L
A.
Yo, I got somethin to say.
Fuck the police,
Comon! Off, What?
Fuck the police,
Yeah!
Comon!
Fuck tha police,
Yeah.
Fuck The police,
Comin straight from the underground.
Young nigga got it bad cuz I'm brown,
And not the other color so police think,
They have the authority to kill a minority.
Fuck that shit, cuz I ain't tha one,
For a punk mutha fucka with a badge and a gun,
To be beatin on, and throwin in jail.

Beat tha police outta shape,
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape,
To mark off the scene of the slaughter.
No controller, bread and water.
I don't know if they fags or what,
Search a nigga down and grabbin in the nuts.
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none.
But don't let it be a black and a white one.
Cuz they slam ya down to the street top,
Black police showin out for the white cop.
Yeah, my brothas will swarm,
On any mutha fucka in a blue uniform.
Just cuz we in Washington D.C,
punk police are afraid of me.
Hey!
Punk on a warpath,
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath,
Of cops, dyin in L
A.
Hey yo, We got somethin to say.
Fuck the police,
Comon, sing that shit,
Right now,
Comon!
Comon!
One more time,
Here we go, here we go,
Comon!
One More, We gotta do it, right now,
Yeah,

Goin' some place, there's no goin' back
Highway Patrol choppers comin' up over the ridge
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
Shelter line stretchin' round the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sIeepin' in their cars in the southwest
No home, no Job, no peace, no rest
The highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad
He pulls prayer book out of his sleepin' bag
Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
Waitin' for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
Got a one way ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathing in the city aqueduct
The highway is alive tonight
But where It's headed everybody knows
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
Waitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad
Now Tom Said, "Mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Where there's a fight 'gainst the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me mom I'll be there
Wherever there's somebody fightin' for a pIace to stand
Or decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes mom you'll see me."
The highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad.</field>

A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if youre looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured
Silent play in the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The cameras eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the fistagons the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks
Who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above fuck it cut the cord
Lights out guerilla Radio
Turn that shit up
Contact I highjacked the frequencies
Blockin the beltway
Move on Dc
Way past the days of bombin Mcs
Sound off Mumia guan be free
Who gottem yo check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
Army of pigs try to silence my style
Off em all out that box its my radio dial
Lights out guerilla Radio
Turn that shit up
It has to start somewhere
It has to start sometime
What better place than here
What better time than now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now</field>

You're missing the hootah
Of the funky buddha
Eluder
Of your fucked-up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws stridin'
While suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when you see me drivin'
By
Hanging out the window
With my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco
I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid from my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
I'm ignoring all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around my gat straight humming
Hummin', Coming at ya
Yeah ya know I had to gatt ya
Time for some action
Just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance
To run the interference
Into your satellite
Shining a battle light
Sen got the gatt and I know that he'll gatt you right
Here's an example
Just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome
I said, "Yo, it's on!"
Take cover son or you're assed-out
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway
That young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I had to establish
To lite
My spliff ignite
You with insight
So if you ain't down, bullshit!
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the One-time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next you hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming coming at ya
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gatt ya!
How you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome
Just for a bucket
Or a fast duck it
Just to stay alive, yo I got to say "fuck it!"
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man[x6]
How I could just kill a man..
how i could just kill a man...</field>

A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
I Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
Yo Z you was packin? You know was strapped
Posse kept rollin it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin niggaz
What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train
that can head up your mission, suckers who be dissing
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Givin best wishes to the best MC
And when the spot is blown and yo you know it's me
Because I'm housin

Coolin' at a party, no better yet disco
Head feelin' mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move...
To crush and fry a sucker MC like crisco
Gimme the cue, check one two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
You treatin me the Z to the D, like a stepchild
Let me tell you homeboy you're livin foul
MC's, you know who you are
On the bandwagon Why Z? Cuz you a star
This is the year when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin
'Cause I'm housin
'Cause I'm housin
'Cause I'm housin

Hot, quick, and tight
The girls can't stand it
When you're doing it right When they're up on the stand
And then they kick out the jams, yes
Kick out the jams, I like to kick 'em out
Yes I'm startin' to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet
What a feelin'
And the sound that abounds and
Resounds and rebounds off the ceiling
You gotta have it, baby
You can't do without
When you get the feelin'
You've got the sounds above
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jams
Yes, kick out the jams, got to kick 'em out
So you got to get it up
And then you can't get enough
Miss Mackenzie
'Cause it gets in your brain
It drives you insane, makes you crazy
The wingling guitar girls
The crash of the drums
Make u wanna keep on rockin
Till the morning comes
Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams
Yes kick out the jams
You gotta kick'em back</field>

Fold my hands and pray for rain.
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane
It's a shame
the way she makes me
scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on, nah
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
nah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
And he hands you a dime
And he asks you with a grin
If you're havin' a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for, nah

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

About man and God and law
And everybody says

Shes sixty-eight, but she says shes twenty-four

Like cattle she'll cross
Degree 106
Sweat and vomit are thrown
And she prays and suffocates
Upon tha memories of home
Of yanqui guns for blood debts on tha loans
Of smoldering fields rape rubble and bones
Of granes hidden trapped up in visions of war
Of nothing no one nobody no more
These are her mountains and skies
And she radiates
And through history's rivers of blood
She regenerates
And like tha sun dissapears only to reappear
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but there
To tear away at tha mask
And now she got a quota
Tha needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across tha new line
of Mason Dicon
Rippin' through denim
Tha point an inch from her vein
Tha foreman approach
His steps now pound in her brain
His presence it terrifies
And eclipses her days
No minutes to rest
No moment to pray
And with a whisper
He wips her
Her soul chained to his will
"My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"
Her arms jerks
Tha sisters gather round her and scream
As if in a dream
Eyes on tha crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to tha floor
Of nothing no one nobody no more
These are her mountains an skies
And she radiates
And through history's rivers of blood
She regenerates
And like tha sun dissapears only to reappear
Maria she's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here.</field>

the profits of profit
extending the scurge of columbus and pizarro
the freedom to buy things you can never afford
the freedom for indians to buy corn that once flourished overgrown in their backyards
the freedom to die of curable disease
the freedom to watch their children's stomachs swell and burst
the freedom to starve and die

peering through her blood and sweat drenched mask
darding, unseen
changing direction with the swiftness of a bird
through the shanty's of the canyon
with every coyote, every insect, every phylum of life
urging her, propelling her forward.
the leaves and branches of the forest
part for miles, clearing her path
the voices and screams of the dead beneathe her feet
echo in the deepest chasm of her soul
hurling her, toward the city
history surging through her veins
pulsing through her fingers
hurling her, towards the city
she caresses her trigger
and the words of magome fulfil her being
and with each shot she fires, she affirms her movement
saying:
enough! enough!
no!
I will see my own blood flow
before you take my land...or my liberty.</field>

Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab ...without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one, then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, Cuz it's sort of...an addiction,

Peering into tha eyes of tha child already on trial
These armies rippin' families apart
Get 'em on file

All tha while films of dogs
Ripping through homes
Ripping skin from bones

Memories erased and burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a Vcr

To advertise some hip disguise
View tha world from American eyes
Tha poor adore keep fighting for more
Tha thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste
Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon
And Rambo too, he got a dope pair of Nikes on
Godzilla pure mutha fuckin filler

So i rest defense on my ligaments
Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin it
Full life living it, never giving it back
Too late for slipping, so slack up
On my lap its on your lips so track shot
A steel dick more clip for pump but
All im saying there aint no question who the man is
In my civic or in this show biz
I drill the fool, kill the fool
Come on what you say?
i think i can take care of all you muthafuckas don't delay right away

Cause tricks be out for your blindside
Never understood it, but remember i showed you
That in these times you gotta look over your shoulder, strap
Well that ain't nothin' but the intent of gettin high
And a cop giving you shit for just passing you by
If your ever in trouble or on the double best to call your pals
If you got...?

Are we getting along? we family, we better be
We got your back, we got your back kid
Just dont be pointing one of them guns, allright man

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
We're the renegades in this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Since the prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
On down through the Middle Ages
When the earth kept going through changes
Then the renaisance came, times continue to change
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne
Doctor Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were renegades of the time and age
So many renegades
We're the Renegades of Funk
From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen
And groove from land to land singing electonic chants like
Zulu Nation
Revelation
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Now renegades are people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the renegades, we're the people with our own philosophies
We change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the renegades of funk
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
poppin', sockin', rockin'with a side of hip-hop
We're the renegades of funk
We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of
electronics
With the bass, and the treble
The horns and our vocals
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh (c'mon!)
There was a time when our music
Was something called the big street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the bass sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man on the dance floor
Say jam sucker
Say jam sucker
Say groove, sucker
Now groove, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Say move, sucker
Now move, sucker
We're the renegades of funk</field>

Main line adrenaline Gaza to Tienanmen
From the basement I'm dwellin' in
I cock back tha sling to stone a settler
And breaks him off clean, call me the upsetter
Here comes the hands on the leashes
The cross, the capital, the pale families, the fear and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch
The cell doors crash
And the master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
Roll right! Roll call!
But now we're alright, we're all calm!
Roll right! Roll call!
And now we're alright, we're all calm!
This hits like fists bomb with the left and don't miss
With the sickest stilo I spark fear like pigs in the park
Head crack, I hijack the papers
The vapors caught fire up in your mind
Come back rewind one time
Here comes the hands on the leashes
The cross, the capital, the pale families, the fear and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch
The cell doors crash
And the master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
Roll right! Roll call!
But now we're alright, we're all calm!
Roll right! Roll call!
We gotta take 'em to tha seventh level
We gotta take 'em to tha seventh level
For their lives and my lives were never settled
Come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on, come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on
Send 'em to tha seventh level!
Send 'em to tha seventh level!

from the pain in my home
hatred passed on, passed on,passed on
a world of violent rage
but its one that i can recognize
having never seen the color of my father's eyes
yes i dwell in hell, but its a hell that i can grip
i tried to grip my family but i slipped
to escape from the pain and an existence mundane
i gotta 9 a sign a set and now i gotta name
read my writing on the wall
no one's here to catch me when i fall
but death is on my side
suicide
a jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
hatred passed on, passed on and passed on
a world of violent rage

yes i dwell in hell but its a hell that i can grip

i gotta 9 a sign a set and now i gotta name
read my writing on the wall
no one's ever catch me when i fall
caught between my culture and the system
Genocide
read my writing on the wall
no one's ever catch me when i fall

then knock the smile off my face

Bring That Shit In
Yeah, the movement's in motion
With mass militant poetry
Now check this out...
in the right light, study becomes insight
but the system that dissed us teaches us to read and write
so-called facts are fraud
they want us to allege and pledge and
bow down into their god
lost the culture, the culture lost
spun our minds and through time
ignorance has taken over
we gotta take the power back
bam, here's the plan
mother fuck uncle sam
step back I know who I am
raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
it's the beats and lyrics they fear
the rage is relentless
we need a movement with a quickness
you are the witness of change and to counteract
we gotta take the power back
Chorus:
we gotta take the power back
C'mon! C'mon!
we gotta take the power back
the present curriculum
I put my fist in 'em
eurocentric every last one of 'em
see right through the red, white and blue disguise
with lecture I puncture the structure of lies
installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
we've got to take it back
'cause holes in our spirit are causin tears and fears
one-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? who's inferior?
yeah, you needa check the interior
of the system who cares about only one culture
and that is why
we gotta take the power back
Chorus
the teacher stands in front of the class
but the lesson plan he can't recall
the students eyes dont perceive the lies
bouncing off every fucking wall
his compusure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
the complacent students sit and listen to the bullshit
that he learned in school
europe, aint my rope to swing on
cant learn a thing from it
yet we hang from it
gotta get it, gotta get it together then
like the motherfucking weathermen
to expose and close the doors on those who try
to strangle and mangle the truth
'cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
we gotta take the power back

To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you

My witness your coughing
Oily silence mocks the legless
As we travel now in coffins
But on the corner
The jury's sleepless
We found your weakness
And it's right outside our door
Now testify
With precision you feed me
My witness I'm hungry
Your temple it calms me
So I can carry on
My slaving sweating the skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire I'm choking on the smoke that fills my home
The wrecking ball rushing
My witness your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs
While on the corner
The jury's sleepless
We found your weakness
And it's right outside your door

Mass graves for the pump and the price is set
Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now controls the past
Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now?

He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back
The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner
Welcome to the New World Order
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest
No job, no home, no peace, no rest, NO REST!
And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad
He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts
And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the Ghost of old Tom Joad
Guitar Solo
Now Tom Said; "Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me ma'
I'll be there
Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes ma,
You'll see me! (repeat 8 times)
And the highway is alive tonight
nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light

Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hardlines
That fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought
And lessons taught
Yes I'll display the fitness
And flip like a gymnast
Raise my fist and resist
Asleep, though we stand in the midst
Of the war
Gotta get mine
Gotta get more
Keepin' the mic warm against the norm
'Cause what does it offer me?
I think often it's nothin' but a coffin
Gotta get wreck
'Till our necks never swing on a rope
From here to the cape of no hope

we are at war until you're free
You'll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless
You see the powerful got nervous
Cause he refused to be their servant
'Cause he spit truth
That shook heads
And burned like black churches
Prose and verses
At million poor in hearses
Watch tha decision of Dred Scott
As it reserves
So long as tha rope
Is tight around Mumia's neck
Let there be no rich white life
We bound to respect
Cause and effect
Can't ya smell tha smoke in tha breeze
My panther my brother we are at war until you're free
You'll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless
And Orwell's hell a terror era coming through
But this little brother's watching you too.</field>

Ya still never edit
The needle I thread it
Radically poetic
Standin with the fury that they had in '66
And like e-double I'm mad, still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it could never come close to the rage
Built up inside a me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocracy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak movements sieze when their heads are flown
Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police the judges the feds
Networks at work keepin people calm
You know they went after King, when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot
With poetry my mind I flex
Flip like Wilson, vocals never lack and dat finesse
Who I got ta who I got to do to wake you up
To shake you up to break the structure up
Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos
Mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the grove
Then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the stutter step Then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, the group of several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream
And put it to an end
Ya betta beware
Of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X
And tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot
Urrrgh
What was the price on his head
What was the price on his head
I think I heard a shot x5
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot
Black Nationalism
He may be a brave contenner for this position
Should he abandon it supposed obediance to the
white literal docteren of non-violence
And embrace black nationalism
Through counter intelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential
trouble-makers x2
Through counter intelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential
trouble makers and neutralize them x4

Flooded tha trench he couldn't shake tha toxic shock
Maize was all we needed ta sustain
Now her golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down wit DDT yeah you know me
Raped for tha grapes, profit for tha bourgeois (?)

I'm headed north like my name was kid 'Cisco
To survive one motive no hope, ah
It's hard ta breathe wit Wilson's head around my throat
Strangled and mangled another SS curtain call

On january 1st, 1994
The indigenous farmers of southern mexico
Declared war on an unjust
And illigitimate government
Of of the debt of the most wild, the most poor
Came a just arm struggle
For democracy, justice, and liberty
And it won't stop until that 65 year old dictatorship,
The partido revolucionario institucional
Is buried in the ground
And the people's voice is heard once again
So check it out:
On january 1st, they became known as
The zapatista movement
And they have a saying, and I want you all to
Sing along with me real quick.
It goes something like this
It goes, everything for everyone...
And nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Yeah, sing that shit...
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves...</field>

Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slittin' my throat
It's all I have
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've gotta take it on the other side
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the other side
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on
How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slittin' my throat
It's all I have
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spitting' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the other side
Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the other side
Take it on
Take it on
How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slittin' my throat
It's all I ever
Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that
It's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it's born again
How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't

Try to steal your mind's elation
Little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication
It's the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the east
At least it settles in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin
Or is it war your waging
The first born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Marry me, girl, be the fairy to my world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication
Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And, Cobain, can you hear the spheres
Singin' songs of station to station
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population
Everybody's been there
And I don't mean on vacation
The first born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker then the rest
There is no test
For this is what you're craving
The first born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Eastside love is living on the westend
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers
The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone
So smart she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation
This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J
Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Wait a minute I'm passing out
Win or lose just like you
Far more shocking
Than anything I ever knew
How about you
10 more reasons
Why I need somebody new just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
Right on cue
Can't stop addicted to the shin dig
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these
Come from space
To teach you of the pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read thru</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Coming out to the light of day
We got many moons than a deeper place
So I keep an eye on the shadow's smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinning off, head is on my heart
It's like a bit of light and a touch of dark
You got sneak attacked from the zodiac
But I see your eyes spark
Keep the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say?
Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
Stumble down to the parking lot
You got no time for the afterthought
They're like ice cream for an astronaut
Well that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and
Find the world and show command
Playing the hand
Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
Do you want this love of mine?
The darkness helps to sort the shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it overtime?
The darkness helps to sort the shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Pick you up like a paperback
With the track record of a maniac
So I'm moving in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday
Honey where we roll
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Overload
Steakknife..
Card Shark..
Con Job..
Boot Cut
Skin that flick
She's such a little Dj
Get there quick
By street but not the freeway
Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play

Blood Bath...
Rib Cage...

Dope Dick...
Pawn Shop...
Quick Pick...
Kiss that Dyke
I know you want to hold one
Not on strike
But I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic
I know you never stole one
Girls that like
A story so I told one
Song Bird...
Main Line...
Cash Back...
Hard top...

We could make time
Rompin' and a stompin'
'Cause I'm in my prime
Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for
The state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
'Bout the motha fuckin girls
From California
Alabama baby
Said hallelujah
Good god girl
I wish I knew ya
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do
Come back baby
'Cause i'd like to say
I've been around the world
Back from Bombay
Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake
It's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when
They do in Sicily
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do
Where you want to go
Who you want to be
What you want to do
Just come with me
I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin' in the Swiss Mountains
Me Oh My O
Me and Guy O
Freer than a bird
'Cause we're rochin' Ohio
Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
'Cause life is beautiful
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know its you
That life is beautiful around the world
Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world
And I have seen your love
I know I know it's you
You say hello and I say I do</field>

Papa was a copper and momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin down the barrel of a hot metal 45
Just another way to survive
California Rest In Peace,
Simultaneous release,
California show your teeth,
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
She shoulda seen it comin when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
The day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn 'ya
A little loaded she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death
California Rest In Peace,
Simultaneous release,
California show your teeth,
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true, to say, say, say...
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it, up to Minnessota
North Dakota man was a gunning for the quota
Down in the badlands
She was saving the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

Get it off with no propeller
Do it up it's on with stella
What a way to finally smell her
Pickin up but not to strong - for you
Take a piece and pass it on
Fly away on my Zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on my wind
Rebel and liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look its on display - for you

We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion

We will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend
We would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let's go you show
Me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination
Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
(Another lonely superstar
to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside
a lover that another tried)
Complete repeat
Sitting in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let's steal this wheel
Take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound
Turn it up and no we can't be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep
Find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend
Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
(Another lonely superstar
to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside
a lover that another tried)
That's right you're right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
The song is fascination
Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
The lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
A May December
Might not be so smart
(Another lonely superstar
to getaway inside your car)
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
(Surrender to the brave inside
a lover that another tried)
Don't be late cause you're my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays</field>

Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl
In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time
Overkill you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light
Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight
Favor some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young
Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail
Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life
Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you
Serpentine, I think she was an aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo wonder
Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo story
Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail
Babe I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring
Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat
Suicide is never going to save you
When I cried, it was because I came too
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss this</field>

California dreamin' is a pettibon
La's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Stick n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche
People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Super heroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well

Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and

Can you make the time for me to come
and get it blessed somehow
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from
I don't take these things so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore
Somebody hooted and they hollered can I buy a vowel
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth
Before you start to growl
I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in

Robots are my next of kin
I'm kissing high and low
Our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret
I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable

Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see the lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye
'Cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody
Lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's only promising
This place was made on you
Tell me baby what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time on
Tell me lover are you lonely
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find out
Tell me baby what's your story
Where do you come from
And where you wanna go this time on
You're so lovely are you lonely
Of giving up on the innocence you left behind
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle Brothers on the microphone
Getting over with the undertone
It's time to torn to stone
Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life could be a little sweet
But life could be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fitty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home</field>

Closer than most to you
What am I supposed to do?
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be
Okay
In you a star is born
You cut a perfect form
Someone forever warm
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
Show love with no remorse
Climb on to your sea horse
This ride is right on course
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way I Knew that it would be with you.
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life.</field>

Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
It's time to leave this town,
It's time to steal away
Let's go get lost anywhere in the u.s.a.
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost...
Blue you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkle light with yellow icing
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for...
So much has come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads
And let us check the surf
Staying high and dry's more trouble
Than it's worth in the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for...
In big sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory's got our snakefinger on
Now let us drink the stars,
it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost right here in the u.s.a.
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost...
Blue you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkle light with yellow icing

I feel the question
Of your loneliness
Confide..
`cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will
Ex Girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want..
to give her 7 years
For being sad
CHORUS :
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words..
I know of to express
This emptiness
CHORUS :
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
Imagine me taught by tragedy
Release is peace
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give..
your love
No matter what
is what she said</field>

Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self-destruction
It's a bitter berry and its very sweet
I'm on a roller coaster
But I'm on my feet
Take me to the river lay me on your shore

Shao Lin shouted a rose
From his throat
Everything must go
A lickin' stick is thicker
When you break it to show
Everything must go
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for
Calling calling for something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there
Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cage
Shao Lin's shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of
All the thing that you own
Everything must go
I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over
But it's only on the rise
Calling calling
For something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for
Throw me to the wolves
Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky
Because I know I'm coming back
Shao Lin's shakin' for the sake of his soul

Calling calling I know you must be there
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
Throw me to the wolves

Throw me to the sky

Making waves in a motion picture.
Wont you keep this,

Search and seizure, Wake up venus.

Mentally ill Bill,
Mum and dad take your 'Don't be sad' pill.
Turn the screw and,
Twist my language,
Don't forsake me I'm contagious.
There's a reason for the 21st Century,
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be,
And that it's meant to be.
It's my favourite,
Combination,
Coming down with the favoured nations.
Deep rotation,
Mutilation,
Learn to give and take dictation.
Oh, oh oh, oh oh,

Oh, oh oh, oh oh,
It's time to run this table.
There's a reason for the 21st Century,
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be,

Read me your scripture now,
Read me your scripture,
Read me your scripture and i will twist it.
Show me your wrist and I,
Show me your wrist and,
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it kiss it.
Oh, oh oh, oh oh,

Simple soldier,
Hand it over,
Stop and read what you just wrote her.
Strangulation,
Altercation,
Oral sex and bird migration.

Could cut my throat
One note could make me die!

I am an indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek
American ghost dance...
A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide
And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved
American ghost dance...</field>

Back and redefine the line

Oh Yeah
Drinkin' sunshine
She likes the taste of it
She had a gold mine
But then she wasted it away
You should have seen her yesterday
Oh Yeah
Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache
Sugar daddy

Cosma shiva
Got off
Made you a believer
I don't need to
Tender
Why do I believe you

Any way she can
Missing pieces She's got a lot of them
Time decreases
I wish I thought of them, before
Before it's time
To close the store
Oh Yeah
Distillation
A lonely sycophant
Some liberation
The only seed
We ever plant
I wanna help you
But I can't
No no

Got off

Sittin' down in New Orleans
You wouldn't believe what I've seen
Sitting on that sack of beans
Lunatics on pogo sticks
Another southern fried freak on a crucifix
Hicks don't mix with politics
People on the street just kickin' to the licks
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Hannah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans
Oh good brother just when I tought
That I had seen it all
My eyes popped out, my dick got hard
And I dropped my jaw
I saw a bird walkin' down the block
Name Apache Rose Peacock
I could not speak I was in shock
I told my knees to please not knock
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans
A little boy came along
Name of Louis Armstrong
Said that girl who left me silly
She liked the looks of me and my willy
So I found her in the quarter
Good God how I adored her
Oh she made me feel so cozy
When she told me I could call her Rosey
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy wheater
I never met a girl that I like better
Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining down on my blue car
Drivin' down the boulevard
She was soft and I was hard
Apache Rose gotta rockin' peacock
Hottest ass on the goddamn block
Rockin' to the beat of the funcky ass meters
She has one of those built in heaters
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy wheater
I never met a girl that I like better
Voodoo gurus casting their spells
Cockatoo drag queens shakin' their bells
Silver sound escapes the trumpet
Watch your leg someone might hump it
Chicken strut your butt let's rock
Gettin' it on under your frock
Flowing like a flame all through the night
My girl's insane but it's all right
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans</field>

Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson

Wake up the cake
It's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when
They do in Sicily
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do
Where you want to go
Who you want to be
What you want to do
Just come with me
I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin' in the Swiss Mountains
Me Oh My O
Me and Guy O
Freer than a bird
'Cause we're rochin' Ohio
Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
'Cause life is beautiful
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know its you
That life is beautiful around the world
Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world
And I have seen your love
I know I know it's you
You say hello and I say I do</field>

I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots
While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not
I've got no time to flick and talk
But this baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shakin' and a kickin' and that did a bit of tot
Her pop said no, but I just couldn't stop
The killer had a case of tod the rock
But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Chili Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We stop the fire, we quench the heat
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street
'cos that's when in the store when who do we meet?
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat
Five thousand babies walkin' out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight for me and golly gee wizz!
I just can't tell ya how much we did
Rockin' right out for those itty bitty girls, right out
But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Chili Peppers have baby appeal

I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal, so get down!
Got the tunes in my pocket...
Baby appeal...
Rock out!...
Play the chili, play the chili, play the chili...
Yes, we're called the Red...Hots...

Someone spilled blood but do you know

Where the Chuck Berries grow
Come your long tall
Daddies of a rock and roll
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Spinning' down from the clouds
Like a tornado
Spinnin' out of control
Like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hittin' harder
Than Larry Holmes
Come your long tall
Daddies of rock and roll
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Mr Uplift Mofo - my man Bo Diddley
Hit sippin' a bottle of nickle ripple
Play the lickity split finger licking licks
For all you wicked city slick chicks
And all you nitty gritty hick
We'll make your nipples ripple
Make you wanna dip your dipple
Make you wanna soak your hickory stick
That's right
Because my man has a grip on it
And I do mean on it
Which brings to mind
A very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named Little Richard
Who was born to make them bitches stir
That's right he'll make the sweet substance drip
From the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milks his cow
The Howling Wolf will howl
And since times does allow
You all can take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders, why
Can't that be me
Cause in his life he is filled with all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things
He'd rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight, he looks
Up with a little smile at me and he says
If I could be like that, I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,
What would I do
Now and dreams we run
She spends her days up in the north park,
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of This dream,
is that too much to ask
With a safe home, and a warm bed,
on a quiet little Street
All she wants is just that something to
Hold onto, that's all she needs
Yeah!!
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,

My talking dolphin spoke to me
He spoke to me in symphony
From freedom's peace beneath the sea
He looked to me eyes full of love
Said yes we live behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
The sun goes up
And the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun
My heart continues to pound
Behind the sun
Now while I shower in the rain
I watch my dolphin swim away
The one who listens to the surf
Can feel the pulse beat of the earth
And like my dolphin swims so free
The sun does swim into the sea
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
An island flying through the sky
One day your son might ask you why
And if your son should be a girl
She too might ask you of this world
The sun shines sweet upon your beach
And yes my dolphin loves to teach
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
The sun goes up
And the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun
My heart continues to pound
Behind the sun.</field>

Pistol whipping of desire
So please do not resist your fate
I'll pick you up yes it's a date
How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention
Sitting there in a silent movie
Beside the only girl who really ever moved me
Happy days but sad I'm facin
Heaven knows that I'm on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?
Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse
A sticky finger and a wicked taste
Gotta a lot of love and a lyrical case
Be sure to write it in your book
I promise not to look
Wanna smell your sunny face
Funny place but it's never a waste
I'd hop this fence to make amends
I hope this movie never ends
How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention
Make it up makin you my business
A funny buttercup but I let her forgiveness
Happy days but sad I'm facin
Heaven knows that I'm on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

She's just made out of flesh and bones
But let me tell you little boy
You'd better leave her alone
Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
Till she left him floatin' in the old bayou
She's the kind of girl
She's built like a bomb
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blonde, get down!
That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box
But let me tell you little boy
She'll clean your clock
A slick and sly spy
Stuck in the muck of the moat
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat
Double-o-dooms day for Mr James Bond
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blonde, get down!</field>

Temporarily blind

Well have some respect

Well, me and my pussy
We lost our flow
Well, goodbye my little calico

Hangin' in its can

I said "that's fine, sublime"

But there will never be another one just like you, no

I never see you
I never see you
I never see you
Hanking laid all thru the night
Blackest flag at dawn
A lust for life that kills itself before it gets too strong,
That's wrong
Please be lifelong
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no

I never see you
I never see you
I never see you
Killing yourself, that would be an awesome oath
This song is so far away
Remember the home and how they left us alone
Remember our friendship
Stealing everything in the store
You know I want you to stay
Remember the home and how they left us alone
Friends fade away...
Well, my friend Bob's insane today

            <field name="lyrics">There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say "Brandy, fetch another round"
She serves them whiskey and wine
The sailors say "Brandy, you're a fine girl"
(you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of the man that Brandy loves
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home
The sailor said " Brandy, you're a fine girl"
(you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"But my wife, my lover, my lady is the sea"
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)
Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean foam rise
She saw its ragin' glory
But he had always told the truth, lord,
he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
She loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
She hears him say " Brandy, you're a fine girl"
(you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"But my wife, my lover, my lady is the sea"
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)
"Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)

Just like the skies
You are love, you are the love supreme
You are the rise
And when you hear this
You'll know it's your jam
It's your goodbye
Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes
To ferry me away
To where we all belong
We all crossed when we were feeling lost
It's just the tide
Katari cried the day her lover died
She recognized
Because he gave her
A life of real love
It's no surprise
The nights are long
But the years are short
When you're alive
Way back when would never be again
It was a time
It's gonna catch you
So glad I met you
To walk the line
Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes
To ferry me away
To where we all belong
Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes
To ferry me away
To where we all belong
Let me live
So when it's time to die
Even the reaper cries
Let me die
So when it's time to live
Another son will rise
Yeah Yeah</field>

Are you coming through? do you want me to?

It would be so cool, to be cool with you,

I don't like blood into the chain
There ain't a nelly man that stays up in my brain
A dirty sun will burn away
Do you even want to stay?

Where'd ya get that bruise? do you want me to?

She's such a little Dj
Get there quick
By street but not the freeway
Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic

I know you want to hold one
Not on strike
But I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic
I know you never stole one
Girls that like
A story so I told one

My disenchanted diplomat
Asleep inside the laundromat
Conveyer belts are moving and

And if you let it germinate
I know it will be worth the wait
Disputed by the news that it was you

I'll come around and make peace
Get down have a barbeque
Let's keep the moon awake
And do electric boogiloo
I am small but I am strong
You see I'm just like you
If you only knew
That I'm just like you
All the world would
Take a cue from

Try to steal your mind's elation
Little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication
It's the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the east
At least it settles in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin
Or is it war your waging
The first born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Marry me, girl, be the fairy to my world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication
Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And, Cobain, can you hear the spheres
Singin' songs of station to station
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population
Everybody's been there
And I don't mean on vacation
The first born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker then the rest
There is no test
For this is what you're craving
The first born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers
The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone
So smart she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation
This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J
Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Wait a minute I'm passing out
Win or lose just like you
Far more shocking
Than anything I ever knew
How about you
10 more reasons
Why I need somebody new just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
Right on cue
Can't stop addicted to the shin dig
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these
Come from space
To teach you of the pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read thru</field>

"you're a disgrace"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool
He cries "oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had"
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green
And so castles made of sand,
Fall in the sea eventually
A little indian brave who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior indian chief
Many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow
He would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle but something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
And so castles made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually
There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
Because she was crippled for life and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she would stop living
So she decided to die
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled
"you won't hurt me no more"
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"look a golden winged ship is passing my way"
And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going
And so castles made of sand
Slips into the sea eventually</field>

Will I ever find words
That give me motive to express
Bread
Will I go unfed
Will I be that who rushes on in
To where angels fear to tread
Was it me who bled
On the new death bed
And there is no fear
When you're leaning on love
Those greatful dead
Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must
Chess, let me play my best
When I do regress, let it all unwind
'Cause we're never confined
To the board unless
Less I second guess
Look into the sky where we all comply
With something higher than the
Rest of my love, sail through
Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must
Sky all around
Fell to the ground
Now I'm a child
Stayed for a while
Flesh is it meaning less
But we all protest
To the last request
Is there anything you
Could now suggest
Did I do my best
Did I leave it better
Even though we look to be
Just mildly obsessed with you
Sail through
Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone I do
To be there when push comes to shove

Searching for the unknown crumb
The crumb the crumb
Something or someone to come
Come along illuminate my lust
Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
Jooze the muse
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hotspot
Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room the groom
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hotspot.</field>

When you, you know all the time,
That a ninety mi-les an hour girl

You tell me it's al-right,
You don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a drive
You're just like

So hard to get through to you

I don't need to run over you

All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get to the other side of town
I'm not the only soul
Who's accused of hit and run
Tyre tracks all across your back I can (heh)
I can see you had your fun
But ah,darlin' can't you see my
Signals turn from green to red
And with you I see a traffic jam straight up ahead
You're just like

Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin down the barrel of a hot metal 45
Just another way to survive

California show your teeth,
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
She shoulda seen it comin when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
The day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn 'ya
A little loaded she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true, to say, say, say...
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it, up to Minnessota
North Dakota man was a gunning for the quota
Down in the badlands
She was saving the best for last

Gone too fast

We got many moons than a deeper place
So I keep an eye on the shadow's smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinning off, head is on my heart
It's like a bit of light and a touch of dark
You got sneak attacked from the zodiac
But I see your eyes spark
Keep the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say?
Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
Stumble down to the parking lot
You got no time for the afterthought
They're like ice cream for an astronaut
Well that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and
Find the world and show command
Playing the hand
Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
Do you want this love of mine?
The darkness helps to sort the shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it overtime?
The darkness helps to sort the shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Pick you up like a paperback
With the track record of a maniac
So I'm moving in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday
Honey where we roll
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky

The nova is over
Wake up and play
Balleradio
Make room for clara's bare feet
The love of a martian
Tick tock and waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I lost today
And these are the things that I
Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This martain ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards bark at donkeys
The love of a martian
Let's bow our heads
And let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone
God bless her little soul
She's got sword in case
Tho this is not her lord incase
The one who can't afford to face
Her image is restored to grace
Disappeared
No trace
Musky tears
Suitcase
The down turn brave
Little burncub bearcareless turnip snare
Rampages pitch color pages...
Down and out but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages
No loft
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude
For the sniffing black noses that snort and allude
To dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its
It's for you
Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck
Muscles and bottlenosed grifters
arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race
A shehive stare and chase wasted feature
Who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own mysteries
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters
Into the newmorning milk blanket
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get you broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights
Fallen freckles away</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I started when we were little kids
Free spirits
but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents
We got together and wrote on desks
A slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
A slipped through whatever cracks
We can find minds altered
We didn't falter in portraying hysterical
And tragic characters
In a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city
And the journeys away
From it we had not yet been
Or seen our friends selves
Chase tails round and round in
Downward spiral leaving trail
Of irretrievable vital life juice
Behind still the brothers blood
Comrades partner family
Cuzz was impenetrable
And we lived inside it laughing
With no clother and everything
Experimental till death was upon us
In our face mortality
And lots of things seemed futile
Then but love and music can save us
And did while the giant grey monster grew
More poisoned and spewing ugly shit around
Nothing is the same so we keep moving.
Went off and off and got some hair cuts
Lookin wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in san francisco
Two boys in san francisco
Blasted off in a bart bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
Mothersfuckers woke us up
Two young brothers on a hover craft
Telepathetic love and bellylaughs
Storm the stage of universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in london, england
Two boys in london, england
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kind and do the no no
Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathics love and belly laughs
We went to fairfax high school
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in l.a
proper
Two boys in l.a
proper
Stealin' anything that we could
Gotta sneak into the starwood
Gotta peak into the deep good
I remember 10 years ago
In hollywood we did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the butthole surfers
Always said it's better to regret
Something you did than something you didn't do
We were young and we were looking for the deep
Kick...

Beneath the heather lies a meadowlark

On your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
Taking acid in a graveyard
Stealing food to keep the night alive
Every day I try to play hard
Even with my lies
The day they found you on a tour bus
The news was barren as a desert bone
The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
A couple pictures shown
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
Slowly turning into driftwood
No one ever wants to die alone
Thinking that a pretty gift could
Make you less unknown
Dirty sneakers on the pavement
The brilliant features of a common man
See the miracle of your life
No one ever can
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
See the world go by
The changes that we entertain
I don't recall it all
Remember I have gone insane</field>

Calling calling I know you must be there
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
Throw me to the wolves
Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky
Because I know I'm coming back
easily</field>

Angeleen but the devil may care
Summer time to talk to and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I'll take to you the movies there
We could walk through Leicester Square
What could be wetter then
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice is yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primirose Hill
What could be wetter then
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
It's all right now
Call me now use the satellite
It's all right
It's all right
Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right now
It's all right
The California flower is a poppy child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thems
What could be wetter then
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right</field>

And the sound of laughing ed mcmahon, we got high
Educated by a world so full of self
And lost in space, too much pride
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts
Are juggling the juggernaut, soviet spy
Every now and then
When I remember to befriend
The little things in life
Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure
Hold my hand
I want to share it all with mary
Results are gonna vary now
Later on I'll read to you the things
That I've been needing to say goodbye
Walk away from mom and dad
To find the love you never had, tell no lies
Carry on and write a song that says it all
And shows it off 'fore you die
Take a little breath
Before you catch an early death
There is so much sky
Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure
Hold my hand
I want to share it all with mary
Results are gonna vary now
Skinny brains and little stains upon your face
Teenage remains tell me more
Lifted in the fifties
When you really rather drifted through time
Let's soar
Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure
Hold my hand
I want to share it all with mary
Results are gonna vary now</field>

In the name of spindestry,a burning bush and it busted me
Who stole all the rain and snow
Who will be my eskimo that's what I wanna know
It's time to under go, somewhere in Mexico
I'll make a room for you
A simple point of view, someone to deep the two
Searching for an eskimo, searching and I wanna know
Someone like you, desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an eskimo, someone like you.
In the name of Jesus Christ I
Sold my son and I named my prize I
Soo, just a little low
Who will be my eskimo, that's what I wanna know
Before I under go, somewhere in Mexico
I'll make a room for you, a simple point of view

Searching and I wanna know someone like you
Desperate and I gotta go, searching for an eskimo
Someone like you.
In the name of Oscar Wilde I
Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I
Go, toe-to-toe with a hoe, well to find an eskimo.</field>

Rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon

well I could be your friend
White clouds I'm in
A mitten full of fisherman
C'mon Huckleberry Finn
Show me how to make her grin
..
well I'm in Michigan
Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tiger come running
Just to steal your luck
(A rainy Lithuanian
Who's dancing as an Indian
Painted in my tiger skin
Especially in Michigan)
Double chins and bowling pins
Unholy Presbyterians
Land is full of medicine
I find it when I'm slipping in
..
into Michigan
(The tainted new libarian
Who fainted when she tucked you in
Let's float away like zeppelins
On stoic gusts of Northern Wind)
Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tiger come running
Just to steal your luck
Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tiger come running
Just to steal your luck
Life is my friend
Underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min
A porcelain that comes in twins
..
When I'm in Michigan
(Throw me in the looney bin
'Cause I can take it on the chin
The cleavage of your pillow skin
Is moving like a violin)
Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tiger come running
Just to steal your luck
Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tiger come running

God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old
Like I told you I'm in for the long, long

Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
Not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs about in God we trust
Some things slide but this is a must
Like I told you there is a time for finding out

People try to tell me what not to do
They shouldn't make it with a younger girl
And
Too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell them that I found a pearl
Well
Like I told you be careful what your asking for

Chours
Hey sister brutus
You got a mess of a better hand
Hey sister judas
Even you never had my back

She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude but I just didn't care
Had to find out these moments of air
And Stevie said all is fair
Like I told you there is something for everyone
Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really really wanted to say
And
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to flee
And
Like I told you there is more than meets the eye

Chorus
Hey sister brutus
You got a mess of a better hand
I said hey sister judas
Even you never had my back
I'm not trying to point fingers at you
I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl you know how to bring the pain
Like I told you I'd do it all again

Chorus
Hey sister brutus
I got a mess of a better hand
I said hey sister judas
Even you never had my back
Come on
Hey sister brutus
There's a fury to the woman's land
Hey sister judas
Even you never had my back</field>

I was looking for the triple,
Never playing good defence
Gunnin' for the glitter,
Every hot and heavy hitter,
She was never really there so I couldn't really get her
I said
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Piece of work, I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore,
A busy mind can go berserk
Oh feast on this, I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip, and I opened up the book
I said
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, is just a medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?
Be my wife, I think you right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...
Crack your whip, she's confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there, but not as much for round-trip
Oh all this time, I was searching for a dream
I was living in and out of every other sex machine
I said
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, is just a medicine
Makes you wanna cry, why don'd they let us in?
Be my wife, I think you right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith

Fall right into now

I'm falling into guru muhk
I'm falling into grace with you

She moves in a rapture
That her capsule might
Land on your star
Meditating in the morning
Head dressed in white
Beauty bazaar
You can smell the purple light
Comin' home her heart
Get lost and wet
I treat you like a teacher
`Cause that's what you are
I wanna be your pet
And when we get
In the same place

My god that I have ever seen
Tearin up my seraton and messing
With my dopamine

Wearing nothing but a cardigan
Oh Yohanna love my Yohanna love

When she told me no she would never..

Hot butter melts across your mouth

He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't
Oh yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't
Oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in
We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-six a number much too small for someone's golden years
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't
Oh yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bit my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't
Oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in
You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said, "oh, don't look back
Just look ahead"
You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said, "oh, don't look back
Just look ahead"
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't

Hide behind your rocks
Put down your guard
I'm not here to box
This is no showdown
So throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter
Where you come from
You could be from Park Ave
Or from a park bench
You could be a politician
Or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist
And you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together
Make a fist and fight
Not to your death
And not to your grave
I'm talkin' bout that freedom
Fight like a brave
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
If you're sick-a-sick n tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give yourself a break
Get it through your head
And get it off your chest
Get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying
The life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
He's one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid</field>

Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets down
Past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on
And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand
And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh I love you, girl
Oh I love you</field>

And then you mate it
Oh I, do you?
A funny thing, the king who gets himself assassinated
Hey now, every time I lose
Attitude
You took a town by storm
The mess you made was nominated
Oh I, do you?
Now put away your welcome,
soon you'll find you've Overstayed it
Hey now, every time I lose
Altitude
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Nevermind the consequences of the crime this time
My fortune faded
The medicated state of mind you find is overrated
Oh I, do you?
You saw it all come down and now
It's time to imitate it
Hey now, every time I lose
Altitude
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Nevermind the consequences of the crime this time
My fortune faded
Come on God, do I seem bulletproof?
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Nevermind the consequences of the crime this time
My fortune faded
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Nevermind the consequences of the crime this time

Well I've committed a funky crime

Hey you mister interview

This is what I grew into
Don't judge me and my soul stew
Funk is my attitude

Funky crime funky crime
Don't you know funk's colour's blind
Well I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind
Barriers of race
In the media take place
Tellin' you there is no room
For what you do, don't budge
There's no groove to your cold gloom
And who made you the judge
Always room for funky tunes
And yes I funk it up
I funk it up
Funky boy
Meets a funky girl
Make it funky, baby
Cause the funk is crazy
Why do you do what you do
I do what I want to do
Who said you could do what you do
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do

Jump a boy
Jump a girl
Jump a rope
Jump for joy
Just don't stop jumpin'
Keep your heart muscle pumpin'
Hillel be jumpin' on that little baby frumpkin
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?
When you're just standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs gettin' a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
Don't you know they're jumpin' foos, jump you!
Jump a nun
Jump a Jack
Jump for fun
Jump back
How's about us jumpin' in the sack?
And now, it's time for a jump attack

Christ, how'd ya think that he got so clean?
Not from sittin' on his goddamn spleen

Dancin' down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice lone chug-a-lug me
There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver

Can you make the time for me to come
and get it blessed somehow
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from
I don't take these things so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore
Somebody hooted and they hollered can I buy a vowel
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth
Before you start to growl
I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin
Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
She cried so hard, you know she looked like Alice Cooper
I don't think that it's so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin
I'm kissing high and low
Our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret
I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin</field>

Travel 'round the world gettin' naked on the stage
Bustin' people out of their everyday cage
We like to think, we make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud our mammy and our pappy
Funky young kings we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
Talkin' 'bout my buddy's funk it up fish bone
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day the good time boys, might just be president
Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
Our swinging's gonna shatter every stone cold face
Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Makin' more than money, more than money can buy
I stop and take a listen to the monsters try
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't believe me you can ask John Doe
'Cause his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you 'bout the band called Fire Hose
To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it
Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours

            <field name="lyrics">Suicide a month before I met you
Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl
In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time
Overkill you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light
Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight
Favor some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young
Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail
Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life
Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you
Serpentine, I think she was an aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo wonder
Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo story
Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail
Babe I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring
Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat
Suicide is never going to save you
When I cried, it was because I came too
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss this</field>

Got to chase those girls around
Westbound, drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound
Hustlers get what they deserve
But it's always half the gate
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date
See you around I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
See you around I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray
Curb you tongue oh scallywag
Because you've got no flag to wave
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have his day</field>

            <field name="lyrics">About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow
Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L
Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think you're just away,
you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'Cos everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?
Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace lovin' whales
flow through liquid outer space
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at them with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you
Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the american tradition
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?</field>

I met a girl who wants to save the world
Make it safe
For someone else to find their faith
I'm away I'm away Hanalei
A simple song and it made me cry
I really don't want to pass me by
A simple song that spoke of Hemmingway
The revolution in your blood
Creates the wave
I picked her up on the road to surf
Looked a lot like a mother earth
She said hello my name
Is Charlotte Gray, hey
Make it safe
For someone else to find their faith

Half blinded,

And I'm not about to hesitate and
One to treasure the rest of your days here and
Give you pleasure in so many ways dear and
Finally you have found something perfect and

Do you want me to show up for duty and
Serve this woman and honor her beauty and

Stay for a while if I may
Say it again and I’ll come around

To find a version of the truth
Left the backdoor swinging
Like a dirty little sleuth
The truth is I have never
Felt half this alive
Now it?s time to dance
Upon the grave called 45
Jacked up on some Kerouac
And surely bullet proof
The girl who taught me what to do
Was missing her front tooth
Gentle as a storm
Inside your mental health
I wanna find the answer
But I just can?t find myself
I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let?s run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown
Later I would look for love
Inside a woman?s dorm
A couch to keep me humble
And her breath to keep me warm
Ophelia was the girl
That I was feeling for
Come to realize
It was me who was the whore
A captain lost himself
Inside a 40 year old skull
The drink of choice was knowledge
And we always wanted more
Drunken sailors
Seeking their Geronimo
Instead they found the things
That they really didn?t wanna know
I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let?s run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown
Country roads
Would never let me stay
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
A devil?s growl and cat?s meow
Were blended into one
Termites called suburbanites
Were eating all the fun
A juggernaut of comedy
And blasphemy
I wanna stop the madness
But I think it has to be
I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let?s run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown
(Added to final song)
Country roads
Would never let me stay
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let?s run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown</field>

It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
Its not about the smile you wear but
The way we make out
When I was another all aloner
nothing but a true beach comber
Anybody seen the sky I'm
Im wide awake now
(Precussion solo)
(gon' getchya gon' shake it...)
Hump de bump doop badu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop badu
Oh no
Bump de hump doop badu
Bump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop badu
Bump Bump
Listen to what I said
And try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance
A chance to make out
Livin' in a citadel
It's hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll
And I am wide awake now
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
Its not about the smile you where but
The way we make out
When I was another all aloner
nothing but a true beach comber
Anybody seen the sky I'm
Im wide awake now</field>

I know is right
Don't want to live
Somebody elses life
This is what I want to be
And this is what I give to you
Because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time
I could die for you
Oh this life I choose
I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights
This eyes have seen
What I really want to do is
Turn into the motion
Beauty that I can abuse
You know that I use my senses to
You can see that
It's only everywhere
I'd take it on and then
I'd find a way to share
Come along and go
Along with me
Wonder with me yo
It's all for free
Chorus
I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose
Come again and tell me
When you wanna go
What it means for me
To be with you alone
Close the door and
Nonne has to know
How we are
Come along and go
Along with me
Wonder with me yo
It's all for free

My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
But now she's gone yes she's gone away
A soulful song
That would not stay
You see she hides 'cause she is scared
But I don't care
I won't be spared

There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky

Some of you sitting there
with your cock in your hand
Don't get you nowhere
don't make you a man
I heard somethin' 'bout my Ma' and my Pa '
They didn't want me
so they made me a star
I, I found out!
I, I found out!
Oh, Hare Krishna
ain'tgot nothing on you
Just keep you crazy
with nothin' to do
Keepin' you occupied with your pie in the sky
There ain't no guru
who can see
through your eyes
I, I found out!
I, I found out!
I've seen through junkies,
I've been through it all
I've seen religion from Jesus to Paul
Don't let them fool you
with them dope and cocaine
No one can harm you,
or feel your own pain

You want to get your look out
I felt the wind blow when
She took her little book out
I'm steady loving on the
Lady of these pages
Another chapter if you will
So advantageous
Down on the river tonight
Take off your glassess and fight
Under the heliomoon I'm
Going to pop the culture
Blue cherry dress on you
Is looking like a sculpture
This recreation is amusing
And confusing
You never knew that it
Could feel so good while losing
(What you lose, your virginity)
Down on the river tonight
Take off your glassess and fight
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
My intuition was a
Poppin' and a shakin'
The very thought of it was
All too much to take in
Curl up with lover we
Could lie out on the blanket
This canopy above I'll
Take the time to thank it
Down on the river tonight
Take off your panties and fight
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
I want to bury my face
Deep in your aroma
Her name is Lisa but
They call her Desmadona
Come out and see me for
Some street comunication
I think it's sweet of you
To be my motivation
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino

My body ripped and tore, I could have floated in space
Could have floated
I stumble 'round my home
I am on the outside My legs and arms are lead, feeling love from no one
Could have floated My head weighs ninety-pounds and I've been down
My friends are aliens and I've been down
Well now I've got no wife Cut a lizard's tail, it grows back to life
I killed some sleepless nights, my heart's torn to pieces
Could have floated I am the funny guy, yeah I've been down
I am the big rock star yeah I've been down
I'll never be the same, cause I've been inside out
And I want to be an animal and take care of my own
My head weighs ninety pounds and I've been down
My friends are aliens and I've been down
I know what it's like cause I've been down Devil sneaks in and deals and I've been down

Sing and dance, just to name a few
All I do,
All I do
And if I heard the angels sing
I'd sing it back to you
And bring sound of heaven ringing just for you
And if I saw the sun fall down
I'd pick it up and make a crown
One that was a perfect fit for you
We could take a walk
Into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue
We could find a place to stay
A secret little hideway
Spend a little time inside of you
All I do, all I do
All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on you
All I do, all I do, all I do, all I do</field>

He's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head
Mr Bonnie and Clyde guy
Lock him in the eye
He's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be
Confusion proof
Pudding's sweet
But too aloof
Orange eye girl
With blackslide Dew said
Yo homie
Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon
Mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
And a little lust
To the funky ass Flea bass
Most in the race
Just loose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space
Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go (oh woh woh)
Don't ask me why
I'm flying so high
Mr Bubble meets superfly
In my third eye
Searching for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand
My hand my hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on Vaudeville
I feel so good
Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood
If you have to ask
You'll never know

There's a flawless rain
In love dying
One foot in the astral plane
Someone's sighing
There's a virgin road
Waiting to be strode
Rope's untying
This power I could not withhold
Satisfying
What do we contain
Can't stop crying
These tears of change
Remain the same
My girl she shoots down
The baddest of guys
She knows that they
Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead
In love dying
Does it go two ways
In love dying
This body I cannot detain
Wake up flying
See the solar shores
Passers buying
The memories we readorn
In love dying
Nothing to obtain
In love dying
No crawling thru
The halls of fame
My girl she shoots down
The baddest of guys
She knows that they
Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead
In love dying
Loss becomes the gain
In love dying
Recreate me
So I may sustain
My girl she shoots down
The baddest of guys
She knows that they
Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead
In love dying

Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe
The many boots that you have laced could tell a story, comin night and day (?)
No one said that you would need a crowd
The many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make
And now i only see your face in clouds

Do you know
Does it show
When i'm low
And then again, when i feel your love from far away, i think of yesterday
I see a family we know how to smile
There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along
There comes a time when we will walk that mile

His soul monkey sperm tribes
Racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle
Givin' bush baby bush baby birth
The baby was a boy
But I think what stunned her
Is that this bare breasted baby
Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone
Came thelonious thunder
Fill the sky with hellfire
From way down down down under
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
Erupting from the ground
In Hollywood he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete
His funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano
I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein
Atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds
They make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man
It's time to take take take
Take the throne
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man

Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being being such a bore
I pray for you most every day
My love's with you now fly away

Into my car
I drive forever
And never get far
The 45 is slowly getting loaded
Send another song to my star
California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up
Get it off
All along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up
Get it off
We all walked your pavement
Get it off
Take more than your
Woah woah
Woah woah
A pendulum inside of my head
Swinging low I hope to get hit
The overflow is slowly adding up
Another drop will never fix it
California mountains in the morning
Get along
Get it off
All along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up
Get it off
We all walked your pavement
Get it off
Take more than your Faith
If I called you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I called you lately
I could be your man
Woah woah
Woah woah
Shut it down
Now look in my eyes
Knock 'em dead
A covered in flies
The big sleep
Without A bed of roses
A light of day
Will never tell lies
Fall along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up
Get it off
California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up
Get it off
We all walked your pavement
Take more than your faith
If I called you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I called you lately
I could be your man
On the river
Into my dock
I paddle through
The shadow and park
To ponder all of those
That came before me
Another piece for
Building my arch</field>

I'd do anything I could
Just to get you in my dirt word
Go down on you
Seventeen and thirty-one
I am just my mother's son
Brown eyes and a silver tongue
All the mothers come undone
At the sight of me

CHORUS:
The water's falling clear
Interiors decieve i fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away
Let's get soft
Let's get hard
Let's get off in my backyard
Where the desert wind
Will wash our skin
A lighter red
Let's make peace
Let's make war
Let's break into heaven for
A dance with heaven's devils or
Is that more than you can store
Inside your head
Chorus
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame
Let's get gentle
Let's get pissed
Get your knickers in a twist
Cause the angel and the devil kiss
They fell in love
Some seem dirty
Some say clean
Something from a madman's dream
Am I really what I seem?
Rising to my head like cream
It feels so strange
Chorus
Slay my shame
Slay my shame
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame.</field>

Where have you been in this world for so long
Well, I love a lover that feels like you
Would you like to tag along?
Well I really don't need any help little girl
But I think you could help me out anyway
Would you believe babe I've been looking for a sole
That feels like you
For some time
Excuse me while I see
If the gypsy in me is right
If you don't mind
Well he signals me ok
So i think it's safe to say
I'm gonna make a play
Oh yeah
See me walk towards you baby
Ah give me some
Oh get into it
Hey, hey little miss lover
Well now, there's so much you and me can discover
And i think we should start, hey, we should start right now, baby</field>

Everything of first impressions
Sweet successions
Been around for quite a while
I see you kept in versatile
Motivated to combine
Even when it's bad it's fine
Did she say something
That made you cry
Have you lost it all
The big fall
Oh so slowly
Comes back holy
Bishop takes a knight
But I will put up quite a fight
Here is your ham on rye
Elementary the chemistry
Means everything to me
The long progression's why
Set it off to collect knowledge
Quit a job
And go to college
All about the aftershock
Swedish latin super funk
Moses of Manhattan
Made it great
Pain we celebrate
And I love
The long progression indiscretion
Bishop takes a knight
But I will put up quite a fight
Here is your ham on rye
Elementary the chemistry
Means everything to me
The long progression's why
In between the reasons
Are the psychedelic seasons
Simple as your stride
Information intimated
Elegant and integrated
Sweep your floors with pride
Smile
'Cause it's all a ride
All supplied
And I love
Everything about this session
And this long progression</field>

Stiff club, its my nature,
Custom love is the nomenclature.
Turn down mass confusion,
Hit the road, because we just keep cruisin'.
Double my fun, double my vision,
Long hard look at my last decision.
Hustle here, hustle there,
Hustle me bitch and you best beware.
It's emotional and I told you so,
But you had to know so I told you.
Soft walk to horizon,
One big crash that no one dies in.
This for the folks in Pay-it-ville,
It'll come true if you say it will.
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
It's emotional and I told you so,
But you had to know so I told you.
Please don't you look right through me,
Hurts my heart when you do that to me.
Street lights out my window,
City make breeze,
gonna stroke my skindow
Just a lot of words
on annother brick wall,
Rob a lot of banks, got a pedigree scrawl.
Put my peg into your square,
Run around like we just don't care.
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, oh yeah
Woo!
Move it, ah, gotta get ya, wanna getcha
Move it, ah, gotta get ya, gonna getcha

'What did I miss?'
I watch the waves come in
Roll in, roll out
Without a single doubt
Love on a bluff
Is there ever enough
I stare into the air
Somewhere out there
The family affair
Bring home the night
Hey hey hey, I know
That you turned on the light
Hey hey hey, so slow
But you gave me the love of my life
She gave me the love
Coming up short
And I'm sad to report
We fuss and fight tonight
Your case, my case
Another day to waste
Lovers don't mix
When they can't even fix
A plot that has a twist
To share, my prayer
I need my baby back
Come home tonight
Woah
Hey hey hey, I know
That you turned on the light
Hey hey hey, so slow
But you gave me the love of my life

The hoover dam
My love can hide behind
A grain of sand
My love for life is fueled by
The love for my man
I love his mother and
The silly mystic man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues
My love is the zulu groove
My love is keep it or move
My love is a laughin' boozed
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is gettin' my food
My love, my love
My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love for a butter knuckle hands
My love for the swedes in the band
My love for the legs that I spin
My love for the fat mingy
My love, my love

kinds of the court shake and bake all takers
back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact
m-a-g-i-c see you on the court
buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
m-a-g-i-c magic of the buck
other teams pray for dreams
but he don't give a fuck
penetrating the lane like a bullet train
comes the magic blood a telepathic brain
knucklehead suckers better duck
when the buck comes through like a truck
scott stops pops and drops it in
on his way back gets a little skin
from the hand of a man named a

slam so hard break your t.v

take it to the hole make your mamma talk

cause they got more moves
that a bowl full of jelly
the buck stops here pops then cheers
a roar through the forum
that deafens my ears
the one and only know if his kind
sits in a throne
not for the records that he holds
but for being bald and bold

Worms out on the porch can
Leave the medicine
Oh well I'm game
For anything at all
Scarecrows a liar
Spends the year alone
No one checked it out
To see if it was real
Sold you the moon
And now it's time to fall
All in all it's like the
Bird who's trapped alone inside the cage
Love
What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
All in all it's just
A call of something wise beyond your room
There's a changing of a major chord
Your minor threat will do, love
My gun misfired
Shot myself instead I guess
I always knew I'd be the one to lose
Last scream don't slane
Time to make a move
What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
All in all it's like the
Bird who's trapped alone inside the cage
Love
A bird who's going to live at half your age, girl
A bird who's never really here to say
What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
Least of all she's like
A bird who's now been
Freed from someone's cage</field>

Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire
Jump up to meet
Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights
Just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file

And a pack of style
I say..
she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself
Until I'm done..
and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars
Make a diagram..

So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind
For the red on rust..

To see you on the corner
Well that I just can't bear
Meet me at the corner
And tell me what to do
Cause I'm messed up on you
And had I known
All that I do now
I'm guessing we're thru now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around in wait
Hey and I turn
I turn my head when I thought
I saw a sign
From the gods
A sign from the gods
That you weren't meant to be mine
And it's fine
Takin' it all for a ride
Until the day when it's gone
Mystified by where
It all went wrong
When it's gone
I live and I learn
And I lose and I win
But it's better than ever
Whenever I'm in
I thank you girl
For everywhere that we've been</field>

It's like always this point of collision
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
Three pound of love
About to burst
Inside my three pound Universe
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
Symbols I've been given to express my goal
Always come up short
You know they just don't get that low
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
Quick release chemicals
strike with incomprehensible precision
Biorganic electronics targeting
microscopic destinations of devistation
Cleaner than light
Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most
as the uncontrollable soldiers
Of suffering succotash
Instantaneous infiltration
leaves me with a case of bustation,
Frustration,
Alone in the constellation of alienation
detached from empty conversation
I wait
I wait
For the wave to break</field>

I've got a nonstop "Yo swan" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No I cannot keep my mouth shut
Rockin' to the beat of the fabulous forum
My Lakers I adore 'em
Blush my lady when I tell her
That I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella
I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things
Good God, where's my sleigh now
Good God, playing for days now
Good God, any day now
Good God, take me away now
Good God, purple haze now
Good God, the baddest of brains now
Good God, any day now
Good God, ridin' my sleigh now
Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Goodman Truman Copote
Talking about my thoughts 'cause they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on my porch 'cause I lost my house key
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo
Good God, where's my sleigh now
Good God, playing for days now
Good God, any day now
Good God, take me away now
Good God, De Niro's insane now
Good God, rackin' my brain now
Good God, any day now
Good God, take me away now..
take me away
Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brothers bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of my favorite things.</field>

The art of noise philosophy

Mercy Mercy Mercy me
Come around
I need another enemy
Anyone could clearly see
The summer breeze
is part of my anatomy
When it's written in britain
We get a little smitten
Like a kitten
The cuddle is where I'm benetfittin'
Any higher the buyer
Would have to pacifier
Up on the wire the flyer
Is gonna satisfy her
My love is forever
By law we can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this
Mercy mercy mercy me
Comin' down
I've got a case of gravity
Even though we disagree
Give a kiss
'Cause life could be the death of me
Acrobatic the static
Is getting to dramatic
Comin' down with the system
We're getting' systematic
Facilitating the mating
My love is circulating
Rejuvenating the fading
But never dilating
My love is forever
By law we can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this
Mercy mercy mercy me
Lovin' on the color of an Emily
Easy as a guarantee
Better yet I'll show you
What you want to see
My love is forever
By law we can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this
Re-enter forever
I want you to feel this
My gentle defender
Step forward and steal this</field>

Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one
Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf
[Pre Chorus:]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
[Chorus:]
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of scorpios a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know
Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees

Over the moon by midnight

Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this

Do you believe in one steer-in
I'll be there; just because I can

The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough, I ask, and are you on to task?
The calicos of Pettibon where cultures come to clash
Several of my best friends wear the colours of the crown
Mary wants to build it up
And Sherri wants to tear it all back down, girl
The saviour of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight
The cross between my former queen, her legendary stare
The holy tears of Ireland, the lovely cross to bear
Several of my best friends know the secrets of this town
And Mary wants to raise it up
And Sherri wants to spit it all around, girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight
Several of my best friends wear the colours of the crown
Mary wants to build it up
And Sherri wants to tear it all back down, girl
The saviour of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses
Hey
We all want the rose you know
Hey
Show us love before you go
Say I will then say I want to
The story knows that I will never taunt you
Hey
We all want the rose you know
Hey
Show us love before you go
Say I will then say I want to

Of your loneliness
Confide..

You know I will, you know I will
Ex Girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want..
to give her 7 years
For being sad
CHORUS :
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words..
I know of to express
This emptiness
CHORUS :
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
Imagine me taught by tragedy
Release is peace
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give..
your love
No matter what
is what she said</field>

Ever fill the

But I know you won't come back

Just in case

There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps
Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away gonna make it my home
Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind
Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can't taste the salt when I lick his tail
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight
Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Runnin' through the woods laughing at the blues
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift good Lord I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness
Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way
In the waterfall I just wanna play
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor

For you, I do
I thought I done it all, I thought I knew
But nothing ever looked as clear as you
Now every never that I knew was fine
Never is a long time

Stolen goods aren't always half that bad
The never that we'll always
You are you are the star I said
From far from far from far away
The love that called it all to stay
By you, by you, by you, by you
A fate is happening on your dress
Will always have a place I guess
By you, by you
All the love that we can bless
The pleasure of my child's best
Lonely books and tenderness
Rescue me from emptiness
You are, you are the star I said
From far, from far, from far away

A bat

What's more - she snores
And that is a fact
Cow eyes lie
Yes it's time to resist
How did I ever
Get into this
How could I ever
Have kissed that bitch
So what if she's
Got big tits
She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit
She came like a cat
Like a cat to cat nop
She came in my lap
With her womanly hips
When I first met her
I came unglued
I played the part of
A blueblooded fool
I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd
Get the last laugh
She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit
Like two trains on one track
Bound for a crash
Two red white and blues we were
Destined to clash
I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
Like fly by night news
We were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by
You and your wack attack
Jump back for chump love
You won't be back for cover
But no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
I thought that your love
Was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride
When I realized that
The smack in my bag
And my baseball bat
Was all you were after
You dirty rat
She's a bitch and a brat
And a living disaster
She thought she was fast
But I was faster
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker.</field>

On a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go
Shake it off
Just to redirect my flow
Come on let's go
Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor mouthing off
In front of every other road block
Come again and tell me
What you're going thru
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
Come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
You always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew thru
Looking up into
A reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up
Another stubborn scorpio
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor mouthing off
In front of every other road block
Come again and tell me
What you're going thru
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
To the moon she gave
Another good review
Turn around and look at me
It's really really you</field>

Submerge into the urge of we
Deliciously the mystery
One big mob aw yea aw yea
One big mob aw yea aw yea
Eh bara mala aw yea aw yea
Eh bara mala aw yea aw yea
Ooze into into my noodle
East or west shepherd or poddle
Lady bug pinetree
To mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun
And a brother to the cool breeze
Chorus :
Scrawled upon the wall
Of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note
That spoke to all
One two buckle my shoe
Take care of me
Cause I might be you
We live in the city
We live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking
A thimble humble
Everything you ever see
Is never more than you and me
Give it on into the beauty of the mystery
One big mob in one big home
A broken home
I'd like to share some air with you
Some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives
to give and give
What was I thinking in my head
The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost
A sullen cost
Picaboo street in Timbuktu
Do I need repeat
That a boy named Sue ?
Rockin' to the beat
Of the kangaroo
Let me kiss your feet
And your forehead too.</field>

Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike
Am I all alone
She said all we
Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss
Am I all alone
One hot minute
And I'm in it come and get it
If I chase it
Am I all alone
Close your eyes
And click your heels
Can you believe
How good it feels
Am I all alone
One hot minute
And I'm in it come and get it
If a chase it I might waste it
Come and get it
I might waste it
Come and get it
Am I all alone
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
A tiny wink is all
All we have
No it's not much more
But don't get mad
Am I all alone
Three lbs
of love
Inside my skull
A million more lives
It's never drill
Just a few times spun
Spun around the sun
A couple more or less
And then we're done.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">So we were down in Brazil and
And that place is wild, we were in Rio de Janeiro
And we had this sort of a security guard, tough guy
And he was supposed to take us around
I said hey could, you know, could you take us to the?
The favelas and show us the prostitution
And the drug deals and the night fights and
You know, the street life of your town
He said: "sure" so we, we pull up to this hooker and
She's wearing this kind of a bright green mini skirt
And it turns out it's a transexual
I said: "get over here" and she comes over
And she thinks she's busted
But she's not busted, no she's not busted
We just wanted to smack her in the ass a few times
I say, hey what's up girl?
Chorus
I get out of bed
And I clear up my head
I don't want to go
But I do it instead
We are dreams
Within a dream
I get into bed
And I turn off my head
I started to float
Was it something she said
We are dreams
Within a dream
? So I remember we got our driver's license
And my friend Hillel had this little Datsun painted green and in?
Hollywood we get so crazy in the winter
The rains would come and the hills
Would just kind of melt down into the city lights and
Well you know we'd smoke weed and we'd go up in the hills
And we'd listen to progressive rock music
And just kind of trip out and
Well we were dreaming, you know, we were dreaming
And we were talking about what we wanted to do
And we were talking about girls and music and?
You know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star
I didn't even know what that was and I was like
"whatever you want to do man
I'm coming with you, I'm right with you my friend"
Chorus
I get out of bed
And I clear up my head
I don't want to go
But I do it instead
We are dreams
Within a dream
I get into bed
And I turn off my head
I started to float
Was it something she said
We are dreams
Within a dream
Why in the world would you want it to be
Why would you wanna take it so, so little really
All this things that come down from the sky
Raining upon your head
Make me stop and wonder why
Can I just spell it out, make it clear
Make it easy to read
For the simple man like me?
I don't think so
I reached out to my family and I said
"It's not about religion and the god
Sitting in the chair in the sky
With a punishing hand", no
It's about heaven in your heart
Now, when can we start?
I wanna choose love instead of fear
Won't you come right now over here
And we come now
Let me make it easy this time
I love you</field>

The fax city 4 were four young men
Time has come and now we jam
With the uplift mofo party plan
We're the organic anti-beat box band
One comes from the Holy Land
Another was born an Australian
Me I'm from Michigan
But Hollywood is the land of lands
It's a Hollywood jam
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the Hollywood jam
Organic anti-beat box band
Life is grand in the land of lands
The mind does boggle the mind expands
The anarchy 4 have manned their craft
Get on your knees and shake your ass
To the jam that is
We don't ask we demand
That you and your clan
Listen now to this jam
To the power of the drummer 'cause the drummer is bad
It's a Hollywood jam
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the Hollywood jam
Organic anti-beat box band
There's a party in my town at 12:00
There's a party that's rockin' down to the rock
I've got nothin' against hip hop
But there's a party in my town
And no beat box
Jam that is
The party's got girls the girls got hot
The party's got boys and the boys got socks
Something popped the doors unlocked
House got up ran around the block
Sit down house
Take off your blouse
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
Any good friend of the lollypop kids
Over the rainbow with the wizz
We represent the Hollywood jam
Organic anti-beat box band
With the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam
Dance that is
It's a Hollywood jam
With the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam
Dance that is
It's a Hollywood jam
With the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam
Dance that is
It's a Hollywood jam
With the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam
Dance that is
It's a Hollywood jam

You just might slam

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spitting' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side

L.a
is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton pickin' maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps
But I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump
When I lick the ripe pick
Like a come on a thumb
Poppin' hump, hump, hump, pop out
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
'cos I'm shooting for the top
And my best friend is flea
Oom chucka willy knew the balls to pop
But he never met the tree
So he never be-bopped out hop!
Antwan the swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat
And between his legs was a sweat young lass
He threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love 'em all
By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop
Because that's when he thought that he heard a phone
Last night and the night before,
I heard a fop outside,
then I came in doors
Freak out!
Now that I told you a little something about the flea
A little something about the tree,
A little something about me
I can't leave you hangin' but my man shermzy,
He swings the yang, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his playin',
You better be burning sherman!
We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way

I was bleeding put it good onto a daffodil

Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns of Bogenvilia

Barely there, your voice is crackin' up across state lines
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you, you're out of range
Skies of ecstacy we're breaking well I do believe
The tears of God were falling down upon my

Be yourself
Some let her call
Never fall
See yourself
Sit alone and wait
To my own call
Go ballistic
Anarchistic
Smack my mouth and
Then you kissed it
So long, my gun
Simple run and
Letter bum
Things are looking good on paper
Once when I was in your favour
This kiss is a mess
Send my girl riddle less
It’s over
It’s over now
So long to riddle songs
It’s over
It’s over now
I dare not read a song
See yourself
Sad, alone and wait
To my own brawl
Free yourself
There’s an only count
This stands for all of them
Just play at any tempo
Going mad and going mental
All balm, said no
Just to let him put it wrong
It’s over
It’s over now
So nice to get along

Dying for your art

Take it for me anyway

            <field name="lyrics">I saw you at the police station
And it breaks my heart to say
Your eyes have wondered off
To something
Distant, cold and gray
I guess you didn't see it coming
Someones got use to slumming
Dreamin' of the golden years
I see you had to change careers
Far away
But we both know it's somewhere
I saw you on the back page of
Some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eyes said
Nothing short of love for pay
I know you from another picture
Of someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fool around and pull some capers
Not today
Send a message to her
A message that I'm coming
I'm coming to persue her
Down home country and
I rest my face on your bed
I got you ten times over
I'll chase you down till your dead
I saw you on the t.v
station
And it made me want to pray
An empty shell of loveliness
Now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny papers
Smilling was your money maker
Somone oughta situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way
It's time to come and find you
You can't hide from me girl
So never mind what I do
Down home country and
I rest my face on your bed
I'm in my soul bed country
And I left it all for your head
I saw you in the churchyard
There was no time to exchange
You were getting married and
It felt so very strange
I guess I didn't see you coming
Now I guess it's me whos bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today
Not for me but someone
I never could get use to
So now I will refuse to
Down home country and
I rest my face on your bed
I'm in my soul bed country
And I left it all for your head
I got my best foot forward
And I'll chase you down till your dead</field>

I'm in your house now let me spin
Python power straight from Monty
Celluliod loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
She's too free I'm the patient
Black and white red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
I'm purple stain - I know
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
Up to my ass in alligators
Let's get it on with alligator haters
Did what you did-did what you said
What's the point yo what's the spread
Black and white red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
I'm purple stain - I know
And if I call you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's the way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where - I go
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

Unspoken words were understood

Feather light but you can't move this
Farley is and angel and I can prove this
Purple stain upon my pillow
Let's sleep weeping willow
Black and white red and blue

Come hit the funk on your way

Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of syncopated but not yet sunk
I will listen low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
How I wish it was so
When you told me that you were solid gold
Gravity free as she looked at the highness
On a mattress full of anti-matter
You never left a very mellow impression
You smell or you go to hell expression
Quixotic elixir might
but probably will not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how,
did I get your lipstick on my kite
I love this weather, it's a perfect storm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form
I love this weather 'cause it keep me warm
Just keep it coming in it's perfect form
Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Oh, lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind in a medicated state
Is a highly overrated fate
Terrible is a soul which you told me
That there is such a thing
Do you know that you glow
When you go from winter into spring
I love this weather, it's a perfect storm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form
I love this weather 'cause it keep me warm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form
The madder the boy
The sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick get strong
Mad boy
Sad song
A wicked fade but the sick get strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
I refuse to punt on forth and long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick get
Kick back a little just watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of syncopated but not yet sunk
I will listen low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
How I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you
I stand before this not known confused
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you

I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you</field>

And this is work I've set to do
I let my motor stray
Forgive me where I play
Sendin' my love to Tennessee
She got style now lets see
And remember who
To surrender to
The captain of my ship is brave
It's brothers hood on a mothers day
Do do do dit do
Oh, sure enough I love you
Oh, sure enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to
I'm off to wonderland
Just in my second hand
Life is short but it ain't planned
I'm away outside but in demand
I'll take it on my chin
Go back and forth again
Find me on some telephone
With a broken down voice and a shake-ed tone
Do unto others who
You would have do to you
Ain't no way I'd ever trade
That sparer life for this piece of shade
Destined for battle zone
Why's there no lesson known?
The lesson's not to wait for me
Unless you got a taste for the bittersweet
Do do do dit do
Oh, sure enough I love you
Oh, sure enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to
Let your jaw decide
Let your jaw divide
Everything we do
Let your jaw decide
Let your jaw divide
Everything we do
Let your motor ride
Let your motor ride
Everything we do
Oh! Help me!
Do do do dit do (4x)
Oh, sure enough I love you

We could have skated through

Save this lady for me
Save this lady for me
Save this lady for me
Call me alabama I'm a seminole prize
Got time square hair and a bedroom eyes
Keystone cops and the billy bob chops
Gonna scare my kids gonna share my crops
Vampire blood and a baseball glove
Justa a little bit of what the girl is made of
National crash into the big lampoon
With a creature coming up from the black lagoon
Save this lady for me
Save this lady for me
Save this lady for me
Save this lady for me
Losing ground true sounds of liberty
The forest of the north might hold the key
Rocking to the rythm of a ragtime band
Black flag wave on on my truck my man
Basketball jones and the great unknowns
Got cheap cologne seventy-six trombones
Looking for the lady that won't be afraid
When heaven needs a hammer gotta get things made
I got more love than anything else

Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra
The more I have something to bring
And now I see you in a beautiful

He’s just a man and any damaging done
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came
Dusting off your savior
Forgiving your behavior
He’s just a man-All in a hand
Your hero’s designated to waver
Anyone can-Always my man
I would never betray you
Look at me who could raise you
Face in the sand-Safe in your hand
You were always my favorite
Always my man-All in a hand
We are the read hots
And we’re loving up the me nots
The flowers in your flower pot
Are dancing on your table tops
And now I see you in a beautiful

He’s just a man and everything he does
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came
Dusting off your savior

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
Southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to ma and pa 'cause

This lonely view
With the birds I'll share
This lonely view
Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon even if I have to crawl and
With the birds I'll share
This lonely view...
Scar tissue that I wished you saw
Sarcastic mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause

Somebody gotta help me please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby detonate for me
Look out honey, 'cause i'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Soul radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight
Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby penetrate my mind
And I'n the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin, searchin to destroy
And honey i'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin, searchin to destroy

To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're gonna get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumpin' that drivin' bad rythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Suckin' on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Pump that leman 'till it pouts
Open your legs to the sensual sound
With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hug the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down
Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Gettin' it gettin' it gettin' it good
In my head, as a hellified hum
I take to rubbin' her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb i strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like, ooh, how rum
Well I like to make her cum
To the rythm of the drums
Make cum, make cum, cum</field>

you're my sexy mexican maid
let me please get on my knees
i come alone
when i wake up in the morn
she greets me where i lay
i look outside to find it's a bright and sunny day
so serene she gives to me my toast and marmalade
what more can i say she's my sexy mexican maid
let me please get on my knees
she puts me in a bubble bath
she tickles me and i laugh
she washes me until i'm clean
then she does a little sexy dance
happy to feel my hand go slap
upon her sexy ass
we make fun so very slow
then we make it very fast
let me please get on my knees
oh let me please.</field>

In fear of such a curse
Shallow be thy game
2000 years look in the mirror
You play the game of shame
And tell your people live in fear
A rival to the way you see
The bible let him be
I'm a threat to your survival
And your control company
Chorus :
You'll never burn me

You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody
To anyone who's listenin'
You're not born into sin
The guilt they try and give you
Puke it in the nearest bin
Missionary maddness
Sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways
Is par for the course
It's fucking rude
To think that you're above
The laws of nature is a joke
Purple sasfies feeding masses
Smoke on which to choke
I might be a monkey
When it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred
Get down on your knees and..

No lullaby kid no 5%
Any way you want to cut that cake
She's dyin' from the likes of abandonment
Lost in the valley without my horses
She need somebody to hold
It looks to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me all right
Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me all right
It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in
It's a dirty walk back
Gonna learn awe way too much
Shootin' dope in the back
Of a cadillac jack
Slow down the road to my back 40
She needs somebody to hold
It looks to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me all right
Down in the south seas
Give me your mouth please
Resuscitation
Is the way I find these
I give you major
You give me minor
Don't fade away
Like an ocean liner
Now
Lost in the valley
Without my horses
No one can tell me
What my remorse is
God made this lady
That stands before me
She need somebody to hold
She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me she looks to me
All right
Down on the bathroom floor
She's searching for another light
She looks to me she looks to me
All right</field>

Don't like the rolling stones
She took a short cut
To being fully grown
She's got the mood ring
Her little sister rose
The smell of springsteen
A pair of pantyhose
This talking picture show
Is leaking from a silhouette
She said my man you know
It's time to get your fingers wet
Your hustle's busted when
You can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
You were screaming "handle it"
Knock the world right off its feet
And straight onto its head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds
And light will shed
I heard some p-funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend
It's on your bloodline
A perfect frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I'm gonna make you mine
It's understood
You wrap your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your kitty at the discotheque
I put my lovin' in your oven
Not ahead to check
The last I heard from you
You we're screaming "resurrect"
Knock the world right off its feet
And straight onto its head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds
And light will shed</field>

Not something that I expected
Now I smile from your affection
We have made a soul connection
Just for whom does your bell toll
Don't be cold show me your soul
Sentimental gentlemen are not afraid
To show you when I am you
You're my best friend
Show me your soul
In a world that can...
Yes I find you so appealing
When you show me how you're feeling
You my friend need not be kneeling
Open up and stop revealing
Trust in me, my heart is whole
I need to see
Show me your soul
Sentimental gentlemen...
In a world that can...
Don't expect too much from me
Perfection is no test for me
Because the best I'll ever be

Show me your soul.

California dreamin' is a pettibon
La's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Stick n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche
People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Super heroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Before the wind before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho
Sir Psycho Sexy that is me
Sometimes I find I need to scream
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go
Deep inside the Garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no that would be treason
Believe me Eve she gave me good reason
Booty lookin' too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' 'cause she's the receiver
I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over achiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that I met one time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that left me blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man he's the man he's the man
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea yea
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go
I got stopped by a lady cop in my automobile
She said get out and spread your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said "What's up?" now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped "Ooo that's tight"
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea I'm the man that you met one time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea I'm the man that leaves you blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea I'm the man I'm the man I'm the man
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea yea
Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mamma that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms in your legs in your pussy I'd kill
To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you
Lay me down lay me down lay me down lay me down
Lay me down lay me down lay me down lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickity split go snap "snap"
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right of the map
Ooo and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while</field>

Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake
Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away
Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it’s on today
Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say
I know a girl
She worked in a store
She knew not what
Her life was for
She barely knew her name
They tried to tell her
She would never be
As happy as the girl
In the magazine
She bought it with her pay
Everyone has
So much to say
They talk talk talk
Their lives away
Don’t even hesitate
Walking on down
To the burial ground
It’s a very old dance
With a merry old sound
Looks like it’s on today</field>

Please don't turn me into them
Stand by for the great eclipse
Rip it out now shake your hips
Backing off the apocalypse
I gotta loosen up
I gotta loosen up to get my grip

Nothing major or too complicated

Cut my heart out
With a feather
And put an end
To any extra pressure

Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for
Ride around on mellow waves of mercy
And fill the space with lack of controversy
For someone
Someone
Set it up to follow you
On my aeroplane
Here's a present
For the future memory lane
Someone
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone

Light it up the room
She sang into any twane
Hit 'em up cause you got me
A mop to your plane

Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said please

You gotta let it be oh yea
Where I go I just don't know

When I find my peace of mind

Oh so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self-destruction
It's a bitter berry and its very sweet
I'm on a roller coaster
But I'm on my feet
Take me to the river lay me on your shore
I'll be comin' back baby, I'll be comin' back for more
Diddle doddle ding a zing a dong bong

Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude

She claims that she can hear my baby screaming to me "fuck me"
Every day, when I'm in the hay
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah
Struck by lust in a telephone booth
Busted by a cop; he said "That's uncool"
He said that she can hear my baby screaming to me "fuck me"

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy

When I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find
Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into space
And this is where I find a way
[Chorus]
The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming 'n' I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming 'n' I'm warming
Pushing myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now
[Chorus]
Alone inside my forest room
And it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start
Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I'm calling
Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I'm sorry
[Chrous]
And this is where I find
Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen
Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand
The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming

I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
Every other day you say
You're gonna have to bury 'em
Famous last words
Spoken from the laserium
Descendants had to record
Sayin' somethin' 'bout Milo
You can take the a train

Most of my fears
Been coming on strong
For most of my years
Add up and end up in a song
Cellophane tweeds and revenue streams
Are blocking my shots and killin' my dreams
That showed me how to be the cause
Hey ah, what now?
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time, for me, I see
She wants to belong and, I want to be free
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee
All of my friends and enemies
They were part of this dance
That put me right here we go
So glad I got this chance
Better known plans
And lesser known schemes
Were all about love and less about me
I'd have to say she wore the pants
That's oh!
It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time for me, Uh-hu
She wants to belong and, I want to be free
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee
I've been left
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time, for me, lets see
She wants to belong and, I want to be free
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's me
It's a long time, for me, uh-uh
She wants to be rich and, I want to be free
Keep your plans elastic 'cause there ain't no, guarantee</field>

I'm on the pavement thinking about the goverment
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,
Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off
Paid off
God knows when but you're doin' it again!
You better duck down the alleyway lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten
So look out kid
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A.
Walkin' on your tip toes, don't try no doze
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
Cause we don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Looks to me like you did
A little to much hittin' kid
You should've took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid, kid
Look out, kid
The good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chillin' em, thrillin' em, and red hot killin' em
Killin' em
I said killin' em
Get sick, get well, hand around an ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail
But users, cheaters, six time losers
Hand around the theatres
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid

That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be

make you wiggle like a wiggley worm
Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole

Crying eyes open

In love with you
No not at all

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Busted in two
Like a brittle stick
I could not drink Because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream
No
I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk
I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye my love
Goodbye my love
I am not alive
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Funny how the price gets paid</field>

This is my tear
I can see clearly now
That this is not a place
For playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time
This is my tear
Comin' on strong
Baudelaire
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime
[Chorus:]
All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end, and then
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
oh never know
Devil may cry devil may care
Distiller's got a scream
And now I know just why
When she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time
California skies
Got room to spare
This is my time
[Chorus]
Take it outside
Take it out there
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time
[Chorus]</field>

Just lose and lose
First time I saw you
You were sitting
Backstage in a dress
A perfect mess
You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love
Chorus :
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
I liked your whiskers
And I liked the dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes
You painted pictures
Cause the one
Who hurts
Can give so much
You gave me such
C horus
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so</field>

I guess I'll have to learn
The good with the bad
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love
I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be the lonely one if you should say we're through
Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
Even you should say goodbye
I still go on loving you
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love
I cried a tear

Well if you want to make me cry

Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see the lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye
'Cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody
Lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's only promising
This place was made on you
Tell me baby what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time on
Tell me lover are you lonely
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find out
Tell me baby what's your story
Where do you come from
And where you wanna go this time on
You're so lovely are you lonely
Of giving up on the innocence you left behind
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle Brothers on the microphone
Getting over with the undertone
It's time to torn to stone
Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life could be a little sweet
But life could be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fitty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home</field>

Who said three is a crowd?
We better get it on the go
Hey, now

Oh Maggie makes it in her cloud
I said, hey, now
We gotta make it rain somehow
She told me to
And show me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
Rain dance maggie advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods?
Little did I know her body was one delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit
Hey, now
We've gotta make it rain somehow

We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap
The cups went up like a natural fact
It was our shoulder space
That made the perfect place
For the magic of the cup
To style out with grace
With a tight turn twist
And a slight swerve swank
The brothers cup kissed
With a kick ass clank
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap
The cups went up like a natural fact
So love all your brothers
And love all your sisters
Love all the misses
And love all the misters
Don't be shy when you're sharin' your kisses
The brothers cup kiss
And we ain't sissies
It is our notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake
of the green sea's motion
The long rocking swell
of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace it's the perfect peace motion
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the power of the cup we are about to astound
All your preconceptions they will come unbound
We are the brothers cup coming to your town
Bringing tubs of love
we're going to spread it around</field>

Take me through the future
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend
We would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let's go you show
Me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination
Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
(Another lonely superstar
to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside
a lover that another tried)
Complete repeat
Sitting in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let's steal this wheel
Take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound
Turn it up and no we can't be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep
Find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend
Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
(Another lonely superstar
to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside
a lover that another tried)
That's right you're right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
The song is fascination
Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
The lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
A May December
Might not be so smart
(Another lonely superstar
to getaway inside your car)
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
(Surrender to the brave inside
a lover that another tried)
Don't be late cause you're my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays</field>

Strawberries left to decay
Can't find my pants or my bank account

Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every sunset marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea
I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay
Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every sunset marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea
The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray

Whatever you do
Don't tell me why
Poppies grow tall
Then say bye bye
The wave is here
A seamless little team
And then we tanked
I guess we're not so sacrosanct
The tip of my tongue
But then we blanked
The wave is here
Waiting on the wind
To tell my side
Ready set jet
But she never gets far
Listen to your skin
From the seat of my car
Two centipedes stuck
In one glass jar
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind
To tell my side
What you want?
What you need?
Do you love?
Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day
Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came
Sterile as the barrel
Of an old 12 gauge
Under my skin
And half my age
Hotter than the wax
On a saxifrage
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind
To turn my page
Steady your sails
For the butterfly flap
Whatever you do
Don't close that gap
I'm dreaming of a woman
But she's just my nap
Your ship is in
Waiting on the tide so I can swim
What you want
What you need
Do you love
Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day
Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came
Now I know why we came
Now I know</field>

the mind does boggle the mind expands
the anarchy 4 have manned their craft
get on your knees and shake your ass
to the jam that is
We don't ask we demand
that you and your clan
listem now to this jam
to the power of the drummers bad
it's a hollywood jam
We represent the hollywood kids
hollywood is where we live
we represent the hollywood kids

There's a party in my town at 12:00
there's a party that's rockin down to the rock
I've got nothin' against hip hop
but there's a party in my town
and no beat box jam that is
The party's got girls the girls got hot
the party's got boys and the boys got socks
something popped the doors unlocked
house got up ran around the block
sit down house
take off your blouse
We represent the hollywood kids
hollywood is where we live
any good friend of the lollypop kids
over the rainbow with the wiz
we represent the hollywood kids

you just might slam dance that is.</field>

I've got a soul
That cannot sleep
At night when something
Just ain't right
Blood red
But without sight
Exploding egos
In the night
Mix like sticks
Of dynamite
Red black or white
This is my fight
Come on courage
Let's be heard
Turn feelings Into words
American equality
Has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace
This is my hour
Can I get
Just a little bit of power
Chorus
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (hollow tree)
The power of equality
Right or wrong
My song is strong
You don't like it
Get along
Say what I want
Do what I can
Death to the massage
Of the Ku Klux Klan
I don't buy supremacy
Media chief
You menace me
The people you say
'Cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker
And smell the slime
Blackest anger
Whitest fear
Can you hear me
Am I clear
My name is peace
This is my hour
Can I get
Just a little bit of power
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (hollow tree)
The power of equality
I've got tapes
I've got CD's
I've got my public enemy
My lilly white ass
Is tickled pink
When I listen to the music
That makes me think
Not another
Motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something
For his own ambition
Never touch
The sound we make
Soul sacred love
Vows that we take
To create straight
What is true
Yo he's with me
And what I do
My name is peace
This is my hour
Can I get
Just a little bit of power
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (hollow tree)
The power of equality
Madder than a motherfucker
Lick my finger
Can't forget
'Cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick
Little piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick
Eat my thickness
I've got a welt
From the bible belt
Dealing with the hand
That I've been dealt
Sitting in the grip
Of a killing fist
Giving up blood
Just to exist
Rub me wrong
And I get pissed
No I cannot
Get to this
People in pain
I do not dig it
Change of brain
For Mr Bigot
Little brother do you hear me
Have a heart oh come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
What ever happened to humanity
What ever happened to humanity
What ever happened to humanity</field>

We all long, we all face
(Added to final song)
I'm so tired
Well I get by
But I could use a few
And I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way
The sun beats down
Upon my lonely face
A perfect world
with all its perfect places
I could use a few
For just in cases
And I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way</field>

Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash your light on
Take a look it's on display - for you
Coming down no not today
Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up it's on with stella
What a way to finally smell her
Pickin up but not to strong - for you
Take a piece and pass it on
Fly away on my Zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on my wind
Rebel and liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look its on display - for you
Coming down no not today
Fly away on my Zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We'll find a place together
What what what what what what - do you?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
What what what what what what - want you?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Fly away on my Zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We're gonna live forever
Forever</field>

Lets sing a new revival
Chemical circus at the pub
Mentally she's departed
Cut me a check I'll cut your rug
Later we'll get bombarded
'Cause everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
Girl your father is dead
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is there always red
In your wedding bed
Everybody knows
Officer please I just got there
Traveled from door to door
Haven't you seen my girlfriend's hair
What are we looking for
'Cause everybody knows
This is the kitt I can't compare
A delicate new arrival
Check the commute I do declare
I think we have our bible
'Cause everybody knows
Take me to the shore
Show me what it's for
Is there always red
In your wedding bed
Everybody knows
The game is full of cons and pros
Like your mother said
Girl your father's dead

Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid
This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene
Can I kiss your dopamine
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it but I gotta know
This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
I saw you out there yesterday
What did you wanna say
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray
What did you wanna say
A masterpiece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
Can I smell your gasoline
Can I pet your wolverine
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean
I don't wanna take it up with little Joe
I don't wanna fake it but I gotta know
This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
I am a misfit
I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split

He said won't you come with me
I let him know that I could not go
You see I get mine for free
We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite
Step inside the emotional ride
I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary
I call my best friend flea
This ticonderoga is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown
Between us there are lines
Yes I told her that
I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day
I would not have it any other way, well
Means so much to me
Can you see the we
What are we ever gonna do
When all I want to be is next to you
I took a girl from the underworld
And I held her way too tight
When it's all been said
And done she was not up for the fight
We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Hoping to get with you
When you get right with your mind
It's my favorite
So I savor it
I must report that life is short
So of your love I'll take ten quarts well
There's no end to this
Don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent
For sitting on my elephant and
Am I crazy to
Join the lazy zoo
All these human butterflies and
Cactus flowers swollen eyes and
I want the devil's share
Of you I do declare
Again I'm asking can I do
When all these animals want to be just like you
I met a girl with long black hair
And she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil
And I picked her for my bride
We are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
And no one that I know has ever really done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right</field>

My will is well

For me to fail
My will could sail yeah
It's such a waste to be wasted
In the first place
I want to taste the taste of
Being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen
To our secret theme
Your solar eyes are like
Nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close
That can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know
That I'do anything
I will for you
Sailin' for the sun
'cause there is one
Knows where I'm from
I care for you
I really do I really do
Come closer now
So you can lie
Right by my side
Sit alone in the sun
I wrotte a letter to you
Getting over myself
Your solar eyes are like
Nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close
That can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know
That I'd do anything
I will for you
Your solar eyes are like
Nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close
That was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know
That I'd do anything
I will for you
Close to my skin

I'm falling in
Disasters are
Just another star
Falling in my yard

Long to be with
Someone to tell

What time
Fascinated by the face of time
What time
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some time
Ultra-fine and ultralistic
can I spy into the mystic
system down for infiltration
open mind free of frustration
I was driving
to a safe place
and arriving
as I retraced
Yell into a telescope
aim it at the star of hope
What time
Fascinated by the face of time
What time
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some time
All over the under
the smell of blood and thunder
I'm connected by the lightning rod
giving into the beauty and
heaven knows how well I know you

Yelled: Here's a song
Here's a little punk rock song for you
A little punk rock called
I think it was written by the Ramones
In the early 70's
Maybe before they started
You know, when it was really hard core back in the old days
Remember?
Flea,
I could have sworn this was the Dead Kennedys
No no no no no
I think it was Sham 69
No, this is the Buzzcocks
You idiot, you worthless peon
Don't you know this is one of the
It must have been, um
The Sex Pistols
No, this is Non Non Non
Hey, it was the Church or the Weirdoz maybe
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You've had a busy day today

Made you lie and numb your soul
Mule donkey ass you bore the load

Entire lifetime flash before me

Hey mother may I have lost a child
But she gave birth

Ooh, never know

With what ever we got

And then we pass it around
You can dance
For the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid
Of whatever's in your way
Next stop big hop
Is turning night into day
Sometimes when
I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing
That we could own
To overthrow all of you
Who have overgrown
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load,
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again
Lets dance all night and day now
Get down and show the way how
I want to show you that I care
Two things I want to say now
You make it all ok now
I need to know that you are there
I've come to learn
Whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into
Whatever light we bend
Out on the street
I get a beat and then
I turn it to ten
Lace boots and the
Ladies of kasakstan
Kick 'em high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to cuba
Then aruba then the dominican
We've got to move it
If we want to do our best
We've got to shake it
If we want to keep it fresh
I'm turning down
All the heavy psychology
To cut a rug
And I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key
And then I turn it for free
We've got to move it
Just a little to hit the spot
A whirling derbish in a flurry
A fox to trot
Come clown around, a robot
Doin' the astronaut</field>

Go and get her I've got her on my mind
Nothing better the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
[Chorus]
Come on baby 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
Take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
Win in the long run
I saw your crime
Dying to get high
With two of a kind
Beat all hands tonight
silveretta the chance of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
Nothing better the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
[Chorus]
Still I waited the chance of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
Nothing better the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Let's go!</field>

Body free and a body less
Come again just to start a fresh
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in coming through the mesh
Checking in just to get it blessed
Hard to leave when it's picturesque
Find a form that's free the roam
Where you come from
Where you going
Where you come from
Where you going
Do it all then it all again
Make it up and you make a friend
Paddle on just around the bend
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend
Hard as hell just to comprehend
Disbelief that I do suspend
Easy now to find a breeze
Where you come from
Where you going
Where you come from
Where you going
We all want to tell her
Tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her
Tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever
I know you said you don't believe
In god do you still disagree
Now that it's time for you to leave
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend
My friend, my friend
My friend
Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend
My friend, my friend
My friend
And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of what I know
Where would I be without you Glo
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend
My friend, my friend
My friend
I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
A kiss goodbye before you leave
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend
My friend, my friend
My friend</field>

You are my
Victorian machinery
(breathe yourself to life)
Your tender shape
Is bending like the scenery
(ride you like a bike)
You be the sail
And baby ill be the rudder
We could make it all day
Until it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure
I will love you forever
When I heeded your call
And every heavy endeavor
Ill keep your place
Janey
Coming down
The mount like a buffalo
(seeds deep in your eyes)
Crazy
But then again
A girl could like it rough you know
(makes up for her size)
You be the sail
And baby ill be the rudder
We could make it all day
Until it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure
I will love you forever
When I heeded your call
And every heavy endeavor
Ill keep your place
Be yourself
When I saw your all today
You be the shack
And baby ill be the desert
There is nothing to lack
When there is nothing to measure
Its all space
Janey
Make a fist
And knock me off
The moon again
(breathe yourself to life)
Lady
Make me feel
Like I was born
In june again
(ride me like a bike)
Crazy
Sing along
Just like they do in budapest

And find out what it's all bout
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet
A detective of perspective
I need to try to get a bigger eye
I could tern the art of life
In a walk I could find a wife
On a walkabout
You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in a desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkbout
High desert skies are what I spy
So fly - you've got to wonder why
The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear
The digirido original man with a dream
I believe the Aborigene
On a walkabout
You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do it all alone
On a walkbout
I've been sitting far too long
At home - I've got to get along
A walk could cure most all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
Bloodwood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
On a walkabout
I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I got myself to meet
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side</field>

Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story

Into the night
Where we can play
I'm on a train
One happy day
Two eyes for sight
Three times I pray
Soda pop
We've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes
We've got a pressure drop
We don't know
But everyday I go
To see what I can bring
Into a cameo
Oh oh oh no
We believe
Climb a tree
For monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a Quaker
The mission
The method
The downfall
Arrested
'Cuz it's not
The first time
Nor is it
The worst time
No no oh no
To see the bird
Without a care
For in a word
It's nice out there
In a tree
My mama bear
Will be all right
With proper care
Hey hey hey do
Boomerang
Into a bigger bang
A little cry of love
Because they cannot sing
Cherokee
What did the pharaoh see
Another time and space
Another place to be
We believe
Climb a tree
For monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a Quaker
The motive
The measure
The purpose
The pleasure
The risk is
It worth it
The disc is
It perfect
I found you
Amongst them
The flower
With young stem
Disparage
The broken
The marriage

We turn red and we turn green, it's the craziest thing I've ever seen
Lost my mind 'cause I'm on the plastic
Who knew it's so damn drastic
Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all your teeth in
Do you want to go fishing in new orleans
Do you want to get up early in the morning
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah, I feel it warming
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray
Send it off through delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold plated hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind
Mexico you are my neighbor
Home of the let's be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire
Do you want to go dancing in chicago
Trinidad's got it bad for tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the avocado
Hallelujah, a desparado
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray
Send it off through delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold plated hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind
Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me I'm the right one for the ride
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide
We got large and we got small, we got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green, it's the craziest thing I've ever seen</field>

Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary son but it's so.....
My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent why do you care
Someone start the car
Time to go...you're the best I know
My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen
Are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro
My what a good day
For a walk outside
I like to get to know
You a little better baby
God knows that I really tried
My what a good day
For a take out bride
I'd like to say we
Did it for the better of
I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary son but it's so
The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty
Going toe to toe
My what a good day
Just to let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better of
I thought about it
And I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout
The mother the father the daughter
Right on the verge just one more dose
I'm travelling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect but it's close
I'm almost there why should I care
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up and
Let it show
My what a good day
For a walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better of
I thought about it

I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout

Get down, you might be fucking with the song of life
Extend your deeper senses, there will be no fight
At the never ending ocean of perfect insights
'Round your molecule beam with a halo of light
The animated aura will give delight
Soon, your every single worry will be out of sight
With the power of It, we are about to astound
All your preconceptions, they will come unbound
"Listen very close," my inner voice expounds
"We are the human race, and we groove to the sound"
Yes, we deliver the truth to our musical birth
A soul shocking sound with electrify the earth
People have to know that it's not about money
Cash is not the way to make your life sunny
There is no need if you got the soul seed
Love, life and peace, it can only begin
When you know in your heart that the change is within
Love all your brothers and love all your sisters
Love all the missus and love all the misses
And don't be shy when you're sharing your kisses
Greed, jealousy gets boos and hisses
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong
Balance your life with the right kind of foods
To eat a sad cow is to eat another you
Well, that's an unfair rap, it's unforgivably rude
It'll put your Karma in the worst of moods
Someone's drinking booze and taking too many ludes
'Cause when you cop, don't you cop an attitude
And that's an ugly thing, it's not the real you
So please y'all, take some sound advice
Be yourself, clear your mind, make a sacrifice
The always sober you is especialy nice
Don't loot, don't shout, give comet the boot
I love it kickin' back and playin' my bamboo flute
Refuse to fight wars for political whores
Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores
It is my notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean
The long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace, it's the perfect peace potion
There you will find it, with sweet sea creatures
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
We will learn much peace will the whale as your teacher
"Good morning class, how very nice to meet you"
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong
Open up your hearts to the planets; to the stars
With your spirit take a trip from Venus to Mars
You know, Einstein did while Hitler hid
Now, Albert lives forever in every single kid
But, with Adolph Hitler, we are permanently rid
Picasso, Mister Dali and my man, Jimi Hendrix
These cool brothers make the world go 'round
Yeah, they do it with art, and Jimy did it with sound
But, by all these men, it was found
Each and every person can be just as renowned
Don't let the world's racist creeds give your pretty face a frown
Stand up for equal rights, I mean buckle down
Go spread the word from town to town
We are the human race and we groove to the sounds
Now that you've heard what it is in a song.</field>

My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
You can't keep a lovin' and a huggin' and a kissin'
And I don't know why...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths
I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin'
And I don't know why...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths
Take the ball...
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shue
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me
Somebody changed, so lemme give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
You can't keep a lovin' and a huggin' and a kissin'
And I don't know why...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths
I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin'
And I don't know why...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths</field>

Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me
With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle
The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow
I'm king of a mule
Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burpin' little turtle
Looked up and said "I beg
Your pardon king Yertle"
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
"Silence !" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burpin'
Little turtle named Mack
I'm Yertle the turtle
Oh marvelous me for
I am ruler of all that I see
Yertle, Yertle the turtle...
Yertle, Yertle the turtle...</field>

Freeze on the radio
I've got to bleed into snow
Hold on
Let go
We know
Do you shine like a temple inside
Can i open your core
So gentle and wide
Like your eyes girl
Rack 'em up stretch 'em out
When they're tight
This acetylene torch is giving me sight
War cries girl
Freeze on the radio
I've got to leave and more
Freeze on the radio
I've got to bleed into snow
Hold on

We know
Black and blue from the hullabaloo
Do the caribou bite

She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream
She's just made out of flesh and bones

But let me tell you little boy
You better leave her alone
Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
'Till she left him floatin' in the old bayou

She's the kind of girl
She's built like a bomb
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blond, get down!

That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box

But let me tell you little boy
She'll clean your clock
A slick and sly spy
Stuck in the muck of the moat

Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat
Double-o-dooms day for Mr. James Bond
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blond, Get down!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow
Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?
Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at them with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you
Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the american tradition
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?</field>

L.A. is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton pickin' maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Like a come on a thumb
Poppin' hump, hump, hump
Pop out
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
'cause I'm shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop
But he never met the Tree so he never be-bopped out hop!
Antwan the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat
And between his legs was a sweat young lass
He threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love 'em all
By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop
Because that's when he thought that he heard a phone
Last night and the night before, I heard a
Fop outside, then I came in doors
Freak out!
Now that I told you a little something about the Flea
A little something about the Tree, a little something about me
I can't leave you hangin' but my man Shermzy, he swings the yang, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his playin', you better be burning Sherman!
We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A.

Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?

While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not

Her pop said no, but I just couldn't stop
The killer had a case of tod the rock

But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky spiel, they'll make some spiel
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal

We stop the fire, we quench the heat
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street
'cos that's when in the store when who do we meet?
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat
Five thousand babies walkin' out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight for me and golly gee wizz!
I just can't tell ya how much we did
Rockin' right out for those itty bitty girls, right out

God save the queen
I am an Indian chief

There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief

My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek
American ghost dance
A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life

But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an Indian brave
There is a memory

That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide

And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved

It was our shoulder space that made the perfect place
For the magic of the cup to style out with grace
With a tight turn twist and a slight swerve swank
The brothers cup kissed with a kick ass clank

We are the brothers cup we like to get it up
We are the brothers cup we like to get it up

Give it up to this planet full of strife we're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap the cups went up like a natural fact

Love all the misses and love all the misters
Don't be shy when you're sharin' your kisses
The brothers cup kiss and we ain't sissies

It is our notion that the perfect peace potion can be found in the wake of the green sea's motion
The long rocking swell of the mighty blue ocean is the cradle of peace it's the perfect peace motion

Give it up to this planet full of strife we're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the power of the cup we are about to astound all your preconceptions they will come unbound
We are the brothers cup coming to your town bringing tubs of love we're going to spread it around

            <field name="lyrics">Deep inside the soul hole of mother earth
Father time came with a supersonic supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle givin' bush baby bush baby birth
The baby was a boy but I think what stunned her
Is that this bare breasted baby was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone came felonious thunder
Fill the sky with hellfire from way down down down under

I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can

Erupting from the ground in Hollywood he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete his funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds they make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man it's time to take take take take the throne

I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I 

I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man

To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're gonna get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumpin' that drivin' bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum

In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Suckin' on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to funk, funk, funk, funk your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Push it on in and pull it on out
Pump that lemon 'till it pouts

Open your legs to the sensual sound
Let the beauty of the beat pump your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hump the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down

Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Gettin' it gettin' it gettin' it good

In my head, as a hellified hum
I take to rubbin' her on the bum
Just a little on the tum
With my thumb i stroke her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like oozing hot cum

Well i like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make her cum, make her cum, cum</field>

I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All those people starvin' everyday
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay

Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you
As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do
I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day
I've got to make it better, I've got to say
You and I, we're millionaires, 
But we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts, 
And everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize, 
There's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide, 
E've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives

We're millionaires
Against hunger

Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Nice and Wise when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Pave the way, take the Grail

I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got three or four yachts on the Chesapeake Bay
All those people starvin' everyday
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay

Well I'm a millionaire too
All I know that is true is that I've got more cash than I can use
I want anything that I can have, 
But I don't need nothin' and I never have
Each damn day my heart's set far, 
But I'll be okay, 'cause I don't starve
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night, 
You know it gives to share
So listen up, you millionaires, 
Every woman, every man, help all you can
All races unite, and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us learn

We're millionaires
Against hunger

Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Nice and wise when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire

Someone spilled blood but do you know
That from the backwoods where the Chuck Berry's grow
Come your long tall daddies of a rock and roll

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

Spinning' down from the clouds Like a tornado
Spinnin' out of control like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hittin' harder than Larry Holmes
Come your long tall daddies of rock and roll

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now (yeah)

Oh well Mr. Uplift Mofo my man Bo Diddley hit sippin' a bottle of nickle ripple
Play the lickity split finger licking licks for all you wicked city slick chicks

And all you nitty gritty hick we'll make your nipples ripple
Make you wanna dip your dipple make you wanna soak your hickory stick, that's rigth 
Because my man has a grip on it and I do mean on it
Which brings to mind a very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named Little Richard who was born to make them bitches stir
That's right he'll make the sweet substance drip from the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milk his cow the howling wolf will howl
And since times does allow, you all can take me to your backwoods now, yo slim

Put down your guard I'm not here to box
This is no showdown so throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter where you come from
You could be from park ave or from a park bench
You could be a politician or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist and you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together make a fist and fight
Not to your death and not to your grave
I'm talking about t hat freedom fight like a brave

Fight like a brave
Don't be a slave
No one can tell you 
You've got to be afraid

If you're sick-a-sick'n'tired of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit and you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never to set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead so give your self a break
Get it through your head get if off your chest
Get it out your arm because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying the life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story but I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher and I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you I'm a rebel with a mission

Fight like a brave
Don't be a slave
No one can tell you 
You've got to be afraid

Fight like a brave
Don't be a slave
No one can tell you 
You've got to be afraid

I'm here today to pump up the uplift mofo party plan
A plan based on a band, a band based on a plan
There should be no in the land of lands
It's a Hollywood jam

You say you're running and you're running and you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet but you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain was driving you insane
You were looking for a day in a life that never came
So don't tell me that I've got to take a number
'Cause I've been to that doctor and believe me that's a bummer
Here's a one of a kind convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention that it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like and leave any time
And one more thing you know it doesn't have to rhyme

Fight like a brave
Don't be a slave
No one can tell you 
You've got to be afraid

Fight like a brave
Don't be a slave
No one can tell you 
You've got to be afraid

Fight like a brave
Don't be a slave
No one can tell you 
You've got to be afraid

Fight like a brave
Don't be a slave
No one can tell you 
You've got to be afraid

Fight like a brave

It's a crazy kind of
Selective affection
My love flows like a wise guy's tie
In the zanniest of directions
My love protection, my love erection
You better get some of my infection
My love can be-a-bigger than
The hoover dam
My love can hide behind
A grain of sand
My love for life is fueled by
The love for my man
I love his mother and
The silly mystic man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad

My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues

My love is the Zulu groove
My love is keep it or move
My love is a laughin' boozed
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is gettin' my food
My love, my love

My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love for a butter knuckle hands
My love for the swedes in the bad
My love for the legs that I spin
My love for the fat mingy
My love, my love
My love is my gross inner self
My love is my dick in my head

Cow eyes lie
Yes it's time to resist
How did I ever
Get into this
How could I ever
Have kissed that bitch
So what if she's
Got big tits

She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit

She came like a cat
Like a cat to cat nap
She came in my lap
With her womanly hips
When I first met her
I came unglued
I played the part of
A blue blooded fool
I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd
Get the last laugh

She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit

Like two trains on one track
Bound for a crash
Two red white and blues we were
Destined to clash
I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
Like fly by night news
We were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by
You and your wack attack

Jump back for chump love
You won't be back for cover
But no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker

No chump love sucker

I thought that your love
Was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride
When I realized that
The smack in my bag
And my baseball bat
Was all you were after
Boys "you dirty rat"
She's a bitch and a brat
And a living disaster
She thought she was fast
But I was faster</field>

Another was born an Australian

Me I'm from Michigan
But Hollywood is the land of lands
It's a Hollywood jam
We represent the Hollywood kids

Life is grand in the land of lands
The mind does boggle the mind expands
The anarchy for have manned their craft
Get on your knees and shake your ass

We don't ask we demand
That you and your clan
Listen now to this jam
To the power of the drummers bad

It's a Hollywood jam
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the Hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
There's a party in my town at 12:00
There's a party that's rockin' down to the rock

I've got nothin' against hip hop
But there's a party in my town
And no beat box jam that is
The party's got girls the girls got hot
The party's got boys and the boys got socks
Something popped the doors unlocked
House got up ran around the block

Sit down house
Take off your blouse
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
Any good friend of the lollipop kids
Over the rainbow with the wiz
We represent the Hollywood kids

Organic anti-beat box band
With the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
It's a Hollywood jam!</field>

I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,
Says he's got a bad cough wants to get it paid off

God knows when but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills you only got ten

Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but the phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early may orders from the D.A. the double D.A

Walk on your tip toes, don't try no doz
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows look out, kid

Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, look out

Looks to me like you did a little to much hittin' kid
You should've took it to the bridge before you started to skid

Look out, kid
The good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chillin'em, thrillin'em, and red hot killin'em

Said killin'em
Come on, come on killin'em

Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail

But users, cheaters, six time losers hand around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters

Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid

Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, look out</field>

Trust is a must to be a true blue dude
That's a matter of fact don't be confused

Everybody knows true friends are few
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody things, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song

Well I'm walking on down the road

I'm walkin' on down the road
A like a momma bear hugs her baby bear cubs
A dude he can't lose when he lives on love

Like the bark on a tree
Like the skin on my knees
I'm standin' by my blood

Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody things, that I've done wrong

But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel round the world gettin naked on the stage
Bustin' people out of their everyday cage
We like to think we make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud our mammy and our pappy
Funky young kings we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
I'm talkin' 'bout my buddy's funk it up fishbone
Good good time boys make me feel good
Give me good times yea yea yea yea
Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day the good time boys that might jest be president
Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
Our swinging's gonna shatter every stone cold face
Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Makin' more that money more than money can buy
I stop! And take a listen to the monsters try
Good good time boys make me feel good
Give me good times yea yea yea yea
If you don't believe me you can ask john doe
'Cause his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you 'bout the band called fire hose
To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it
Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours
Good good time boys make me feel good
Give me good times yea yea yea yea</field>

Kinds of the court shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact
M-a-g-i-see see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-a-g-i-see magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams
But he don't give a [fuck]
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the buck comes through like a truck
Scott stops pops and drops it in
On his way back gets a little skin 
From the hand of a man named a. c. green
Slam so hard break your t.v. screen
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole make your mamma talk
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble 
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble
L.A. Lakers fast break makers
Kings of the court shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
Cause they got more moves
That a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here - pops - then cheers
A roar through the forum
That deafens my ears
The one and only know if his kind
Sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for being bald and bold
Kareem Abdul Jabbar
All time great super super star
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble 
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson

You're my sexy Mexican maid

My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone

When I wake up in the morn
She greets me where I lay
I look outside to find that I's a bright and sunny day
So serene she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say she's my sexy Mexican maid

My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone

She puts me in a bubble bath 
She tickles me and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean 
Then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap 
Upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow
Then we make it fast

My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream

When you're livin' on the streets
You've got to let it roll
Get on with what you've got
Awe everybody knows that it's alright
You've got no secrets to tell
But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock

You do it oh so well
She's stone cold bush 
She's got marble eyes
Sweet china doll her thighs
And animal in pain she starts to cry

Her pipes are open wide

Open your bashful mind
Let my band step inside

With honest sounds I'll paint your brain
For in this song I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be 
On this trip you'll ride for free
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus
Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aw be my quest inside my grove
Cause what I've got to give to you
Is gonna make you wiggle like a wiggley worm
Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus
Take your body shake it around
Do the dog on the ground
And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have to make you piss your pants

To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there then you'll know
For me to stay here I've got to be me

You'll never be in doubt that's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
'Cause I promise I'll be gone for a while

And when you see me again I hope that you have been
The kind of person that you really are now
You got to get it straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman taking up my time

Oh how could I ever allow
I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun
When you know that you're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one

I'll be good I wish I could get this message over to you now

When you see me again I hope that you have been
The kind of person that you really are now
I'll be so good I wish I could

Get this message over to you now
Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good I wish I could</field>

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I cry, I cry
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
God damn, what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced

Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I wonder why, why
Put us in your pumpkin shell
Where you keep us very well
It's hell, where I dwell

When history books are full of shit
I become the anarchist, I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie, no place for me, I bleed

Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I decide to defy
Kill my trust if you must, but in my blood there is the lust
For life, that's right
Apache blood is in my heart, thrashing through me like a shark
Crashing through the dark

Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I confide, confide
What am I supposed to do, I feel like I'm cut in two
Confused by rules
Do these two cultures clash or am I living in the past?
I ask, please, tell me fast

Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I thats right
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong
Be wrong, thats wrong
I took my foot and kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead, forefathers, help me decide

A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides

Then it dawned on me like the mornin' sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I am a master of adaption and I've got to take action
I'm a man, the animal man</field>

I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away
Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being being such a bore
I pray for you most every day my love's with you now fly away

I stare at the ceiling Because I can not fall
Asleep tonight 
No not at all
Head lights flash Across my bedroom wall
Crying eyes open Because I can not fall
In love with you, I know not at all

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Busted in two Like a brittle stick
I can not drink
Because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream and no I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Yeah, yeah
This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye my love
Goodbye my love
I am not alive

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Oh oh how the price gets paid
Well I got to pay, I got to pay the price
I think I'll walk away

Erotic shock

Temporarily blind
Dimensions to discover

Each into the other
Uncontrollable notes
From her snow white throat
Fill a space
In which two bodies float
Operatic by voice
A fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower
She must be moist

Rarely do friends
Come and then go

She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged

Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)

Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl

Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way

She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home

I don't know what, when or why
The twilight of love had arrived

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl

Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl

Persuaded by one sexy dame
No I do not feel no shame

You are on the road
Can I get a little lovin' from you
Can I get a little bit of that done did do
You are on the road
Tell me now girl that you need me too
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling for you

Every man has certain needs
Talkin' 'bout them dirty deeds
To these needs I must concede
Livin' by my lowly creed

Woman please know that I'm good
Know that I did all I could
But yes it's true likelihood
Of being great is not so good

Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me

There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody time to deliver

Orange eye girl
With a backslide dew said
Yo homie
Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon
Mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
And a little lust
To the funky ass flea bass
Most in the race
Just lose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space
Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody want to come get some

Mr. Bubble meets superfly
In my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on vaudeville

I feel so good
Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood

Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella

I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things

Good God where's my sleigh
Good God playing for days
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God purple haze
Good God the baddest of brains
Good God any day now
Good God ridin' my sleigh now

Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Good man Truman Copote
Talking about my throughts 'cuase they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on the porch 'cause I lost my housekey
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo

Good God where's my sleigh
Good God playing for days
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God DeNiro's insane
Good God rackin' my brain
Good God anyday now
Good God take me away now take me away

Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brother Bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings

I miss you slim
I love you too
See my heart
It's black and blue
When I die
I will find you

Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can 
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can</field>

There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps

Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away gonna make it my home

Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind

Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can taste the salt when I lick his tail

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight

Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Runnin' through the woods laughin' at the blues

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift good Lord I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness

Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way
In the waterfall I just want to play

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it</field>

At night when something just ain't right
Blood red, but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red black or white, this is my fight
Come on courage, let's be heard
Turn feelings into words
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power

The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality

Right or wrong, my song is strong
You don't like it, get along
Say what I want, do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan
I don't buy supremacy
Media chief, you menance me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me, am I clear
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power

The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality

I've got tapes
I've got c.d.'s
I've got my Public Enemy
My lilly white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition
Never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo he's with me and what I do
My name is peace, this my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power

The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality

Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget, cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick, little piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick, eat my thickness
I've got a welt from the Bible belt
Dealing with the hand that I've been dealt
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist
Giving up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
No I can not get to this
People in pain, I do not dig it
Change of brain for Mr. Bigot
Little brother do you hear me
Have a heart oh come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
Whatever happened to humanity</field>

Crying into space
Tears on her pretty face

Flashing in the night?
Big thunder rumble fish

Headstrong 'bout this song
Exploding souls, be gone
Marvin Gaye, my love
Where did we go wrong?

Before the wind, before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho

Sir Psycho Sexy that is me
Sometimes I find I need to scream

He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

Deep inside the garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no that would be treason
Believe me Eve she gave good reason
Botty looking too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' 'cause she's the receiver
I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over achiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper

Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that I met 1 time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that left me blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man he's the man he's the man 
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea

He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

I got stopped by a lady cop
In my automobile
She said get out and spead your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said "what's up?" now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped "ooh that's tight"
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam

Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea, I'm the man that you met 1 time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea, I'm the man that will leave you blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man 
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea

Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mama that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms in your legs in your pussy I'd kill
To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you

Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap "snap"
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map
Ooh and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while</field>

I can't find the love I want
Someone better slap me

Before I start to decompose
Looking in my rear view mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear "have no fear"

Sitting in my kitchen hey girl
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby
The star of mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me
I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad "said 'bout me"

And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain

Just one note
Could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from
The song she wrote
Could fuck me where I lay
Just one note
Could make me choke
One note that's
Not a lie
Just one note
Could cut my throat
One could make me die

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot

Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room the groom

Meet me at the coffee shop

            <field name="lyrics">It started when we were little kids 
Free spirits but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents we got together
And wrote on desks and slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains 
And slipped through whatever cracks we can find minds altered 
We didn't falter in portraying hysterical and tragic characters
In a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city 
And the journeys away from it 
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spiral 
Leaving trail of irretrievable vital life juice behind
Still the brothers blood comrades partner family cuzz was impenetrable
And we lived inside it laughing with no clothes
And everything experimental 'till death was upon us 
In our face mortality and lots of things seemed futile then 
But love and music can save us and did
While the giant grey monster grew more poisoned and volatile around us 
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around 
Nothing is the same so we keep moving
We keep moving

Went off and got some hair cuts
Lookin' wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a bart bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
Motherfuckers woke us up

Two young brothers on a hover craft
Telepathics love and belly laughs

Storm the stage of universal
Slim shine talk box go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no no

Two young brothers on a hover craft, yeah
Telepathics, love and belly laughs, oh yeah
Oh shit
Oh shit

We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealin' anything that we could
Gotta sneak into the starwood
Gotta peak into the deep good

I remember ten years ago
In Hollywood we did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the butthole surfers said 
It's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do
Yeah, we were young 
Were looking, looking, looking for the deep kick
Yeah, seen 'em come, 'em go seen, gettin' close to you</field>

One big mob is home a broken home
I'd like to share some air with you some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives to give and give

What was I thinking in my head the color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration now
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost a sullen cost

Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your mamma, pay your father take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow

Three pounds of love inside my skull
A million more lives it's never dull
Just a few times spun, spun around the sun
A couple more or less and then we're done

Puke it in the nearest bin

Missionary madness
Sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways
Is par for the course
It's fucking rude

To think that you're above

Purple sashes feeding masses
Smoke on which to choke

I might be a monkey

Fundamental hatred

My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth would not be true
Refuse the news

I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I supposed to do
Just lose and lose

First time I saw you
You were sitting backstage in a dress
A perfect mess

You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love

Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so

I liked your whiskers
And I liked the dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes

You painted pictures
'Cause the one who hurts can give so much
You gave me such

Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so</field>

You kept me close, love never lost
I called you hippie, you said fuck off
Said your brother's a real punk rocker

Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me oh over the moon

Friends near death, you gave respect
Sympathetic intellect
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall (that's all)

Always be loving you
Now I'm away from you
Always be loving you

Round and round inside your head
Smartest fucker I ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul

Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me over the moon

Mule donkey ass you bore the load
Of all creations tortured souls
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall

(Like no other, I love you your my brother)

Water flowing and I will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left that only you knew
Will never be understood, will never be understood

Hey, gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me
In a loving stream
Hey mother may I have lost a child
But she gave birth
To a loving stream

Oh, never know
When the gods will come and take you
To a loving stream

Oh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me were
From your loving stream

In a loving stream
Fuck the magazines
Fuck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream

Fuck the legal greed
Fuck the nothing scene
See the family
In a loving stream</field>

And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet

A detective of perspective
I need to try and get a bigger eye, open wide
Blood wood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
To me now
On a walkabout

You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in the desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

High desert skies, are what I spy
So fly, you've got to wonder why
The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear

The digeridoo original, man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout

You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

A walk could cure almost all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One, two

I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about, can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side</field>

So rare to dare
Afraid of
Ever being there
Take me home
I need repair
Take me please
To anywhere

Descend
All the way

Descended from
Demented men
Struggle with
The art of zen
Please don't look
Too close at me
You might not like
What you see

Descend

Everyday, warped and scared
Of being there

Craving
Sends me crawling oh
Beg for mercy
Does it show
A vacancy
That's full of holes
Hold me please
I'm feeling cold

Alabama baby said hallelujah
Good god girl I wish I knew ya

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Come back baby 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world back from bombay

Fox hole love pie in your face
Living in and out of a big fat suitcase

Bonafide ride step aside my Johnson
Yes I could in the woods of Wisconsin

Wake up the cake it's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when when they do in sicily

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Where you want to go who you want to be
What you want to do just come with me

I saw god and I saw the fountains
You and me girl sittin' in the Swiss mountains

Me oh my o, me and guy o
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rockin' ohio

Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful

I know I know for sure
Ding dang dong dong ding dang dong dong ding dang
I know I know its you

Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world And I have seen your love

A lickin' stick is thicker
When you break it to show

Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for

Calling calling for something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cage
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake
Of his soul Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of
All the things that you own
Everything must go

I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over
But it's only on the rise
Calling calling
For something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for

Throw me to the wolves
Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky
Because I know I'm coming back

Angeleno but the devil may care
Summer time to talk and swear
Later maybe we could share some air

I'll take you to the movies there
We could walk through Leicester square
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man

London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right

Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice was yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart

Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primrose hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man

London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right

Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
It's all right now
Call me now use the satellite
It's all right, it's all right

Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right now
Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right

The California flower is poppy child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan

Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man

London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right (hey hey, oh oh)</field>

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soul mate bled
Push the trigger and I pull the thread, I gotta take it on the other side

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down

Spread your head and spread the blanket 
She's too free and I'm the patient

Knock on wood we all stay good 
'Cause we all live in Hollywood 
With Dracula and Darla Hood 
Unspoken words were understood

Up to my ass in alligators 
Let's get it on with the alligator haters 
Did what you did did what you said 
What's the point yo what's the spread

Lookin' fine, you're lookin' fine and get on nineteen ninety nine (it's right on time)

Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow, bow wow wow
Now I'm here, I'm nowhere now

Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate

It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time, it's right on time (it's right on time)
Lookin' fine, you're lookin' fine and get on nineteen ninety nine (it's right on time)

(It's right on time)

Well, plain and simple pain I want to but I can't complain
Death row, let us go it's time to blow up for show
All the world reverberated coming through, we motorcaded
Start off when we operated
Turing up in solid stated

Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies 
It's time to leave this town it's time to steal away 
Let's go get lost anywhere in the U.S.A.

Let's go get lost, let's go get lost

Blue you sit so pretty West of the one 
Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun 
Just a mirror for the sun 
Just a mirror for the sun

These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
So much as come before those battles lost and won 
This life is shining more forever in the sun 
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf 
Staying high and dry's More trouble than it's worth in the sun

Just a mirror for the sun 
Just a mirror for the sun 

These smiling eyes are just a mirror for

In Big Sur we take some time to linger on 
We three hunky dory's got our snake finger on 
Now let us drink the stars it's time to steal away 
Let's go get lost right here in the U.S.A
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost

Well, you were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand
To celebrate you is greater
Now that I can, always my man

Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for
Misunderstand, all in a hand
Just like you could, you make me
All that I am, all in a hand

A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra the more I have something to bring

And now I see you in a beautiful and different light
He's just a man and any damage done will be all right
Call out my name, call and I came

Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior
He's just a man, all in a hand
Your hero's destined to waver
Anyone can, always my man

I would never betray you
Look at me, who could raise you?
Face in the sand, safe in your hand
You were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand

We are the Red Hots and we're loving lots the love me nots
The flowers in your flower pot are dancing on the table tops

And now I see you in a beautiful and different light
He's just a man and everything he does will be all right
Call out my name, call and I came

Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man</field>

I'm falling in someone who's been
Sittin' by the phone
I'm left alone in another zone

John says to live above hell
My will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail
My will could sail yeah

It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I want to taste the taste of being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything 
I will for you

Sailin' for the sun'cause there is one
Knows where I'm from
I care for you I really do I really do
Come closer now
So you can lie right by my side
Sit alone in the sun I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself, yeah

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything 
I will for you

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Close to my skin someone who's been
I'm a falling in
Disasters are just another star
Falling in my yard

My will is well
Long to be with someone to tell
I love your smell</field>

I cried a tear for nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through

Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

I was walking 
Through a courtyard
Without shoes and 
Without regard 
Automatic catacombs
Take me where I want to go 

All around 
All in faces 
It astounds 
And amazes 
Good to last innatural 
Touch me I'm a chromosome 

What time 
Fascinated by the face of time 
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
Time 

Ultra-fine and ultralistic 
Can I spy into the mystic 
System down for infiltration 
Open mind free of frustration 

I was driving 
To a safe place 
And arriving
As I retraced 

Yell into a telescope 
Aim it at the star of hope 

What time 
Fascinated by the face of time
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
Time 

All over the under 
The smell of blood and thunder 
I'm connected by the lightning rod
Giving into the beauty and 
Heaven knows how well I know you

Can I spy into the mystic

By the way I tried to say

Dani the girl
Is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife card shark
Con job boot cut

Skin that flick
She's such a little DJ
Get there quick
By street but not the freeway
Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play

Dog town blood bath
Rib cage soft tail

Standing in line
To see the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow
By the way I tried to say

Black jack dope dick
Pawn shop quick pick
Kiss that dyke
I know you want to hold one
Not on strike
But I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic
I know you never stole one
Girls that like
A story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

Standing in line to

Someone forever warm
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

Show love with no remorse and
Climb on to your seahorse and
This ride is right on course
This is the way
I wanted it to be with you
This is the way
I knew that it would be with you

What I really want to do is
Turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I'd use my senses to
You can see that
It's only everywhere
I'd take it all and then
I'd find a way to share

Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me yo
It's all for free

I could die for you

Oh this life I choose

I could die for you

Come again and tell me
Where you want to go

Close the door and
No one has to know
How we are

Come along and go

Wander with me yo

Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of scorpios a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know

Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees

Into the light, heavy, middle weight

Motor mouthing off

Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due

Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
And come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
And you always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew through

Looking up into
A reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up
Another stubborn scorpio

Can you feel the voltage

Got room to spare

Take it out there

Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still I so admired
Bloodshot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me she wolf style
Rip right through me

Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw love stream flow

Come on baby 'cause, there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better then love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight

Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
All the better, to make it so fine
Simply put I saw love stream flow

Come on baby 'cause, there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better then love and service
Universally speaking

Body free and a body less 
Come again just to start a fresh 
Once again to find a home 
In the moment of the meantime 

Dropping in coming through the mesh 
Checking in just to get it blessed 
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam 
Where you come from 
Where you going 

Where you come from 
Where you going 
Do it all then it all again 
Make it up and you make a friend 
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see 
All the mamas and the papas 

Take a chance on a recommend 
Hard as hell just to comprehend 
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze 
Where you come from 
Where you going 

Where you come from 
Where you going 

We all want to tell her 
Tell her that we love her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever seen 
We all want to kiss her 
Tell her that we miss her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever 

I know you said you don't believe 
In God do you still disagree 
Now that it's time for you to leave

Is love my friend 
My friend
My friend

Your stylish mess of silver hair 
A woman of your kind is rare 
Your uniform returns to air 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend 
My friend
My friend

And now it's time for you to go 
You taught me most of what I know 
Where would I be without you Glo 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend 
My friend
My friend

I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be 
A kiss goodbye before you leave

Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash your light on

Take a look
It's on display for you
Coming down
No, not today

Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her

Pick it up
If not too strong for you
Take a piece
And pass it on

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

Fly on my wind
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator

Take a look
It's on display for you
Coming down
No, not today

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We'll find a place together

Try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden
Dreams of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication

It's the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East
At least it settles in the final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin is this your chin
Or is that war your waging

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me girl be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population everybody's been there and
I don't mean on vacation

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest
There is no test
But this is what you're craving

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication

Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side

Ex girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want, to give her seven years
For being sad

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words, I know of to express
This emptiness

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

Imagine me taught by tragedy
Release is peace
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give, your love
No matter what
Yeah, what she said

Stealing the shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep

Saving us from the heat
Something's will die in their place
Others will leave with a trace
Fire will come by its day

In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you got to pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?
Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner
Rebel, and a stunner
On her merry way saying baby, watcha gonna?
Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess
I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah, yeah

She's a lover, baby, and a fighter
Should've seen it coming when I got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess
I'm your priest

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew that others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

Pushed the fader, gifted animator
One for the now, and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man
Wasn't gunnin' for the quota
Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last

Gone too fast

Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck 
Muscles and bottlenosed grifters arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race
A shehive stare and chase wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the new morning milk blanket 
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny who's bouquet set a course for bloom without decay 
Get you broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights fallen freckles, away</field>

I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start
And beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
And I'm
(Slow to finish but I'm quick to start)

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face, hey</field>

Rake it up to take it in 
Wrap me in your cinnamon 
Especially in Michigan 
Well I could be your friend 

White clouds I'm in 
A mitten full of fisherman 
C'mon huckleberry finn 
Show me how to make her grin 
Well I'm in Michigan 

Cry me a future 
Where the revelations run amok 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Lions and tigers come running 
Just to steal your luck 

A rainy Lithuanian 
Who's dancing as an Indian 
Painted in my tiger skin 
Especially in Michigan

Double chins and bowling pins 
Unholy Presbyterians 
Land is full of medicine 
I find it when I'm slipping in 

The tainted new librarian (into Michigan)
Who fainted when she tucked you in 
Let's float away like zeppelins 
On stoic gusts of northern wind

Cry me a future 
Where the revelations run amok 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Lions and tigers come running 
Just to steal your luck 

Out on the farm we'll be 
Swimming with the mother duck 
Deep in the mitten where 
Lions and tigers come running 
Just to steal your luck 

Life is my friend 
Underwater violins 
Order now from ho chi min 
A porcelain that comes in twins 

Throw me in the looney bin 
'Cause I can take it on the chin (when I'm in Michigan)
The cleavage of your pillow skin 
Is moving like a violin

Cry me a future 
Where the revelations run amok 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Lions and tigers come running 
Just to steal your luck 

Out on the farm we'll be 
Swimming with the mother duck 
Deep in the mitten where 
Lions and tigers come running 
Just to steal your luck, yeah</field>

Cells about to separate
And I find it hard to concentrate and

Temporary this cash and carry
I'm stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate and

All I want is for you to be happy and
Take this moment to make you my family and
Finally you have found something perfect and 
Finally you have found

Death defying this mess I'm buying
It's raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate and

Estuary is blessed but scary your
Heart's about to palpitate
And I'm not about to hesitate and

One to treasure the rest of your days here and
Give you pleasure in so many ways dear and
Finally you have found something perfect and 
Finally you have found
Here we go

Do you want me to show up for duty and
Serve this woman and honor her beauty and
Finally you have found something perfect and 
Finally you have found
Yourself

With me, will you, agree, to take
This man, into your world
And now, we are as one

My lone ranger the heat exchanger
Is living in this figure eight
And I'll do my best to recreate and

Sweet precision and soft collision, aww
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to separate and

All I want is for you to be happy and
Take this woman and make you my family and
Finally you have found someone perfect and

All I want is for you to be happy and
Take this woman and make you my family and

To survive

Come along and show me something
That I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet

I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted
And just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But now I walk alone and talk about it when I know

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do

Let it on, I'll cut you off
When you're screaming into the phone
Hard to own
Anyway, I wanna let you know
That everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me?

You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But now you're quick to get into your regret
I'll take the fall and now you got to give it all away

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill

I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do

Hey, what would you say if I stayed?
Stayed for a while, if I may
Say it again and I'll come around
But not for the last time
Hey, what would you say if I changed?
I'll change everything but my name
Play it again and I'll come around
Come around, but not for the last time, not for the last time

You used to be so warm and affectionate
I used to know just what I wanted
And just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret

Forty detectives strong
Takin' a stroll down love street
Strollin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-dependant?

Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear but
The way we make out

When I was an all-aloner
Nothing but a two-beach comber
Anybody seen the sky, I'm
I'm wide awake now!

Workin' the beat as we speak
Workin' the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-dependant?

Sing it back to you and bring the 
Sound of heaven ringing just for you 

And if I saw the sun fall down 
I'd pick it up and make a crown 
One that was a perfect fit for you 

We could take a walk 
Into the apple orchard by the school 
We could make a little residue 

We could find a place to stay 
A secret little hide away 
Spend a little time inside of you

I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause that's what we do

Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me
And that is why I

Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire
Jump up to meet

I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause that's what we do

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah

In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights
Just to get struck

I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth
And a pack of style

I say, she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself
Until I'm done, and

Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars
Make a diagram, and
Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah, hey

Oh yeah
So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind
For the red on rust, I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers
I said

Now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause that's what we do

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and

No lullaby kid, no five percent
Any way you want to cut that cake
She's a-dyin' from a life of abandonment
Lost in a valley without my horses
She needs somebody to hold

It looked to me like heaven sent this for
Your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me alright

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me alright

It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in
It's a dirty walk back
Gonna learn no way too much
Shootin' dope in the back of a Cadillac jack

Slow down the road to my back forty
She needs somebody to hold

It looked to me like heaven sent this for
Your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me alright

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me alright

Down in the south sea
Give me your mouthpiece
Resuscitation is the way I find these
I give you majors
You give me minors
Don't fade away
Like an ocean liner
Now

Lost in the valley without my horses
No one can tell me what my remorse is
God made this lady that stands before me
She needs somebody to hold

She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me
She looks to me alright

Down on the bathroom floor
She's searching for another light
She looks to me
She looks to me alright

It looks to me like heaven sent this for
Your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me alright

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright

Her little sister, Rose
A smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose

This talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette
She said, "My man, you know, it's time to get your fingers wet"
You hustle faster when you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you, why, you were screamin', "Handle it!"

Knock the world
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share

I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on the lone pine
I'm gonna make you mine
It's understood, you wrap the fool right around my neck
You've got some glitter on ya kitty in the disco tech
I put my lovin' in your oven and I had to check
The last I heard from you a you we're screamin', "Resurrect!"

Knock the world
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share, ooh

Knock the world
Right off its feet and straight onto its head

Mysterious girl misunderstood

Why try and run away

Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today

Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say

I know a girl
She worked in a store
She knew not what
Her life was for
She barely knew her name

They tried to tell her
She would never be
As happy as the girl
In the magazine
She bought it with her pay

Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today

Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say

Everyone has
So much to say
They talk talk talk
Their lives away
Don't even hesitate

Walking on down
To the burial ground
It's a very old dance
With a merry old sound
Looks like it's on today

Alone inside my forest room
And it's storming

I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start

Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I'm calling

Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I'm sorry

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon (a mirror to the moon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warning
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushin' myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now

And this is where I find

Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen

Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon (a mirror to the moon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warning
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)
And I'm forming and I'm warning
Pushin' myself
And no I don't mind asking

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon (a mirror to the moon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warning
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warning

Little lady what a reputation
Kinda shady now you're gonna make again

I know you can straddle

A tiny storm in your teacup girl

Every other day you say
You're gonna have to bury 'em (whoop-tay-whoop-tay-git-ta-gala-goop-ta)

Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?

No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue

Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye
'Cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody
Lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away
Can't take it for another minute

This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high, it's only promising
This place was made on you

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where do you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed

I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone

Chitty chitty, baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life could be a little sweet
But life could be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas city
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fitty

Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?

And some a lot
We've got to make due
With what ever we got
We get it hot we cool it down
And then we pass it around

You can dance
For the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid
Of whatever's in your way
Next stop big hop
It's turning night into day

Sometimes when
I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing
That we could own
To overthrow all of you
Who have overgrown

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you
I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt
We turn it out
And then we turn it again, woo

I've come to learn
Whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into
Whatever light we bend
Out on the street
I get a beat and then
I turn it to ten

Lace boots and the
Ladies of Kazakhstan
Kick 'em high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to Cuba
Then Aruba then the Dominican

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you
I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go (two things I want to say now)
All we know
Heavy load (you make it all okay now)
Start to float
Without a doubt (I need to know that you are there)
We turn it out 
And then we turn it again

We've got to move it
If we want to do our best
We've got to shake it
If we want to keep it fresh

I'm turning down
All the heavy psychology
To cut a rug
And I make no apology
I turn a cheek
I turn a key
And then I turn it for free

We've got to move it
Just a little to hit the spot
A whirling dervish in a flurry
A fox to trot
Come clown around
A robot
Doin' the astronaut

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you
I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go (two things I want to say now)
All we know
Heavy load (you make it all okay now)
Start to float
Without a doubt (I need to know that you are there)
We turn it out

Coming up on it everyday for 
Look at me and it's what I stay for 
A little locket of fantasy 
That we believe in 

Lilacs and contraband 
I've got Santa Monica in my hand 
A little, Beatlemania when I can 
And I've got two big bags of old Japan 

Ring side and blow-by-blow 
Another, main event at the old rainbow 
We're comin', right on top of the tupelo 
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot

With a, happy ending that's made of sand 
With a little bit of lovin' is all I can

No, no, I know, I said, no, no

It's like a dream
That falls away
Into the night
Where we can play
I'm on a train
One happy day
Two eyes for sight
Three times I pray

Ooh
Soda pop
We've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes
We've got a pressure drop
We don't know
But everyday I go
To see what I can bring
Into a cameo
Oh oh oh no

We believe
We believe
Climb a tree (we believe)
For monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a Quaker

The mission
The method
The downfall
Arrested
'Cause it's not
The first time
Nor is it 
The worst time
No no oh no

To see the bird
Without a care
For in a word
It's nice out there
In a tree
My mama bear
Will be all right
With proper care

Hey hey hey do

Boomerang 
Into a bigger bang
A little cry of love
Because they cannot sing
Cherokee
What did the pharaoh see
Another time and space
Another place to be

We believe
We beieve
We believe
We believe
Climb a tree
For monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a Quaker

Climb a tree
For monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a Quaker

The motive
The measure
The purpose 
The pleasure

The risk is
It worth it
The disc is
It perfect

I found you 
Amongst them
The flower
With young stem

Disparage
The broken
The marriage

Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary, son, but it's soul
My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent, why do you care?
Someone start the car
Time to go
You're the best I know

My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting now where we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen
Are treating you like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro

My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better baby
God knows that I really have tried
My what a good day for a take-out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better, oh

I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary, son, but it's soul
The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty going toe-to-toe

My, what a good day for a, let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better, oh

I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter, yeah

Right on the verge, just one more dose
I'm traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect, but it's close
I'm almost there, why should I care?
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up, let it show

My what a good day for a, walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better, oh

I thought about it and I brought it out

I'm consecrated but I'm not devout

You don't form at all

She recognized
Because you gave her a life of real love
It's no surprise

The night's are long, but the years are short

Let me die so when it's time to live
Another sun will rise

I said yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I said yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes 
To ferry me away
To where we all belong

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone</field>

I'm comin' for you 'cause I adore you and
I'd like to get inside your mass production
This indecision has got me cringin' well
I can't resist the smell of your seduction

Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Unwrap the package with a mutt persuasion
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
I wanna dance to every day's occasion

This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

When we envision, lack of division and
The planet does another revolution
The day I blew on ya you said I grew on ya
Turns out that we are all the one solution
Go!

I'm comin' at you well, you are the cap too and
I like the sound of your articulations
Want to arouse her and maybe espouse her, well
She showed me love with out the stipulations

This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

I wanna lean on you, get Jan and Dean on ya
It's time to sway a little mass perception
I like you cheeky well, so Mozambiquey and
I think the world could use a clear connection

This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

This I know, hell this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone

Raise my bar and raise your stay

Something good gon' come your way
Just look out your door

No matter whatcha mad at girl

When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old
Like I told you I'm in for the long long

Had to of been one of those things that took place in outer space
A match made in heaven, not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs about "In God We Trust"
Something slide, but this is a must
Like I told you there's a time for finding out

People try to tell me what not to do
You shouldn't make it with a younger girl and
Too many chances for the foot to drop,
I tried to tell 'em that I found a pearl, well
Like I told you be careful what you're asking for

This is to Brutus
Gotta mess of a better hell, ow
This is to Judas
Even you never had my back

She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude, but I just didn't care
I had to find out, these moments are rare
And Stevie says, "All is fair"
Like I told you there is something for everyone

Well, I guess I never told you some things
That I really, really wanted to say
Did I do everything I could do,
Or did the mice just need to play?
Like I told you there's more than meets the eye

This is to Brutus
Gotta mess of a better hell, ow
I said this is to Judas
Even you never had my back

I'm not trying to point fingers at you
And I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl you know how to bring the pain
Like I told you I'd do it all again

This is to Brutus
I gotta mess of a better hell, ow
I said this is to Judas
Even you never had my back

Come on
This is to Brutus
There's a jury to the woman's lap, ow
This is to Judas
Even you never had my back</field>

Westbound drunk with lots to say

Hustlers get what they deserve
But it's always half the game
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date

Counting days and skipping your stones into the sun
Overrated on the form it goes to where you turn,

Living the dream of a meteorite

Stop jumping 'cause we got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of L.A., yeah

Short stroking butterfly, better to go for broke
What you're smoking Mary Jane, it doesn't make you choke
Jumping the fence, riding the waves, can you take a joke?
I'll be yours today,
Living the dream with a capital K!

Stop jumping 'cause we got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of L.A., yeah

Tell me now, tell you how
Just show me where to sit

Make time for love and your happiness
The mothers of invention are the best
We all learn and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone I guess
I guess

Half blinded, I'm reminded how to find myself
Nickel and dime I think, it's time to play some musical chairs
Dirty laundry, what a quandary, ask her if she cares
I'll be yours and more,
Better than ever like never before

Stop jumping 'cause we got something to say, yeah

Sweet talking, there's a marker,
To your part of town,
Never again, we're trying to see your love supremed and bound
Is it ever meant to be, and is it so profound?

A history

It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you
Soft walk to horizon
One big crash that no one dies in
This for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will

Hurts my heart when you do that to me
Street life out my window
City-made breeze gonna stroke my skin though
Dropped a lot of words on an old brick wall,
Rob a lot of banks, got a pedigree scrawl
Put my peg into your square
Run around like we just don't care

When I thought I saw a sign from the Gods
A sign from the Gods that you were meant to be mine
And it's fine, taking it all for a ride 
Until the day when it's gone
I mystified my way and it all went wrong 
When it's gone

The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask and are you up to task?
The catacombs of bet and bone where cultures come to clash

Several of my best friends wear, 
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up, 
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses 
The monarchy of roses tonight

The cloth between my former queen, her legendary stare
The holy tears that I am in, the lovely cross to bear

Several of my best friends know, 
The secrets of this town
And Mary wants to raise it up, 
And Sherry wants to spit it all around, girl
The sailors of the night

Show us love before you go
Say I will, and then say I'll want to
The story of love that I'll never taunt you

Your eyes had wandered off to something distant, cold and grey
I guess you didn't see it coming
Someone's gotten used to slumming
Dreaming of the golden years
I see you had to change careers
Far away, but we both know it's somewhere

I saw you on the back page of some free press yesterday
The drift wood in your eyes said nothing short of love for pain
I know you from another picture
Of someone with the most convictions
We used to read the funny papers
Fooled around and pulled some capers
Not today, send a message to her
A message that I'm coming, coming to pursue her

Down your country I rest my face on your bed
I've got you ten times over, I'll chase you down 'til you're dead

I saw you on a TV station and it made me wanna pray
An empty shell of loveliness is now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker
Someone oughta situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way, time to come and find you
But you can't hide from me girl, so never mind what I do

Down your country I rest my face on your bed
I bet my sovereign country and I left it all for your head

I saw you in the church and there was no time to exchange
You were getting married and it felt so very strange
I guess I didn't see it coming
And now I guess it's me who's bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today, not for me but someone
I never could get used to, so now I will refuse to

Down your country I rest my face on your bed
I bet my sovereign country and I left it all for your head
I got my best foot forward and I'll chase you down 'til you're dead</field>

So I keep an eye on the shadow's smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinning off, head is on my heart
It's like a bit of light and a touch of dark
You got sneak attacked from the zodiac
But I see your eyes spark
Keep the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say?

Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot
You got no time for the afterthought
They're like ice cream for an astronaut
Well that's me looking for weed
Turn the corner and
Find the world and show command
Playing the hand

Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine?
The darkness helps to sort the shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it overtime?
The darkness helps to sort the shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Pick you up like a paperback
With the track record of a maniac
So I'm moving in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday
Honey where we roll
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?

Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design

He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in

We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-six a number much too small for someone's golden years

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said, oh, don't look back, just look ahead

You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said, oh, don't look back, just look ahead

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea

I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay

Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea

Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest
Now, he takes off her dress
Now, let me go
I just can't look its killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr Brightside
I'm coming out of my cage
And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest
Now, he takes off her dress
Now, let me go
'Cause I just can't look its killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr Brightside
I never...
I never...
I never...
I never...</field>

Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you
I'm ready, let's roll onto something new
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around
Pace yourself for me
I said maybe baby please
But I just don't know now
When all I wanna do is try
Somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential

I remember when you were mine
Just to reach you
Baby, I'd stand in line
There's another world
We're living in
Tonight
There's another heart
That's fading in
The light
Don't want your picture
On my cell phone
I want you here with me
I don't want your memory
In my head, no
I want you here with me
Spent the summer
Just layin' out in the sun
Time seems to move so slowly
When you're taking it as it comes
(Taking it as it comes)
Maybe we were just too young
(Maybe we were just too young)
Your body was tan and your hair was long
You showed me your smile and my cares were gone
Falling in love filled my soul with fright
You said "Come on babe, it'll be alright"
Must have been a fool till the bitter end
Now I hold on to hope
That I'll have you back again
I'd bargain and
I'd fight
But there's another world
You're living in
Tonight
Don't want your picture
On my cell phone
I want you here with me
I don't want your memory
In my head, no
I want you here with me
Well, I saw you in a restaurant
The other day
And instead of walking towards you
I ran away
(Ran away)
And I'll keep on waiting for you
For you to come around
Come around and say
I don't want your picture
On my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't need those memories
In my head, no
I want you here with me

Are we human?

My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human?
Or are we dancer?
Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance,
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye
Wish me well..
You've gotta let me go
Are we human?
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human?
Or are we dancer?
Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know is your heart still beating
Are we human?
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
You've gotta let me know

Waiting on some beautiful boy
To save you from your old ways

Watch it now- here he comes
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined when you were young
Can we climb this mountain
I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go
We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young
And sometimes you close your eyes and see the place where you
Used to live
When you were young
They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while
You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now- here he comes
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus

The good old days
The honest man
The restless heart
A promised land
A subtle kiss
That no one sees
A broken wrist
The big trapeize
Oh well I don't mind
If you don't mind
'cause I don't shine
If you don't shine
Before you go
Can you read my mind?
It's funy how you just break down
Waitin' on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
The magic soakin' my spine
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
The teenage queen
The loaded gun
The drop dead dream
The chosen one
A southern drawl (?)
A world unseen
A city wall
And a trampoline
Well I don't mind
If you don't mind
Coz I don't shine
If you don't shine
Before you jump
Tell me what you find
When you read my mind
Slippin in my faith
Until I fall
You never returned that call
Woman, open the door
Don't let it stay
I want to breathe that fire again
She said
"I don't mind
If you don't mind
Coz I don't shine
If you don't shine"
Put your back on me
Put your back on me
Put your back on me
The stars are blazing
Like rebel diamonds
Cut out of the sun

A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I've been on a trail for a little while
And that was the night that she broke down
And held my hand
The teenage rush, she said:
Ain't we all just runaways?
'Cuz we got time
But that ain't much
We can't wait 'till tomorrow
You gotta know that this is real, baby
Why you wanna fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip
When the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just run away to somewhere else
Some place good
We can't wait 'till tomorrow
You gotta know that this is real, baby
Why you wanna fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance, baby, we can't lose
Ain't we all, just runaways
I knew it when I met you
I'm not gonna let you run away
I knew it when I held you
I wasn't letting go
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other 'till the morning light
We used to laugh now we only fight
Baby, are you lonesome now?
At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt this house
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls
We can't wait 'till tomorrow
Now we're caught up in the appeal
Baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive
And we're all just runaways
I knew it when I met you
I'm not gonna let you run away
I knew it when I held you
I wasn't letting go
Ain't we all just runaways
Ain't we all just runaways</field>

Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hopin'
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind
And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And the zipping white light beams
disregarding bombs and satellites
That was the turning point,
That was one lonely night
The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"
Well, now I'm back at home and-
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea;
You better look it over
Before you make that leap!
And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don't dwell on my transmission
Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh what a lonely night
The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down!
It's all in your mind"
The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"
My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from East to West
They say the Nile used to run from East to West

Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter
Oblivious to schoolgirls' lies
When I look back on those neon lights
The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light
Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out, we've got the radio on
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Racing shadows under moonlight
Through the desert on a hot night
And for a second there we'd won
Yeah, we were innocent and young
Cast out of the night, well you've got a foolish heart
So you took your place
But the fall from grace was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover
But you can't escape the second attack
Your soul was innocent
She kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face
Burnin' for love
Holdin on' for your life
All that I wanted was a little touch
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time
Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we've got the radio on
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Racing shadows under moonlight
We're taking chances on a hot night
And for a second there we'd won
Yeah we were innocent and young
The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you 're too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
(It's so cruel)
You run for cover
But you can't escape the second attack
(and you turn your back, you're so)
Your soul was innocent
she kissed him and she painted it black
(On a losing game)
You should have seen your little face
Burning for love
(Miss Atomic Bomb)
Holdin' on for your life
But you can't survive
(All that I wanted was a little touch)
When you want it all
(A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much)
There's another side

I carried the weight of our last fight
Elvis singing "Don't be cruel"
And I wonder if you feel it too
It's like we're going under
Somewhere outside the lonely esmeralda county line
The question of my heart came to my mind
If I go on
With you by my side
Can it be
The way it was
When we met
Did you forget all about those golden nights?
Maybe a thief stole your heart
Or maybe we just drifted apart
I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust
If I go on
With you by my side
Can it be
The way it was
When we met
Did you forget all about those golden nights?
All of our plans have fallen through
Sometimes a dream, it don't come true
Darling! Darling!
(If we go on, can it be?)
Can it be
The way it was?
When we met
Did you forget all about them golden nights?
If I go on
With you by my side
Can it be
The way it was?
My heart is true
Girl, it's just you
I'm thinking of
Can it be the way it was?
Maybe a thief stole your heart</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I pack my case.
I check my face.
I look a little bit older, I look a little bit colder.
With one deep breath, and one big step;
I move a little bit closer, I move a little bit closer.
For reasons unknown.
I caught my stride, I flew and flied.
I know if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my
mind.
But my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to.
And my eyes, they don't see you no more.
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don't recognize you no more.
For reasons unknown; for reasons unknown.
There was an open chair.
We sat down in, the open chair.
I said if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my mind.
But my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to.
And my eyes, they don't see you no more.
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to,
And my eyes don't recognize you at all.
For reasons unknown; for reasons unknown.
I said my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to;
and my eyes don't recognize you no more.
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to;
And my eyes don't recognize you no more.
For reasons unknown; for reasons unknown; for reasons unknown; for reasons unknown.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">A love struck Romeo, sings the streets a serenade,
Laying everybody low, with a love song that he made
Finds a street light, steps out of the shade
Says something like, 'You and me babe, how about it?'
Juliet says, 'Hey it's Romeo,
you nearly gave me a heartattack'
He's underneath the window, she's singing,
'Hey now, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here,
singing up to people like that'
Anyway, what you gonna do about it?
Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start,
And I bet, then you exploded into my heart,
And I forget, I forget, the movie song
When you gonna realize,
it was just that the time was wrong,Juliet?
Come up on different streets,
they both were streets of shame,
Both dirty, both mean, yes,
and the dream was just the same,
And I dreamed your dream for you,
and now your dream is real
How can you look at me
as if I was just another one of your deals?
When you can fall for chains of silver,
you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers
and the promises they hold
You promised me everything,
you promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say,
'Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him'
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above,
I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize,
it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
I can't do the talks, like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, and bad company
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet I'd do the stars with you, anytime
Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above,
I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize,
it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
And a love struck Romeo, sings the streets a serenade,
Laying everybody low, with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient street light, steps out of the shade
Says something like, 'You and me babe, how about it?'
'You and me babe, how about it?'</field>

Keep praying for rain
Dancing for rain little girl by the drain
Motherless child, rescue rescue
Don't you listen to the never
Keep praying for rain
Dancing for rain with your doll by the drain
Motherless child, rescue rescue
Keep your ear to the shell, keep your ear to the shell
Stay on the path that leads to the well
There are many take the one that leads to the well
rescue rescue
Keep your ear to the shell, keep your ear to the shell
Motherless child does thou believe
That thine afflictions have caused us to grieve?
Motherless child angels wear clothes
Their eyes now are swollen and exposed
Don't you listen to the never
Keep praying for rain
Dancing for rain, no sweet for the pain of a motherless child
Rescue rescue
Keep your ear to the shell, keep your ear to the shell
Stay on the path that leads to the well
There are many, take the one that leads to the well
Motherless child, follow my voice
And I shall give thee great cause to rejoice
Motherless child, be of good cheer
My arm is reached out, I am here
I'll crush every doubt and every fear
Clothesline the shame and you will answer to the rain
Wonderful wonderful, wonderful wonderful
Motherless child I am with thee, thou wast never alone
Maybe I'm dirty, maybe I'm unworthy
Motherless child, can you hear me? I will give you a home
Wonderful wonderful, wonderful wonderful
Motherless child I am with thee, thou wast never alone
Maybe I'm dirty, maybe I'm unworthy
Motherless child, can you hear me? I will give you a home
You were never alone</field>

            <field name="lyrics">What have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died
I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover
What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous
I saw my mother on the street last night
All pretty and strong, singing 'the road is long'
I said 'Momma I know you've tried'
But she fell on her knees and cried
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
I know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover
And there was nothing she wouldn't give
Just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams
She's running, she's running
Just to trust him
He got a big smile, he's fake news
Just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover
Run
Run
Run for cover</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Step out into the Indian dust
I can feel the cracks in my spirit
They're starting to bust
Drive by your house, nobody's home
I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone
All my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl
Another girl
I went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
I can't believe you're out there flying with somebody else
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
And give him all of my love
All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
And she's just another girl
I could be reeling them in, left and right
Something's got a hold on me, tonight
Well maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want another girl
All of my friends say I should move on
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
She's just another girl
Now why can't I sleep at night
And why don't the moon look right
It sailed off but the TV's on
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
She's just another girl
All my friends say
She's just another girl
Another girl</field>
