in your eyes &lt;br /&gt;The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty &lt;br /&gt;I thought of you and the years &lt;br /&gt;and all the sadness fell away from me &lt;br /&gt;And did you

needed me &lt;br /&gt;It was clear that I could not do a thing for you &lt;br /&gt;Now life devalues day by day &lt;br /&gt;As friends and neighbours turn away &lt;br /&gt;And there's a change that, even with regret, &lt;br /&gt;cannot be undone &lt;br /&gt;Now frontiers shift like desert sands &lt;br /&gt;While nations wash their blooded hands &lt;br /&gt;Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey &lt;br /&gt;I woke to the sound of drums &lt;br /&gt;The music played, the morning sun streamed in &lt;br /&gt;I turned and I looked at you &lt;br /&gt;And all but the bitter residue slipped away.. &lt;br /&gt;slipped away &lt;br /&gt;Wearing the Inside Out &lt;br /&gt;From morning to night I stayed out of sight &lt;br /&gt;Didn't recognise I'd become &lt;br /&gt;No more than alive I'd barely survive &lt;br /&gt;In a word.. &lt;br /&gt;overrun &lt;br /&gt;Won't hear a sound (He's curled into the corner) &lt;br /&gt;From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering) &lt;br /&gt;I've spent too long (With and endless stream of garbage to) &lt;br /&gt;On the inside out (.. &lt;br /&gt;curse the place) &lt;br /&gt;My skin is cold (In a sea of random images) &lt;br /&gt;To the human touch (The self-destructing animal) &lt;br /&gt;This bleeding heart's &lt;br /&gt;(Waiting for the waves to break) &lt;br /&gt;Not beating much &lt;br /&gt;I murmured a vow of silence and now &lt;br /&gt;I don't even hear when I think aloud &lt;br /&gt;Extinguished by light I turn on the night &lt;br /&gt;Wear its darkness with an empty smile &lt;br /&gt;I'm creeping back to life &lt;br /&gt;My nervous system all awry &lt;br /&gt;I'm wearing the inside out &lt;br /&gt;Look at him now &lt;br /&gt;He's paler somehow &lt;br /&gt;But he's coming around &lt;br /&gt;He's starting to choke &lt;br /&gt;It's been so long since he spoke &lt;br /&gt;Well he can have the words right from my mouth &lt;br /&gt;And with these words I can see &lt;br /&gt;Clear through the clouds that covered me &lt;br /&gt;Just give it time then speak my name &lt;br /&gt;Now we can hear ourselves again &lt;br /&gt;I'm holding out (He's standing on the threshold) &lt;br /&gt;For the day (Caught in fiery anger) &lt;br /&gt;When all the clouds &lt;br /&gt;(And hurled into the furnace he'll) &lt;br /&gt;Have blown away (.. &lt;br /&gt;curse the place) &lt;br /&gt;I'm with you now &lt;br /&gt;(He's torn in all directions) &lt;br /&gt;Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering) &lt;br /&gt;Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break) &lt;br /&gt;Ourselves again &lt;br /&gt;Take it Back &lt;br /&gt;Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze &lt;br /&gt;I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea &lt;br /&gt;I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire &lt;br /&gt;We were spinning into darkness, t &lt;br /&gt;he earth was on fire &lt;br /&gt;She could take it back &lt;br /&gt;he might take it back some day &lt;br /&gt;So I spy on her, I lie to her, &lt;br /&gt;I make promises I cannot keep &lt;br /&gt;Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep &lt;br /&gt;And I make her prove her love for me, &lt;br /&gt;I take all that I can take &lt;br /&gt;And I push her to the limit to see if she will break &lt;br /&gt;She might take it back, &lt;br /&gt;she could take it back some day &lt;br /&gt;Now I have seen the warnings, &lt;br /&gt;screaming from all sides &lt;br /&gt;It's eay to ignore them and G-d knows I've tried &lt;br /&gt;All of this temptation, it turned my faith to lies &lt;br /&gt;Until I couldn't see the danger &lt;br /&gt;or hear the rising tide &lt;br /&gt;She can take it back, she will take it back some day &lt;br /&gt;She can take it back, she will take it back some day &lt;br /&gt;She will take it back, she will take it back some day &lt;br /&gt;Coming Back to Life &lt;br /&gt;Where were you when I was burned and broken &lt;br /&gt;While the days slipped by from my window watching &lt;br /&gt;Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless &lt;br /&gt;Because the things you say &lt;br /&gt;and the things you do surround me &lt;br /&gt;While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words &lt;br /&gt;Dying to believe in what you heard &lt;br /&gt;I was staring straight into the shining sun &lt;br /&gt;Lost in thought and lost in time &lt;br /&gt;While the seeds of life and the seeds of were planted &lt;br /&gt;Outside the rain fell dark and slow &lt;br /&gt;While I pondered on this dangerous &lt;br /&gt;but irresistable pastime &lt;br /&gt;I took a heavenly ride through our silence &lt;br /&gt;I knew the moment had arrived &lt;br /&gt;For killing the past and coming back to life &lt;br /&gt;I took a heavenly ride through our silence &lt;br /&gt;I knew the waiting had begun &lt;br /&gt;And headed straight.. &lt;br /&gt;into the shining son &lt;br /&gt;Keep Talking &lt;br /&gt;For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals &lt;br /&gt;Then something happened &lt;br /&gt;which unleashed the power of our imagination &lt;br /&gt;We learned to talk &lt;br /&gt;There's a silence surrounding me &lt;br /&gt;I can't seem to think straight &lt;br /&gt;I'll sit in the corner &lt;br /&gt;No one can bother me &lt;br /&gt;I think I should speak now &lt;br /&gt;(Why won't you talk to me) &lt;br /&gt;I can't seem to speak now (You never talk to me) &lt;br /&gt;My words won't come out right &lt;br /&gt;(What are you thinking) &lt;br /&gt;I feel like I'm drowning &lt;br /&gt;(What are you feeling) &lt;br /&gt;I'm feeling weak now &lt;br /&gt;(Why won't you talk to me) &lt;br /&gt;But I can't show my weakness &lt;br /&gt;(You never talk to me) &lt;br /&gt;I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking) &lt;br /&gt;Where do we go from here (What are you feeling) &lt;br /&gt;It doesn't have to be like this &lt;br /&gt;All we need to do &lt;br /&gt;is make sure we keep talking &lt;br /&gt;Why won't you alk to me &lt;br /&gt;(I feel like I'm drowning) &lt;br /&gt;You never talk to me &lt;br /&gt;(You know I can't breathe now) &lt;br /&gt;What are you thinking &lt;br /&gt;(We're going nowhere) &lt;br /&gt;What are you feeling &lt;br /&gt;(We're going nowhere) &lt;br /&gt;Why won't you talk to me &lt;br /&gt;You never talk to me &lt;br /&gt;What are you thinking &lt;br /&gt;Where do we go from here &lt;br /&gt;It doesn't have to be like this &lt;br /&gt;All we need to do &lt;br /&gt;is make sure we keep talking &lt;br /&gt;Lost for Words &lt;br /&gt;I was spending my time in the doldrums &lt;br /&gt;I was caught in a cauldron of hate &lt;br /&gt;I felt persecuted and paralysed &lt;br /&gt;I thought that everythign else would just wait &lt;br /&gt;While you are wasting your time on your enemies &lt;br /&gt;Engulfed in a fever of spite &lt;br /&gt;Beyond your tunnel vision, reality fades &lt;br /&gt;Like shadows into the night &lt;br /&gt;To martyr yourself to caution &lt;br /&gt;Is not going to help at all &lt;br /&gt;Because there'll be no safety in numbers &lt;br /&gt;When the Right One walks out of the door &lt;br /&gt;Can you see your days blighted by darkness? &lt;br /&gt;Is it true you beat your fists on the floor? &lt;br /&gt;Stuck in a world of isolation &lt;br /&gt;While the ivy grows over your door &lt;br /&gt;So I opened my door to my enemies &lt;br /&gt;And I ask could we wipe the slate clean &lt;br /&gt;But they tell me to please go fuck myself &lt;br /&gt;You know you just can't win &lt;br /&gt;High Hopes &lt;br /&gt;Beyond the horizon of the place we lived &lt;br /&gt;when we were young &lt;br /&gt;In a world of magnets and miracles &lt;br /&gt;Our thoughts strayed &lt;br /&gt;constantly and without boundary &lt;br /&gt;The ringing of the division bell had begun &lt;br /&gt;Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway &lt;br /&gt;Do they still meet there by the Cut? &lt;br /&gt;There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps &lt;br /&gt;Running before time took &lt;br /&gt;our dreams away &lt;br /&gt;Leaving the myriad small creatures &lt;br /&gt;trying to tie us to the ground &lt;br /&gt;To a life consumed by slow decay &lt;br /&gt;The grass was greener &lt;br /&gt;The light was brighter &lt;br /&gt;With friends surrounded &lt;br /&gt;The nights of wonder &lt;br /&gt;Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us &lt;br /&gt;To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side &lt;br /&gt;Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again &lt;br /&gt;Dragged by the force of some inner tide &lt;br /&gt;At a higher altitude with flag unfurled &lt;br /&gt;We reached the dizzy heights &lt;br /&gt;of that dreamed of world &lt;br /&gt;Encumbered forever by desire and ambition &lt;br /&gt;There's a hunger still unsatisfied &lt;br /&gt;Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon &lt;br /&gt;Though down this road we've been so many times &lt;br /&gt;The grass was greener &lt;br /&gt;The light was brighter &lt;br /&gt;The taste was sweeter &lt;br /&gt;The

&lt;br /&gt;The forest was also inhabited &lt;br /&gt;By a small group of people called the lizards &lt;br /&gt;The lizards were a simple people &lt;br /&gt;And they had lived in the forest undisturbed &lt;br /&gt;For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once a year when spring came &lt;br /&gt;And the first blossoms began to show &lt;br /&gt;The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain &lt;br /&gt;To give thanks for all that they had &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They thanked the birds &lt;br /&gt;And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks &lt;br /&gt;And the trees and the rivers &lt;br /&gt;But most importantly, they thanked Icculus &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Icculus lived at the top of the mountain &lt;br /&gt;Or at least everyone thought so &lt;br /&gt;For no one had actually ever seen him &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But they knew he existed &lt;br /&gt;Because they had the Helping Friendly Book &lt;br /&gt;Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book &lt;br /&gt;To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It contained all of the knowledge &lt;br /&gt;Inherent in the universe &lt;br /&gt;And had enabled the Lizards &lt;br /&gt;To exist in harmony with nature for years &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And so they lived &lt;br /&gt;Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge &lt;br /&gt;His name was Wilson &lt;br /&gt;And he quickly became intrigued &lt;br /&gt;By the Lizards way of life &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He asked if he could stay on &lt;br /&gt;And live in the forest &lt;br /&gt;And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider &lt;br /&gt;Were happy to oblige &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years &lt;br /&gt;Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book &lt;br /&gt;And all was well &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone &lt;br /&gt;Wilson explained that he had hidden the book &lt;br /&gt;Knowing that the Lizards had become &lt;br /&gt;Dependent on it for survival &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He declared himself king &lt;br /&gt;And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge &lt;br /&gt;He cut down the trees and built a city &lt;br /&gt;Which he called Prussia &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And in the center of the city &lt;br /&gt;He built a castle &lt;br /&gt;And locked in the highest tower of the castle</field> &lt;br /&gt;
