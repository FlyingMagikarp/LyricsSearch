The buildings were dead and the alleys Stunk from things that used to live there Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered A child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence With not a scrap left on the plate And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable Cause the only thing left was their faith And there sure as hell ain't much I can do About it.... There's a meltdown in the sky There's a new day comin' and I don't know why There's a fear that gets me high And the cold night numbs as the jet black clouds roll on by.... So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold Made me wonder just who was the foe And was it all to come true what nostradamus Had predicted such a long long time ago? You could hear screams and moanin' From the people atoning For their sins of a guilt ridden life And the final door shuts From the wind that leaves cuts From the edge on the blade of god's knife And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about.... There's a melt down in the sky There's a new day comin and I don't know why There's a tear stuck in my eye There's a new day comin' and I don't know why Battle lines had been drawn Mother nature how she cried By her side, till the dawn Couldn't kill her if they tried How they tried, open eyed, genocide Then... she died Battle lines had been drawn Mother nature how she cried By her side, till the dawn Couldn't kill her if they tried How they tried, open eyed, genocide Then... she died There's a meltdown in the sky There's a new day comin' and I don't know why There's a fear that gets me high And the cold night numbs as the jet black clouds roll on by....</field> &lt;br /&gt;        </doc> &lt;br /&gt;         &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;        <doc> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="artist">afi</field> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="song">born in the usa</field> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="genre">Pop</field> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="language">en</field> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="lyrics">"Frank wont be coming in today, Joe. &lt;br /&gt;or tomorrow. &lt;br /&gt;Frank quit, bought a goat farm..moved to Ukiah." &lt;br /&gt;"I like really big tits &lt;br /&gt;I like really big tits. &lt;br /&gt;Reading pornos, watchin' girly shows, takin' off their clothes. &lt;br /&gt;I like watchin' gay men fight &lt;br /&gt;I like watchin' gay men fight. &lt;br /&gt;Walk like a macho man, love Hulk Hogan, love the slogan. &lt;br /&gt;"Hulk rules!" &lt;br /&gt;I'm just God's gift to Earth &lt;br /&gt;I'm just God's gift to Earth. &lt;br /&gt;Walkin' in a strut 'cross the side of the bar, drivin' a chevy truck. &lt;br /&gt;You know me with gun racks, got a .40 growin' up eat and live and breath dregs- &lt;br /&gt;I'm born in the US of A, born in the US of A, born in the US of A. &lt;br /&gt;I've been tryin' to be a man &lt;br /&gt;I'm just tryin' to be a man. &lt;br /&gt;Drink from dawn to night, lookin’ for a fight, makes everything alright. &lt;br /&gt;I like really big tits &lt;br /&gt;I like really big tits &lt;br /&gt;I think I’ll look up to all the girls, a slut might just beat me up. &lt;br /&gt;You know me with gun racks, got a .40 growin' up, even though I’ve got three ???- &lt;br /&gt;I'm born in the US of A, born in the US of A, born in the US of A. &lt;br /&gt;You know me with gun racks, got a .40 growin' up, eat and live and breath dregs- &lt;br /&gt;I'm born in the US of A, born in the US of A, born in the US of A. &lt;br /&gt;We'll shiiiit."</field> &lt;br /&gt;        </doc> &lt;br /&gt;         &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;        <doc> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="artist">afi</field> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="song">miss murder</field> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="genre">Pop</field> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="language">en</field> &lt;br /&gt;            <field name="lyrics">Chorus: &lt;br /&gt;Hey, Miss Murder can I! &lt;br /&gt;Hey, Miss Murder can I! &lt;br /&gt;Make beauty stay if I, &lt;br /&gt;take my life?

&lt;br /&gt;I can't remember many moments in the light &lt;br /&gt;This retribution has defiled me to no end &lt;br /&gt;An execution without merit looms ahead &lt;br /&gt;Tell me why! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was a boy who had to live his own way &lt;br /&gt;I never fit into the model they had designed &lt;br /&gt;I chose a path less taken &lt;br /&gt;I stood with others who had often felt the same &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We got stares from passersby &lt;br /&gt;Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away &lt;br /&gt;And when the three young boys died &lt;br /&gt;They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No hope in sight &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I sit here terrified! &lt;br /&gt;Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? &lt;br /&gt;Won't anybody open up their eyes? &lt;br /&gt;Before the three of us have lost our lives! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why was everybody so damn afraid? &lt;br /&gt;They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime &lt;br /&gt;And to justify their own faith &lt;br /&gt;We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The three of us were attacked and disgraced &lt;br /&gt;For many hours we were questioned and someone lied &lt;br /&gt;One of us couldn't take it &lt;br /&gt;His simple manner was manipulated in kind &lt;br /&gt;Fear made him lie &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I sit here terrified! &lt;br /&gt;Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? &lt;br /&gt;Won't anybody open up their eyes? &lt;br /&gt;Before the three of us have lost our lives! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I am terrified &lt;br /&gt;Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? &lt;br /&gt;Won't anybody open up their eyes? &lt;br /&gt;Before the three of us have lost our lives &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And why? &lt;br /&gt;Can't anybody see through their disguise? &lt;br /&gt;Only believe we didn't take their lives &lt;br /&gt;And now the three of us have lost our lives &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I often wonder why I sit and wait to die &lt;br /&gt;What have I done to justify the sentence they gave? &lt;br /&gt;Too many hours spent in darkness questioning &lt;br /&gt;"How and why"? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can't remember many moments in the light &lt;br /&gt;This retribution has defiled me to no end &lt;br /&gt;An execution without merit looms ahead &lt;br /&gt;Tell me why</field> &lt;br /&gt;
