Keep on coming
Right, let's roll
Back to the touch
Back to the taste
Who's now on?
I'm letting you know
She's gonna shout
She's gonna push it all the way down
No I can't believe
Man, you're sweet
Back down now baby
When you scream
Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock the night and then roll
Seek all the things
She's gonna shake it down
Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock the night
I really know that you will see
Just how a woman is waiting for me
I'll make you scream
Rock on you, baby
Make you scream
Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock the night and then roll
Rock the house
Rock the house
Then roll
Get lost, get down</field>

Rock your little heart out
You gotta rock it on down
Got everything you want, got everything you need
Don't worry about the cost, just sell your soul to me
You gotta bring the house down
Beat the drums load
Bleed your lamp dry
Come on let's fly
Rock your little, rock your little
rock your little heart out
Rock, rock your little heart out
Rock it on down
Cut your teeth on this
You gotta put your foot down
Beat your chest hard
Blow your brains out
Feel her shout loud

Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice
You say that you want respect
Honey for what?
For everything that you've done for me
Thanks a lot
Get up off your bended knees
You could set your mind at ease
My temperature's running hot
I've been waiting all night for a bite of what you got
(Chorus)
Damnation, they're puttin' you down
Damnation, all over town
Damnation, cause you're way outta reach
Livin' on the streets you gotta practice what you
preach
(Chorus)
Damnation, left a happy home
Damnation, to live on your own
Damnation, you want to live in sin
Damnation, it's a rock 'n' roll -
Damnation, just a bundle of joy
Damnation, you're a toy for a boy
Damnation, you got dollars in your eye
Damnation, chasin' that pie in the sky
Damnation, rock 'n' roll -

She's a woman, she's a winner
In every way, way, way
She don't want love

I like it better when she read my mind
You know, don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't want to play that game
CHORUS:
Just give me that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby give me ruff stuff
You don't want ruff stuff?
Don't want your face around here
Make you shake, make you shiver
Make you pray, pray, pray
Gonna make you quake, make you quiver
And turn you grey, grey, grey
I don't need brakes
They slow me down too much
They keep me out of touch
They lock me in
I like it better when I pull the pin
You know, don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't want to play that game

I like them big and I like them small
And if they asked me to take an oath, I would have to take them all

Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden rule
American history and practical maths
You studyin' hard and you're hopin' to pass
Ooh you're working your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone
Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the kitchen is ready to sell
But you're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you got time to eat
Well back in the classroom open your books
Ooh the teacher don't know how mean she looks
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roooooll
As soon as 3 o'clock goes around
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books and outta your seat
You go down the hallway into the street
And you're tryin' to forget just where you've been
You find a juke joint, you go in
You drop the quarter right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot, like me
With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long they wanted to dance
And you're feeling the music from head to toe
As round and round and round you go
Get over here
Long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll, hey

Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hang out with me?
And maybe burn me up?
She was standing alone, over by the junkie box
Like she's something to sell
I said baby what's the going price
She told me to go to hell
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Singles bar, got my eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She's got eyes of slate
(She my mistake)
She mind on here money
I really don't care, no
Said hey baby, you're driving me crazy
Laying out on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
"Toss off buddy she's mine"
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Hey you, Angus, shoot me, shoot
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
I don't want to be in pain
Don't want to be
Shot down in flames</field>

We'll take a double shot of ecstasy
I'll drink some water from a wooden cup
Keep a rocking till the sun comes up
And I warn you, it's the best shot of your life
Shot of love
Rock you little lady make you blow and breath
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed
Come on now honey we'll get full of desire
A humping and pumping till we start a fire
And I warn you, it's the best shot of your life
Shot of love
Shot of love
I'm gonna make you plead
And I warn you, it's the best shot of your life
Shot of love
Like to plead
Shot of love
A humping and pumping got you jumping
Shot of love

Underneath that old apple tree
Sitting with a handful of flowers
Looking as cool as can be
We talked away a couple of hours
Then she laid her hand on my lap
Oh I thought I got to be dreaming
I didn't know I fell in her trap
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play
She was a soul stripper, yeah
She took my heart
She was a soul stripper, ooh
And tore me apart
She started moving nice and easy
Slowly getting near to my spine
Killing off each last little feeling
Ooh everyone she could find
And when she had me hollow and naked, yeah
That's when she put me down
Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me
Stuck it in and turned it around
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say, you know
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play
She was a soul stripper, yeah
Ooh she took my heart
Ooh was a soul stripper
Tore me apart
Soul stripper, soul stripper

See me ride out of the sunset
On your colour Tv screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right
Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
(But) don't you start no fight
Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
T.N.T
and I'll win the fight
T.N.T
I'm a power load
T.N.T
watch me explode
I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand?
So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
(And) run for your life
The man is back in town
(So) don't you mess me 'round
Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
T.N.T

Her Deuce was wild
But my Ace was high
But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before
Said she'd never had a Full House
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack(7x)
She's got the Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
She's got the Jack
Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you
She play'd 'em fast
And she play'd 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card
But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before
Said she'd never had a Royal Flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were comin'
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealin' out
I'd have dealt it back
She's got the Jack, She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack, And who knows what else?

That she gave it to anybody
But I made her cry
And I made her scream
I took her high
And I curdled her cream

She told me she was a virgin
She was number nine, ninety-nine on the clinical list
And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch

But she gave me her heart
And she gave me her soul
And a great, big - warn out
Empty hole
But how was I to know it had been filled in before
She said, "Bon, I've never had the urgency"
She was number nine, ninety-nine on the critical list
And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch
She's got the Jack

You know, I woke up one morning
and there it was on the sheets -the clap
Now I know you all call it the clap
Over here so what I'm gonnado
I'm gonna say "She's got the --"

Just what it is she's got, in this case it's the clap

Where the sun's so hot and the daylight don't show.
Where the moccasin she rests on a soft bed of sand,
You can hear the hound dog howling out the land.
Chorus:
It ain't the way i wanted it.
But lord that's the price you pay.
I said jailer bring me water for my throat is dry,
Four walls, steel bars, i've been watching passersby,
I've been sitting here so long i'm starting to cry,
The hangman's coming, i'm surely going to die.
Chorus:
It ain't the way i wanted it.
But lord that's the price you pay.
Oh, honk on it, boy,
A little jail cell blues here.
Lead break
I shot a man in macon over a poker game,
I killed another in atlanta just to build my fame,
Well, now i hear the hammers they're pounding out my name.
It ain't the way i wanted it.
But that's the price you pay.
It ain't the way i wanted it.
But lord that's the price you pay.
Hey jailer, how about that water my throat's still dry,
Four walls, steel bars, i've been watching passersby,
I've been sitting here so damn long i'm starting to cry,
The hangman's coming i'm surely going to die.
It ain't the way i wanted it.

When the flags are high, hear the battle cry
Treaty gone, see the bandits fly
Dig the trench, watch that blast
Shell shock come, coming fast
Name and rank on parade
Might get laid by a hand grenade
Do you know what it means?
This - means - war
This means war, this means war
I said this means war, this means war
This means war

I need you to fire
Cock your gun, wet your sights
Get the bull dead to rights
Volunteers, one pace back
On the beach ain't no place for kids
When the flack is high on a bomber run
You don't talk back to an ack-ack gun
Fire range, and you're in the blitz
Keep your head or you're blown to bits
Name and rank on parade
Might get laid by a hand grenade

Who's going there, is it a friend or foe?

There was nothing that she wouldn't do

She knew we were making love
I was so satisfied deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She has a touch, a touch too much
She had the face of an angel, smiling with sin
The body of venus with arms
Dealin' with danger, strokin' my skin
Like a thunder and lightening storm
It wasn't the first, wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard, wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare
Seems like a touch, a touch too much

Last stand
Down to my last dime
I ain't got the sense to leave
The dealers cutting fine
Last draw
Back against the wall
Depending where the money is
Is where I'm gonna fall
Ace high
Hide your poker eyes
I didn't want to laugh too much
When I picked up the prize
Lady Luck
Standing at my side
I'll leave with more than I brought in
And I get out with my life
I get out with my life
CHORUS:
I go, you go, she go, we go
Two's up, it's a two's up
Give me head, give me tails
Give me doubled up and coming doubled over on the rails
Give me two's up, it's what I want
(Alright)
High up
When you're looking down
Then you see two animals
Just fooling you around
Stray dogs
Gonna take them in
I don't know what your names are
But you're gonna break them in
All day
It's difficult to say
Who is doing what to whom
Who's out of the play
I love
The way you slide and slip
Love the way you girls work out
And make the partnership
Make that partnership
CHORUS
(Gotta give me double or quits)
Two's up, two's up
Like your partnership
Like the way you slip
There ain't nothing like a two's up
That's the way it is, two's up
It's what I want to hear
Give me head, give me tails
Give me doubled up and coming over on the rails
Two's up, it's locomotion
Two's up, you're drivin' me wild
Give me high, give me low
Give me twice the satisfaction
Twice the pot of gold (?)
And it's a two's up
It's gonna be two's up
We're gonna have a two's up, two's up, two's up, two's up
There ain't nothin' like a two's up

Don't need no more
You've been peekin' all around
While they're messin' about
Better get your name, come on in
Gimme that thing and feed your war...
War Machine
Make a stand, show your hand
Call in the high command
Don't think, just obey
I'm like a bird of prey
So better get your name, come on in
Gimme that thing and feed your war...
War Machine
Better watch your back
N` cover your tracks
Kick your foot
through the door
Hit the deck, know the score
They take you by surprise
And here's mud in your eye
This will be the day
they shouldn't forget
Call of the wild,
hungry for more
And feed your...
War Machine
Let's go
I've seen your war ...

Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view
On the finest avenue
Lookin at your beat on the street
You're always pushin, shovin
Satisfied with nothing
You bitch you must be gettin old
So stop your love on the road
All your diggin for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
I wonder
Honey, what do you do for money
Honey, what do you do for money
How do ya get your kicks?
You're ridin on the take and you're always on the make
Squeezin all the blood out of men
They're standin in a queue just to spend the night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin, stabbin
Tryin to get it back but girl you must be gettin slow
So stop your love on the road
All your diggin for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
Yes I wonder
Honey, what do you do for money
Honey, what do you do for money

How do you get your kicks?

Cannonball down the line
Giving that woman just a one more chance
To give it to me one more time
Engineer wishing he was home in bed
Dreaming about Casey Jones
Wide-eyed woman heading a mile ahead
Thinking about broken bones
(CHORUS:)
It's her love that I want
It's her love that I need
It's her love got to have
It's her love
Heavenly body flying across the sky
Superman was out of town
Come on honey, gotta change your tune
Cause it's a long way down
Clark Kent looking for a free ride
Thinking about Louise Lane
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's - a suicide
And that'd be a shame
(CHORUS:)
It's her love that I want
It's her love that I need
It's her love got to have
It's her love
But what's next to the moon?
Long Arm looking for a fingerprint
Trying to find the mystery clue
Hitting me with the third degree
Working on a thumb screw
Alright, officer, I confess
Everything's coming back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack
(CHORUS:)
It's her love that I want
It's her love that I need
It's her love got to have
It's her love
What's next to the moon
If not the sky, oh baby, say bye-bye.</field>

Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
Cause the walls started shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were makin' it
and you...
Shook me all night long
Yeah you, shook me all night long
Walking double time on the seduction line
She was one of a kind
She's just mine all mine
Wanted no applause
It's just another cause
Made a meal out of me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
But the walls was shaking
Earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it

Shook me all night long
Yeah you, shook me all night long
Knockin' me out, yeah you
Shook me all night long

Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you
Is a moment I treasure
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Lying close to you
Feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever, forever and ever
I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well, I just wanna be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just wanna hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

When I was so brokenhearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Listen to me
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do-down on me
Now there's not even breathin' room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah you cry when we're makin love
Must be one and the same
It's down on me
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me
'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Till you give your heart away
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin to forget you

Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Well, sing with me, sing for the years

But I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

With a one-night stand,
With a one track mind
Out in no-man's land
(The punishment sometimes don't seem to fit the crime)
Yeah there's a hole in my soul
But one thing I've learned
For every love letter written
There's another one burned
(So you tell me how it's gonna be this time)
Is it over, Is it over
'Cause I'm blowin' out the flame
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find there's nothing there girl
Yeah I swear, I'm telling you girl yeah 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where the garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, yeah I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose
I'm as dry as a seven-year drought
I got dust for tears
And I'm all tapped out
(Sometimes I feel broken and can't get fixed)
I know there's been all kinds of shoes underneath your bed
Now I sleep with my boots on but you're still in my head
(And something tells me this time I'm down to my last licks)
'Cause if it's over, Then it's over
And it's driving me insane
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find there's nothing there girl
Yeah I swear, I'm telling you girl yeah 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, Yeah, I should have known better

And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy
to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin to walk through
The pain
When I lost my grip
And I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave,
but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired
Of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I
Would die
chorus
It's Amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's Amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's Amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer
for the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings
You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen
to all that righteous talk
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive
chorus
It's Amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's Amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's Amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer

So, from all of us at Aerosmith
To all of you, wherever you are
Remember, the light at the end of the tunnel
May be you

We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere
Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly
If this life
Gets any harder now
It ain't no never mind
You got me by your side
And anytime you want (fly fly fly)
Yeah we catch a train and find a better place

You can have a better ride now

But man he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Dog days just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain
Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away
Run, run away

It's Janie's last I
O

She had to take him down easy
And put a bullet in his brain

She said 'cause nobody believes me

Am I the one to blame?
I gave up and left you for a nowhere-bound train
Now that train has come and gone
I close my eyes and see you lying in my bed
And I still dream of that day
What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me
And now that I'm alone
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be
An old friend told me that you found somebody new
Oh, you're finally moving on
You think that I'd be over you after all these years
Yeah, but time has proved it wrong
'Cause I'm still holdin' on
What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me
And now that I'm alone
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be
We've gone our separate ways
Say goodbye to another day
I still wonder where you are
Are you too far from turning back?
You were slipping through my hands and I didn't understand
What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me
And now that I'm alone
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free

I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this!
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing "Hey diddle diddle"
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I knowed love was here to stay
When she told me to
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Just gimme a kiss
Like this!
Schoolgirl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this!
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing "Hey diddle diddle"
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance

Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'

She told me to

Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way

If I could change the world
Like a fairy tale
I would drink the love
From your Holy Grail
I would start with love
Tell ol' Beelzebub
To get outta town
Cause you just lost your job
How did we get so affected (cause I think)
Love is love reflected
Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise yo' drinkin' glass
Here's to yesterday
In Time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss Heaven off
We got Hell to pay
Come full circle
And if
There's a spell on you that
I could take away
I would do the deed
Yeah and by the way
Here's to Heaven know's
As the circle goes
It ain't right
I'm uptight
Yeah and get off my toes
I used to think that every little
thing I did was crazy
But now I think the Karma
cops are comin' after you
Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise yo' drinkin' glass
Here's to yesterday

We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss Heaven off
We got Hell to pay
Come full circle
Every time you get yourself caught up inside
Of someone else's crazy dream
Own it, yeah that's a mistake
Everybody's gotta lotta nada killing them
Instead of killing time
Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise yo' drinkin' glass

We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss Heaven off

Well there's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises
I guess they don't mean a thing
So baby what's the story
Did you find another man
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made
When you don't look back
I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is
That you can sleep
In the night without thinking you lost
Everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Girl before I met you
I was f

fine
But your love made me a prisoner
Yeah my heart's been doin' time
Spent me up like money
Well then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
'cause you had me deep with the devil in your eyes
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is
That you can sleep
In the night without thinking you lost
Everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much
Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' for me
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night

But now it's ooh baby please
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad
We was making love when you told me that you loved me
I thought ol' cupid he was taking aim
I was believer when you told me that you loved me
And then you called me someone else's name
There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone

That falling in love is so hard on the knees
You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad
Chip off the old block
Man you're so much like your sister
My fantasize it must be out of luck
My old libido has been blowing a transistor
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck
Yeah
I'm Jonesin' on love
Yeah I got the DT's
You say that we will
But there ain't no guarantees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
What are you looking for
It's got to be hard core
Must be some kind of nouveau riche
Is this your only chance
Or some hypnotic trance
Let's get you on a tighter leash
Own it own it own it
You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad
You ain't that good
Is what you said down to the letter
But you like the way I hold the microphone
Sometimes I?m good but when I'm bad
I'm even better
Don't give me no lip
I've got enough of my own
There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these

Her picture graced to grime on the door
She a long lost love at first bite
Baby maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody say
Forgive me if I seem out of line
Then she whipped out her gun
Tried to blow me away
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
So never judge a book by its cover
Or who you're going to love by your lover
Love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a venus
Lord imagine my surprise
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
What a funky lady
She like it like it like it like that
He was a lady
Baby let me follow you down
Let me take a peek dear
Baby let me follow you down
Do me, do me, do me all night
Baby let me follow you down
Turn the other cheek dear
Baby let me follow you down

And love you just a little more (whoa yeah)

Nobody gets out alive

Livin' it up when I'm going down

Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Gonna be a penthouse pauper
Gonna be a millionaire
Gonna be a real fast talker
And have me a love affair
Gotta get my timing right
It's a test that I got to pass
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey
Kiss your sassafrass
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm going down

There is nothing wrong your perception of the reality
Do not attempt to adjust the illusion
We control the harmonics

We can reduce the volume to a whisper
Or increase it to a deafening roar
Now is the time to submit quietly
We control all you hear and feel
You are about to enter a great adventure
And experience the odd and mystery
From your ultimate fantasies, to your deepest fears
From which you may never return

I got the fever, fever, fever, fever
Yeah, they threw me outa jail I tell ya it ain't fair
I tried to kiss the judge from the electrica' chair
Yeah we're all here cause we're not all there tonight
The guitar's cranked and the bass man's blown a fuse
And when the whole gang bangs tell me then what's you're excuse
We got the fever, fever, fever, fever
Fever gives ya lust with an appetite
It hits ya like the fangs from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here cause we're not all there tonight
We can't run away from trouble
There ain't no place that far
But if we do it right at the speed of light
There's the back seat of my car, caviar
I was feelin' so high I forgot what day
Now I'm feelin low down even slow seems way too fast
And now the booze don't work and the drugs ran out of gas
Chorus
The buzz that you be gettin' from the crack don't last
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass
Yeah we're all here cause we're not all there tonight
My first time ever lover
We fell asleep out on the lawn
And when I woke up I was all alone
Makin' love to the crack of dawn
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir
The gangster of love rides again
I got the fever
You know I get a chill
Fever
It gimme such a thrill
Fever
Like a burnin' plague
Fever
Yeah get outta my way
Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear
As long as I'm in heaven honey I don't care
You look so good baby look so fine
I tell you you're the image of the perfect crime
You gets so tired holdin' on so tight
If you think you're goin' crazy well you may be right

With a thought like that you can't go wrong
About the girls of summer
Oh yeah
(Do you know, everybody knows now)
Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls are born to make you cry
Over and over again
My favorite thing that drives me wild
Is when a city girl walks a country mile
For a boy she loves, God bless the child
Inside the girls of summer
Oh yeah

Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls can't live without it

They get you climbin' the walls
They get you caught in their spell
They get you speakin' in tongues
Could this be Heaven or Hell
To fall in love twice a day
Is such a sweet place to be
Sîl vous plait
The best things about life are free
The pussywillow up your tree
To the one who climbs
They'll always be the girl, yeah
Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls no doubt about it
Some girls are born to make you cry
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls got twenty reasons why

It surely opened his eyes
Well, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Well, she ate it
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right
Even Eve in Eden
Voices tried deceivin'
With lies to show the lady the way
At first she stopped and turned
And tried to walk away
Man, he was believer
Lady was deceiver
So the story goes, but you see
The snake was he and she just climbed right up his
tree
So, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
She ate it
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right
Science was related

When Lady Luck took him by surprise
Her sweet and bitter fruits
Surely opened his eyes
Evil came like rain
And who knows who's to blame
And something tried to lay her to waste
And all she want to need was just a little taste
So, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Yeah, She ate it

But you ain't got no case
Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin´ my mind
´Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
You think you're fine as calamine but not
enough to scratch a seven year itch
´Cause love is like the last licks
Outta Hendrix...yeah
Ain't that a bitch, Ain't that a bitch
Then you feel so out of place
Lickin´ up the arsenic
From the same old lace
You know the stuff is poison
But you gotta have a taste
You gotta
Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin´ my mind
´Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up with your face in a ditch
´Cause love is like a warm gun
On a cold night...yeah
Ain't that a bitch, Ain't that a bitch</field>

And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy
to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin to walk through
The pain
When I lost my grip
And I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave,
but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired
Of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I
Would die
chorus
It's Amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's Amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's Amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer
for the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings
You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen
to all that righteous talk
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive
chorus
It's Amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's Amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's Amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer
for the desperate hearts tonight
[spoken]
So, from all of us at Aerosmith
To all of you, wherever you are
Remember, the light at the end of the tunnel
May be you
Goodnight</field>

Your running in place like a rat in a race going nowhere
The evil you speaks from the tongue of a freak so don't go there

Why I thought of that, I just

Ya got like a little animal cracker, Discovery channel thing
Watch the gazelle as he grazes through the open plains
Now look, as the cheetah approaches
Watch as he stalks his prey
Now the gazelle is a little spooked
He could head north to the manless peaks above or south
The gazelle now faces mans most parlous question
North or south way down tune in next week
(Baby, do you think it's possible)
That anyone else in this world
Is doing this very same thing at this very same moment?
I hope so

Give my heart a break
You say it's you that loves me more
And then you kick and slam your door.
Hey
While you're on your way
I want to thank you for the ride
And pull the thorn out of my side
And call me your baby.
I kissed away the tears you cried
And then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
It's all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes
Yeah, what it takes to make this love survive
Another last goodbye
Another last goodbye
You crash and burn
With the pages turned
In your black book full of names
And then you throw your frozen heart
Out in somebody else's flames
And it's a low down dirty, dirty shame.
Don't let this love slip through the tracks
I miss your claw marks on my back
And call me your baby
I kissed away the tears you cried
And then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
Yeah, It's all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes
Yeah, what it takes to make this love survive
Another last goodbye
(Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah)
I believe I've always been in love with you
Though we got caught up in the sway
Never know in where we left
Been off the hook and out of hand
Sometimes I feel that love is a crime
‘Cause I remember, yeah, the very first time
You call me your baby
I kissed away the tears you cried
And then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
It's all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes
Yeah, what it takes to make this love survive
Another last goodbye (8x)</field>

So I didn't believe when you said

Knew of another place in space in time
He told of how me and my lady could look but we would never find
Said if you please I beg your pardon
Sometimes the things you see they just ain't so
Your life can be an Avant Garden
'Cause love's what makes your garden grow
The sun leads the way the moon lights the sky
I see you and I lying in my Avant Garden
I dream of the day when our worlds collide
We won't be denied here inside our Avant Garden
Sometimes my life ain't what it seeming
Right from the start it's what your heart's believing
Could all this just be lucid dreaming
But dreams ain't just enough for me
The sun leads the way the moon lights the sky
I see you and I lying in my Avant Garden
I dream of the day when our worlds collide
We won't be denied here inside our Avant Garden
You know it just ain't right
To deal with other shite
No one should ever be so broken hearted
Don't ever be afraid cause when you got it made
Yeah you don't even have to try
So i'll be waiting in your garden
Watching all your flowers grow
The sun leads the way the moon lights the sky
I see you and I lying in my Avant Garden
I dream of the day when our worlds collide
You'll know we're arrived here inside our Avant Garden
The sun brings the rain the moon needs the sky
I see you and I lying in my Avant Garden
Beware of the lies a word to the wise
There's sweet cherry pies
And truth inside our Avant Garden</field>

Like the storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone
Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
They're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away
I will not move, yet
I'll stand still, instead
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forever more
The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son
They're gone
The sun shines bright
And anger rises
Lorn and lonely
Torn apart
Don't you think
It's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss
Let's pray
That heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror
Shall honour arise
So let's pray
And blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright
Don't you hear me cryin'
Cryin'
Come take me away
I hallow thy name
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forever more
That's what minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense
Outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forever more</field>

Saying
Beautiful!

Beautiful!
Do all the things we never tried

Believe me this trick's no cinch

When I whip out my big ten inch

Well a band that plays its blues
She just love my big ten inch

Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said now stop that jivin'
Now whip out your big ten inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just loves my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
I, I, I cover her with kisses
And when we're in a lover's clinch
She gets all excited
When she begs for my big ten inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
My girl don't go for smokin'
And liquor just make her flinch
Seem she'll go for nothin'
'Cept for my big ten inch

Liftin' up your skirt
Well let me tell ya
What you been doin' in the Firepatch
What you been doin' with your little skirt
Got....
You've been foolin' with the Bitch's Brew
You know the things I told you not to do
You fell into the briar patch
Ain't nothing gonna save your ass
Remember the things you said
The saving and the screams for bread
And now you just walked away
So take it away, all the way
You're fooling with the Bitch's Brew
That ain't the thing you ought to fool with
Now you keep your fingers out of there, honey
You know that ain't no there
The way that you really feel
Down the parts on the way you deal
Where the witch is sight
And the things that you fight
(Oh God)
You've been messin' with the Bitch's Brew
Now don't you know who you're talking to
Say you're talking to the Bitch's who
Tell me you never really cared
The Voodoo man eyes of fire
The Hoodoo man most desire
The Bitches are out n' smooth
Tell from the light of the moon
(Yodle-lay-lay-lay, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)
I've been thinkin'
Had my hands through the sense of time
Yeah, and I've been drinkin'
Just to make this here song rhyme
You're foolin' with the Bitch's Brew
Now don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you....</field>

She was dressed like a chamber maid
All decked out in silk and I took her
Like a cat takes to milk
Come here little Queenie or...
Has the cat got your tongue?
Can't let nobody see me
Come on girl while we're still young
'Cause there's never been no lover's knot
Can tie you down 'cause you're so hot
Don't pinch me ass I may be dreamin'
Hope tonight that I'll be screamin'
Black cherry, black cherry, black cherry
I like it, I like it, I like it
She looked sheik in a funky way
Tongue in cheek baby all the way
Home girls they got pride, she said
'One time around' I said 'Let's go for a ride'
Come here little Queenie..
or ah
Has the cat got your tongue?
My best shot for a C note baby she said
That's why this Janie's got a gun
Because there's nothin' like a good time girl
To take you twice around the world
I'm so in lust I think I'm trippin'
So in love I think I'm slippin'
Down to the river, down to the river of love
Where the love runs deep it's so sad it's a love you can't keep
Down to the river, down to the river
Abover 42nd Street it's so sad
That the bad don't come cheap
Because there's nothing like a good time girl
To take you twice around the world
Right to the land of milk and honey
Leave your troubles, bring your money

I went to night school for the blues
I took some stuff
they said would cool ya
But nothing seemed to light my fuse
But it's all in the past
Like a check that's in the mail
She was a tall whiskey glass
I was an old hound dog
that just loved to chase his tail
Until I met a blind man
Who taught me how to see
A blind man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm gonna make you come with me
Because here comes the sun
and we'll be chasing all the clouds away
I've had some lovers like a joy ride
Some things are never what they seem
My heaven's turned into a landslide
I thank God I woke up from the dream
I met a blind man
Who taught me how to see
A blind man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm gonna make you come with me
Because here comes the sun
and we'll be chasing all the clouds away
The way bees chase honey
And drink all the flowers dry
We'll be saving us a little money
And if that don't do it
yeah, I know the reason why
Don't make no sense lightin' candles
There's too much moonlight in our eyes
I met a blind man
Who taught me how to see
A blind man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm gonna make you come with me

Stand on the seashore lookin' at the city
See the street light look like a lady on the titty
In the wax museum everybody can see themselves
As others can see them but nobody wants to be the baby
Tough break - cabbage head
Try to get a salad made
Hold my pickle, hold the lettuce
Session waters don't upset us
Kid's span face looks so even like a needle
Never make third base like a toilet bowl cleaner
Like an squawk-eight fool with the dooner over double
If I have to do rock a roller up a jello
Statiol coverslag, smokin' bowl no feelin' high
Burn and people, try to let us
Hush I'm for hm, what I'm saying
See me kiss - can you prepance
Waitin' for - Gotta have a dance
Say me now - Say all I need is a chance.</field>

Never gave me too much room
Then one day she came to me
Love at first sight, head to toes
I love her wild, my mountain child
And that's just how she goes
And here she got
Hey I can't stop loving you
Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this
Tell me what you put into that kiss, yeah
Now keep that coming on, let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do

He got my picture on the fridge
And the first time that he kissed me
We was high up on the ridge
And when we came down from the mountain
I will ride with my ...
And for all it costs, for getting lost, there ain't no better sin
Here we go, yeah
You know I can't stop loving you

Now keep that coming on, let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do
Cause I can't stop loving you
When I wake up and see your face
All that jump in a picture lace
And that there's nowhere else I would rather be
Then all tied up in this rhapsody ...
Hey I can't stop loving you

Slidin' over next to me
Man, she said, this life is a drag
It's a shaky situation
I'm hangin' on my will
And I get no satisfaction
From a hundred dollar bill
But I got what I came for
And I'll do it 'till I drop
You do what you want to do
I ain't never gonna stop
(Chorus)
You say you got something that makes you feel good
And you can't stop messin' with it
All your life you've been so misunderstood
'Cause you can't stop messin'with it.
Sittin' by the seashore
Dreamin' 'bout a little more
Circlin' the classifieds

Man I need another fix
I'll never have to kiss the bride
Yeah, the city is a war zone
This country gone to hell
And the beer cans in the alley
From the rich folks on the hill
They're screamin' hallellujah
But I don't givea damn
'Cause I got my own religion
Yeah, it's a right here in my hand

You stand like a marble statue
Trying to look so hard
All decked out in your antique dress

Even a rock will crumble

If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust
Gonna chip that stone away

You fall in love and then love falls away
You turn out the love when you turn out the lights
You hit the heavens when you hit the heights
How can I turn off the flame you know how it kills me
Every time you say love is gone away, I get closer
It's a give and take every time we break, I get closer
You get closer too
I love you baby till death due us part
If love's on a man why not un-break my heart
You start so many things so why not let's dance
2 times in love or a one time romance
How can I turn off the flame you know how it kills me
Every time you say love is gone away, I get closer
It's a give and take every time we break, I get closer
You get closer too
And I don't know why we fight
What's wrong with always being right
It's always those damnedest things,
Can angels fly on broken wings
And every night when I'm alone in bed
I still smell your perfume
Then I wake up and I swear, I swear
I still remember
Every time you say love is gone away, I get closer
It's a give and take every time we break, I get closer

I took a shot on the chin
I'm rearranging my game
tell by the shape I'm in
in line of fire, you know what to say
they gave us no choices, just one shade of grey
my legs keep movin', I don't seem to stray
but I know each step we take, they're one step away
I found the secret, the key to the vault
we walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls
I took the time, to feel for the door
I found the secret, the key to it all
I got the Nouveauree
and dragged it home to bed
I traded you for me
I took it all and said
I find my own fun, sometimes for free
I got to pay it to come lookin' for me

barely stay on cause I'm so God damn gaunt</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Come 'ere baby
You know you drive me up the wall
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems
You got someone on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me
Say you're leavin on a seven thirty train
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood
Girl you been givin me the line so many times
It kind gets that feelin bad looks good
That kind lovin'
Turns a man to a slave
That kind lovin'
Sends a man right to his grave
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue
You're packin up your stuff and talkin like it's tough
And tryin to tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show
That kind lovin'
Makes me wanna pull
Down the shade, yeah
That kinda lovin'
Yeah, now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue
I'm losin my mind, girl
'Cause I'm goin' crazy
I need your love, honey
I need your love
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
I'm losin my mind, girl
'Cause I'm goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
I'm losin my mind, girl
'Cause I'm goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
You turn it on, then you're gone
Yeah you drive me</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Arriving in boats
Black hooded coats
Tormentors climbed into my room
I crawled under my bed
Covered my head
But they're flushin' me out with a broom
The leades, she's small
Pinned my ass to the wall
For my seeds or she'd be losin' her past
Time after time
She'd be readin' my mind
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate it
This is Critcal Mass
So far, so good
I heard the other say
So good, so far
They're takin' me away
I drink to you, your mind, her ass
We'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrake it
This is Critical Mass
Now the tallest of two
With a brush full of blue
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun
That it's really well done
But she just ain't listenin' at all
She points to my heart
Tellin' me if I'm smart
I'll practise and phase
Out and admit
when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screamin' out down the hall
Need it
Need your love
Just then I heard a poundin' on the wall
We're all there
Sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to your alas
We'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
We are the Critical Mass
Time and space is takin' me away
Time and space is takin' me away
Time and space is takin' me away
Time and space is takin' me away</field>

I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry

Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said?
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river..

When I was so brokenhearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Listen to me
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do-down on me
Now there's not even breathin' room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah you cry when we're makin love
Must be one and the same
It's down on me
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me
'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Till you give your heart away
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' to let you
Do what you do what you do down to me, baby, baby, baby
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin to forget you

She like a pooker
She holy roller, love me like a song
She like a lightning
She roller coaster, 'til the break of dawn
She like a shadow
She all around me, nasty hearted dream
She got the sexy
She do it to me, wake me when I scream
God, I'm in love, I'm in love...
Now I lay me down to sleep
Goodnight
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Tonight
If I die before I wake
In your arms, my love can't break away
Darkness (she like a shadow)
Darkness (she all around me)
Nasty hearted dream
Darkness (she got the sexy)
Darkness (she do it to me)
Wake me when I scream.</field>

they talk to me and seem to hypnotize
you say the things nobody dares to say
and I'm not about to let you fly away
my lover with no jet lag
stayin' up all night in the sleepin' bag
you got a heart-beatin' rhythm from the subterrain
I really love you little girl, I don't need to explain
I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl
like a double shot of lovin' so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl
'cause you and me is two of a kind
like deja vu I feel like I've been here
or somewhere else but you've been always near
it's you that's in my dreams I'm beggin' for
but I woke up when someone slammed the door
so hard I fell out of bed
screamin' mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread
and the moral of the story, I can testify
I get stoned on you girl, that's the best reason why.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Sweet Susie Q, she was a rebel
No angel wings, born like the devil
She was so hot, so cool and nasty
Believe it or not, here’s what she asked me...
'If you need love with no condition
Let's do the Do, honey, I'm on a mission'
The girl’s so bitchin’, my backbone’s twitchin’
Cause down in Hell's kitchen, the Devil's Got a New Disguise
I’m on a mission, a proposition
It’s intuition, 'cause the Devil’s Got a New Disguise
If you see Kay tell her I love her
She did me in, but I'll recover
She said LOVE was her desire
All that she touched, she set on fire
She was so diss, I couldn't slake her
She blew a kiss, I threw the dagger
The girl’s so bitchin’, my backbone’s twitchin’
Cause down in Hell's kitchen, the Devil's Got a New Disguise
I’m on a mission, a proposition
It’s intuition, 'cause the Devil’s Got a New Disguise
We came from the wrong side of town
Got nothing to lose when you're upside down
We gotta get out of this place
Got nothing to lose cus...
It ain’t no surprise
When your big ol’ silver eyes
Got me feelin’ tranquilized
When she lets me have her prize
'Cause Monday night
She’s Tuesday wild
On Wednesday night
She’s Thursday’s child
But Friday night, night, night, night, night, night, night
You gotta give me all of your love
We came from the wrong side of town
Got nothin’ to lose when you’re upside down
We lived on the side of the tracks
Got laid in the shed of an old smokestack
We gotta get outta this place
Or we got a heel gonna smash your face
We came from the wrong side of town
The girl’s so bitchin’, my backbone’s twitchin’
Cause down in Hell's kitchen, the Devil's Got a New Disguise
I’m on a mission, a proposition
It’s intuition, 'cause the Devil’s Got a New Disguise
The girl’s so bitchin’, my backbone’s twitchin’

Chantilly Lace was head to toe in these tights
I smell that Perfume now here she come again
I can't believe this chick and a check out that grin
The way that you come yeah the way that you drool
Don't give me no nevermind I ain't yesterday's fool
You buzzin' round my hive some and reek of self conceit
Rubbin up and down my leg like a dog in heat
You're a dime store lover
A dime store lover
Just a back page cover
Yeah a dime store lover....
Now some object when I throw down my cool
But I'm judge and jury so uh..
objection overuled
She did her best just to put on the charm
She said "I dare you", I said "twist my arm"
Donnez-moi un break honey then I paid the cheque
To some psycho chick who's talkin' out the side of her neck
I...I...I tipped my hat, she winked her scandle eyes
And cracked a smile - I was mofo suprised
She's a dime store lover
A dime store lover
Yea a back seat shover
Just a dime store lover....
We was rollin round and round and round
Chantilly took my breath away
Yeah when push came to shove
She gave me all the love
That she was savin' for a rainy day
We was rollin round and round and round
Chantilly was my cream brule'
I was ooh and ahh, she was ooh la` la`
Un do me Baby....
We did the wild thing, it was good stuff cheap
She made some promises she couldn't keep
I think I'm fallin' for this dime store lover
Can't help it yeah I just got to have it
You're a dime store lover
A dime store lover

When you talk to me in circles take your foot out of your mouth
It's hard enough to make it when you're livin' on the street
And you want to tell somebody but you got to be discreet
Then you catch your girlfriend with her skirt hiked up to here
Honey, don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Say the times they be a changin' though the blind lead the blind
You know your head is empty though there's somethin' on your mind
Been shackin' up with Lucy, and when the morning comes
You're with Sally in the alley and the junkies and the bums
You wonder why your girlfriend has her skirt hiked up to here
Honey, don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Roll the dice get lucky 'cause they roll you for the dime
You got nothin' else to lose if you only lose your mind
When pleasure that is shallow causes trouble to be deep
You've been dusted with the devil while he sweeps you off your feet
Tell you little secret make you want to jump and shout
When you talk to me in circles take your foot out of your mouth
It's hard enough to make it when you're livin' on the street
And you hate to be a wise guy when your feet are in concrete
Oh, sleepin' with the dogs, and you wake up with the fleas
Honey, don't get mad, get even.</field>

Some say they don't
I take it in stride
And I can never get enough
If I don't got to swallow my pride
I heard it all before and then
She told me "gimme some slack"
Then she smiled at me and gave me
The shirt right off her back
And that's when I took advantage of the situation
(Chorus)
Don't stop
Rockin' your socks off
Don't stop
Knockin' their blocks off
Don't stop
Gettin' your rocks off

Shakin' your fist, boy
Don't stop
I ain't got much to lose
I'm feelin' so confused
There's such a small thin line
Between pleasure and pain
And when you say don't
Then it's don't stop
I got to complain
Yeah, I think I may be getting
Real tired of all the steam
Because it's hard to get the way
You move out of my dreams
Got to get it while you can
Whenever you're in doubt
You got to whip it out
When you keep hearin' no
And your body says yes
But you can't hear a word
That's been said
But you gotta confess
Looking up her address
Got you thinkin' with your other head.</field>

A Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right outa me
Oh, pass me the vile and cross your fingers, it don't take time
Nowhere to draw the line
Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime
No dice honey, you the salt, you're the queen of the brine
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got ta choose
Where to draw the line
Checkmate, don't be late
Take another pull
That's right impossible
When you got to be yourself
You're the boss of the toss
The dice, the price
Grab yourself a slice
Know where to draw the line</field>

Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true

Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay
Yeah, I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life's in books' written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things you do come back to you
[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
(Solo de Guitarra)
[Chorus]
Well, sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream comes true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
And dream until your dream comes true
Dream on! Dream on! Dream on!
Dream on! Dream on! Dream on! Dream on!
Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away</field>

She owns me
I didnt know that she'd know She stoned me
I think I got it bad and I cant let it go
I thought and youd be much better
All of the cashmere all orange and green
Shes naturally drop dead gorgeous
cleanly gardenia and black lessareen
shes naturally drop dead gorgeous
its so not fair
Completely inside my head imagine pretending
Shes the book that Ive read with a beautiful ending
It really drives me mad I cant leave her alone
cause I wont let me forget her
Rose colored glasses you know what that says
shes naturally drop dead gorgeous
Her sweet molasses on my slice of bread
shes naturally drop dead gorgeous
Totally out of control
She owned me
Sweet almond eyes just to see and be seen
shes naturally drop dead gorgeous
she tasted like cherries sweet loves grenadine
shes naturally drop dead gorgeous
Makes love like a rabbit to my velveteen
shes naturally drop dead gorgeous
a gem with a smile like a young norma jean
shes naturally drop dead gorgeous.</field>

Her picture graced to grime on the door
She a long lost love at first bite
Baby maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody say
Forgive me if I seem out of line
Then she whipped out her gun
Tried to blow me away
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
So never judge a book by its cover
Or who you're going to love by your lover
Love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a venus
Lord imagine my surprise
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
What a funky lady
She like it like it like it like that
He was a lady
Baby let me follow you down
Let me take a peek dear
Baby let me follow you down
Do me, do me, do me all night
Baby let me follow you down
Turn the other cheek dear
Baby let me follow you down
Do me, do me, do me, sue me</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Well I woke up this morning
On the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin'
About all those things you said
About ordinary people
And how they make you sick
And if callin names kicks back on you
Then I hope this does the trick
'Cause I'm sick of your complainin'
About how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'
'Bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humor
About your way of life
And I think I can do more for you
With this here fork and knife
(chorus:)
Eat the Rich: there's only one thing that they're good for
Eat the Rich: take one bite now - come back for more
Eat the Rich: I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the Rich: take one bite now, spit out the rest
So I called up my head shrinker
And told him what I done
He said you best go on a diet
Yeah I hope you have some fun
And a don't go burst a bubble
On rich folk who get rude
'Cause you won't get in no trouble
When you eats that kind of food
Now they're smoking up their junk bonds
And then they go get stiff
And they're dancing at the yacht club
With Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens
When you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit
But go real good with wine
(Chorus)
Believe in all the good things
That money just can't buy
Then you won't get no bellyache
From eatin' humble pie
I believe in rags to riches
Your inheritance won't last
So take your Grey Poupon my friend
And shove it up your ass!
(Chorus:)
Eat the Rich: there's only one thing that they're good for
Eat the Rich: take one bite now - come back for more
Eat the Rich: don't stop me now I'm goin' crazy
Eat the Rich: that's my idea of a good time baby</field>

Behind the walls of my temptation
That's when it all began
She tie me up with my frustration
And snapped my rubber band-ah
I remember a sweet patchouli she
Absolutely adore
It's all about with who your hangin'
And she gave me too much rope
She da queen of my delusion
She my zen from way back when
And the cause of my confusion
A face without a name
Is the face without a name
Yeah
She lived on lucky charms and coffee
And cracker jack surprise
She had me all reborn and then
She killed me with her eyes
She's the queen of my delusion
She my zen from way back when
And the cause of my confusion
A face without a name
Is the face without a name
Face without a name
Huh huh yeah huh
Tryin' an get little bit
There's nothing wrong with it
If no one see's ya
What ya gonna say
When i don't know her name
I'll blame it on the damned amnesia
Forgotten love's no doubt a waste
What's in a name without a face
Waaa-yeah
We did a little nip and tuck then
She whispered to my brain
I asked her if somethin'
And she said lets fuck
Then i forgot her name
She's the queen of my delusion
She my zen from way back when
And the cause of my confusion
A face without a name
Yeah i've come to that conclusion
Heh heh heh
If she comes to me at all
Come to me at all

When you're hangin' by a thread and I'm hangin' on to you
Baby, we can fall apart or we can fall together
It's a long way down
We can make a new start, never say never
We can fall apart or we can fall together
Fall together
Fall together
Fall together
Now I know you feel compelled when you're way down in the dumps
Every road can take some turns, every road has got its bumps
Now you got to know yourself, you got to play it smart
'Cause you suffer for your sanity if you suffer for your art
Baby, we can fall apart or we can fall together
It's a long way down
We can make a new start, never say never
We can fall apart or we can fall together
Fall together
Fall together
Fall together
Now, honey, I got this feelin' somethin' funny, I don't what it is
My knees are shakin', my heart is racin' and the ground's about to give

For another child who vanished out of sight
And a heart is broken, another prayer in vain
There's a million tears that fill a sea of pain
Sometimes I stare out my window
My thoughts all drift into space
Sometimes I wonder if there's a better place
(Tell me)
Where do fallen angels go
I just don't know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling
Now the times in frightening
Can't ignore the facts
There's so many people
Just slippin' through the cracks
So many ashes are scattered
So many rivers run dry
Sometimes your Heaven is Hell
and you don't know why
(So listen)
Where do fallen angels go
I just don't know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling, falling, falling...
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Somewhere out there there's a shining light
And I got to be with you tonight
And with all we're nowhere
We still pay the price
Yeah the Devil seems to get his way
In downtown paradise
Where do fallen angels go
I just don't know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling, falling, falling...
Where do fallen angels go
I just don't know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling, falling, falling...

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad
We was making love when you told me that you loved me
I thought ol' cupid he was taking aim
I was believer when you told me that you loved me

I feel like I have been hit by a fuck
Yeah
I'm Jonesin' on love
Yeah I got the DT's
You say that we will
But there ain't no guarantees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
What are you looking for
It's got to be hard core
Must be some kind of nouveau riche
Is this your only chance
Or some hypnotic trance
Let's get you on a tighter leash
Own it own it own it
You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad
You ain't that good
Is what you said down to the letter
But you like the way I hold the microphone
Sometimes I?m good but when I'm bad
I'm even better
Don't give me no lip
I've got enough of my own
There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you please
You know what I want

I keep falling off
My eyes don´t want to see
My ears don´t want to hear
The things that make me feel
That keep me so endeared to you
It makes me think

It doesn´t matter
The time that I fall
I'm up for the next one

I got the fever, fever, fever, fever
Yeah, they threw me outa jail I tell ya it ain't fair
I tried to kiss the judge from the electrica' chair
Yeah we're all here cause we're not all there tonight
The guitar's cranked and the bass man's blown a fuse
And when the whole gang bangs tell me then what's you're excuse
We got the fever, fever, fever, fever
Fever gives ya lust with an appetite
It hits ya like the fangs from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here cause we're not all there tonight
We can't run away from trouble
There ain't no place that far
But if we do it right at the speed of light
There's the back seat of my car, caviar
I was feelin' so high I forgot what day
Now I'm feelin low down even slow seems way too fast
And now the booze don't work and the drugs ran out of gas
Chorus
The buzz that you be gettin' from the crack don't last
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass
Yeah we're all here cause we're not all there tonight
My first time ever lover
We fell asleep out on the lawn
And when I woke up I was all alone
Makin' love to the crack of dawn
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir
The gangster of love rides again
I got the fever
You know I get a chill
Fever
It gimme such a thrill
Fever
Like a burnin' plague
Fever
Yeah get outta my way
Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear
As long as I'm in heaven honey I don't care
You look so good baby look so fine
I tell you you're the image of the perfect crime
You gets so tired holdin' on so tight
If you think you're goin' crazy well you may be right

Flesh
You got me all soakin' wet
Flesh
The only thing that's worth the sweat
From the day that Eve did Adam
Down to Romeo and Juliette
Everybody gotta have
The prince of lust has met his match
The witch has brewed her baddest batch
His sword is sharp and hard as stone
Her cauldron begs for one more bone
And so my love, this story's told
From modern times to days of old
From Boston Mass
to Bangladesh
Yeah, when the night comes
Everybody got to have
Flesh
It's got me all soakin' wet
Flesh
The only thing that's worth the sweat
From the Mississippi River
To the highest mountain in Tibet
Everybody gotta have

You got me all soakin' wet

We'll just fly
If this life
Gets any harder now
It ain't no never mind
You got me by your side
And anytime you want (fly fly fly)
Yeah we catch a train and find a better place
Yeah, 'cause we won't let nothin'
Or no one keep gettin' us down
Maybe you and I
Can pack our bags and hit the sky
And fly away from here
Anywhere
Yeah, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere
Do you see a blue sky now
You can have a better ride now
Open your eyes
'Cuz no one here can ever stop us
They can try but we won't let them
No way-ay-ay-ay-yeah-ah
Maybe you and I
Can pack our bags and say goodbye
And fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere
Fly away from here ( ya)
Yeah anywhere
Now honey, I don't I don't I don't care
Yeah we just fly...
We just fly (fly away)</field>

And I hear your lies
Ain't no truth in your smile
Ain't no truth in your eyes
Well, the trail you leave on the blood-soaked ground
It's stains us all and it tears us down
The guns you carry and the bombs you make
Cause too many tears, too many hearts to break
Well I'm a freedom fighter
I'm a desperate man
I aim my camera
And I take us in
Well, I'm a freedom fighter
And I'm taking aim!
A child of war, a weapon of shame
There was once a time we believed your lies
Now you can't walk the streets cause you'll never survive
That's hell to pay if you don't give us right
One man's terror is another man's freedom's fight
Oh, oh, oh

In half the time it takes to blink
But it all depends on what you think
About the girls of summer
When all you think of all day long
Is a pretty face inside a song
With a thought like that you can't go wrong
About the girls of summer
Oh yeah
(Do you know, everybody knows now)
Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls are born to make you cry
Over and over again
My favorite thing that drives me wild
Is when a city girl walks a country mile
For a boy she loves, God bless the child
Inside the girls of summer
Oh yeah
(Do you know, everybody knows now)
Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls are born to make you cry
Yeah, over and over again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They get you climbin' the walls
They get you caught in their spell
They get you speakin' in tongues
Could this be Heaven or Hell
To fall in love twice a day
Is such a sweet place to be
Sîl vous plait
The best things about life are free
The pussywillow up your tree
To the one who climbs
They'll always be the girl, yeah
Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls no doubt about it
Some girls are born to make you cry
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls got twenty reasons why

You got to make up your mind
Any way I can steal it
Any way you can deal it to me
You know the pleasure’s all mine
You gotta love it
You better own it
You gotta love it
And God knows it
You gotta shu uh shove it
I’m gonna make things happen
Goin’ ‘round’n, ‘round’n, round
I wanna say you’re a fire cracker
I wanna say you’re a switch blade knife
You make sex a career
Comin’ down from an all night tripper
Pull your foot from the ruby slipper
‘Cause you can’t get there from here
You gotta love it
You better own it
You gotta love it
And God knows it
I’m gonna make things happen
Goin’ ‘round’n, ‘round’n, round
That's it
I got thi feeling deep inside my gut
Overwhelming feeling of I know not what
One thing’s for sure I ain’t got time for those who can’t relate
You gotta learn to love the midnight madness
You gotta revel in the good and badness
If yin ‘n yang is your thing
What I gotta do to try and reach ya
Is it for real or just a double feature
So let’s go throw the I Ching
You gotta love it
You better own it
You gotta love it
And God knows it
I’m gonna make things happen

On the wrong side of the street

I've been lickin' off all my fingers

The sake of her in bed
Every end my heart must bare
It’s like a friend who turns and walks away
From here its like a tear
But sometimes pains to much
A parts today...
Love loves to high
In the roads of emotion
I couldn’t die
In the roads of emotion
Sometimes the love you get ain’t good enough
Although you love is tough
And cause it cows you floor
Is that what people say that love is for
Well i don’t want no more
That is why I’m out the door...

Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover
But you ain't no dancer Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter

She's comin' down fast</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I'm down a one-way street
With a one-night stand,
With a one track mind
Out in no-man's land
(The punishment sometimes don't seem to fit the crime)
Yeah there's a hole in my soul
But one thing I've learned
For every love letter written
There's another one burned
(So you tell me how it's gonna be this time)
Is it over, Is it over
'Cause I'm blowin' out the flame
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find there's nothing there girl
Yeah I swear, I'm telling you girl yeah 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where the garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, yeah I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose
I'm as dry as a seven-year drought
I got dust for tears
And I'm all tapped out
(Sometimes I feel broken and can't get fixed)
I know there's been all kinds of shoes underneath your bed
Now I sleep with my boots on but you're still in my head
(And something tells me this time I'm down to my last licks)
'Cause if it's over, Then it's over
And it's driving me insane
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find there's nothing there girl
Yeah I swear, I'm telling you girl yeah 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, Yeah, I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose
If it's over, It is over
And I'm blowin' out the flame
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find
There's nothing there girl yeah I swear
I'm telling you girl, yeah 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, Yeah, I should have known better

All night long
You're saddle sore
And on the grind
Just pushed you a little bit more
Don't mind if I do
It's Hollywood
Hot damn - hands in a jam
Never say can't
'Cause you know you can
In Hollywood
Don't be mesmerized
What goes on here
Ain't no surprise
As long as you'll be cool
In Hollywood
Oh, wee set the pace
Fill your nose
Despite your face
They'll make you Babylon
In Hollywood
Now you see it
Now you don't
Someone's gonna take it away
Now you see it
Now you won't
Every dog has it's day
Oh wee I got the cools
A brand new car
And the family jewels
And they won't stop me now
In Hollywood
Oh wee boogedy shoe
Got myself a new hairdo
I'm makin it somehow
In Hollywood
Now you see it
Now you don't
Someone's gonna take it away
Now you see it
Now you won't
Every dog has it's day
All night long
Hollywood
All night long
Hollywood
In time they'll build you up
And then they'll bring you down
Hollywood
You're a dream machine
Some day they'll burn the king for sellin out
Chew you up and spit you out
Just like heaven when things are good
But there ain't no hell like
Hollywood
Would you guess
What it's all about
You may be a lady
But I'll knock you out
Wrap my knuckles upside your head
Make you take back
Every damn thing you said
You play with me
Gonna pay the price
No ghost of a chance
I'm holdin the dice
You lie about this and
lie about that
Don't wanna hear
Nothing about no more crap
Now you see it
Now you don't
Someone's gonna take it away
Now you see it
Now you won't
Every dog has it's day
All night long

Dragged from the cradle, I was weaned in the wild
Ran with the wolf pack, flesh torn to shreds
In the compensations, I was left there for dead
Read it in the paper it ain't fair
You know who today don't seem to care
Livin', lovin', gettin' loose
Masturbatin' with a noose
Now someone's kickin' out the chair
Some kind of voodoo
Come across this land
Some kind of voodoo
Be the medicine man
Everybody's lookin' at the sky
Don't believe the cover-ups and lies
They been tellin' us since birth
Pissin' off old Mother Earth
My gones are bygones prophesied
Some kind of voodoo
Come across this land
Some kind of hoodoo
Be the medicine man
Get ready
Wonder should I go or should I stay
'Cause what we got ain't workin' anyway
I did my best, God knows I tried
I feel like I been crucified
Why did you, why did you, why did you take it all away

Lying close to you
Feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you

barkeep gimme a drink, that's when she caught my eye
she turned to give me a wink, that'd make a grown man cry

come easy, go easy, all right until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight, I'm like a loaded gun
peelin' off my boots and chaps, I'm saddle sore
four bits gets you time in the racks, I scream for more
fools' gold out of their mines, the girls are soaking wet
no tongue's drier than mine, I'll come when I get back!
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back!
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm ridin', I'm loadin' up my pistol
I'm ridin', I really got a fistful
I'm ridin', I'm shinin' up my saddle
I'm ridin', this snake is gonna rattle
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back!
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back!
ridin' high!
ridin' high!
ridin' high! already!.</field>

21 yrs later, he don't understand,
if god wanted him to fly, he would've given him wings,
now his life becomes a symphany without the strings,
Whatever happened to the innocent girl,
she became a victem of a fucked up world,
she didn't fit into the master plan,
because a woman shouldn't be a man,
Purgatory's waitin', hail mary take my breath way,
drinking flex my arms, smokin' 20 packs a day,
you can't sail in the needle and the spoon,
or give all the credit to the man on the moon,
Everyone complaining about the hand they're dealt,
cuz they lookin' for a feeling they never felt,
get off the pot, get off your ass,
try to be the 1st, but you'll wind up last,
aaaahhhhhh...
Whatever happened to the magical one,
he said, your hearts out of rythem and we come undone,
(on the ruuunnnnnnnnn)
hoping he can catch her and bring it back,
and ressurect the love before it fades to black,
Purgatory's waitin', hail mary take my pain away,
genueflecs? my arms, smoking 20 packs a day,
holy roll me overgetcha here to say?,
you can't sail in the needle and the spoon,

Janie's got a gun
Whole world's come undone
Lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do
What did he put you through
They say when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But man he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Dog days just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain
Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away
Run, run away
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Dog days just begun
Now everybody is on the run
What did her daddy do
It's Janie's last I
O
U
She had to take him down easy
And put a bullet in his brain
(she left him in the pouring rain)
She said 'cause nobody believes me
The man was such a sleaze
He ain't never gonna be the same
Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away
Run, run away
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Now everybody is on the run
Janie's got a gun
Dog days just begun
Now everybody is on the run
(honey honey, what's the problem)
Janie's got a gun (tell me it ain't right)
Janie's got a gun (was it your daddy's cradle-robbin' that)
Dog days just begun
(made you scream at night)
Now everybody is on the run
Janie's got a gun</field>

I met the pony
It was so dark that i could hardly see
It smelled so sweet you know who and Joanie
So many butterflies one could not see
We all could feel desire
Took off in flight
It was hotter than fire
Than came the light
Oh, oooh
Oh, Ah, Now smell the heat
The dancing pony unwrapped his wings
To try off Joanie
The pony he grew in size
In thunder and rain
And finally realize
What he was and what he does
And what he couldn't stay
And left to kiss the cheek of Mother Nature
Nobody here can denie such things
He's created as you look'm honey
No butterfly should be denied his wings
He was a kick ass rocking horse
He like a hell bent tied to the Gavin Pole
It was a one-time fantasy
I got to grab hold and fly into the Holy Land
Bare back, riding like like a butterplane
Nightmares, and he can hold the candle to my dreams
Oh we rode tonight
I talked to believe in
What I saw all right
It was everything
We flew into burning skies
The thunder and rain
And finally realize
What he is and what he does
And what he couldn't stay
Oh, no, no...
Took off in flight
Oh, no, no...
Bare back somethings coming over me
Not mess and he can hold the candle to my dreams
No live to breathe
No stable lights
No try to please
Nobody's eyes
We'll never see lust again
And tell me the pain
Bury it all again
We have a good time
Somebody shot him down
Now tell me, tell me, tell me never
We could really cause a course in time
Listen bissin' to your old pleasures
Bissin' listenin' be a king of spine
He was a keep grass rocking horse
He was a one time fantasy
A two two...?.</field>

Part of me says let it go
And life happens for a reason
I don't I don't I don't
Cause it never worked before
But this time, this time

Tell me what to do

And I'll do anything to just feel better

Yeah and I'll do anything to just feel better

And I'm afraid of sinking
You're the only one who knows me

Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive
Oh I know I lived this life afore
Somehow know now truths I must be sure
Tossin, turnin' nightmares burnin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailin' ships the Viking spits
The blood of father's land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death
Fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die
Screams of no reply
They died
Screams of no reply
And died
Lordy Lordy they died
Lordy Lordy they died
Live and do or die
They died
Live and no reply

Bare-foot-children cryin´ my-oh-my
I watched you on the avenue
While other men were having you
I think that you should led your caged bird fly

Kiss your past good-bye
Kiss your past good-bye
Kiss your past good-bye
I´ve been so lost I must confess
I´ve had my share of loneliness
But yeah it´s hard to keep a good man down
The loves you lost were all in vain
The past lives on inside your brain
I don´t think you need those memories
Hangin´ ´round, yeah
Good-bye
Kiss your past good-bye
You´ve gotta let if fly
Kiss your past good-bye, yeah
And if that bird don´t fly away
There´s just one thing I got to say
It´s later than deuce a ticks
Your broken heart, it needs a fix
You´re feedin´ off a high that would not last
And people they don´t seem to care
And sorry just don´t cut it, yeah
It seems to me you´re gettin´ nowhere fast
So...Kiss...your...past
Or kiss your ass good-bye
Kiss your past good-bye
There´s no more tears to cry
So kiss your past good-bye

Yes sir, no sir
Don't come close to my
Home sweet home
Can't catch no dose
Of my hot tail poon tang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer
Home sweet home
Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma' she's a cookin'
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feet in the ghetto
Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It ain't no good when the bossman
Stuffin' down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rockin' the street
Home sweet home
Mama, take me home sweet home
I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street.</field>

Never knowing wrong from right
And that same show 40 years ago
Being televised tonight
Cause getting from inside my head to the Taj Mahal
I went from never having none to want to have it all
I wanna keep that dream alive
And eat that honey from the hive
With all the noise and all the clamour
No surprise, you know I am a

I think that what I'm trying to say is
Sticks and stones will break your bones
At least they'll rearrange
I'll drop a dime, and every time,
I get myself a nickel's change
They say we don't know Jack
At the plant we proved them wrong
We traded in our soul tonight
And sold them for a song
And if Satan had a lady friend, it was Mary Jane
I never wondered why she tried to drive us quite insane
And how we got that golden fleece
From toking on that pipe of peace
Yea as far as I can see
There is a God 'cause it got me a

When the gang's all there
He gets his woman every night for free
He's out there rockin' like you wouldn't believe
Singin' na, na, na...
Johnny like to gamble with his lady Louise
She was a black jack deuces are wild
He got to thinking 'bout his nose in the breeze
And there Johnny looked and he smiled
He started thinking 'bout the fortune and fame
with the young girls down at his knees
He dug the money but forgot all the names
So he knew just how to appease
Lick And A Promise

Now the crowd keeps screamin' for more

While the weak ones all retreat
Gotta draw first blood
Or they'll read your funeral rights

It's dog eat dog when you meet your rival
And the combat zone it's your means of survival
Gonna get last licks on a suicide blitz

            <field name="lyrics">Something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise
We're livin' on the edge
There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's a meltdown in the sky
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
The mister you're a better man than I
chorus: We're livin on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin'
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
Livin' on the edge
You can't stop yourself from fallin'
Livin' on the edge
Tell me what you think about your situation
Complication-aggravation
Is getting to you
If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin'
And even if it wasn't would you still come crawlin' back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again and again
Tell me what you think about your situation
Complication-aggravation
Is getting to you
If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin'
And even if it wasn't would you still come crawlin' back again?
I think you would my friend
Again and again and again and again
Something right with the world today
And everybody knows it's wrong
But we can tell them no or we can let it go
But I would rather be hanging on
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin'
You can't help yourself at all
Livin' on the edge
You can't stop yourself from fallin'
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
You can't help yourself
Livin' on the edge
You can't stop yourself from fallin'

            <field name="lyrics">I was walkin' down the street
When someone called my name
She had spiked heels on her feet
And she was feelin' no pain
Ohhh must be Lizard Love
So I hid behind the newspaper
Turned to page six
She was in her birthday suit
Behind a crucifix
Ohhh must be Lizard Love
She was hangin' big booty
She was puss n' boots way up to here
She's a little bit of heaven, a 24-7
A 10 every day of the year
Now there must be some mistake
I'm feelin' so high strung
She said 'I make love like a snake
I even got a forked tongue'
At first I thought I was dreamin'
That I'd wake up and she'd dissappear
But when I opened up my eyes
She was laughing and a screamin' swinging from the chandlier
You know I never seem to give
Or ever get enough
And I just can't seem to live without
That sweet bodacious stuff.</field>

I wanna be the punishment to fit your crimes,
Midnite downtown, you're walkin the floor,
you fell into the roses and your dress got tore,
you're hanging with "Ambresia" and you're gonna have a ball,
your monkey's up the river and it's ten feet tall,
It's a long way, gonna dig that hole to China,
Oh won't you blow that wimpy diner,
You're a man of the times Lorretta..
yeah...
Your boyfriends in the closet with a girl named Jack,
drinkin welfare whiskey, smokin food stamp crack,
You take it every nite till you get your fill,
you never get enough like you say you will,
you're wheelin and you're dealing but you gotta learn to chill,
you got a lot of "nada" so you take another pill,
It's a long way gotta dig that hole to China,
Won't you blow that wimpy diner,
You're a man of the times Lorretta,
It's a long way, gonna ride that train to ruin,
I'm gonna get there me and you and,
You're a man of the times Lorretta,
("Sweet Lorretta you're the man of the time" X2)
And in the morning, yeah,
The walls of Babylon come tumbling down,
and I'm hallucinating madly,
I'm in the lust of sweet emotion cuz I like it,
(solo)
And in the morning the walls of Babylon come tumbling down,
I'm waiting for my "ex" to see me,
I'm in the lust of sweet explosion cuz I like it, like it, like it,
Like it, like it, like it, like it..
(scream)
(stop)
It's a long way gonna dig that hole to China,
Oh won't you blow that wimpy diner,
You're a man of the times Lorretta,
It's a long way, gonna ride that train to ruin,
I'm gonna get there me and you and,
You're a man of the times,
Oh the squeeze of the mind,
You're the 2 of a kind,
You were his before mine,

I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Jackie's in the elevator (whoa)
Lingerie second floor (whoa yeah)
She said can I see you later (whoa)
And love you just a little more (whoa yeah)
I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said I'll show you how to fax in the mailroom honey
And have you home by five
Love in an elevator

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
In the air, in the air
Honey one more time now it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when i'm going down
Elevator
Going down
Haha-haha-haha-haha!
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Gonna be a penthouse pauper
Gonna be a millionaire
Gonna be a real fast talker
And have me a love affair
Gotta get my timing right
It's a test that I got to pass
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey
Kiss your sassafrass
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground [6x]</field>

Teenage baby send you
Full friction magazine
I don't know how she do it
Up down turnaround
Four on the floor tonight
When she did what she was doin'
She was rubbin' me the wrong way right
Push come to shove
Give it one more try
Don't miss your water
Until the well runs dry
Love Me Like A Birddog
Never Learn to Fly
Bareback baby
Tell me what's on your mind
If it's the same old same old
Slap you on the back behind
I don't know how you do it
Tell me one time
About how it used to be
You got the judge and jury
Swinging from the highest tree
Push came to shove
Give it one more try
Don't miss your water
Until the well runs dry
Love Me Like a Bird Dog
Never learn to fly
Ask me no questions
I'll tell you no lies
Love Me Like a Bird Dog
Never learn to fly
Ask me no questions
Bass drum beating
Like a hot damn house on fire
Love lover's quarrels
Always seem to make the body cry
I don't know how she do it
Tell me one time
About how it used to be
She got the judge and jury
Swinging from the highest tree
Push came to shove
Give it one more try

Ah there's a chill in the summer time air
You get a thrill from the smell of her hair
You get a high from the taste of her wits
It's certified, but but, but you ain't getting there yet
Still can't forgive
but baby cut me some slack
Still got a feel you ain't never coming back
You want the karma but you won't commit
You'll be spanking your monkey when she's all up in your shit

Is that your girl in a lily white dress
How come she's so fucking passive-agress
I hear you say with your adorable tongue
And that you just don't care how especially yeah
While the night is still young
Still you raise your imagination
Do that ration, generation, single patience
Contamination, suffocation

To fall in lust, not love

No thanks, I took that ride
God only knows I've tried believing
I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart and hope to die
To tell I luv you lies
I imagine everyone survives
For giving up all that you got
To tell I luv you lies
The first time you look for love,
you find you don't know jack
So much for mind games, you play to win
'Cause first you lose your heart's desire,
then you get it back
But ignorance ain't bliss
There's so much more behind the kiss
I'm feeling
I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart and hope to die
To tell I luv you lies
I imagine everyone survives
For giving up all that you got
To tell I luv you lies
When loneliness and paranoia feeds me
God help the person who needs me
If ignorance is bliss
than take me off the list
I'm leaving

Will cross their heart and hope to die

I imagine everyone survives

From your ultimate fantasies, to your deepest fears
From which you may never return

When laughin' people bring on primal screams

Don't Brake it
If you do then you feel like the world's coming down on you
You know that history repeats itself
But you just learned so by somebody else
You know you do, you gotta think up fast
You gotta figure what it's gonna take to make it last
Make It
Don't brake it
I said Make It
Don't brake it
Then you do
Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catchin' the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose
You're only paying your dues
Too stinkin' proud but you're gonna pay
If you're gone I'll get you anyway
Although you know what you've been going through
Your only dreams feel like a tattoo
Make It
Don't brake it
I said Make It
Don't brake it
Then you do
Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catchin' the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose</field>

Tell ya, honey, how I feel
I've been dreaming
Floatin' down stream and
Losin' touch with all that is real
Whole earth lover, keepin' under cover
Never knowin' where ya been
You've been fadin', always out paradin'
Keepin' touch with Mama kin
Well you've always got your tail on the wag
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpertual drag
You better check it out
Cause someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon
It ain't easy, livin' like you wanna
And it's so hard to find piece of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it, you've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line
Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for you dad is just a drag
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
Cause someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon
(Chorus:)
Keepin' touch with Mama kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy,
Sleeping late and smoking tea
(Chorus)
It ain't easy, livin' like ya wanna
And it's so hard to find piece of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it, you've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line
Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for you dad is just a drag
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
Cause someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon

            <field name="lyrics">The streets were cold and barren
The nights were dark and dank
And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years....
The buildings were dead and the alleys
Stunk from things that used to live there
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered
A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence
With not a scrap left on the plate
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable
Cause the only thing left was their faith
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do
About it....
There's a Meltdown in the sky
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why
There's a fear that gets me high
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by....
So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold
Made me wonder just who was the foe
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus
Had predicted such a long long time ago?
You could hear screams and moanin'
From the people atoning
For their sins of a guilt ridden life
And the final door shuts
From the wind that leaves cuts
From the edge on the blade of God's knife
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about....
There's a Melt Down in the Sky
There's a new day comin and I don't know why
There's a tear stuck in my eye
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why
Battle lines had been drawn
Mother nature how she cried
By her side, till the dawn
Couldn't kill her if they tried
How they tried, open eyed, genocide
Then..
she died
Battle lines had been drawn
Mother nature how she cried
By her side, till the dawn
Couldn't kill her if they tried
How they tried, open eyed, genocide
Then..
she died
There's a Meltdown in the sky
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why
There's a fear that gets me high.</field>

Live and loved from the old jaw bone
Ah, don't you cry you're home sweet home
Rock a bye sweet lady gypsy blue
Oh, the nightingale's singin' her song in the rain
Hush a bye sweet lady, soft and new
Oh, don't you cry, the wind she's a-screamin' your name

Unless you get that monkey off your back
Well I made believe the devil made me do it
I was the evil leader of the pack
You best believe I had it all and then I blew it
Feedin' that fuckin' monkey on my back
Ahh, if you put it in a spoon man I would boot it
Some kings whose mental house was just a shack
Where do you draw the line
When all your friends are dyin'
Got to get that monkey off your back
Your crystal ball is where you chase the dragon
She said now bring me home his head inside a sack
But now you find your crystal ball are draggin'
Got to get that monkey off your back</field>

I'm feelin´ like I hung the moon
And then at times
I'm so weak from lovin´
I couldn´t even carry a tune
But now I'm back
Oh yes I am
I maybe fall apart at the seams
I had a nightmare
Believe me when I tell you
Nobody ever dies in their dreams
I think I need a stay of execution
In a wink, I'm dead in love again
Nine Lives - Puss and booty
Nine Lives - Live again
Nine Lives - It ain´t over
Nine Lives - Live for ten
Well well well
Engine room to bombardier
Is the dream
I died and went to Heaven
She´s enough to make you
Cry in your beer
How can a good thing
7 come 11
Slip a fare-thee-well
And how can one man´s
Little bit o´ Heaven
Turn into another man´s Hell
I think I need a stay of execution
Yeah I know, I'm dead in love again

New York is such a pity
But at Max's Kansas City we won
We all shot shit in the bar
With Johnny O' Toole and his scar
And then old Clive Davis said
He's surely gonna make us a star
I'm gonna make you a star
Just the way you are
But with all his style
I could see in his eyes
That we is goin' on trial
and It was no surprise
The boys kept kickin' ass
As usual time would tell
But some bitch in the choir
Threw water on the fires of hell
She loved to shove and tell
Lord, she loved to tell
But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial
And it was no surprise
No surprise
No surprise
No surprise
Midnight lady
Situation fetal
vaccinate yo ass with yo phonograph needle
I say look it here
A friend of mine
Scratch like you need calomine
Flamingo boots, soles a creakin'
Still in love and Puerto Rican too
Ridin' on the wheels of hell
Smokin' in our axle grease
The backstage is rockin'
And we're copping from the local polica
That's right, the local police
Or the juctice of peace
But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial
Baby, it's no surprise
No surprise
No surprise
No surprise
Rock n' roll, junkie whore
Got my foot inside the door
Knock knock, knock knock, knock
Nobody's keepin' score
Bad time go away
Come again some other day
Topaz and sazzafraz
Will keep the blues away
Candy store, rock n' roll
Corporation jelly roll
Play the singles, it ain't me
It's programmed with insanity
You Ascap, if BMI
Could ever make a mountain fly
If Japanese can boil teas.</field>

I try to hold on to them with all my might
Precious time spent with you goes by much too fast
Like snow in the sun it just never seems to last
Another tasteless coffee
Another empty day
Suddenly last night is just so far away
Too many talking heads
What was it that they said
When we're apart the days are dark
When I'm with you I'm in the light
You're my oasis in the night..
yeah
You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night
You keep our love light shinning bright
You're my oasis in the night..
yeah
When you're in my arms
you keep the world at bay
You stop it at the door
I don't care what they say
Time's too short
The fire's too hot
Don't know what to do
'cause I know in a flash
It's just a memory too
Another tasteless coffee

Suddenly last night is just so far away

Some of your love
Keep the storm clouds back
I don't think I can ever come back
If you don't give me some of your love
You're the stars in the sky
And there's no wonder why
Now the moon's coming out
My heart start to race
There was never a doubt
Just the smile on your face
Your beautiful soul
Your beautiful face
One sweet kiss
And I just gotta say
(Oh Yeah)
I will die for you baby (Oh yeah)
I will cry for you baby (Oh yeah)
I'm on my knees for you baby (Oh yeah)
Oh won't you please give me some of your love</field>

I'm a ram up for walls
Somethin' told my baby
You can have it all
Jump trough the window
Look my life in the den
Look out pretty mama
I'm On The Road Again

I'm On The Road Again
(And you can do what you want)
I'm On The Road Again
(And you can do what you want)
Yeah, I came home last night
To get my dinner hot
Went to the door
But the door was locked
Jump through the window
And believe me or not
She hadn't even
Put my dinner into the pot
(Chorus)
Yeah, never been evil
And I've never been shy
Every down a champ
And I'm a time by
Down un winner
With my apple in bed
Look out pretty mama
I'm On The Road Again
(Chorus)
Yeah, never been evil
And I've never been sly
Every down a champ
And I'm a time by
Down in the window
With my apple in bed
Look out pretty mama.</field>

Broke a woman's heart
With only myself to blame
Fate ran its course
I suffered a loss
I learned a lesso in pain
Cheated, lied
I took love for granted
Oh, I paid the price
I won't last a night
I won't make the same mistake twice
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many
The changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough
Love went trough such sudden change
Taken a turn for the worst
The joy turned to fear
The pain got so severe
Lord, I thought I was cursed
Get what you give
It comes around full circle
Oh, I paid the price
Love so fast
I won't make the same mistake twice
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many
Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough.</field>

Hey That old dog is comin' after me
I thought ya told her I was out of town
I wonder how she know'd I was hangin' around
Say Listen Babe Don't go wastin' your time
You keep a-comin' 'round You'll hear the same old line
You got a thousand boys You say you need 'em
You take what's good for you
An' I'll take my freedom
Cause lately it's been so hard to make ends meet Oh Yes it has
And Honey You're headin' up a one-way street
And I'm goin' the other way
I thought I knew her A cagy lady
How could my sunshine be so damn shady
She said she loved me Took??? my conversation
But I'm the one who makes my situation
It's one way city An' I thought I knew
It's such a pity Honey That's it for you
CHORUS 1:
Because lately It's been so hard to make ends meet Yeah
And Honey You're headin' up a one-way street
And I gotta go the other way
(spoken)
You know what I'm talkin' about
I seen that butterfly you tried to put on your can
I'm gonna get me some of that
And if comin' over here I never showed ya
I made it pretty clear I'm glad to know ya
An' though your brother Spike is on the level
But you always lookin' like you're mad at the devil
Don't say I coped a 'tude It's all forgotten
It's just you're much too rude You're pure to rotten?????
You know I worked so hard to keep it alive
Now all I have from you is nothin' but jive
CHORUS 1:
Yes I do
Yeah lately It's been so hard to make ends meet
And Honey You're heading up a one-way street
And I really do feel that I got to be movin' on
Hey Baby Hey Baby Hey Baby Hey Baby---
CHORUS 2:
I've been headin' down a one-way street
Had me foolin' everybody I meet
I said Your head's like a one-way street
Had me foolin' everybody you meet
CHORUS 2: (3x)
I said your head's like a one-way street
You got to get yourself back on your feet

Ya-ya baby till out goes the lights
If you wanna take a lookie cookie tonight
Might be your lucky nighty night night
How they go déjà-booty
You're a yaya baby tonight
Way to go thought you knew me
Yeah but you're not getting it right
But it's cool
Too cool for cat
A little bit of this and a little bit of that
Had a red hot maybe on a cold summer night
Ya-ya baby till out goes the lights
If you wanna taste the cookie lookie tonight might be your lucky
Roses are red, my lips on you
But you couldn't tell by the things that we do
The things that we see are so out of sight
We'll have to see when we turn out the light
Living in the land/lap of love
Living on coochie and romance
Waiting on cupid to call
Some people say that's livin'
Yeah but that ain't livin' at all
And it's cool, that's how i roll
You get a little lovin' if you got a lot of soul
And it's for sure, when love's just right
Ya-ya baby when out goes the lights
If you want a little nookie cookie tonight might be your lucky

Venus girls and the men from mars

Do the girls sees red

And your best lovin is in the past and
Cause somewhere slow is nowhere fast
Your outta your head
So out of your head
Stay out of your head
You better get with it cuz you're so without it
No out of your head
So out of your head
Stay out of your head
(somewhere, somewhere underneath the rainbow)
Bricka bracka firecracker sis boom bah
Here comes trouble in a push up bra
His style is sharp as a coffin tack
But out of your box and your way off track
Your a mile away on a mental binge
Your catasphrophe is of a lunatic fringe
Your still put together its tit for tat
You say its all good but its more than that
Your outta your head
So out of your head
Stay out of your head

And after all this time, I still can't let go
I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Scrawled upon my soul
Etched upon my memory, baby
And I've got your kiss
Still burning on my lips
The touch of my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me, baby
I've tried/ everything that I can
To get my heart to forget you
But it just can't seem to
I guess it's just no use
In every part of me
Is still a part of you
And I've still got your face

Still burning on my lips

Painted on my heart
Painted on my heart, oh baby
Something in your eyes keeps haunting me
I'm trying to escape you
And I know there ain't no way to
To chase you from my mind

Etched upon my memory baby

Where no one gives a hoot
Nobody never ever wears a suit

They look so proud
That's 'cause they know
That they've been so well endowed
Now, I ain't much
For Fannie's conversation
Or care to much
About her operation
But every time Pandora comes my way
I get high
Can't explain the sensation
To get it on
I gotta watch what I say
Or I'll catch hell
From the women's liberation

Sweet Pandora
Good-like aura
Smell like a flora
Open up your door-a for me
Sweet Pandora
Good-like aura
Smell like a flora
Open up your door-a for me
Sweet Pandora
Mama crack a smile for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me
Now I ain't what
You'd call a city slicker
Or claim to fame
To be a slitty licker
But every time Pandora comes my way

Never tought I'd given in
Her candle of youth was burnin' low

Try and sell me an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speak easy on the grape vine
Keep shufflin' the shoe shine
Old tin lizzy do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery
Yes, I'm movin', Yes, I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Tap dancing on a land mine
Yes, I'm movin', I'm really movin'
Yes, I'm movin', Yes, I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Get crazy on the moonshine

There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
Seems like 99 and one half days
Now wait a minute
I think something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this damn door
Now wait a minute
I think something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this fucking door
Something bad just because of it
My baby don't want me no more
That's her loss, that's my gain
I'm gonna head out back yonder, i think
Back yonder over the hill
I'm gonna head out back yonder, i think
Yonder over the hill
Over the hill
'cause if my baby don't
Love me no more
I know her sister will</field>

When the good Lord made that woman
He sure went to town
Oh, when the good Lord made that woman
He sure went to town
Well, when he was feelin' high
Oh, he sure should have been feelin' low

My baby went away,
She went away,
Across some sea.
It's been two years or so,
Since I saw my baby go,
And then this letter,
Came to me.
It said ??
She found somebody new,
Oh, let me think, let me think,
What shall I do?
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no.
Remember,
Walking in the sand.
Remember,
Walking hand in hand.
Remember,
The night was so exciting.
Remember,
Her smile was so inviting,
Remember,
And then she touched my cheek,
Remember,
With her fingertips.
Remember,
Softly, softly we met with a kiss.
Whatever happened to,
That girl that I once knew.
That girl that said she'd be true.
Whatever happened to,
That night I gave her to you.
What will I do with it now.
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no.
Remember,
Walking in the sand.
Remember,
Walking hand in hand.
Remember,
The night was so exciting.
Remember,
Her smile was so inviting,
Remember,
And then she touched my cheek,
Remember,
With her fingertip.
Remember,
Softly, softly we met with a kiss.
Whatever happened to,
That girl that I once knew.
That girl that said she'd be true.
Whatever happened to,
That night I gave her to you.
What will I do with it now.</field>

She was a real top manner
Lots of nothing other
Hard Core biloozy
Late night rubber
A second hand clothes
Smiling like a Cheshire Cat
Well it was either now or walkin down the urchin' moon
Only a certain situation you could see I'm who
Putting the ring around the rose n' pull the daisy chain
Well, we are here, can tell me you ain't with that bachelor thing
Oh, close your eyes and what do you see
Oh, nothing but hammer to you with your only decease in me
(Chorus)
If you have wanna won with me
You're not to have be here tonight
Want you to hold it down
And let me lose a rock me right
Want you to get it on I'm your main man

Call it chump change, I think not
'Cause I got sump'n no one else has got
It's no look like and it ain't no protege
Its nuclear my Rocket 88
Well get down on the darkside of the moon
And leave a little somthin' on the dune
This home by ten is gonna have to wait
'Cause we got a Rocket 88
Light years honey that's how far we'll go
Let's fire it up and watch the rockets glow
Gee suit, g-spot, gee I really must admit
I got my Rocket 88, honey this is it
So no more up against the wall
Just come with me and watch the earth get small
I swear you never will come down at all
So if you like it in your face
I'll rub your nose into outer space.</field>

No smooth face laywer

Doors start lockin’
Your old time connection
Change your direction
You ain’t gonna change it
Can’t rearrange it
Can’t stand the pain
When it’s all the same to you, my friend
When you’re low down and dirty
From walkin’ the street
With your old hurdy gurdy
No one to meet
Said love ain’t the same

Love for the devil

Seeds of a thousand
Drawn to her sin
Seasons of whither
Holdin me in
Oh woe is me

Oh woe is me
I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sails
Fireflies dance in the heat of
Hound dogs bay at the moon
My ship leaves in the midnight
Can't say I'll be back too soon
They awaken
Far far away
Heat of my candle
Show me the way
Seeds of a thousand
Drawn to her sin
Seasons of whither
Holdin me in
Oh woe is me
I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me

Only child with a hang down lip
Starve for love and you pay your chip
Little by little, catch enough to me
She's more of a woman
And I thought she'd be to me
Hungry girl, she's a city slick
Sayin' the one, on a losin' stick

She chop my head on a guillotine
She's my flame, she's a feather my chief.</field>

don't get deep, shut up and dance
Love has got me down
a tear just hit the ground
so I started writing you this song
but the words I wrote came out all wrong
Yeah but it's alright
When you can't define the crime
then life ain't worth a dime
when they take away everything you've got
and they rub your nose in the funky spot
Not without a fight
When they work your fingers to the bone
now what does get you - nothing
in a crowd of people
you're still alone
you hope that tells you something
the road to heaven is paved in hell
and it makes you wonder
Why we're here at all
Check out the shape of the circumstance
he wears the dress and she wears the pants
here comes Jill and she needs romance
but you can't do jack so shut up and dance!
Sex is like a gun
you aim, you shoot, you run
when you're splittin' hairs with Mr
Clean
it's like getting head from a guillotine
and the night has just begun
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
don't get deep shut up and dance.</field>

Downtown's a pity, takin' fair square

Turnin' in style, walk a mile for your titty
Naked foul while under there
Under where it's pretty gritty
Hey, don't you know people
She's a love lust hussy
She left, oh she rust me

She was a Sight For Sore Eyes

These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
to see him walkin around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about, his fuckin dad walkin out
Cause he just hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin back
Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants; doo rags and a stockin cap
His step-father hit him so he, socked him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go
[Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]
C'mon! Sing with me (Sing!)
Sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (C'mon!)
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away...
[Eminem]
Entertainment is changin, intertwinin with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unnholy, only have one homie
Only this gun - lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
or they can degrate; or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin on corners and porches just rappin
to havin a fortune, no more kissin ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin to me religiously
So I'm signin CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin menace this shit doesn't make sense B!
It's all political, if my music is literal
and I'm a criminal how the FUCK can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't; I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera - that was a FIST that hit you!
[Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]
C'mon! Sing with me (Sing!)
Sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing with me)
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away...
[Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they want to get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin
to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin to you - but we're the fuckin shit in they eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spiritslive on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...
[Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]
Sing with me (Sing!)
Sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (C'mon!)
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away...
[Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]
Sing with me (Sing!)
Sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (C'mon!)

No one even knows I'm alive

You're rockin' so hard

            <field name="lyrics">Hey have you heard the news
Somebody stole my shoes
And I can smell the booze
How indiscreet
And though I had a plan
After that thief outran
Into another man
Who had no feet
I swear to god that day
That guy with no feet say
You got to walk my way
That's how it's planned
That's when I thought "good grief"
J-just ain't my belief
Until I saw the holes
Inside his hand
Street Jesus
Street Jesus
Come on, come on, what you think about life?
Demon in heaven gotta carry a knife
You said to me, "no, that ain't the plan"
With a smile on his face and the holes in his hand
Wise man tell ya what they're reading from a scroll
But things kinda change when the story gets told
They tell it like it is to everybody they meet
Just to sing it in the church what they're preaching in the street
Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to vacate you'll find
Street Jesus
Street Jesus
Good god almighty, s'posed to be about love
You must've wished upon me by kissing the glove
I'm a high-stepping lover, sharp as a knife
I'm a pink flamingo on a great long life?
A wise man, poor man, beggar man too
You bet your bottom dollar but whatcha gonna do?
I can make up daylight jealous of the night
I try to play the game but I never get it right!
Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to vacate you'll find
When you wonder what's up
With your half empty cup
Say tell him "don't give up,
Reach for the stars"
You think you're so street wise
Just pray and close your eyes
Until we colonize
The moon and stars
But wouldn't it be great
If we could wipe the slate
When we all live in hate
And all this fear
So please don't call me "sir"
If you're whole life's a blur
And mr
bartender
Another beer
Sometimes it's hard trying to keep up the pace
The train kept a rollin' when you're trying to win the race
If you don't believe me, wanna stay in the game
You gotta know who from the heavens came
They tell it like it is to everybody they meet
Cause they're singing in the church
what they're preaching in the street
If you wanna give em hell then you tell it from the steeple
But I'd rather be a priest so I can scream it to the people
Placate and vacate your miiiiind
Too late to vacate you'll fiiiiiind
You won't get too many tries
Love is the love of my life
Street Jesus
Street Jesus
Street Jesus
Street Jesus
Who do ya
Who do ya
Who do ya
Who do ya think that you are?</field>

Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit gone died
Yes it is
You stand in the front just a shakin' your ass
I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
I talk about something you can sure understand

Blame it on the beat of the drum
God I love the sweet taste of India
Lingers on the tip of my tongue
Gotta know that´s what´s gotten into ya
Any cat man do when it´s done...
Oh yeah she´s got that kind of love incense
That lives in her back room
And when it mixes with the funk, my friend
It turns into perfume
When you are born you´re afraid of the darkness
And then you´re afraid of the light
But I'm not afraid when I dance with my shadow
This time I'm gonna get it right
To think of what I´ll get tonight
Just lookin´ for a little taste, a taste of India
She´ll steal the smile right out of your face
Her yin and yang, Is just the thing
She´s unpredictable my friend
God I love the sweet taste of India
Lingers on the tip of my tongue
Gotta know that´s what´s gotten into ya
Any cat man do when it´s done...
It´s like the first taste love of vindaloo
That sets your heart on fire
And if you let her stuff get into you
It will be all that you desire
When you make love to the sweet tantric priestress
Drinkin´ in the bliss of delight
But I'm not afraid when I dance with her shadow
The time I'm gonna get it right
She´s gonna whet my appetite
Just lookin´ for a little taste, taste of India
She´ll steal the smile right out of your face
She a friend of mine, She a concubine
The sweetest wine, I gotta make her mine
God I love the sweet taste of India
Lingers on the tip of my tongue
Gotta love the sweet taste of India
Blame it on the beat of the drum
God I love that sweet taste of India
Lingers on the tip of my tongue
Gotta know that what´s gotten into ya

Now nothing's ever what it seems
I thought I felt it all around
But now it's laying there on the ground
Why was it there for me,
But not for you?
Tell me, tell me,
It comes as bliss of love,
Now I'm sitting here
And you're so far gone
I'm staring down the page in a magazine
I looked up at the Tv, but it's just too discrete
When we're together, I thought it was ecstasy
Oh I can tell the sun's still shining
But shadows are all I can see
And everywhere I go,
I'll never see your face I know
What could I say,
That could make you come back this way
Tell me, tell me,
It comes as bliss of love,
Now I'm sitting here
And you're so far gone
Now I know I should have known
And I see I could have seen
You gotta rest your soul
I need to know, I want to find out
If your fields are still green, whoaaa
Now I hope that what I have found
Could somehow be true
Why is it such a long long way and you
Tell me, tell me
It comes as bliss of love, now I'm sitting here
And you're so far gone.</field>

Oh honey, best believe it
To save a lot of time and foolish pride
I'll say what's on my mind, girl

You love me, you hate me, I used to be your lover
You know you've had it comin' girl so take me to the
Other side
Take me to the other side
Take me to the other side</field>

The way you love I adore
You always come never know where you been
But a-now I'm here baby to even the score
You're up, you're down
You're always running in place
Triathlon if you please
You're always beggin' me for a taste
But I ain't up to snuff if you sneeze
Yak yak yak
Lord you give me the bends
Heads and tails
You're all out of love
Like The Reason A Dog
Has so many friends
He wags his tail instead of his tounge
Your older sister
She's a lot like you
She likes to grab my mircophone
Now there ain't too much she won't do
Especially when we're all alone
You're up, you're down
You're always runnin' in place
Triathlon if you please
Her mind's on rewind and erase
You might get shot, babe
When you're shootin' the breeze
Yak yak yak
Lord you give me bends
You're heads and tails
Are calling for love
Like The Reason A Dog
Has so many friends
He wags his tail instead of his tounge
(Repeat)
Your older sister
She's a lot like you
And there ain't too much she won't do
There's always something
That you got to say
I lose my mind and then I surely fade away, yeah
Yak yak yak
Lord you give me the bends
You're heads and tails
Now look what you done
Like The Reason A Dog
Has so many friends
He wags his tail instead of his tounge.</field>

Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web, any size
Catches thieves, just like flies
Look out! Here comes the Spider-man!
Is he strong? Listen, Bud!
He's got radioactive blood.
Can he swing from a thread?
Take a look overhead.
Hey there, there goes the Spider-man!
In the chill of night,
At the scene of the crime
Like a streak of light
He arrives just in time
Spider-man, Spider-man
Friendly neighborhood Spider-man
Wealth and fame, he's ignored
Action is his reward
To him, life is a great big bang-up
Wherever there's a hang-up
You'll find the Spider-man!

Baby, we can only come alive to me
Her man he was lusted

They left her to be trusted
To the orphanage

Went insane
Uncle Salty told me
When she was just a baby
That she could buy a maybe
Someday she'd see
Soon she found that money
Is love for all the others
The pushers and the shovers
Was the life to me
But when she cried at night
No one cared
And when she cried at night
Went insane
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Now she's doin' many
For money and the penny
Sell her for a penny or two or three
Hers is the cunnin'
For men that come a runnin'
They all come for fun and it seems to me

With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this!
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing "Hey diddle diddle"
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I knowed love was here to stay
When she told me to
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Just gimme a kiss
Like this!
Schoolgirl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this!
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school

            <field name="lyrics">When your heart is breakin'
When your faith has been shaken
When the road you're takin'
Takes you nowhere at all
When it all, seems to all go wrong
Remember, nobody, can always be strong.
We all fall down...
I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go through it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down
When your dreams are shattered
When you feel broken and battered
When every step on the ladder
Takes you nowhere but down
And you lose ground, like you can't hold on
Remember, nobody, can always be strong.
We all fall down...
I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go though it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall.
I will lift you, high above the rain
I'll be with you, we all feel the pain
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down
Everyone breaks
You'll get hurt sometimes, in this life
You fly so high, you crash and burn sometimes
And I want you to know, you are not alone
We all fall down (we all fall down)
I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go through it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall.
I will lift you, high above the rain
I'll be with you, we all feel the pain
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall.
I will catch you.
I wont' let you.
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down</field>

Got a holy resurrection
You got the oo-ee baby
That's sweeter than confection
You don't need no invitation
Grab the devil by the tail
If you got the fascination
Touch it, touch it, touch it
Make it red hot!
Wham bam - it was better than the first time
Love jam - had my fingers in the pie
Wham bam - we were swingin' from the grape vine
Wham bam - and I kissed her butterfly
You got me climbin' up the walls
Gotta scrape me off the ceiling
Slow down baby
We don't want to blow the feeling
We got the fiy-aa
like a burnin' volcano
I hope this feelin' never slips away
That is what I pray for
Yea, the train kept a rollin'
Screamin' all night long - Do it! do it!
We're gettin' down and dirty - do it! do it!</field>

Am I the one to blame?
I gave up and left you for a nowhere-bound train
Now that train has come and gone
I close my eyes and see you lying in my bed
And I still dream of that day
What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me
And now that I'm alone
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be
An old friend told me that you found somebody new
Oh, you're finally moving on
You think that I'd be over you after all these years
Yeah, but time has proved it wrong
'Cause I'm still holdin' on
What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me
And now that I'm alone
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be
We've gone our separate ways
Say goodbye to another day
I still wonder where you are
Are you too far from turning back?
You were slipping through my hands and I didn't understand
What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me
And now that I'm alone
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be
What could have been love will never be
What could have been love
What could have been love
What could have been love

Well there's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises
I guess they don't mean a thing
So baby what's the story
Did you find another man
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made
When you don't look back
I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is
That you can sleep
In the night without thinking you lost
Everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Girl before I met you
I was f

n
e
fine
But your love made me a prisoner
Yeah my heart's been doin' time
Spent me up like money
Well then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
'cause you had me deep with the devil in your eyes
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is
That you can sleep
In the night without thinking you lost
Everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much
Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' for me
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost
Everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice

I was as lonely as can be she had a beautiful *
She was lonely
She showed me her tattoo it was right there On her breast
Somewhere in a city in the middle of the West
When she asked me to her house
Little did I know she was only
She was just 18 still livin' with her folks
She was only
And when I met her momma she undressed me With her eyes
Then her daddy gave a look at me
That could have paralyzed
'Cause your mamma wants to do me and your
Daddy wants to do me in
I'm a cat with nine lives I hope that I
Can make it to ten
O'cherry please forgive me for confessin'
My original sin
Because your mamma wants to do me
And your daddy wants to do me in!
(dialogue to chorus)
In the morning as I gingerly tipped toed
Down the stairs, I had this deja voodoo
That maybe I already had been there
Then it all came back to me that night back in 1973.</field>

Yeah I was hangin' with the Devil when we made a pact
I'm drinkin' welfare whiskey smokin' food stamp crack
It was one part sour..
two parts sweet
Three parts strong..
and four parts weak
I would rather sit on a pumpkin
And have it all to myself
Then to be crowded on a velvet cushion
You may be bad
You can not see
You may be deaf
It's all meant to be
Now when the Lord get ready
You gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move
You got to know
When the good get ready
You gotta move
Huh huh..
you gotta
You gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move</field>

Happy just to be in lust
Never have to eat no dust
Everybody talk about
Young lust
You're dyin' and you're screamin' inside
Oh, you're guilty way before you been tried
It's crazy but you're diggin' it
Young lust
You feel it in the summertime blues
Oh, easy when there's nothin' to lose
And baby you been missin' out
Young lust
Sometimes you need it so bad
It's enough to drive a young girl mad
So what you gonna do about it
A little bit o' nasty
You look a little sleazy
But don't get any on you
Young lust
You better keep your daughter inside
Or she's gonna get a dose of my pride
Yeah, everybody talks about it
Young lust
Once you had it you can never go back
Don't you ever let 'em give you no slack
When you're streakin' down the alley way
Checkin' out the ladies
Who didn't bring their boyfriends
Who love to get in trouble
I got to say I'll see you later,
meet me in the elevator
Always gettin' stronger
Never gettin' weaker
My love is gettin' longer
I'll keep it in my sneaker
Never keep a secret
Never feelin' guilty
Never gettin' lonely
Never gettin' no peace, hidin' from the police
Sneakin' out the back way
Sneakin' down the alley way
Gotta do it my way
Do it in the sunshine
Hangin' from the clothesline
Find another tree to climb
Young lust
There's no time for lovin'
Young lust
No, don't need one in the oven
Young lust
I'm a-pushin' and a-shovin' it
Young lust
Come on now I just can't wait
Are you fishin' or you gonna cut bait
Everybody body doin' it
Young lust
Honey now ain't it a bitch
Sometime you gotta scratch that itch
So what you gonna do about it</field>

The buildings were dead and the alleys Stunk from things that used to live there Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered A child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence With not a scrap left on the plate And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable Cause the only thing left was their faith And there sure as hell ain't much I can do About it.... There's a meltdown in the sky There's a new day comin' and I don't know why There's a fear that gets me high And the cold night numbs as the jet black clouds roll on by.... So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold Made me wonder just who was the foe And was it all to come true what nostradamus Had predicted such a long long time ago? You could hear screams and moanin' From the people atoning For their sins of a guilt ridden life And the final door shuts From the wind that leaves cuts From the edge on the blade of god's knife And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about.... There's a melt down in the sky There's a new day comin and I don't know why There's a tear stuck in my eye There's a new day comin' and I don't know why Battle lines had been drawn Mother nature how she cried By her side, till the dawn Couldn't kill her if they tried How they tried, open eyed, genocide Then... she died Battle lines had been drawn Mother nature how she cried By her side, till the dawn Couldn't kill her if they tried How they tried, open eyed, genocide Then... she died There's a meltdown in the sky There's a new day comin' and I don't know why There's a fear that gets me high And the cold night numbs as the jet black clouds roll on by....</field>

"I like really big tits

Walk like a macho man, love Hulk Hogan, love the slogan.
"Hulk rules!"
I'm just God's gift to Earth
I'm just God's gift to Earth.
Walkin' in a strut 'cross the side of the bar, drivin' a chevy truck.
You know me with gun racks, got a .40 growin' up eat and live and breath dregs-
I'm born in the US of A, born in the US of A, born in the US of A.
I've been tryin' to be a man
I'm just tryin' to be a man.
Drink from dawn to night, lookin’ for a fight, makes everything alright.
I like really big tits
I like really big tits
I think I’ll look up to all the girls, a slut might just beat me up.
You know me with gun racks, got a .40 growin' up, even though I’ve got three ???-
I'm born in the US of A, born in the US of A, born in the US of A.

Hey, Miss Murder can I!

take my life? Oh oh oohh
With just a look, they shook
And heavens bowed before him.
Simply a look
Can break, your heart.
The stars that pierce the sky;
He left them all behind.
We're left to wonder why
He left us all behind.
Chorus:
Hey, Miss Murder can I! Hey, Miss Murder can I!
Make beauty stay if I, Take my life? Oh oh ooh
Oh...
Dreams of his crash, won't pass!
Or how they all adored him.
Beauty will last when spiraled down.
The stars that mystify;
He left them all behind.
And how his children cry;
He left us all behind.
Chorus:
Hey, Miss Murder can I! Hey, Miss Murder can I!
Make beauty stay if I, Take my life? Oh oh oohh
What's the rift that twists
within this furthest mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it.
At the cost of love
your ray of light will fizzle out!
Without hope! Aaarrgg...
When the empty sand just flowing through our
empty skin!
And we're searching for what we were promised.
Reaching for the cold and rain we never let
go;
They won't ever let us blow our filthy hands apart.

We are the cracks in diamond walls.
I tried to illuminate but the shadows kill.
I’m overshadowed.
See how I blend in with nothing?
Now beautiful boys, let’s destroy.
We’ll shine as the Lucite breaks and falls.
Raise the new glitter god with the golden tears- the tears that swallow.
A smile that’s touched so warms nothing.
Yesterday I burnt the sky, looked to the ground and wrapped it around me.
Still today I have so much to burn.
Yesterday I longed to die, fell to the ground, and the ground caught me.
Now today I question why I fell.
Deities fell to decoys, tainting what’s pure.
Let’s cleanse them all.
Infinite life reclaimed, as the shadows kill they are overshadowed.
We’ll burn as they fade into nothing.
Yesterday I burnt the sky, looked to the ground and wrapped it around me.
Still today I have so much to burn.
Yesterday I longed to die, fell to the ground, and the ground caught me.
Now today I question why I fell.
So what can help me to understand, somehow, why it always pains me to breath?
We’re no longer confined because yesterday I burnt the sky.
Yesterday I burnt the sky, looked to the ground and wrapped it around me.
Still today I have so much to burn.
Yesterday I longed to die, fell to the ground, and the ground caught me.
Now today I question why I fell.</field>

When you begged to know I was glad to show
That I needn't be scared, either way I still bite
Oh, I must confess I am overdressed, for you
Not impressed?
Darling, I want to.
I'll confess this too,
Must you know the truth,
This is all for you.
Darling, I want to.
So here's the final scene
When I finally come clean
I've watched you for years, years
And here's my favorite part
When you beg for my heart and I disappear.
Oh, I must confess I am overdressed, for you.
Not impressed?
Darling, I want to.
I'll confess this too,
Must you know the truth,
This is all for you.
Darling I want to.
Darling, I want to ...
Destroy you</field>

Can be given freely , it's a valuable commodity
But obviously this is something you
Never learned
Faithis something that you put in friends and
Had i excess morals to lend
I'd let you borrow them but my trust you haven't earned!
We've got a problem
First of all: there is no we, i'm detached from you completely
I've got a problem: you tell lies to my friends and think it won't get back to me
No bond
Could ever seem to make a stable fit in our relationship
But one thing that never comes between us
Honesty
When you've got something to say you always seem to find away
To avoid the truth or instead you avoid me!
We've got a problem: first of all there is no we, i'm detached from you completely
I've got a problem: you telll lies to my friends and think it won't get back to me

Someone should just throw me away,
I feel like a garbage can.
Throw me away,
I've got no use.
Throw me away,
I'm nothing to lose.
Throw me away,
I feel like shit.
I am useless.
I know I know nothing at all,
I'd take stand, but I know I'd fall,
I'd run head-down into a wall,
And watch my blood run faster.
Girls laugh and pass me on the street,
I spook out everyone I meet,
I've got pink toenails on my feet,
I'm such a fucking master.
Throw me away,
I've got no use.
Throw me away,
I'm nothing to lose.
Throw me away,
I feel like shit.
I am useless.
I never seem to feel well,
I always seem to looks like hell,
It seems like everyone can tell my mind is going numb,
My mom thinks I wear women's clothes,
I get dogged on at all the shows,
It seems that everybody know,
I look like a fucking bum.
Throw me away,
I've got no use.
Throw me away,
I'm nothing to lose.
Throw me away,

I'll break your individuality,
I'll take you down.
I'll seal shut your open eyes.
I'll give you a taste on the bland.
Intoxicate you, take me in.
You'll never feel the touch of my hand.

            <field name="lyrics">Twenty-six years and seems like I've just begun
To understand my, my intimate is no one
When the director sold the show, who bought its last rites?
They cut the cast, the music, and the lights
This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone
Twenty-six years end, still speaking in these tongues
Such revelations while understood by no one
When the new actor stole the show, who questioned his grace?
Please clear the house of ill-aquired taste
This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something real
I lay strewn across the floor, can't solve this puzzle
Everyday another small piece can't be found
I lay strewn across the floor, pieced up in sorrow
The pieces are lost, these pieces don't fit
Pieced together incomplete and empty
This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone
This is my line, this is eternal
How did I end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone.</field>

We are the cracks in diamond walls.
I tried to illuminate but the shadows kill.
I’m overshadowed.
See how I blend in with nothing?
Now beautiful boys, let’s destroy.
We’ll shine as the Lucite breaks and falls.
Raise the new glitter god with the golden tears- the tears that swallow.
A smile that’s touched so warms nothing.
Yesterday I burnt the sky, looked to the ground and wrapped it around me.
Still today I have so much to burn.
Yesterday I longed to die, fell to the ground, and the ground caught me.
Now today I question why I fell.
Deities fell to decoys, tainting what’s pure.
Let’s cleanse them all.
Infinite life reclaimed, as the shadows kill they are overshadowed.
We’ll burn as they fade into nothing.
Yesterday I burnt the sky, looked to the ground and wrapped it around me.
Still today I have so much to burn.
Yesterday I longed to die, fell to the ground, and the ground caught me.
Now today I question why I fell.
So what can help me to understand, somehow, why it always pains me to breath?
We’re no longer confined because yesterday I burnt the sky.
Yesterday I burnt the sky, looked to the ground and wrapped it around me.
Still today I have so much to burn.
Yesterday I longed to die, fell to the ground, and the ground caught me.
Now today I question why I fell.</field>

Mother, say you'll pray for me.
I'm premature in my decay.
Shards of glass swimming in my eyes.
A small voice in the back of my mind
that's whispering words
I never want to hear.
I pray that you won't hesitate,
as you watch me degenerate,
to reach in my wounds and extract all of my fear.
My suffocation, asphyxiation.
I've been choking on my own blood.</field>

Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by.
99 red balloons floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine it springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
As 99 red balloons go by.
99 Decision Street, 99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call out the troops now in a hurry

Teach me not to dream
Dream deeply
I haven't left here for days

He told me I should have known

To love soft lies, She lied
Do you miss her like I missed you? "

my father the morning pushes through moonlight love.
So what's sleep?
Sleep.
I'm tired, so tired,
but it seems that there's someone here with me.
We are the wakeful, wry, watchful.
We're awaiting
Deathless ones
(X2)
A story at three with the shrillest of cries.
My mind fights with the sparkles in the corner of my eyes.
I'm tired, so tired,
but it seems that there's someone here with me.
We are the wakeful, wry, watchful.
We're awaiting
Deathless ones
(X3)
I hear the morning choir sing to me their elegy
(X2)
So beautiful
They sing to me their elegy
Requiem..</field>

A world of violets.
My breath materialized again.
Immaculate.
Inanimate.
A comfort cutting time I see...
a string of white lights.
Forever walking through December.
Forever longing for a sign of life,
a bringer of light.
Forever wandering together through
a world of violets.
Ice everlasting.
A full moon casting
a purple veil enshrouding all
I
perambulate, somnambulant.
A solace piercing time I see...
a string of white lights.
Forever walking through December.
Forever longing for a sign of life,
a bringer of light.
Forever wandering together through
a world of violets.
If only for one night,
if only for one night,
if only for one night remember.
If only for one night,
if only for one night,
if only for one night together..</field>

I saw you step upon that bridge
I saw you walk across that bridge
I saw you float above that bridge
And I've floated since that day
It's too much to take, the thought of it all
Release me distraction
It's too much to take, the thought of my fall
Shameful attraction
What happened to the place I'd hide?
I taught you how to slip inside

I saw you walk across that bridge
I saw you float above our bridge

awake while everyone else sleeps.
I'm giving unease to anyone I meet.
My generosity can never runout,
because I give a gift from what's within myself.
No hope at all.
Take nothing from nothing and you'll have nothing left.
I can't recall.
I can't recall a moment in my life when life was at it's best.
Everyone avoids my stare
and no one cares to ever dare to look into my eyes of what they most fear.
And they're taught to fear,
to fear no evil.
And they know no fear,
they've learned to love themselves.
Forever unlucky,
'cause I'll own tomorrow.
Forever unwanted,
outcast today.
I'm not mislead,
I've got no one to follow.
Everywhere to go,
no place to stay..</field>

Begin to ring in the new sound anxiously
Oh, I am anxious and aching, breathing the burning air
Caring for something that is not there
Knowing what's fated, begin my fatal flight
Flying obscenely into the light
But the light will evade me to bring down punishment
Punishing soundly it lets me live
Swing the serenade (I heard it swing)
Swing love down and find the saddest song
I heard you swing the promises (You'll watch me swing now)
Swing love now and choke what we've become
Black without blindness, my eyes begin to sting
As my lips part to poison, sweet poisoning
Oh god, I feel like I'm dying
I've found death finally
And it feels like heaven, I'll never reach
Swing the serenade (I heard it swing)
Swing love down and find the saddest song
I heard you swing the promises (You'll watch me swing now)
Swing love now and choke what we've become
Swinging now, will you watch me?
Swinging now, will you watch me?
Turn it down
Drown it slowly
Is it off? I'm still listening
Swinging now, will you watch me?
Swinging now, will you watch me?
Turn it down
Drown it slowly
Is it off? I'm still listening
Swing the serenade (I heard it swing)
Swing love down and find the saddest song
I heard you swing the promises (You'll watch me swing now)
Swing love now and choke what we've become
(I'll bite your lips though I know better than this)

We're youth eternal,
nothing more to become.
A thousand lights are burning from both ends.
We're proud of reputations we all own.
Together forever.
Rejected but never alone.
Together forever.
I'd purify the world with one primal scream,
but no one would listen.
Keep dark secrets to myself,
because no one else will talk to me.
It's hard for me to comprehend,
they couldn't understand all the thoughts going
through our heads.
With a smile they tore us up,
now look what we've become.
Finally we are numb.
No need to.
No need to feel.
I've got a nothingness and that's all that's real.
No need to cut the numbness inside.
No need to.
No need to hear.
What you've got to say means nothing at all.
I've got no distance left to fall.</field>

Gentle caresses, just as paper thin -frail

What I if could go to sleep for days,
would you count the hours,
or would your restlessness consume fading memories of me?
Fall into open arms that offer their protection.
Quick to deny that their open to deceit.
Long to believe that support will never cease.
Bitter and lonely, those they've left before.
What if I could go to sleep for days,
would you count the hours,
or would your restlessness consume fading memories of me?
The vibrant heart so quickly growing old,
the warmest eyes so quickly growing cold.
Just a glance for they don't care to see what becomes of me.

I do implore these confines now

I'm hovering throughout time.
I crumble in these days.
I crumble, I cannot find
reflection in these days.
If you listen, listen close,
beat-by-beat, you can hear when the heart stops.
I saved the pieces when it broke and ground them all to dust.
I am destroyed by the inside.
I disassociate.
I hope to destroy the outside.
It will alleviate and elevate me.
Like water flowing into lungs,
I'm flowing through these days.
As morphine tears through deadened veins
I'm numbing in these days.
I know what died that night.
It could never be brought back to life once again, I know.
I know I died that night and I'll never be brought back to life.
Once again, I know.

don't like what's real.

if only pure sweetness was offered
why's this bitter taste left in my mouth
if I could catch my breath
just to exhale
I'd know that I held it in too long
from above comes a faint smile
a new vantage, such a view
familiarity, now disowned
just sit and stare, as I walk away
walk away
watch me

Overwhelmed by my doubt.
Things I said I'd never do I've done.
Those I said I'd never be I've become.
I have broken - I'm still breaking - cracked and wrecked,beyond repair.
Smacks me in the face every time I fall.
I cannot disregard, with each new fall I hit twice as hard.
Would you be there for me? I would.
Would you look up to see?
I would

but you've left me no choice.
Though I still strain
I can't recall the beauty of your fey voice.
Now that I've heard come through the walls
a song I've heard many times
I must return all you gave me
in the company of swine.
We had found sacred ground
Oh we had found sacred ground
You'll burn down.
I thought you sang so tastefully
but now I see I was wrong.
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave
so, please, cut the love song.
How I regret what I must do
but you must be replaced
For I cannot go on suffering
such simple and common tastes.
When you met my eyes you sang to me
of passion, pain and will.
When I blinked you turned away
to kiss the hand of filth.
We had found sacred ground
Oh we had found sacred ground
I'll burn down
I thought you sang so tastefully
but now I see I was wrong.
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave
so, please, cut the love song.

Tell me who will hear your voice,
your song, when the smoke has cleared
and the lights are gone?
Tell me, who appears when I'm gone.
I thought you sang so tastefully
but now I see I was wrong.
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave
so, please, cut the love song.
I thought you sang so tastefully
I see I was wrong.

Friends was not good enough?
Fuck You Very Much.
You can always claim you're straightedge,
go ahead and dye your hair.
You won't get more attention from me,

Oh, we dance in misery

Swept off our feet by our misery, we're swept into the shadows

Let me hide within your black, the still inside your eyes
Deafened, caught within a cry
So sensual, as step by step by step, I seperate
As breath to breath, as I..
suffocate

We all..
have no chance in this horrid romance

Too old for someone

Darling, I want to.
I'll confess this too,
Must you know the truth,
This is all for you.
Darling, I want to destroy you.
As you reached for my hand,
Did you then understand
It was I who would lead you that night?
When you begged to know I was glad to show
That I needn't be scared, either way I still bite
Oh, I must confess I am overdressed, for you
Not impressed?
Darling, I want to.
I'll confess this too,
Must you know the truth,

So here's the final scene
When I finally come clean
I've watched you for years, years
And here's my favorite part
When you beg for my heart and I disappear.

writhing with sickness
thrown into banality

killed by the weakness,
but forced to return.
(Turn it) OFF!
I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held the falling star and it wept for me, dying
I feel the falling stars encircle me, now as they cry
go out there so quickly,
grows malignant tribes
Post human extinction excels
unrecognized.
Feeling surrounded, so bored with mortality, I decay.
All of this hatred is fucking real.
(Turn it) ON! yeahhh
I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held the falling star and it wept for me,
dying
I feel the falling the stars encircle me,
now as they cry.
But it wont be all right,
despite what they say
Just watch the stars tonight come out as they,
as they disappear disintegrate.
And I disintegrate ?cause this hate is fucking real.
And I hope to shade the world
as the stars go out and I disintegrate.
I wont be alive
just watch the sky
just watch the sky
the stars go out</field>

Poisonous and slow.
My mind it speeds.
My voice has died.
God let me make the faintest cry.

By my hands
By my legs

I waved as i passed myself along the way.
I have arrived so unashamed, but my reflection no longer looks the same.
It seems much dimmer now.....it seems so dim.
Just stumble and fall into a world that's overcrowded.
And you will find me.
Won't recognize me; i won't recognize myself.
I have arrived so unashamed, but all my senses no longer seem the same.
I can sense everything.
My sight's so clear.
In an instant, my life just slipped away.
I fought for life the whole time you were holding me down.
You watched me dying.
Holding me down, you brought my rebirth.</field>

before I sink, because I think,
I think I may have found the short way down.
Just give me something
Cold and clear
The love spent here,
As I had feared means nothing dear.
I pray to reason I'll forget.
I'll trade what's left.
JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING!
I'm the devout,
Praying just to get the blood out,
Bound by this flesh I own.
I'm the devout,
Cutting just to get the blood out.
Desecrate til we die alone.
I will defy the pulse disguise
But please pretend we're still alive
If it gives you hope.
I've sung and drowned.
I'm taking the short way down.
Give me something!
I'm the devout,
Praying just to get the blood out,
Bound by this flesh I own.
I'm the devout,
Cutting just to get the blood out.
Desecrate til we die alone.
Give me something I can take,
Can take to make the memories fade.
Poison kiss, remember this,
I never was meant for this day.
I'm the devout,
Praying just to get the blood out,
Bound by this flesh I own.
I'm the devout,
Cutting just to get the blood out.
Desecrate til we die alone.</field>

Deadened branches stirred by whispers in the wind.

Fall children fill the streets at dusk, at last, it

Are you a lonely one, too?
This is a lonely war tonight, the soldier's waking
They were the lonely ones, too
Leave your stain and love my wounds tonight
Leave like they all do

In this game so fake with a reprobate
Seal our fate, seal our, seal your

First impressions of the sun
Burnt the skin now are buried
We've been staring up too long
Eyes gone dry
no more tears
Salt and shame upon my tongue
Dust on dust, drying flowers
We've been coming here too long
Here in the golden mirror watch
Every word you say shatter
And find a way to cut like golden days
Flesh on flesh on the dry earth
Our reflections are the same
Wearing dust, match the desert
Past is captured as it's made in your image
Like an actress lying to protect her age
Dust on lens
dying flowers
We shall not return again
Here in the golden mirror watch every word
You say shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days
Your watching as I fade
Fading as I'm watching every word I say
Loving how I fade, wilting like a flower
Knowing that the rain may fall too late
It can't revive my dying flowers
Oh the rain may fall..
too late
This is our final hour</field>

I'm wide awake all through the night,
Diner may suck but I'll take a bite,
I do whatever I can.
My muscles stiffen through the day,
Discomfort never goes away,
Someone should just throw me away,
I feel like a garbage can.
Throw me away,
I've got no use.
Throw me away,
I'm nothing to lose.
Throw me away,
I feel like shit.
I am useless.
I know I know nothing at all,
I'd take stand, but I know I'd fall,
I'd run head-down into a wall,
And watch my blood run faster.
Girls laugh and pass me on the street,
I spook out everyone I meet,
I've got pink toenails on my feet,
I'm such a fucking master.
Throw me away,
I've got no use.
Throw me away,
I'm nothing to lose.
Throw me away,
I feel like shit.
I am useless.
I never seem to feel well,
I always seem to looks like hell,
It seems like everyone can tell my mind is going numb,
My mom thinks I wear women's clothes,
I get dogged on at all the shows,
It seems that everybody know,
I look like a fucking bum.
Throw me away,
I've got no use.
Throw me away,
I'm nothing to lose.
Throw me away,
I feel like shit.

Heavy heat, and sheets stick to my skin
Can't get away from nothingness.
I try to get up, but I have to give in to the force that is keeping me down
I overcome gravity, I look outside
A cat cries out, trapped upon a window sill, but is crying's drowned out by my screaming inside
What will it take?
I wonder what it's like exposed outside, would I be safe? When will it break
Try to look out, I see reflection I just want to break
Sirens moan
They're forever crying..
someone's probably dying.
The sound sticks inside my head
Talk to myself, I'm company, but who is to say if nothing if said? Two windows stare back at me
Three stories high nothing is new
I may sit, but someday I'll stand
I'll muster up the will and fire myself through.</field>

Close it so beautifully
I'll let animosity unwind
Steal away the darkened pages
Hidden so shamefully
I'll still feel the violence of the lines
I can't stand my laughter as they cry
My soul brings tears to angelic eyes
And miles away my mother cries
Omnipotence, nurturing malevolence

Where the rain falls every night
Upon precious flames we once found so pretty
Our frail and only light
Love is all that's left and I'm emotionless
You won't read it in the papers
In this time, keep your hands clean, just read my mind
We're trapped between the nightmares
And I fear the future's here
It's 1985 (and it feels like, feels like survival)
It's 1985 (and it feels like, feels like survival)
Can you read my mind?
Oh, the emptiness overfills this city
So you'll be queen tonight
As you overthrow, looking pale and pretty
I welcome your requite
They told us love can save
So we prepared our graves
You won't read it in the papers
In this time, keep your hands clean, just read my mind
We're trapped between the nightmares
And I fear the future's here
It's 1985 (and it feels like, feels like survival)
It's 1985 (and it feels like, feels like survival)

Will you hold my hand as we count the hours… the hours
Will you hold my hand as we count down the hours… the hours
Standing beneath the meteor showers?
You won't read it in the papers
In this time, keep your hands clean, just read my mind
We're trapped between the nightmares
And I fear the future's here

Bring it down, down to the ground.
Tear it up
Burn it down.

The sound of breaking glass drives me back up.

No bond
Could ever seem to make a stable fit in our relationship
But one thing that never comes between us
Honesty
When you've got something to say you always seem to find away
To avoid the truth or instead you avoid me!

So unhappy in my whole life
Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
You were my first faith, made of lies like all the others
Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
I found my last light but it died like all the others (all the others)
Oh, my painful fatal flaw
May your cruelty find you
May the scars you left in me
Dig into you twice as deep
Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
You were my first faith, made of lies like all the others
Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
I found my last light but it died like all the others
I know you'll look away while I'm crying
I know you'll wear that bow with a smile
Everything I gave you, it was wasted
Love further down, adore that denial
I stopped feeling numb, now I have to be
Because I trusted you I cannot trust another
Heart stops beating, what was brutality?
You were my last light so I'll die like all the others
Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
You bathed in love light so I'll die like all the others, all the others</field>

Last words of the runaway
Your love was written so true
And now I can't speak your name
I faced destruction and you
Just killed me and walked away
I gave my heart to the cruel
Now, it will not beat again
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
Just like I suffered
No one will ever know you
Deny the last one who cares
Intoxicate with the new
Pretend I'm no longer here
I opened my heart to you
You lied just to reach inside
Now, with the faith you removed
Our hope for forgiveness dies
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
Just like I suffered
(Ahh)
I've seen my darkest days
You gave each one to me
I've seen my darkest days
You gave each one to me
You have been lost for days
May you find my darkness
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
Just like I, I fucking suffered
Just like you
You made me suffer
I hope you
I hope you do</field>

Hold me closely now but
Don't say anything
They've come to take me away
And won't leave until I'm gone
Don't feel
Don't love anything
Love attracts all those
Who taint the cherished
Don't try to change anything
Nothing can pure every stay

Relax you'll be fine
All we love goes away
They'll take
All you left them find

I know you
And I know a place
Where no one is likely to pass
You don't care if it's late
And, you don't care if you're lost
And oh, you look so tired
But tonight you presume too much
Too much, too much
And if it's the last thing I ever do
I’m gonna get you
Crash into my arms

Turn from the light that has made them all go blind

Key lime pie,
your green filling makes me inept.
Flaky crust is what I lust.
Your fresh lime scent is a must.
Take me with coffee, never with tea.
You're the pie that pleases me!
People gawk "Is that pie green?
" Ask for a bite - "Fuck you, I'm mean."
Key lime pie - cheapest hooker
I've ever had.
Key lime pie.
Last slice gleaming,
if you're out I'm mad.
Key lime pie.
Poke fun and laugh and jest.
Key lime pie.
Don't bother me, digest key lime pie..</field>

Demonized
Purified
Justified

Love these screams like I do
Well the infinite times come
Just smile and all faith is gone
Guess I was the one to
To sacrifice everything
It's going to fast now
I c'can I cannot hold on
But at this place
Who'd want , who'd want to
I escape

Turn you to nothing.
Now blush and smile as they whisk you away.
Part your lips a bit more,
I'll swallow your fear.
I will show you how.
All the bite marks inpressed
A need to be here,
A need to see...
City lights, like rain,
Dance and explode.
Fall upon debutants,
Reeling from, nights that
Kiss and Control,
All of our, broken hearts.
Velvet burns,
The wrists while restraining.
You blushed and smiled,
And said you would stay.
One more time steal my breath,
I'll feed you the sky.
I will show you how.
Steal the glamour from death,
And before you die,
Then you should see...
City lights, like rain,
Dance and explode.
Fall upon, debutants,
Reeling from, nights that
Kiss and Control,
All of our, broken hearts.
Hearrrrrrtssss.
Ourrrrr heartssss.
"We all want to die like movie stars" you said.
As you jumped from the height of our cutting room floor.
While above us glowing, exploding, our dreams burst forth in light and death.
Hold me and tell me
"We'll burn like stars, we'll burn as we fall,
Watch as city lights dance for us"...
City lights, like rain,
Dance and explode.
Fall apart, the pain of old lights,
"What if i'm, not dead?"
Kiss and Control,
Fall apart, the pain of our lives, has pain.
Dance and explode.
City lights like rain City lights caress me
Kiss and Control
All of our, broken hearts.</field>

I've made my choice, now i've gotta face the facts.

Because I can't have my cake and eat it too.
I'm worn down from fighting with myself.
I'll save my life and lose my mental health.
I'm wigging out, everthing is turning round.
A bitter taste - no comfort to be found.
An emptiness wells inside me,
There's no filling the void that will always be,
A self-control is all i have to hold.
It's been too long.
Maybe I have been to bold.
When you're by your own conviction
discipline can be your addiction.
I'm worn down form fighting with myself.
I'll save my life and lose my mental health.
I've gone this far so I'll kepp trying.
Continue to fight, I hope that I don't end up dying..</field>

I will detach myself from your kind

Sense of commitment
A sense of pride.
I heard you say that we shared a destiny.
Now it's plain to see you've got no sense at all.

(O my soul love, I pray thee pity me
From out this dark gulf where my poor heart lies
A barren world hemmed in by leaden skies
Where horror flies at night, and blasphemy
For half the year the sickly sun is seen
The other half thick night lies on the land
A country bleaker than the polar strand
No beasts, no brooks, nor any shred of green
There never was a horror which surpassed
This icy sun's cold cruelty)
Beyond and to all time I stand
Beyond and to all time I stand
Beyond and to all time I stand
Beyond and to all time I stand
I stand, I stand
I stand!
(O my soul love, I pray thee pity me
From out this dark gulf where my poor heart lies,
A barren world hemmed in by leaden skies).</field>

Cross the street in your mini truck
Mini trucks suck
Stupid piece of shit
Hip-hop fuck
Mini trucks suck
Cross the street in your mini truck
Mini trucks suck
Stupid piece of shit
Hip-hop..
Cruising with my new whore
I'm out of beer and I need more
Marijuana has got me high
Can only be heard when I need pot
Look at me, I said you're a prick
Flip off me
You wanna suck dick? Stand right there, I'll fucking hit you
I'll take this
Hit you back, hit you back and slam right into a pole.
Mini trucks suck.
Cross the street in your mini truck
Mini trucks suck
Stupid piece of shit
Hip-hop fuck
Mini trucks suck
Cross the street in your mini truck
Mini trucks suck
Stupid piece of shit
Hip-hop..
Like to cruise when I know I'm poor
I'm a regular at the liquor store
Max out the stereo, pump up the bass
I buy girl shit
Wanna drive in a race
Think I'd rather fuck a chump
Need my beer and a little joint
Friends are easy, don't know shit
Going down and suck, down and suck, down and suck..
at least I'm getting laid
Mini trucks suck
Cross the street in your mini truck
Mini trucks suck
Stupid piece of shit
Hip-hop fuck
Mini trucks suck
Cross the street in your mini truck
Mini trucks suck
Stupid piece of shit
Hip-hop..
Yeah, boy
Mini trucks suck
Cross the street in your mini truck

By AFI

This is what I brought you
This you can keep
This is what I brought
You may forget me
I promise to depart
Just promise one thing
Kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep
This is what I brought you
This you can keep
This is what I brought
You may forget me
I promised you my heart
Just promise to sing
Kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep
Kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep
This is what I thought
I thought you need me
This is what I thought
So think me naive
I promise you a heart
You promised to keep
Kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep
Kiss my eyes and lay me to
sleep
Hey Miss Murder can I?
Hey Miss Murder can I?
Let beauty stay I,
take my life?
whoa-oh-ohh
With just a look they shook
And heavens bowed before him.
Simply a look can break your heart.
The stars that pierce the sky;

He left us all behind.
Hey Miss Murder can I?

Hey Miss Murder can I?
Hey Miss Murder can I?
Let beauty stay if I,

whoa-oh-ohh
What's the hook, the twist
Within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it.
That the ghost you love, your ray of light
Will fizzle out without hope.
We're the empty set just floating through, wrapped in skin
Ever searching for what we were promised.
Reaching for that golden ring we'd never let go,
who would ever let us put their filthy hands upon it?
Hey Miss Murder can I?
Hey Miss Murder can I?
Let beauty stay if I,

For even needle open my chest and insert ten pins.
I just anticipate what awaits when I awake..

            <field name="lyrics">Summer, I painted a scene that lit the stars for me.
Said, "I can erase it for you dear."
That summer created those words that came to life in three.
They were denied by you.
Summer I laid down below a glitter-adorned night
And silently sparkled my own way.
Summer I laid down by you and shared my frail light.
You gave the dark to me.
I looked inside to find the one I sent away.
I nearly froze when I stepped inside to find the flowers turned to gray.
I closed my eyes and kissed them one last time.
(I wanted this excoriation
I thrive on this self mutilation.) in backround
Summer, a morning so pale, alone when they found me.
As I remained sleeping I heard them say,
"This summer created a boy of abject misery."
He was designed by you.
I looked inside to find the one I sent away.
I nearly froze when I stepped inside to find the flowers turned to gray.
I closed my eyes and kissed them one last time.
(I wanted this excoriation
I thrive on this self mutilation.) in backround
So like a lost child I will hide,
And like a lost lie I will find a way to return to the one who made me
Cover
your eyes and we'll die together.
Will you cry for me? Will you cry for me, or will you cry with me?
I've been a lonely one.
I've had this whole world drained from me.
Am I the only one? I've had this world drained from me.
Summer, I painted a scene that lit the stars for me.
Said "I can erase it for you dear.".</field>

I'll say goodnight and bow to everyone.
Then we go under.
The beauties are sleeping as fruit just rots away.
Today go hungry.
Let it begin.
Make me invincible.
There was a weeping I carried down today, a sigh worth keeping.
Deep within divinity let's start another secret show.
Go kill the lights, we'll glow till morning comes.
I'll say goodnight and bow to everyone.
No need to worry it is just another monster.
No need to fear here in the secret show.
No need to worry I am just another monster.
In you, I'll see me, in the secret show.
Go kill the lights, we'll glow till morning comes.
I'll say goodnight and bow to everyone

This means nothing so spare me the lies.
I deny you sympathy;
Just as I have been denied.

I can't deny that I've been faking,
For you, every sign of life.
I died...
for the last lie;
And the heartbreak;
for the first time,
I could not take...
I could not take til I made you cry.
This is what you taught me.
This is what you taught - and I learned well -
To recognize that feeling easily can be dispelled.
I cannot breathe.

For you, every sign of life.
I died...

Show your wounds I'm bored with mine.
Nothing is new.
Don't despair I rarely cry...
Oh my;
Oh my dear please dry your eyes.
Who could harm you?
To hurt you is to be despised, as I'd love to.

And the heartbreak;
for the first time,

I can see, it's all done.
Nothing can erase the damage done.
I have seen ten liars love,
seen two lovers lie, seen youth, blinded, smiling.
I have seen deceit handed down.
From the highest height,below the lowly.
I can see it's been done, all that was pure has been eradicated.
I have seen beasts bathed in glory, tread across the angels as they crawl.
Take it all away.
Regress to nothing.
Can someone please take these images from my mind?.</field>

I can't be a part,
Be a part of your modern world.
I've gotta be apart,
Be apart,
Gotta be apart.
I've gotta be apart.
I can't grasp the values that you hold.</field>

If you could only hear all the things you used to say.
Consumed now by what you knew was poisonous,
quenching your thirst for life (for life.)
Will you die for me? Will you live for me?
Kill aspirations away.
Embrace a dream that was a nightmare only yesterday.
True friends forgotten and all hopes been traded in,
exchanged for what.
For what? All at once, all is lost
All is lost..</field>

Afraid of the morning
That I awake and feel like someone
Is here but I'm laying right out
Going darker and darker
When my skin peels away roses appear
And I'll turn over
Find me in the corner of the round room
Reaching into dawn to find night blooms
Beauty, how you blind! give me a reason
Without sight, I will ever find you
And how you blind! I know the reason
I can't stop touching my eyes
I'm allied to the night
And warring the morning
I retreat into the dark if someone is near
You can lay me right out
With the right kind of flower
When my senses slip away lilies appear
In the hot house you'll find me
Staring at the end, again, in rapture
I lick my fingers
make my tongue go numb
I chew you from beneath my nails
Put your petals in my mouth</field>

I can
hate myself
more...
more than anyone
WILL YOU JOIN ME!?
I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT THIS
TORTURES ME!
HAVE I CREATED THE SUFFERING!?
SHOW ME!
Or do you happily cut, further in?
to sever what's left inside, that binds me.
Now all i feel is
Desperation, devastation

to lose ways, to sing, an odd time of death, to lose and not to win.
Why must I, always have to lose with an easy life?
Why cant I, just pretend to fall asleep? No longing goes through the night.
Caroline was greater for breaking down the set, wanting to find a look.
Can’t remember days, the days we posses, only the day she left.
I see her in the crucifix, my mind begins to slip.
My love had fallen right to a T.
Then I close my eyes and the tears begin to run, the nightmare has just begun.
Why must I always have to lose with an easy life?
Why cant I, just pretend to fall asleep? no longing goes through the night.</field>

Feel it crawl upon your chest
Bear it's teeth and steal your breath
Stay awake as its creeping close
If you're brave enough you'll see
As it stares it looks a lot like me
It looks like me
Though there's no way I will materialize
Let the ghost that meets your eyes still haunt you, remind you
There's no way to apologize
Your selfish words must float denied like your crime
I float now
We rewind
Draw a line that cannot be crossed
Make a circle out of salt
Knowing it was all your fault
Hide inside, call your doting dogs
As their weak servility
Feeds your emptiness, remember me
In solitude you will sense me
Though there's no way I will materialize
Let the ghost that meets your eyes still haunt you, remind you
There's no way to apologize
Your selfish words must float denied like your crime
I float now
We rewind
Forever feel it as it's gnawing
Forever crawling, ever crawling
Never caring always smiling
Here to feed when you are falling
There's no way I will materialize
Let the ghost that meets your eyes still haunt you, remind you
There's no way, you can't apologize
Your selfish words must float denied like your crime
I float now
We rewind
We rewind
I float now, forever
You did this

I see no reason why I've placed such a value on you, but my thoughts have changed now, I've opened my eyes and now I'm through.
Lookin' back at my short life, the few pleasures that I've found, all your misconceptions pummel me into the ground.
Now, I look at your small life and it doesn't mean a bit
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit.
They say all good things come to an end, I wish this didn't apply.
You were once someone I called my friend but that's all now changed and I don't know why.
Things are very different now
You've got nothing to say
It' s sad when someone you know very well decides to fuckin' die and go away.</field>

I think I want to be...
Balls will roll,
I think it's time,

It's a very big decision,
it's going to change my life.
I'll have to make all new friends,
I 'm gonna lose my wife.
But that's okay with me.
There's something in my soul.
It doesn't matter who's the better man,
it the man who gets to bowl.
I 've made my decision ,
I'm gonna make the change.
There will be rolling balls,
I'm gonna play my game.
It's gonna be so great.
It's gonna be the best, besides,
I've always told myself I look good in a dress.
I'm gonna cut'em off,
I'm gonna cut'em off,
I'm gonna cut'em off.
I'll never have to cough.
Now I've made my change and I've fulfilled my dream.
I'm now a member of the women's bowling team.
I hope I throw a strike,
'cause I'll never score again.
My first game is tomorrow,
I will go to play and then....</field>

The whole world wails.
I feel as though I've been abducted,
Or maybe I am just misplaced,
As I watch these rash hysterics lay to waste the human race.
Just ask them if the sky will open and save us from the truth.
They say that they'd leave today
Just without, without you.
Is this one big joke?
I can only hope.
Say your prayers, they're the final punchline.
I don't see the love
Below or above.
I see you're scared well
I feel fine.
Oh please believe I'm doing just fine.
For what's deceased I shall never grieve.
Just let your faith die.
I feel I have been abandoned.
I alone seem to see disgrace
As I watch these mad dogmatics govern our entire race.
Don't tell them you can walk on water or they may drink your blood.
Why live for pain, in the name
The name of, name of love?
I can only hope
This is in one big joke
With your prayers as the final punch line.
How is it divine
When it's flawed design?
Fill the cracks with faith I can't find.
Screaming for pure love
You venerate
Delusion based in hate
Bleeding from pure love
For this I pray:

But I left here in darkness
And found you, found you on the way
Now...it is silver and silent
It is silver and cold
You in somber resplendence...I hold.
Your sins into me
Oh my beautiful one
Your sins into me
As your rapturous voice escapes I will tremble a prayer,
and I'll beg for forgiveness.
Your sins into me
Your sins into me
Oh my beautiful one
Light...like the flutter of wings
Feel your hollow voice rushing
Into me...as your longing to sing
So I...I will paint you in sliver
I will wrap you in cold
I will lift up your voice as...I sink.
Your sins into me
Oh my beautiful one now
Your sins into me
As your rapturous voice escapes I will tremble a prayer,
and I'll beg for forgiveness.
Your sins into me
Your sins into me
Oh my beautiful one
(Cold in life's throws)
I fall asleep for you
(Cold in life's throws)
I only ask you turn away
Cold in life's throws
I fall asleep for you
Cold in life's throw
I only ask you turn
As you seep
Into me
Oh my beautiful one now
Your sins into me
Oh my beautiful one
Your sins into me
As your rapturous voice escapes I will tremble a prayer,
and I'll beg for forgiveness.
Your sins into me
Your sins into me
Oh my beautiful one
Oh
Your sins into me
Oh my beautiful one
Your sins into me
As your rapturous voice escapes I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
Your sins into me
Your sins into
Your sins into me
Your sins into me
Oh my beautiful one</field>

god tell me, tell me this isn't real!
i can't believe all that i have foreseen is finally happening.
i cannot for a single second stand the way i feel.
i always knew.
i always saw it coming.
enveloped now, encased by my worst fear.
i've never felt the nausea of longing to feel nothing,
i never wanted to cease to exist,
just disappear.
fear memories are all that lie ahead.
never have i felt so lost.
memories dull my senses.
fear tragedy is all that lies ahead.
never have i felt so dead.
once felt so warm, no i'm fucking freezing.
i am the once embraced abandoned one.
i raised my eyes up to the light in hopes of finding healing;
no relief was mine,
i was burnt, by the sun..</field>

For sights seen so commonly
Now I have come to be the walking enmity
Assimilate into a culture
Of post-morality
From what I've seen I hate humanity
Rot with repulsion
I'll write the world a brand new song
Look upon your bleak creation
But is it truly me
That's come to be the human blasphemy?
I'll set the world on fire
And in the burning light
I will write my first love song
And I will feel warmth
Hide your eyes
In heaven in the lies
Believe relieve
I'll end the world tonight
Overwhelmed with deep repulsion
For sights seen so commonly
Now I have come to be the walking enmity
For humanity the human blasphemy
I'll end the world tonight.</field>

As you like, dressed in himalayan white
I'll wait for you some other night dressed
As you like, in himalayan white
Am I loud too much and proud too much?
You wanted me in this stance or on my back
You said I am not read enough, in bed enough
I've given up on romance
I've nothing left for love
I am here

I'm just amused at your quest for attention
through your self abuse.
The only response that you get for your pleasis sorely
less than sympathy.
What reason is there to be alive?
When the word is against you how can you survive?
All your friends are apathetic at best,
and your entire life is a total mess.
Give it a fuckin' rest.
You can't feel me, feel,
I'm scarred so deep.
No one needs me.
Could you please leave me alone?
I'm sorry to hear that your world's sinking fast
and you've lost your stable ground
and I'm sorry to add to your disappointment,
but I won't be brought down.
I'm not angry,
I'm just amused at all the dramatics you love to use,
but one thing I have noticed that is strange to me is
that you're not content until you're brought down,
and you're always so alone because you can't be found.
You're soul is black and you're filled with hate.
How much more can you possible take?
Give me a fuckin' break.

Tell me it's better way up there
I need you
I need you
I need you to tell me
Does it feel the same after healing fame
And all the strange, strange
Strange behavior?
Does it make it worse?
They mispronounce the hurt
I feel so strange
I'm still a stranger
Is there the misunderstanding
That there's hit of healing light?
Tell me the cuts finally stop showing before
We kiss, again, the night
Here in the dark, tripping your picture
I keep rehanging on the wall
I need you better way up there
I need you
I need you better
Does it feel the same?
Would I feel like you?
Because I still feel strange
Are you a stranger too?
I wish it mattered more
But I never will be you
I always feel so fucking strange
Are you a stranger too?

We are the wakeful, wry, watchful.
We're awaiting.
Deathless ones.
A story at three with the shrillest of cries.
My mind fights with the sparkles in the corner of my eyes.
I hear the morning choir sing to me their elegy.
So beautiful.
They sing to me their elegy
Requiem..</field>

Why must you be so missable?
Everything you take,
Makes me more unreal.
Real lines are undefined.
How can this be so miserable?
Under the summer rain, i burnt away.
Under the summer rain, burn!
You turned away.
Listen i can't make.
Make a sound or feel.
Feel fine i kissed the lies,
Why must they be so kissable, oh.
Listen as i break.
Break the fourth wall's seal.
Gorgeous eyes shine suicide
When will we be invisible?
Under the summer rain, i burnt away.
Under the summer rain, burn!
We find a way.
Under the summer rain, i burnt away.
Under the summer rain, burn!
You turned away.
This is the fall,
This is the long way down.
And our lives look smaller now,
And our lives look so small.
Willingly crying.
(living and dying)
This is the fall,
This is the love, went down.
And our lives look smaller now,
And our lives look so small.
Under the summer rain.
I burnt away.
Under the summer rain, burn!
We find away.
Under the summer rain, i burnt away.
Under the summer rain, burn!
We find a way.
Under the summer rain, i burnt away.
Under the summer rain, burn!

Let nothing shade your vision,

Again Never Again But since then we've lost our glow.
They said it hurt their eyes but he would never know that they were filled with
regret as their own dissipated.
He said, "I now feel more desperately alone, even though they wrapped their

Why can't I seem to sort it out?
Why am I always filled with doubt?
So many people everywhere,
so self absorbed without a care.
Of their viral lives,
I'd like to bleed them all.
When all is drained, who shall hold?
When mindless bodies screw tortured souls,
will somebody be there to catch me when I fall?
Why can't I seem to sort it out.
Why am I always filled with doubt.
How could I always be so blind?
Why can't I figure it out.
I could always hope for change,
could always hope to rearrange.
But why not just abandon hope and tear it all apart now?.</field>

crushed velvet, candle wax, dried up flowers
the figure on the bed
all dressed up in roses, calling
beckoning to sleep, offering a dream
the words were as mystical as, purring animals
the circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
the time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
ghost stories handed down, reached secret tunnels below
no one could see me
I fell into yesterday
our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy
the words were as mystical as, purring animals
the circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
the time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
ghost stories handed down, reached secret tunnels below
no one could see me
I fell into yesterday
our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy

the girl on the wall always waited for me, and she was always smiling
the teenage death boys, teenage death girls
and everyone was dancing
nothing could touch us then
no one could change us then, and everyone was dancing
nothing could hurt us then, no one could see us then,
and everyone was dancing, everyone was dancing
no one could see me
I fell into yesterday
our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay

steal away the breath and leave me on my own.
Waiting by the stairs
(Waiting, I despair)
Waiting, I despair
(Waiting by the stairs)
My whole life is a dark room.
One, big, dark room.
Do I hear the hollow sound,
Footsteps resounding on this frozen ground,
Or the familiar disappointment of the echoes of my own?
Waiting by the stairs
(Waiting i despair)
Waiting, I despair
(Waiting by the stairs)
[whispers:]
Somehow I ended up here in between,
Where there is always the comfort,
Of knowing I'll never be seen.
When I fall
When I fall
I wait for just one touch,
And I fall
Weightless,
Endless,
Faithless, I'll adore you.
A single touch, before I fade
Painless let me pass through.

I walk into the raging sea
To drown out this emptiness
It's all you have left for me

            <field name="lyrics">Someone said they saw me fall apart
Part of me collected and destroyed
Tell me what it's like to hold a heart
When it shatters
Someone said that they ran into her
Asked if there was any word of me
And she swore that everything we were
Never mattered
(There is a face beneath the waves)
I will return again
I will return to you
I will return again
I am part of you..
I am
Are you somewhere listening to me?
Have these whispers finally found the cracks?
White walls won't forever keep these screams
They will shatter
Secretly, you know that I'm still here
While you're being held you're so alone
For you killed the only one who cared
Let it shatter
(There is a voice within the walls)
I will return again
I will return to you
I will return again
I am part of you..
I am
What do you do
When my soul invites you?
Oh, you'll see me again
You know this will never end
What do you do
When your heart reminds you?
Oh, you'll put me to death
But I will return again
I will return again
I will return to you
I will return again
I am part of you
I will be with you again, with you again
I will be with you again, I will be with you
I will be with you again, with you again
I will be
I am part of you..
I am</field>

Chrysanthemums of white
They seemed so beautiful.
I can remember, I searched for the amaranth.
I'd shut my eyes, to see.
Oh how I smiled then, so near the cherished ones.
I knew they would appear, saw not a single one.
Oh how I smiled then, waiting so patiently.
I'd make a wish and bleed.
While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
I can remember...dreamt them so vividly
Soft creatures draped in white, light kisses gracing me
I can remember when I first realized dreams were the only place to see them.
While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
Hope was wasting away.
Faith was wasting away.
I was wasting away.
I never, never wanted this.
I always wanted to believe.
Never never wanted this.
I could not help because.
Never Never wanted this.
From the start I'd been deceived.
Never never wanted this.
I could not help because.
I never, never wanted this.
I always wanted to believe.
Never never wanted this.
Never Never wanted this.
From the start I'd been deceived.
Never never wanted this.
Inside a crumbling effigy
(But you promised)
So dies all innocence
(But you promised me)
While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
Hope was wasting away.
Faith was wasting away.

Casting haloes on the moon,

In the heat of the night,The animals scream.
In the heat of the night, Walking into a dream...
Fall fall fall fall, Into the walls.
Jump jump out of time.
Fall fall fall fall, Out of the sky.
Cover my face as the animals cry, In the hanging garden.
Creatures kissing in the rain, Shapeless in the dark again.
In a hanging garden , Change the past.
In a hanging garden, Wearing furs and masks...
Fall fall fall fall, Into the walls.
Jump jump out of time, Fall fall fall fall.
Out of the sky, Cover my face as the animals die.

Burn in the sand with pure intentions.
Right beside me, someone to follow.
For a change, I'll refrain,
From hiding all of me from you.
(here's my lullaby.)
Pray for rain, lose your name.
And watch all your dreams fall through.
(hush now don't you cry.)
I swore to bring my knees come crashing,
When you bury, me.
Today the smoke ran through our mask and.
Hold me, you may, drown me, tomorrow.

Come down.
Come down cold with us.
With me.
I flee to decemberunderground.
As you exhale, I breathe in and sink into,
The water underground,
And I grow pale without you.</field>

Five A.M
on the bathroom floor from the night before.
do you find me dreadful?
What a shame such a sad disgrace,
such a pretty face,
but she's not regretful.
Am I beautiful?
Am I useable?
It's killing time again.
Put on your face and let's pretend,
these killing lights won't kill us all again.
Three A.M
on the city street,
when the air is sweet,
i've had my mouthful.
but it seems that i'm tired of screams
such a pretty face up in will look dreadful.
Am I beautiful?
Am I useable?
It's killing time again.
Put on your face and let's pretend,
these killing lights won't kill us all again.
It's killing time again.
cover your face and we'll pretend,
these killing lights can't kill us all again.
You seem to always remember,
we never forget a face.
when we cut cut cut cut cut cut cut you up,
cut cut cut cut cut they remember.
cut cut cut cut cut cut cut you up.
cut you uppppppppp.
It's killing time again.
Put on your face and let's pretend,
these killing lights won't kill us all again.
It's killing time again.

All by myself, I'm alone in such poor company.
The deeper I think, the deeper I seem to sink,
I can't stop the insects that are feeding,
pull the needles from beneath my skin.
I broke myself, shattered, tied a bow around every piece.
You'll lovely the eyes.
Have they always shown so vacantly?
The more I show the less you'll want to know.
I can't stop the insects that are feeding,
pull the needles from beneath my skin.
Now I'm on display.
I am becoming.
Hurt myself today.
It's all for you.
Do you like, do you like, what I'm becoming?
Cut myself today.
It's all for you.
I part the night, flashing, approaching as I watch you flee.
Pushed through your panes.
Seems I've landed quite uncomfortably.
But as I pass through souls of broken glass
I can't stop the insects that are feeding.
Pull the needles from beneath my skin.
Please don't ask me just what I think, trust me,
you don't want to know.
Please don't ask me to open up, trust me, trust me,

BREAK DOWN!

BURN NOW!

REACH OUT!
And you may take my heart away!
Imperfect cry
Scream in ecstasy
So what befalls the flawless?
Look what i've built
(Please don't do this)
It shines so beautifully.
(Why won't you look at me?)
Now watch as it destroys me.
I left it all behind and never said goodbye.
I left it all behind and never said goodbye.

Once-wishing, wistful eye
Sang high, raise the tide
'Til the sea's mouth dried
There's a missing man

Sickened by these crimes
Sickened by these eyes

It's within me.
Keep it deep within yourself and sink with me.
Last night I had the misfortune to see it all first hand.
"Evacuate the premises" was the innate first command.
What drives the need for all of this?
And will I ever understand?
Has someone failed to tell me of this master plan?
But I keep it deep inside myself.
It's within me.
Keep it deep within yourself and sink with me..</field>

And in the distance there's a gathering,

Pushed to our knees so let us pray,
and all together we'll bring the real rain.
Watch all that's wasted wash away, so let it come.
Our will be done.
Stature retrieved, regain our form.
Break free from instinct that's left us all confined.
From nature we must stray to clarity we'll climb.
Tradition ingrained, now impermissible.
Now comes a call for all to find a brand new evolution.

Don't wanna think about it,

And in the mirror, all midnight eyes.
Oh, if I could remain, but it's just a visit.
All midnight eyes read "vacancy."
Twisted, twisting.
To the lovely dancing lights,
I begged, "May I cut in?"
but they never stopped playing "their song."
Of a joyous song they sing,
I've heard whispers.
On a freezing note, I resonate.
Just like romantic verses,
just like a joyous end,
just like a memory, it twists me.
You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic,
onto the melting boy and melt away.
You light as gently, you're so cinematic.
Bathed in your radiance, I melt.
In the glitter, in the dark,
sunk into velvet praying this will never end.
In the shadow of a star,
in static pallor,
I realized I never began.
All the colors upon leaving will turn to grey..</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Oh !
Calling tears from deep inside,
Oh, you're so exquisite.
And in the mirror,
all midnight eyes.
Oh, if I could remain,
but it's just a visit.
All midnight eyes
read "vacancy."
Twisted, twisting.
To the lovely dancing lights,
I begged, "May I cut in?"
but they never stopped
playing "their song."
Of a joyous song they sing,
I've heard whispers.
On a freezing note,
I resonate.
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end,
just like a memory, it twists me.
You land as lightly as the new snow,
cinematic,
onto the melting boy
and melt away.
You light as gently, you're so..
cinematic.
Bathed in your radiance, I melt.
In the glitter, in the dark,
sunk into velvet
praying this will never end.
In the shadow of a star, in static pallor,
I realized I never began.
All the colors
upon leaving
will turn to grey.</field>

you try to cling so tight to me
but your attempt's in vain
You've less sincerity than the plastic
Paper in rain
The print appears so bright to me
The words remain
I hold it to the light I see right through
So eager to say, "hello", but you don't know me
You just know what you see
Pay the price to see the show but you don't own me
Before you knew would you have felt the same?
Just when I'm inspired
you drain the drive right outta me
and even when I'm tired you push me to perform for you amusement
Just like raging fire, you burn what's left inside of me
and to fulfill your desire, I'd give you light till I burned out
So eager to say, "hello", but you don't know me
You just know what you see
Pay the price to see the show but you don't own me
Before you knew would you have felt the same?
Just when you start to smile
I look into your eyes and see
your veiled denial to express any real emotion
Just wait around a while
you'll lose what you once had for me
I'll be out of style I'll be discarded with the warmth you once feigned
So eager to say, "hello", but you don't know me
You just know what you see
Pay the price to see the show but you don't own me
Before you knew would you have felt the same?.</field>

Imagined heart, I disappear

Well, ask me and I'll swear you were there all along.
Another place?
Another state?
At any rate,
I can't relate.
There's no two ways,
you're a disgrace.
Drown down your fear,
suffocate every spark of clarity.
Your weakness: sickens me, saddens me, strengthens me.
There's no way to free responsibility.
Who's to blame?
Who's in the wrong?
The truth from which you hide - it was you all along.
You were there, you didn't care,
and your heart and mind were self impaired.

Sometimes just waking is surreal.
I walk right through the nameless ones.
I know that hope's unknown.
Sometimes the water feels so real.
As I walk through it fills my lungs, my god, I'm drowning.
This day never seems to end.
This pain, never.
This rage I can not let go.
I hear them calling my name.
I feel them gnawing out holes all throughout the flawless souls.
So alone
Sometimes I swear that I can hear the taunting of the voiceless ones.
I fear that I alone fear those who finally ceased to feel that they're alone
inside this place.
I am the misplaced.
Now every face, it looks familiar...
then every face would melt away until...
now everyone, do you know, I know your deception?.</field>

We held hands on the last night on earth.
Our mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields and under trees,
screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves.
It was empty on the edge of town but we knew everyone floated
along the bottom of the river.
So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea
and the shattered seasons lay,
and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease.
In our cancer of passion you said, "Death is a midnight runner."
The sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide.
We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes
of stars that wore like an antique wedding dress.
The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn
as the ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop.
The few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime.
I kissed you at the apex of the maelstrom and asked
if you would accompany me in a quick fall,
but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't good for two.
I rode alone.
You said, "The cinders are falling like snow."
There is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty,
bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence.
Of blue and grey.
Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city.
The sun was stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon
and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines.
Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward,
and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation scratched
into the earth like a message.</field>

I was to touched to see you clearly,
far too young to realize I had loved so dearly you,

Dying just to see you...
dying since I misconstrued
your blue heart, black eyes,
feigning falling, words I won't forget.
I died right when I saw you
while you shared that cigarette.
Oh I saw you every time I close my eyes,
in the Hughes film I had scored,
produced and starred in, in my mind.
I could recite you, well,
I'd written every line...
but you strayed far from my flawless script
on which I'd spent a lifetime!
Falling over dead.

feigning falling, words I won't forget.

Their aged offererings received and returned,

As the mourning grows.
Unfold before me.
Turn back the page again.
Twenty four hours spent wishing that the day was never ending.
Shadows of glory shading my heart again.
Recall the summer when I left my heart to cool beneath the shadows I'm coming 'round again.

I try, I remain a stranger - not of this time.
I swear I'm almost there though I've been wandering for days.
I may be chasing ghost trains hoping
they'll arrive where we used to play.
I may be hopping ghost trains for
they terminate where we used to play in those days.
I know I'm with strangers
I recognize and I realize my own disowned me.
They were never mind.
I swear I'm almost there.
This is right where we used to play.
I may be chasing ghost trains hoping
they'll arrive where we used to play.
I may be hopping ghost trains for
they terminate where we used to play in those days.
I never will let it go until I find the place I called mine.
I never was truly meant for this time.</field>

Every tear that's fallen brings one thousand floods.
Paper cuts are leaving blood behind.
All the silent laughter ringing piercingly.
I blink making my eyes mine.
Words in their worthlessness,
they should be weighted down,
but do I truly wish their cessation?
Fly.

            <field name="lyrics">{Little Boy-} We held hands on the last night on earth
Our mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields and under trees, screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves
It was empty on the edge of town but we knew everyone floated along the bottom of the river
So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea and the shattered seasons lay, and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease
In our cancer of passion you said, "Death is a midnight runner."
{Davey-} The sky had come crashing down like the new of intimate suicide
We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes of stars that were like an antique wedding dress
The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn as the Ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop
The few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime
I kissed you at the top of the apex of the maelstrom and asked if you would accompany me in a quick fall, but you made me realize that my ticket wasnâ€™t good for two...I rode alone.
{Voice of Unknown man-} You said, "The cinders are falling like snow." there is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty, bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence
Of blue and grey
Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city
The sun has stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines
Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation scratched into the earth like a message..</field>

I wont play the fool,

I only play to win.
I only want what I deserve so who are you tryin' to kid?
You can call it like you see it but I call it like it is.
I'm sick of shruggin' off your petty little ways.
The names are always changing,
in the end it's just a game.
We're runnin' in a circle,
a never ending chase,
you keep on steppin' out of reach but you won't win the race.
No more waitin' around,
no more hangin' around ,
no more draggin' me down.
Everything's so easy for you but I've struggled to get this far.
I'm alone in the fight.
What's wrong, whose right?
I take it all to heart.
Your true colors start to show.
You call yourself a friend?
The teams are drawn,
you chose your side,
you'll get yours in the end.
You play along to the same old song
just as long as you can win,
when someone better comes along,
you're too cool to let them in.
So now I've got you wonderin' if I've got it in for you.
I'd like to tell you different but I can't because it's true..</field>

How can you ever expect someone else to know you

you're someone else?
You keep on sayin' that you want to show me
that you're really different, but your just the same.
If you're really mindless then there is no way
that I can win,
maybe you're just one of them,
or maybe it's just a game.
You lie to yourself and remain alone.
I'm not exactly sure of your motivation.
I'm not exactly sure what you're tryin' to do.
All I'm really sure is that you're not too impressive
and you're wearin' a mask
that I can't see through.
Maybe you're not looking for acceptance,
maybe you're striving for something more.
If it's status that you lust then why try to be one of us?
You're someone we'll never trust 'cause we know the score..</field>

Never shamed but never free
A life to heal the broken heart with all that it could
Lived the life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart
with all that I could
Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away
Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold
A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter to laid the rest
Now and then I try to find a place in my mind
Where you can stay
You can stay awake forever
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away
Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me
Cause as soon as I'm done I'll be on my way
To live eternally
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but its so hard to stay
When I have so much to say and you're so far away....
I love you
You were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you
When He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied
So far away
And I needed to know
So far away
And I need you to
need you to know</field>

is it such a sin
for me to take what's mine
until the end of time
We were more than friends
before the story ends
And I will take what's mine,
create what God would never design
Our love had been so strong for far too long,
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong,
before the possibilities came true,
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears,
conjuring her deepest fears
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times,
I can't believe it,
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes,
Eyes over easy, eat it eat it eat it
She was never this good in bed
even when she was sleepin'
now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in
it goes on and on and on,
I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever,
with a fountain to spray on your youth whenever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
and I know, I know it's not your time
but bye, bye
and a word to the wise when the fire dies
you think it's over but it's just begun
but baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime
we fell apart
let's make a new start
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
but baby don't cry
Possibilities I'd never considered,
are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard,
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave,
to repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fuckin times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it eat it eat it
Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
while you burned in hell, no peace forever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
and I know, I know it's not your time
but bye, bye
and a word to the wise when the fire dies
you think it's over but it's just begun
but baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime,
we fell apart
Let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
But baby don't cry
I will suffer for so long
(What will you do, not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, If it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again
We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing
Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(Yes, I do.)
Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(I do)
I now pronounce you...
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
and I know, I know it's not your time
but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies

There's nothing here for me on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps

Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

(Now your nightmare comes to life)
Dragged ya down below,
Down to the Devil's show,
To be his guest forever,
(Peace of mind is less than never!)
Hate to twist your mind,
But God ain't on your side,
An old acquaintance severed,
(Burn the world your last endeavour!)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air,
'cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head,
You're now a slave until the end of time,
And nothing stops the madness turning,
Haunting, yearning, pull the trigger!
You should have known, the price of evil,
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooooh it's your fucking nightmare!
(While your nightmare comes to life)
Can't wake up in sweat,
'cause it ain't over yet,
Still dancing with your demons,
(Victim of your own creation!)
Beyond the will to fight,
Where all that's wrong is right.
Where hate don't need a reason,
(Loathing self-assassination!)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your site,
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
"Give in with the best intentions help you with your
complications!"
You should have known the price of evil,
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call,
Everybody to fear,
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah.
Ooooh, it's your fucking nightmare, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Fight (fight),
Not to fail (fail),
Not to fall (fall),
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (die),
Die again (die),
Drenched in sin (sin),
With no respect for another
Down (down),
Feel the fire (fire),
Feel the hate (hate),
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (lost),
Hit the wall (wall),
Watch you crawl (crawl),
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices
(calling from above),
And I know they may seem real
(these signals of love),
But our life's made up from choices
(some without appeal),
They took for granted your soul,
and it's ours now to steal
(As your nightmare comes to life!)
You should have known the price of evil,
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear,
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah...
Ooooh, it's your fucking nightmare!</field>

So unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems,
'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place,
just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay,
You'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light,
But girl this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be
Arrived too early
And when I think of all the places
I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life
And realize this is going too far
I don't belong here,
we gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right
to move on and on,
Far away from here!
A place of hope and no pain,
Perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain,
'Cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay,
You'll be back here soon anyway

(with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time
(I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay,
I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind
Gave me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life
I don't belong here,
we gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right
to move on and on,
Far away from here!
Got nothing against you,
and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light,
And I'd hope you might take me back inside
When the time is right
Loved ones back home all crying
'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God
that there's somebody listening
(I am, unbroken)
Give me a chance to be
(I'm chocking)
the person I wanna be
(on this ecstasy!)
(Unbreak me)
Oh Lord, I'll try so hard
(Unchain me)
but you gotta let go of me
(I need another chance to live!)
I don't belong here,
we gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right
to move on and on,
Far away from here!
Got nothing against you,
and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light,
And I'd hope you might take me back inside
When the time is right</field>

Cutting whisper
Rising vapors through
Clouds of gold
Giving fire and
Change the demons
With undercurrents
Far too strong to haul
The sun burnt out today
Fools are dancin' in the rain
Stopped by the acid stain
And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain
Nightfall hunts us all
From the shadows
Cynical beauty now
Lies the host
Before the flicker
There's only blackness
The end is coming
All my friends are dead
The sun burnt out today
Fools are dancin' in the rain
Stopped by the acid stain
And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain
Rid by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the selfish stage
Feeding on the voices in my head
(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)
The unruled hedges we
Turn to someone
All those weeping will
Go unheard
Up on that once green hill
Around the mazes
And seeing the darkness
The jaws will take it slowly
The sun burnt out today
Fools are dancin' in the rain
Stopped by the acid stain
And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain
Rid by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the selfish stage
You're feeding all the voices in my head
You're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head</field>

It's empty and cold without you here,
Too many people to ache over
I see my vision burns,
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
These streets we travel on
Will undergo our same lost past
I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile,
Holding you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come,
But I don't want to leave you
I see my vision burn,
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
(a melody, a memory, or just one picture)
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here,
Too many people to ache over
Newborn life replacing all of us,
Changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here so where should we go?
Will you take a journey tonight,
Follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?
I see my vision burn,
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
(a melody, a memory, or just one picture)
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
Its empty and cold without you here,
Too many people to ache over
Trails in life, questions of us existing here,
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
So, what if I never hold you, or kiss your lips again?
So I never want to leave you
And the memories for us to see
I beg don't leave me
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
Its empty and cold without you here,
Too many people to ache over
Trails in life, questions of us existing here,
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
(silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)
I stand here alone
Falling away from you,
No chance to get back home</field>

When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that you might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real
Still I'm on my way (on and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take
Hey!
I can't live in here for another day
Darkness
Has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on
To faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile
The mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive
I walked the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade (on and on it goes)
Wash my view away
Hey!
I can't live in here for another day
Darkness
Has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on
To faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile
The mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive
Take you down now
Burn it all out
Throw you all around
Get your fucking
Hands off me!
What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knocking
At the wrong gate!
For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
The only deal you'll find
I'll gladly take your soul
While it seems sick
Sober up quick
Psycho lunatic
Crushing you with
Hands of fate!
Shame to find out
When it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside
Inferno awaits!
Evil thoughts can hide
I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin
Release the dark within
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life
Die buried alive</field>

A welcomed change from the abeyance
Of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel I appreciate the time
I'm not alone
(why don't you get my lawyer on the phone)
There were days, these child eyes
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
I found my heart for the first time
And I awakened in me
I left myself to navigate and oh I felt control
(It seems these sheep have quite an appetite)
Who is the crowd
That peers through the cage
As we perform here, upon the stage
As the boy, became a man
In came a calm sophistication
I can hardly understand
So lost in ego
Didn't notice when the time had slipped away
(yeah, everybody's got a sob story)
Jesus christ, was born to die
Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We're simply sociopaths with no communication baby
I see your angle but we differ
From our points of view
(so tell me, what's your cross to bear)
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers just not today
Hope my wheels don't abandon me now
Seein' that I'm out here alone
I'm runnin' out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice
Guiding me to her arms
Mother, I'm alright
It took the birth of sin
To snake-rattle the mind
Before a blow to the head
By the gavel of time to wake up
Won't you wake up?
When did the walking apes
Decide that nuclear war
Was the only solution
For them keeping the score
Just wake up
Can't you wake up?
(Do you know this is just a simulation don't you?)
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage

Tell me a lie in a beautiful way

Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun

Blood is spilled
While holding keys to the throne
Born again, but it's too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid
Let the water throw it's shades of red now
Arrows black out all the lights
Death is riding in the town with armor
They've come to grant you your rights

Do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been living
Life's so reckless, tragedy endless
Welcome to the family
Hey!
There's something missing
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection
Welcome to the family
Not long ago you find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you find yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now, can you look at yourself?
You can't win this fight
In a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight!
Hey kids! (hey kids)
I have to question
What's with the violent aggression
Details blurry, lost him too early
Welcome to the family
Hey!
Why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done, a casualty rerun
Welcome to the family
I try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now, so have you figured it out?
You can't win this fight
And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight!
Here for you and all mankind,
I've lost my mind
Psychotic rounds in to dementia
I won't be fine
I see you're a king who's been dethroned
Cast out in a world you'll never know
Stand there, place your weapon by your side
It's a war the end, we'll surely lose but that's alright
So have you figured it out now, so have you figured it out?
And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight
Deep inside where nothing's fine
I've lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside
I've lost my,
Deep inside where nothing's fine
I've lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside

Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we're built
don't point the blame on me
Scream, Scream, Scream the way you would

            <field name="lyrics">This shining city built of gold,
A far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye round here
Look to the waters of the deep.
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast,
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked.
The Beast and the Harlot
She's a dwelling place for demons,
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine
To fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.
The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen,
Myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once
As her mourners watch her burn.
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world,
Sailors navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss
With her sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot.
She's a dwelling place for demons,
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine
To fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.
The day has come for all us sinners,
If your not a servant you'll be struck to the ground.
Flee the burning, greedy city looking back on her
To see there's nothin' around.
I don't believe in fairytales
And no one wants to go to Hell,
You've made the wrong decision
And it's easy to see.
Now if you wanna serve above or
Be a king below with us you're
Welcome to the city
Where your future is set forever.
She's a dwelling place for demons,
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine
To fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.
She's a dwelling place for demons,
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine
To fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.</field>

Well, I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees

Don't mourn for me, you're not the one to place the blame
As bottles called my name
I won't see you tonight
Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry
while I'm away
Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,

So far away, I'm gone
Please don't follow me tonight.
And while I'm gone, everything will be alright.

When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall
I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confined in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me
Nothing will last in this life
Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze till I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague
Break all your promises
Tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here
Tasting salvation's near
Nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall

These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight, on tonight.
Ooooo?.
Stand up and fight.
The fighting rages on and on, to challenge me you must be strong.
I walk your land but don't belong, two million soldiers can't be wrong.
It's no fun but I've been here before
I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war.
(Not the way I pictured this, I wanted better things)
Some are scared others killing for fun, I shot a mother right in front of her son.
(Take this from my consciousness, and please erase my dreams)
Fight for honor, fight for your life.
Pray to God that our side is right.
Even though we won, I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears,
grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories wont let you cry
unless I don't return tonight.
So many soldiers on the other side, I take their lives so they can't take mine.
(Scared to make it out alive now murder's all I know.)
Nobody tells me all the reasons we're here.
I have my weapons so there's nothing to fear.
(Another day, another life, but nothing real to show for)
Fight for honor, fight for your life.
Pray to God that our side is right.
Even though we won, I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears,
grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories wont let you cry
unless I don't return tonight.
Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise.
Living another day in disguise.
These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight.
Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive.
Stranger's blood on my hands, I've shot all I can
There are no silent nights, watching your brothers all die
To destroy all their plans with no thought of me
No thought of me, no thought of me
Ohhhhhhhhhh....
I walked the city lonely
Memories that haunt are passing by
A murderer walks your street tonight
Forgive me for my crimes, don't forget that I was so young
Fought so scared in the name of God and country</field>

Hey! can't you see
We're tripping on the wire
Walking through the candy land
Of our desires
Press the magic button
And behold the world you crave
Where's the fun in freedom
When it renders you a slave?
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Hey! it goes beyond big brother in the sky
Beyond the threat of martial law
No horus eye
No one came to cuff you
They just handed you the chains
Blind follows the blind
And now the one-eyed man is king
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed
No form of payment
No pot of gold will satisfy
The debt of what he's owed
Spilling from the houses in a trance
The children lined up on the road
Cursing at the piper
As he lured your kids away
And led them to the river
For what was their final day
No need for convincing
On his pipe he played a song to fool them all
Fooled them all
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorn
And now the fire keeps us (keeps us)
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed</field>

Though they took your voice, words forever shine
Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true
As they spoke your fate, a fearless man replied
"As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine"

Reverse the wager I've no means to pay
Toto has pulled back the green tonight
In sight
And blue pills coat with such disdain
I wore the shades for so long
That I've forgotten how to see
The curtain rises
But who dares to pull the strings
I know this may be hard
For you to believe in all
But you only exist because we allow it
I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem
To mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen
A figurine
Can't you hear me scream?
By the way of cosmic rays
A subtle breakdown jarred the code display
A simulation as I can tell, our cell
Playing out a hopeless scene
We stand to lose all our charm
And faith just seems to wane
A billion years can seem
A stunningly short time
You've been beaten down time and time again
But still you find yourself
At the center of it all
I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem
To mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen
A figurine
Can't you hear me scream?
You hear me
You had one thing to do, one thing
And you fucked it up, piece of shit
Nurse, patient 666158 needs to be sedated
We need 500 ccs of Blue Comfort
Oh hello there, dearie
I've been expecting you
Posturing the way I feel
Is truth only what we believe is real?
Marvel the sketches that paint the night
Starlight
And take a breath before it's all erased away</field>

Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds
Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow man
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)
I've had enough
it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone
So, how does it feel to know that someone's kid
in the heart of America has blood on their hands,
Fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain a lifestyle
That insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from we have a special salute
That we aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes
Who spend their days pointing fingers
(Fuck you)
(Shh quiet, you might piss somebody off)
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your
Generous hypocrisy, collecting enemies
Tabloid gossip queen, worthless men
(There's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(Right this way, you dug your own grave)
I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone
All the way from the east to the west
We've got this high society looking down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every direction
Blaming their own nation for who wins elections
They've never contributed a fucking thing
To the country they love to criticize
Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first
(Shh Quiet, you might piss somebody off)
Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow man

Pre-flight demonstration

Hoping you would send a sign
Came a million miles
And the earth grows small
As I lovingly leave it behind
Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you my friend
We seem to have found it
All the hope we've been denied
There's more than we've been told
Had to find it on the other side
Now I must be dreaming
Face against the frozen glass
But there's no return now
And the blazing worlds salute
As we go flying past
Freed of the world
Shed of the weight

            <field name="lyrics">Before the story begins,
is it such a sin
for me to take what's mine
until the end of time
We were more than friends
before the story ends
And I will take what's mine,
create what God would never design
Our love had been so strong for far too long,
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong,
before the possibilities came true,
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears,
conjuring her deepest fears
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times,
I can't believe it,
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes,
Eyes over easy, eat it eat it eat it
She was never this good in bed
even when she was sleepin'
now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in
it goes on and on and on,
I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever,
with a fountain to spray on your youth whenever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
and I know, I know it's not your time
but bye, bye
and a word to the wise when the fire dies
you think it's over but it's just begun
but baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime
we fell apart
let's make a new start
'cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
but baby don't cry
Possibilities I'd never considered,
are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard,
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave,
to repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fuckin times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it eat it eat it
Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
while you burned in hell, no peace forever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
and I know, I know it's not your time
but bye, bye
and a word to the wise when the fire dies
you think it's over but it's just begun
but baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime,
we fell apart
Let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
But baby don't cry
I will suffer for so long
(What will you do, not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, If it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again
We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing
Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(Yes, I do.)
Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(I do)
I now pronounce you...
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
and I know, I know it's not your time
but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
you think it's over but it's just begun

Cleanse us acid rain
Stand near to me
Don't look, be brave
Over the blackened moon
I'll carry you away

So unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems,
'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place,
just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay,
You'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light,
But girl this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be
Arrived too early
And when I think of all the places
I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life
And realize this is going too far
I don't belong here,
we gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right
to move on and on,
Far away from here!
A place of hope and no pain,
Perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain,
'Cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay,
You'll be back here soon anyway
This peace on earth's not right
(with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time
(I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay,
I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind
Gave me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life
I don't belong here,
we gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right
to move on and on,
Far away from here!
Got nothing against you,
and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light,
And I'd hope you might take me back inside
When the time is right
Loved ones back home all crying
'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God
that there's somebody listening
(I am, unbroken)
Give me a chance to be
(I'm chocking)
the person I wanna be
(on this ecstasy!)
(Unbreak me)
Oh Lord, I'll try so hard
(Unchain me)
but you gotta let go of me
(I need another chance to live!)
I don't belong here,
we gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife

Reality
You never stopped to think and you ripped us apart.
How could you? Now our time is gone but it's still breaking my heart.
Tears run down as I think of the days we've had,
And the memories will last forever,
But you and I have died and gone our separate ways.
You are the one.
You are the wrong one.
Breaking the mold.
Going your own way.
All I feel, betrayal.
So much time I've wasted, and I never thought it'd come to this.(3x)
Apology.
We had something great, then it was washed away.
We had something more, then I can explain.
I'm sorry
No! We had something great, then it was washed away.
No! Not all friendships last, the genuine are harder to take.
No! Time to start again, hope someday you'll think of me.

Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right
Can't turn out right
I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
I know, I know.
Dark will turn to light, in time I'll be alright
I know, I know
(I never imagined my life could turn out this way
So cold so black so alone)
Living goes by fast, catch your breath
and it will pass you by.
And it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold.
Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right
Can't turn out right
Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right
Can't turn out right</field>

And the days have not been kind
Once a steady gaze and charming smile
Has been buried in the lines I find
I walk in the noise, quiet employs
And darkness seems to know just where I am
Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
There are words that never found my lips
There are words I'd soon forget
Thought the trick was never to look back
But it seems I've lost my grip, I slip
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow all the bullets bear my name
Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
Took the road but should have chased the stars
Now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago, I know
I struck all the matches stuck in the ashes
Forgive me, won't you simply speak my name
Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow we all found
The warmth of the gun now (x6)
Took the road but should have chased the stars
Now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago (x2)</field>

Gets rid of the pain of being a man
Caught here in a fiery blaze,
Won't lose my will to stay.
I tried to drive all through the night,
The heat stroke ridden weather,
The barren empty sights.
No oasis here to see,
The sand is singing deathless words to me.
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn
(all alone).
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction.
My confidence is leaving me on my own
(all alone).
No one can save me and you know
I don't want the attention.
As I adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights
will take me to new heights.
My hand is on the trigger I'm ready to ignite.
Tomorrow might not make it but everything's all right.
Mental fiction follows me;
Show me what it's like to be set free.
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn
(all alone).
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction.
My confidence is leaving me on my own
(all alone).
No one can save me and you know
I don't want the attention.
So sorry you're not here
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear.
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised
When things aren't what they seem.
Caught here in a fiery blaze,
won't lose my will to stay.
These eyes won't see the same,
after I flip today.
Sometimes I don't know why
We'd rather live than die,
We look up towards the sky
For answers to our lives.
We may get some solutions
But more just pass us by,
Don't want your absolution
Cause I can't make it right.
I'll make a beast out of myself,
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man.
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn
(all alone).
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction.
My confidence is leaving me on my own
(all alone).
No one can save me and you know
I don't want the attention.
So sorry you're not here
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me
But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
I've known it from the start all
These good ideas will tear your brains apart
Scared but you can follow me
I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die</field>

            <field name="lyrics">This shining city built of gold,
A far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye round here
Look to the waters of the deep.
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast,
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked.
The Beast and the Harlot
She's a dwelling place for demons,
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine
To fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.
The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen,
Myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once
As her mourners watch her burn.
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world,
Sailors navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss
With her sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot.
She's a dwelling place for demons,
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine
To fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.
The day has come for all us sinners,
If your not a servant you'll be struck to the ground.
Flee the burning, greedy city looking back on her
To see there's nothin' around.
I don't believe in fairytales
And no one wants to go to Hell,
You've made the wrong decision
And it's easy to see.
Now if you wanna serve above or
Be a king below with us you're
Welcome to the city
Where your future is set forever.
She's a dwelling place for demons,
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine
To fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.
She's a dwelling place for demons,
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine
To fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.</field>

In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do
I feel it burn inside, burning me like the rising sun
Lifted into the sky, took away the only thing I loved
I know after tonight all your power crumbles in my arms
So don't worry, I'll be fine, when my life ends, I'll leave this scar
When I fell down, I needed you there
Every note and every word seems so hard to take
Finally, In destiny
A smoking gun in your hand, now don't you realize what you've done
Put a bullet in his back, your hero since you were so young
How could you kill the man who brought salvation through your pain
He must mean everything to end it all this shameful way
Passion in my eyes, I lived it everyday, but how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do
I started here so young and helped you get along
Just did it for the love, and people healed through us
Don't live you life in vain, don't take it out on me
You're cracked, so just remember, I'm not your enemy
I don't deserve to fall this way, by a man who felt betrayed
I felt so down now you're around to rescue me
Every note and every word i'm listening
Sometimes problems seem too deep to take
Sometimes I cry thinking my future looks so bleak
Finally, together we were destined, I know what's best for us in the end
Someone hear me, someone stop me, someone listen, why aren't you listening?
Passion in my eyes, I lived it everyday, but how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do
In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left to finish you</field>

I don't know where to begin, but I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're followin'
Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit behind the blood between the red
and white and blue but it's too deep for you to see and
everyone eventually will take the step cause it's in sight you
take the left I'll take the right I fell the hate you've built
for me and I say pay attention baby)
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
But it wasn't a sin, a sorry life in judging every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit you forgot
How to speak how to ask all the questions
The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more
I can do from on the outside looking in your government
is listenin' to
push you on the story of immortal father mortal son
give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)
If they had it their way I'd burn in Hell and your future's a fuckin' disaster can't you see
Don't give them all the power when your future's in desperate trouble baby
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact you gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to (run)
Running away from condition, I see you but you're running away from
Your scared seductive system
Most would claim I live a lie when pointing out it's easy
to predict these things
Every color has its side, they live together vote and most
won't read between these lines
Please help us, please save us of course they have control
we're all the same
Up on the cross, crucified their problem drove the nail and let Him rot
Family and friends, it won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder "bout how you sold your mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made will leave you empty
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight
With my mind still intact I'm gonna make it alright
Easier said than done
With no place to hide and having no place to run
You've fallen asleep in denial
Look at the way we're dyin'
How it ends I'll never know
Just live your life blind like me</field>

Behind your back, the time has come, the end is near.
It's when you sleep, so late at night, and in the light, getting prepared.
It's not to help you, but help their cause, under one system,
you wont exist.
They are the few, with all the power,
our system screams, we can't let them tear our hearts out.
Screaming, pulling on our pride.
Stand together for the right cause, one system to our demise.</field>

I lost my final fight to disease, I feel that this is where it ends
I need that shot to enter my vein
My Brompton Cocktail blend
'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle on

In a world so wrong
I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
in a lie...
I'm tired, induced euphoria (induced euphoria)
to help me move along (help me move along)
I wanna meet my maker in peace, I want to feel alive again
So put that smile back on my face and mix it strong my friend

I won't struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong
I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
And I take my life tonight 'cause I have the right to die how I wanna
and leave how I arrived, so alive
I believe my sins have been forgiven
and I believe my choice will save me from this life
please don't question why
my sins have been forgotten
I believe I'll find peace in afterlife
please don't question why
I left this way
'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong
I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong

The first thing that you feel is a rumblin'
The next thing you know everything starts crumblin'
Stumbling and you're trying to escape
So you want to get away from your faith
but you can't but wait!
OH no ain't no discounts
you never want it all yall want the full amount
of the lyrical gumbo not mumbo
when it's stronger then a coffee jumbo
the black buffallo from the GTS
came from my back
and the T on my chest
am I up to the test? aw yes
with my brand new style
so fresh
some folks trying to say I'm old off
showed off
got with my boys and road off
to provide the dust
and tumbleweeds
make way for the buffalo stampede
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
The whole world can change
in the blink of an eye
try not to cry
feel the pain and the pride
and the loneliness
and the phonyness
all I want is the truth
can you show me this?
but you're here to hook beats
your pace quickens
and you're clucking around like chickens
the Buffallo is on a roll
now you know
like I said popo
so tell your momma and them
save your drama for them
tell all your kin folks
your cousins and your friends
and get on over to the Ponderosa
and move your body and your boody
like you know you're supposedta
some folks trying to say I'm old off
showed off
got with my boys and road off
to provide the dust
and tumbleweeds
make way for the buffalo stampede
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
(music break)
one, two, three, four
From Little Big Horn to wounded knee
The trailer kids you'll never find me
and like a cheese boy
you know I'm outlasting
You know I got a hell of a ton of um asking
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Come and see
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness

When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that you might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real
Still I'm on my way (on and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take
Hey!
I can't live in here for another day
Darkness
Has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on
To faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile
The mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive
I walked the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade (on and on it goes)
Wash my view away
Hey!
I can't live in here for another day
Darkness
Has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on
To faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile
The mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive
Take you down now
Burn it all out
Throw you all around
Get your fucking
Hands off me!
What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knocking
At the wrong gate!
For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
The only deal you'll find
I'll gladly take your soul
While it seems sick
Sober up quick
Psycho lunatic
Crushing you with
Hands of fate!
Shame to find out
When it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside
Inferno awaits!
Evil thoughts can hide
I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin
Release the dark within
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life
Die buried alive</field>

Converse behind my back, but now I'm here
Need no one to comply with me though everyone that I defeat
Don't need you, fuck camaraderie, this rage will never go away
Hatred fuels my blood, I'll burn ya down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall, I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone, see it in my eyes
Now I can understand, it's sorrow that feeds your lies
You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breath
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day, the fear in you is here to stay
So get the fuck away from me, and learn to trust the words I say.
Hatred fuels my blood, I'll burn ya down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall, I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone, witness and see it in my eyes
Now I can understand, put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Run from me before I tear you down (be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (it feels so right)
I won't help you, let you rot away (despise what you say)
Run towards the light exposing your soul (we won't be there by your side)
Salvation's dying (somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end, sweet child we'll miss you
No, so far away
I can't trust anyone, witness and see it in my eyes
Now I can understand, put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Falling away, can't buy back time
Burn it down anyway</field>

Silent, you fear, we've got to move higher

Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow
Destroy their perfect crime

away in this land you must go.
Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth.
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit.
(Far away in this land I must go,
out of the site of the One.
A punishment sent from his hand
a hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the site of the One,
away in this land you must go.)</field>

The air is cold and thin
Thoughts are haunting me as I look around
This will never end
And I'll bleed forever
Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far - it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from
Outside shell is strong - confident
But slowly eats away
Like a man plagued with disease, I try to fight
Through my pores it seems to seep...
And I'll bleed forever
Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far - it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from
And you sit there and do nothing
You're content with doing nothing
There's nowhere to run and hide
when you're living to die
Stuck alone inside your head,
better off dead
The phone would ring in the empty house,
no one's around.
Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far - it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from
But in my life, I wanted more,
I needed more, I taste more</field>

Searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas
Fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies
I've stood in hell
Where many had to suffer
I stared the devil in the eyes
Walked many roads
To witness ancient idols
And found the great Gates of fire
Had many storms
Question my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise
The hangman's searching
For bones he can borrow
while I scaped in the night
Fight or flight!
Live again
All roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
Cause on this night
I'll be coming home
I escaped the hail
Of calculated mortars
then drunk the blood of a king
A desert rain
has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me
So it seems
Live again
All roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
Cause on this night
I'll be coming home
(Solo)
My story ends
Not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world
Through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is
I've been told
So I go
Live again
All roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
Cause on this night
I'll be coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home</field>

Answering the call
Came a modern messiah to save us all
Something far beyond the work of fiction
Positronic brain
A world that's void of all the anguish
And suffering, pain
Better tame your convictions
Before you go and open the cage
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god
Unsure of what we'll find
Never held a high regard for darwin
Selection takes too long
A little kick in the pool
Shouldn't do us wrong
Devouring the very last
Invention man would ever need
But exponential growth
Is a frightening thing, indeed
Sweet bohemian jury rounded up
And hung in the streets
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god
Unsure of what we'll find
Sometimes when I look up
To the sky I have to wonder
Are we "summoning the demon" you and I?
Have you noticed
That I'm needin' it more now
More than it needs me
Got a couple of billion
That seem to agree
Surfing in an artificial dimension
But we're not alone
Now the master has become
Just a stepping stone, oh
Like a blow to the ego
The bitter pills are harder to take
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find
We're creating god, in search of the divine
We're creating god

I've been wrong times over

Walk with me, crimson day
Don't speak, no use for words
Lie in my arms, sleep secure
I wonder what your dreaming of
Lands rare and far
A timeless flight to reach the stars
A lifetime full of words to say
I hope that time will slow the passing day
I've been wrong times over
And I've been shamed with no words to find

I've come so far to meet you here
To share this life with the one I hold so dear

Is for you, for you

Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds
Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow man
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)
I've had enough
it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone
So, how does it feel to know that someone's kid
in the heart of America has blood on their hands,
Fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain a lifestyle
That insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from we have a special salute
That we aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes
Who spend their days pointing fingers
(Fuck you)
(Shh quiet, you might piss somebody off)
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your
Generous hypocrisy, collecting enemies
Tabloid gossip queen, worthless men
(There's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(Right this way, you dug your own grave)
I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone
All the way from the east to the west
We've got this high society looking down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every direction
Blaming their own nation for who wins elections
They've never contributed a fucking thing
To the country they love to criticize
Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first
(Shh Quiet, you might piss somebody off)
Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow man

I've had enough

So lost till I stumbled upon
Two roads in front of me I had to take my time
To the right I can see a church,
I took a step in that direction first
But to the left there was a watering hole
Where they were whisky drunk and now that's where I wanna pray
So far down here just holding on
If I was perfect the answer would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walk through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize its difficult but now I can see
There's gotta be another way to go,
A way that's much more feasible
A combination of all these lies,
To set your path without choosing a side
I make decisions one at a time
And no I never say I'm always right
I'm confident that when I stand on my own
You'll see the truest form of a man when I'm shining through
So far down here just holding on
If I was perfect the answer would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walked through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize its difficult but now I can see
Oh I hear it now, all the religious rhythms
The left isn't better, its just more of the same
Condemning all these people for what they believe
I'll climb to the top of their mountain again
No one is going to save me this way
And the closer to the top I get the more they take aim
But I'm not you,
I may not be perfect but I've always been true
I may not be worthy in your eyes
Climb up from the bottom for the last time,
The last one, the last one, the last time
If I was perfect the answer would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walked through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize its difficult but now I can see</field>

All fear has been avoided
You say the words and my weapon is drawn
This one could be my last time
Some people call it war crime
I may be staring down a lethal sight
(To die)
Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering a man should never know
Leaving my faith on the danger line
I do this for my family
My daughter loves her daddy
Too many talk down on things they don't know
With colors never faded
Reckless and unabated
They may take me but never take us all
(I'll crawl)
Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering a man should never know
Leaving my faith on the danger line
I know what you're thinking
I've been there before
So think of the times, the time we spent laughing away
So think of the times at home
(Life without a care)
Now I find myself in my own blood
(Never thought I'd lay in my own blood)
The damage done is far beyond repair
I never put my faith in up above
(Never had much faith in up above)
But now, I'm hoping someone's there
I never meant to leave this world alone
I never meant to hurt the ones who cared
And all this time I thought we'd just grow old
You know, no one said it's fair
Tell my baby girl that "It's alright"
I've sung my last song today
Remind the lord to leave his light on for me
I'm free</field>

The smell of fall.
Changing season.
The graveyard is alive, black cat across my path,
the chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead.
Imprisoned souls.
Trapped for eternity.
Black crows break the silence.
The garden of the dead's alive tonight and you can not stop it.
Just enjoy it.
Open up your mind and you will feel it too.
The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.
You can feel the thoughts of the dead.
Feeling the thoughts of the dead.
True or false, it's still there, teaching me.
True or false, still there, teaching me.
You can feel it tonight.
The wood has rotted away.
Take the time absorb it.
Their time is slipping away.
Stone all carved by hand.
Statues that resemble their faces.
They still breathe.
Come join us.
Smell the burning ember's, time flickering away.
Timeless but soon gone.
Timeless but soon gone.
I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts.
As time crumbles away.</field>

Miles away from those I love,
purpose is hard to find
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
Can't help but wish that I was there
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
to hold her when I'm not around,
when I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again
There's nothing here for me on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps
and all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
to hold her when I'm not around,
when I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again
Some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
When hope begins to fade...
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love
Purpose is hard to find
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is

How quick I'd wash it down the drain
Past tense the future, nothing matters now
I act on my own and I'm to blame
Live in a wicked dream, with angst turned out all wrong
Were all so weak, no matter how strong, yeah
I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally, Demons they follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for obscenity, all a part of me
I don't like that you're calling me a liar
I don't like that you found out I'm a snake
Been sneaking around for far too long now
I don't like how fast my intentions fade
Karma has beat me down, but the worst is yet to come
Many mistakes and still I'm so young, yeah
I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally, Demons they follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for obscenity, all a part of me

Count how many times
Awakened in fear, nightly
Palms sweating
Dreams
Where promises are made
To no one but myself
Help him
Crushed daily
Don't lend me your hand
I can't trust my self
So how can you trust me
We've all made selfish, bad decisions
We've all tried dishing out the blame
Convinced our selves of our own actions
My problem is I'll never change
In doubt, some good comes out
I'll fold before its time
Can't promise you that its my last time, yeah
I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally, Demons they follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for obscenity, all a part of me
Truth won't help you now
All the loves gone too far
Truth won't help you now
All the loves gone too far
I'm scarred, yeah
Demons they follow me, 'cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah
Demons they follow me, 'cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah

Never asked you to like me,
I don't want your praise (we won't play your games)
Look down on me, spit in my face,
you're nothing to me:not to me
Darkened eyes you'll see,
there is no hope, no savior in me
(don't look this way, don't breathe this way,
don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by, no one will care,
what happens to me
(don't look this way, don't breathe this way,
don't stare this way, anymore)
My presence won't be ignored, no not today
Don't walk in my direction, turn the other way
(don't look my way for help,

Asking questions, predetermined answers,
you won't find them here (we don't want your opinion)
And I don't want you, I won't let you think,
compromise is near
'Cause it's not near.
I'm alone in here
No more feelings
Killed my fears
Don't ask
you'll never know
you're left behind and I'll be exposed
Far away, you keep on trying...
Holding me down, breaking away,
trying to distance my life.
Not one in the crowd, but one with the answer
the one that could change your mind
But it's not true, I don't know you
Don't waste your time, and don't waste mine
I'm not your friend, I won't soothe your soul
And in the end you're all dead to me....</field>

If walls could talk to spill the lies
We see the world through devil's eyes
I maintain an addiction
Been known to take it too high
I got an itch with a loaded hair trigger
And a one way ticket to fly
When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devil start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
After all, everybody's doin' their time
Caught your eye in the corner
Don't you look at me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter
Gotta fix what don't belong
I see the writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devil start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
After all, everybody's doin' their time
That's just the price to play
So tell me what you like
Got a hand on the kerosene match tonight, right
Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval and a dollar
Got a pretty little body to grind
I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devil start to crawl

Seems the ghost is in your stall
For a thousand years
Taured lived within us all
I've come from somewhere beyond
Lost in a world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine
Here in '54
Tastes the napalm fill the sky
Axis wins the war
Seems the crop of our divide
I've slipped through bodies aligned
Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine
All that's me and all that's you
All that's false and all that's true
On the sea you sailed away
Another you'd surely stay
It's only fabric so it seems our intimate reality
We're living simultaneously while parallel in possibility
Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine
Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Black enchanting eyes,
cut through my heart
with no regret or sign of life
They tear apart my pride
and cold runs through my veins
I feel their stare from miles
haunting every step
and they won't stop hunting me down
I know the time will come,
when all around me's burned
and you'll still see me there
Asking where you went too
and what person brought you here
And why you left the burning children
cold out in the night
and calling for you all alone...
Dark in their hearts,
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down
Holding me down
They'll find you alone
and your desperate and villainous ways
Turning their hearts into stone
they seek more than vengeance
Look in their eyes your pain is their satisfaction
Look in their eyes and see the darkness take hold
I'm controlled by fate (waiting for)
Tired of your parade (waiting for)
No sign of vengeance (waiting for)
Burn for the rest of time (waiting)
Hear the haunting words (They'll find you alone)
lost children with no heart are crying (Turning their hearts into stone)
and you're the lost mother they're calling
Go now, run and hide (seek more than vengeance)
I hear them crying at night (your pain is their satisfaction)
outside when the planets are falling (for the rest of time)
They want to feel and know you hear them (Go now, run and hide)
Dark in their hearts,
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down
(holding me down)
Go now
Run and hide
Eternal rest in time
Eternal rest in time</field>

In our reflection we learn to fly
No hand to hold us
No one to save us from tomorrow
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
No light to follow
A shot in the dark
Does anybody know?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
High from the heavens
I can't see the pain
Does anybody care?
Think for a moment of all the lives
Stripped of their essence before their time
We stand to conquer
But is there nothing left tomorrow?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
No light to follow
A shot in the dark
Does anybody know?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
High from the heavens
I can't see the pain

with your wooden sword so mighty.
You're St
George or you're David and you always
killed the beast.
Times change very quickly,
And you had to grow up early,
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies
at your feet.
You'll die as you lived
In the flash of a blade,
In a corner forgotten by no-one.
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel,
One man, and his Honour.
The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the
fencing master's call.
He taught you all he never knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil men.
You'll die as you lived
In the flash of a blade,
In a corner forgotten by no-one.
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel,
One man, and his Honor.
You'll die as you lived
In the flash of a blade,
In a corner forgotten by no-one.

Lost in yesterdays realm.
Drained with confusion.
Where did it all go?
Look into the past, look into their faces.
Never, the thought of being time fucked.
But now they're all gone
And all that' left is this blank faced picture.
Ninety percent, nothing was done, nothing accomplished,
coasting through life didn't seize the day.
No one ever realized that they're already dead.
By the time you realize, you'll be dead too.
Without another chance to save the world,
these things they're gone, your gone, forgotten.
Now your face in my picture frame.
It's gone, forever.
Right before my very eyes.
And just when I thought I made light of things.
It slips away, into darkness.
My life passes now I see.
Just what this world does hold for me.
It's getting hard, harder to breathe.
Am I out of time is that what this means?
Well that's what it means.
That's what it means, you and me try to breathe.
Now you
Realize.
Your life, flies by.
Now I
Realize.
My life, I die.</field>

That comes alive when you take off her clothes
Theres no tellin' just where she's been
Ask around but no one seems to know
Late at night when you're looking for sin
Call her up and she'll lay down the law
You can't trust her cause she'll lie to your face
But that's now why you gave her a call
Awaits deep inside
The lust and burning desire
We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, 'till we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
'Cause shes here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About the girl I know
Another thing about this girl I know
She's more confortable down on her knees
Went to school, got a job, and then she's shot into hell
All 'cause shes born to please
Don't get her mixed up 'cause she knows what she likes
Can tell the difference between right and wrong
She knows you're watching every one of her moves
Just more reason to string you along, yeah
Awaits deep inside
The lust and burning desire
We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, 'till we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
'Cause shes here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About the girl I know
The first time's hard enough
But you made it through
The second time, I see the changes in you
She's got you somehow
You're needing her now
Yeah!
We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, 'till we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
'Cause shes here for you

Hey! can't you see
We're tripping on the wire
Walking through the candy land
Of our desires
Press the magic button
And behold the world you crave
Where's the fun in freedom
When it renders you a slave?
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Hey! it goes beyond big brother in the sky
Beyond the threat of martial law
No horus eye
No one came to cuff you
They just handed you the chains
Blind follows the blind
And now the one-eyed man is king
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed
No form of payment
No pot of gold will satisfy
The debt of what he's owed
Spilling from the houses in a trance
The children lined up on the road
Cursing at the piper
As he lured your kids away
And led them to the river
For what was their final day
No need for convincing
On his pipe he played a song to fool them all
Fooled them all
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorn
And now the fire keeps us (keeps us)
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed</field>

Born again, but it's too late to atone

Dare escape and learn the price to be paid

As I lovingly leave it behind
Freed of the world
Shed of the weight

We seem to have found it
All the hope we've been denied
There's more than we've been told
Had to find it on the other side
Now I must be dreaming
Face against the frozen glass
But there's no return now
And the blazing worlds salute
As we go flying past

Please don't follow me tonight.
And while I'm gone, everything will be alright.

Essence left my heart tonight

Look at the face you pierced with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
He's gone
Nothing will take back time.
I need him back, but nothing will take back time.
I can see just fine,with you in my life,
there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
a nightmare full of sorrow.
Nightmare, full of pain!
Nightmare, full of pain!
I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll
Take away
Take away!
TAKE AWAY!
TAKE AWAY!!!

or cry while I'm away
Look at the face you pierced with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
He's gone
Nothing will take back time.
I need him back, but nothing will take back time.
I can see just fine,with you in my life,
there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
a nightmare full of sorrow.
I can see just fine,with you in my life,
there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
a nightmare full of sorrow.</field>

I'm not crazy (Cause I got none)
Well that's not true, I've got a bed and a guitar
And a dog named dog who pisses on my floor
That's right, I've got a floor
So what, so what, so what?
I've got pockets full of kleenex and lint and holes
Where everything important to me just seems to fall
right down my leg
and on to the floor
My closest friend linoleum
Linoleum
Supports my head, give me something to believe
That's me on the beachside combing the sand
Metal meter in my hand
Sporting a pocket full of change
That's me on the street with a violin under my chin
Playing with a grin, singing gibberish
That's me on the back of the bus
That's me in the cell
That's me inside your head
That's me inside your head</field>

Testing what I know.
Lips soaked in deceit.
Pull me from here.
No one's innocent.
So why do I feel bad?
But guilt keeps creeping, creeping up on me.
Guilt
Tearing me up inside.
The innocent.
An evil in disguise.
The face of beauty to fall for.
I fall to my knees, deceitful.
Brought down by feelings of regret.
Again your mind has failed the test.
Not everyone feels the same.
Pacifist blinded by the game.
Stand tall
They'll break your heart.
Stand tall
They'll smash your ego.
Stand tall
They'll tear you down.
Stand tall
Scar your soul.
Break your thought.
Fuck your mind.
The mark I breathe on you.
It's burning through your soul.
The breath I waste.
Losing control.
I bleed in pain.
Testing what I know.
Lips soaked in deceit.
Pull me from this hole.

War in our blood, some things never change
Fighting for land and personal gain
better your life, justify our pain
The end is knocking
The end is knocking
We've all been lost for most of this life
(lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain’t right
(most of us just ain’t right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride
How many lives will we take
How many hearts destined to break
Nowhere to run, can't escape
Full of ourselves, tied to our fate
The end is knocking
The end is knocking, yeah
We've all been lost for most of this life
(lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain’t right
(most of us just ain’t right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride
With peace of mind so hard to find
We're dwelling on the drastic signs
Another way to numb our mind
And as you close your eyes tonight
and pray for a better life
you’ll see it flying helplessly away
We've all been lost for most of this life
(lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain’t right

I'm living with a hole inside
A piece of me that I have yet to find
The edge of reason, Lies uneven
Turn me off, feel the blood so cold
It's like a product that was bought in salt
Asking me for the impossible
I ain't waiting for a miracle
I ain't waiting for the world to change
Under my skin lives the reason
Under my armor I've lost it all
No more pain
No saviour made of born design
Fool me before I tell ya not this time
Rape my body, Lost my vision, Lost my mind
I had to let it go
Another day living irrational
Another day inside this dying soul
I ain't waiting for a miracle
I ain't waiting for the world to change
Under my skin lives the reason
Under my armor I've lost it all
There's something in your eyes
A part of me that I recognise
I want to let you know
We'd be there if we could and it's alright
You taught me how to feel
It's no wonder I'd do anything
Tell me why'd you have to go
With the ones that come last are the best I know
At times, It seems that we've lost it all
Burn it all
Burn it to the fucking ground
Believe the words that I don't want me around
Life with vision, indecision
World collision and heads will roll
With nothing left except but the pain to show
Mental imagery on the floor
I ain't waiting for a miracle
I ain't waiting for the world to change
Under my skin lives the reason
Under my armor I've lost it all</field>

Living another day in disguise.
These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight, on tonight.
Ooooo?.
Stand up and fight.
The fighting rages on and on, to challenge me you must be strong.
I walk your land but don't belong, two million soldiers can't be wrong.
It's no fun but I've been here before
I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war.
(Not the way I pictured this, I wanted better things)
Some are scared others killing for fun, I shot a mother right in front of her son.
(Take this from my consciousness, and please erase my dreams)
Fight for honor, fight for your life.
Pray to God that our side is right.
Even though we won, I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears,
grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories wont let you cry
unless I don't return tonight.
So many soldiers on the other side, I take their lives so they can't take mine.
(Scared to make it out alive now murder's all I know.)
Nobody tells me all the reasons we're here.
I have my weapons so there's nothing to fear.
(Another day, another life, but nothing real to show for)
Fight for honor, fight for your life.
Pray to God that our side is right.
Even though we won, I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears,
grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories wont let you cry
unless I don't return tonight.
Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise.
Living another day in disguise.
These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight.
Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive.
Stranger's blood on my hands, I've shot all I can
There are no silent nights, watching your brothers all die
To destroy all their plans with no thought of me
No thought of me, no thought of me
Ohhhhhhhhhh....
I walked the city lonely
Memories that haunt are passing by
A murderer walks your street tonight
Forgive me for my crimes, don't forget that I was so young
Fought so scared in the name of God and country</field>

Clouds of gold
Giving fire and

Stopped by the acid stain
And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain
Nightfall hunts us all
From the shadows
Cynical beauty now
Lies the host
Before the flicker
There's only blackness
The end is coming
All my friends are dead
The sun burnt out today
Fools are dancin' in the rain
Stopped by the acid stain
And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain
Rid by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the selfish stage
Feeding on the voices in my head

(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)

The unruled hedges we
Turn to someone
All those weeping will
Go unheard
Up on that once green hill
Around the mazes
And seeing the darkness
The jaws will take it slowly
The sun burnt out today
Fools are dancin' in the rain
Stopped by the acid stain
And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain
Rid by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the selfish stage

Another story with a mangled scene
It couldn't happen any other way
You wanna talk about it?
I'm begging you to walk in my shoes any time
Watch the clock 'til you unwind
You wanna cry about it?
It's making me consider that I lost my mind
The way I see, you must be blind
So this is the world you left behind
This is the guilt that consumes you
So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you
Can't bribe me with money
Can't shower me with shame
Another killer from a broken home
Until you cover me with maniac fame
You wanna know about it?
Well I'mma be fucking with you every time
Story broken, you're behind
And when you ask about it
You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
Seems we all have friends to find
So this is the hate I've been born to
Full of the tales of the untrue
So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you
And I'm waiting
Waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
(and all the promises I'll find)
No hesitating,
You've pulled the trigger now your story's left behind
I know you want to see me fry,
Like my soul you won't survive
So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you
To die unknown
Would crush the fish lens we all see through
To kill the glare
Expose the ugliness we hold true</field>

(Now your nightmare comes to life)
Dragged ya down below,
Down to the Devil's show,
To be his guest forever,
(Peace of mind is less than never!)
Hate to twist your mind,
But God ain't on your side,
An old acquaintance severed,
(Burn the world your last endeavour!)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air,
'cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head,
You're now a slave until the end of time,
And nothing stops the madness turning,
Haunting, yearning, pull the trigger!
You should have known, the price of evil,
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooooh it's your fucking nightmare!
(While your nightmare comes to life)
Can't wake up in sweat,
'cause it ain't over yet,
Still dancing with your demons,
(Victim of your own creation!)
Beyond the will to fight,
Where all that's wrong is right.
Where hate don't need a reason,
(Loathing self-assassination!)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your site,
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
"Give in with the best intentions help you with your
complications!"
You should have known the price of evil,
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call,
Everybody to fear,
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah.
Ooooh, it's your fucking nightmare, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Fight (fight),
Not to fail (fail),
Not to fall (fall),
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (die),
Die again (die),
Drenched in sin (sin),
With no respect for another
Down (down),
Feel the fire (fire),
Feel the hate (hate),
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (lost),
Hit the wall (wall),
Watch you crawl (crawl),
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices
(calling from above),
And I know they may seem real
(these signals of love),
But our life's made up from choices
(some without appeal),
They took for granted your soul,
and it's ours now to steal
(As your nightmare comes to life!)
You should have known the price of evil,
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear,
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah...
Ooooh, it's your fucking nightmare!</field>

Evil yours, now evil mine
So I robbed you blind
The voices in my head could jest
A less than peaceful side
The endless possibilities

You can't break me
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't save me
Barriers our trust will fade
I've stood in the dark
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead
I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die
Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all
Help me, make me crawl
To daddy's little girl
To read the writings on the wall
While cast into the nothingness
The final curtain call
You can't break me
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't save me
Barriers our trust will fade
I've stood in the dark
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead
I'm trying to survive, I'm not ready to die
Through the madness we find
Loyalty is no match for power
Say goodbye to your life, left to rot in
Your darkest hour
Friends won't help you now as long as your mine
You can't break me
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't save me
Barriers our trust will fade
I've stood in the dark, been
Waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive
And I'll control the world one
Person at a time
As I damn the dead
I'm trying to survive, I'm not ready to die

I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way.
Don't tell me it's too late,
Cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
And let others lead the way.
Some searching to find
That life with a new piece of mind.
And still we push further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.
Some feel that life's a favour,
While some don't have the time.
Wash up and kiss the alter,
All hail the mighty father,
But love will keep you blind.
Same questions we keep asking,
Won't hear the answers
Cause we're scared of what we'll find
We try and compensate through our troubled faith
That should keep us safe
And keep searching for a sign.
Some searching to find
That life with a new piece of mind.
And still we march further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.
There wont be another day, no changing of the seasons,
And no one's gonna save us from the lies.
The greatest story ever told,
Is only what you make it.
There will be struggle and fear,
All by design
And still we march further away (we've been so logicated)
Singing our songs of yesterday
(nothing's got all the point, the blame?)
While so much still stands in our way (yeahhhh!)

A bullet sunk straight through my skull
A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
No pain as I awoke, but dead
Seeing the face of the man
The time as he lays down his gun
I knew this was going to take place
White silence, so peaceful, so numb
No one knows the time they're changing
No one will see through:
You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my Mother shed tears
(and taste the blood she cries
and taste the blood she cries)
No:This gun has stopped time in its tracks
Has altered the course of my fate
Destiny is shattered and timeless
Closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace
I'll watch you call, calling for me,
you can't bring back time...
Close your eyes or look away,
fate exposed and won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
descending entity in me
My voice has been taken from me.
The more I listen, the more I have to say.</field>

There's a bed of skeletons waiting for me,
on the other side
They're waiting for my next move (next fatal breath)
Human lives to me seem so unreal, can't see through the fog
(nothing past a grey wall) see past the stereotype
Belief, structure built up in you.
I'll tear you down and the one who created you
If they didn't have One how would they act?
If we didn't have hope how would we behave?
Would they still feel remorse
if they slaughtered innocent beings?
Or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane?
A good friend once told me we are our memory
without them we equal nothing
And all I can see is the place I wanna be
Sudeenly my life was so free
Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
their echoes are reaching my ears
Nights coming fast, suns going down
But keep away from me..
keep away from me
(it's hard, to keep me in this place, keep away from me)
We may have created the beginning, mentally
We may have created the beginning, physically
To the end of our human existence...

Nights coming fast, suns going down - confused
I don't know the answers but neither do you</field>

comploratus
Silens, oro
Regnet exitium
Days of warning
Night brings morning
My prayers worthless
Heaven is burning down
I walk stricken
Pitch black vision
Oh One, save me
Caress my weary eyes
Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames
In flames
In flames
In flames
Grant them eternal rest,
oh, lord Embrace them
into your army of undead
Strike with vengeance
those who oppose your will
And lay waste
to all the opposition set before you
Walk with them and shield
them from the blinding
light of servitude
And devastate your enemies
as they die by your hand
Amen
Nature quaking
Prophets aching
I kneel faithful
Damnation cracks the sky
My heart fiction
Superstition
Your grace deathless
Give life to my last breath
Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames
In flames
In flames
In flames
Rise from ashes
Violence clashes my soul vacant
Cleanse me of all this sin
I stand guilty
I bleed filthy
Born of fire
Savor this final hour
Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames
In flames
In flames

All the fame is implied
With no fortune unseen
Sell the rights

Time-machine
While I'm dulled by excess
And a cynic at best
My art imitates crime
Paid for by
The allies
So invest
Now I'm finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes
Mesmerized
There's a vintage thirst returning
But I'm sheltered by my channel-surfing
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo
A tribute to false memories
With conviction
Cheap imitation
Is it fashion or disease?
Post-ironic
Remains a mouth to feed
Sell the rights
To your blight
And you'll eat
See the vintage robot wearied
Then awakened by revision theories
Every famine virtual

Shine forever true
Shared with us the world well, before your time
Though they took your voice, words forever shine
Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true
As they spoke your fate, a fearless man replied
"As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine"

They all know, they all know!
Sorry, did I wake your dream?
Some questions run too deep
We only, only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we'd find
Lost our way tonight
Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?
Save me - I'm trapped in a vile world
Save me - Where the ending's all the same as every
other
We're only here to die
Save me - I'm losing my only dream
Save me - I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me, let me know
They all know, they all know!
Ever since the day you left my fates been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight,
so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?
Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?
Save me - I'm trapped in a vile world
Save me - Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me - I'm losing my only dream
Save me - I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me, let me know
If you hear me, let me know
Help me find my way
Said help me find my way
No pulse inside of me
Stone cold lips and heresy
All lies and to a degree
Losing you I wanna be, oh
You'll find out right now,
He may be out of his mind, but someday you will find
That sanity has left us all blind,
and dragged us all behind
A moment seen through those eyes, crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die,
I say it just moves on
If you'd only open your mind,
then someday you will find
Insanity left us behind,
and walked right through the door
I can see the picture's clear as yesterday, pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay,
but know you're not alone
Save me - I'm trapped in a vile world
Save me - Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me - I'm losing my only dream
Save me - I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me, let me know
If you hear me, let me know
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die
Tonight we all die young</field>

Woke animal feelings in me
Took over my sense and I lost control
I'll taste your blood tonight
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
but know it's too late you've wasted all your time
Relax while you're closing your eyes to me
So warm as I'm setting you free
With your arms by your side there's no struggling
Pleasure's all mine this time
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
but know it's too late you've wasted all your time
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure unmask your desire perishing
We've all had a time where we've lost control
We've all had our time to grow
I'm hoping I'm wrong but I know I'm right
I'll hunt again one night
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby

Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
perishing
Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we're built
don't point the blame on me
Scream, Scream, Scream the way you would
if I ravaged your body
Scream, Scream, Scream the way you would
if I ravaged your mind
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring

We keep writing, talking and planning
but everything's changing
We all know what to do but know one does it
Now this time has passed and full of regret
Two in my heart have left me a while
I stand alone
When they get back, it won't be the same
Never be the same
My life, you've always been there
Now you're gone and my heads spinning
Left the childhood, left the memories
left the good times in the past
Moving on your time has run out
Wishing the clock would stand still
the world can wait
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends
[Chorus]
As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night
Never will I forget you, and all the memories past
So rarely I get to see your face
Growing I looked to you in guidance
We knew that time would kill us
but you're still so close to me
To me you were my life
To me you were my soul companion
Now you are so far away
Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had
Come back - to the days when we were young
Come back - to the days when nothing mattered
I feel time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night
As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night</field>

But I'm too young to worry
These streets we travel on
Will undergo our same lost past
I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile,
Holding you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come,
But I don't want to leave you
I see my vision burn,
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
(a melody, a memory, or just one picture)
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here,
Too many people to ache over
Newborn life replacing all of us,
Changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here so where should we go?
Will you take a journey tonight,
Follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?
I see my vision burn,
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
(a melody, a memory, or just one picture)
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
Its empty and cold without you here,
Too many people to ache over
Trails in life, questions of us existing here,
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
So, what if I never hold you, or kiss your lips again?
So I never want to leave you
And the memories for us to see
I beg don't leave me
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
Its empty and cold without you here,
Too many people to ache over
Trails in life, questions of us existing here,
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
(silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)
I stand here alone
Falling away from you,
No chance to get back home</field>

I'll miss you very much.
Room with empty bottles, broken dreams,
and pride still running high, always on your side.
But I wanted more for you.
You can't go on this way.
And now I see it all fall through.
We pray for better days.
Stuck alone and scared.
Throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.
I don't want to see you like this.
We all tried to save you but missed.
I still feel the hope on your road.
Now come back to us like the days of the old.
I still feel you there, trying to get on top.
You'll always have my support, in my heart.
People you've hurt.
Friends that you've lied to.
But we understand, and that's not (you) can see the end of the road,
I can see it too, for you, I'm scared, if I lose you, I'm not prepared.
This time, if you die.
I watch you, right before my eyes.
Just trust me, and listen.
You have no self control.
This will take your life.
Overdose and then indulge until you die.
Pondering, we all ask the question why.
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad.
And we are left the only family that you've ever had.
Overdose and then indulge until you die.
Pondering, we all ask the question why.
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad.
And we are left the only family that you've ever had.
I wanted more for you.
You can't go on this way.
And now I see it all fall through.
We pray for better days.
Stuck alone and scared.
Throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.
Help you see it through.
Fight this me and you.
Reaching deep inside.
Problems not just you is what we find.
Our friendship makes it mine.</field>

So my intentions are known
See, I have pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of being damned alone
I got a storybook of my own
Don't you see
I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs?
(And you know it's right)
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire
Well, I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell you who not to be

I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs

Harden your mind from the chains of the divine
Make way to Shepherd of Fire
Through the ages of time (time, time, time)

But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me it's never too late
I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs

I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name

I am your wrath
I am your guilt
I am your lust

I am your scar

Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty in me
Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
That's right I shed my skin tonight but my fangs are hard to hide
And you know that you're going to die, yeah
Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty to me
Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control
Fire that burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside
Making my way through the night you're still in my sight
You're runnin' away cuz ya know you can't hide
My instincts are cold blooded hate; to you I'm the bearer of fate
Wrong place and now the wrong time, now terror is all that you'll find
Can't you feel the poison rising straight to the heart from the venomous bite
Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control
Fire that burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside
Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone
Vanish from my sites - venomous control
You won't make it right - my appetite has grown
Lost your final fight - no love will be shown
Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone
Vanish from my sites - venomous control
You can't make it right - my appetite has grown

Reverse the wager I've no means to pay
Toto has pulled back the green tonight
In sight
And blue pills coat with such disdain
I wore the shades for so long
That I've forgotten how to see
The curtain rises
But who dares to pull the strings
I know this may be hard
For you to believe in all
But you only exist because we allow it
I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem
To mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen
A figurine
Can't you hear me scream?
By the way of cosmic rays
A subtle breakdown jarred the code display
A simulation as I can tell, our cell
Playing out a hopeless scene
We stand to lose all our charm
And faith just seems to wane
A billion years can seem
A stunningly short time
You've been beaten down time and time again
But still you find yourself
At the center of it all
I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem
To mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen
A figurine
Can't you hear me scream?
You hear me
You had one thing to do, one thing
And you fucked it up, piece of shit
Nurse, patient 666158 needs to be sedated
We need 500 ccs of Blue Comfort
Oh hello there, dearie
I've been expecting you
Posturing the way I feel
Is truth only what we believe is real?
Marvel the sketches that paint the night
Starlight
And take a breath before it's all erased away</field>

Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away
Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold
A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter to laid the rest
Now and then I try to find a place in my mind
Where you can stay
You can stay awake forever
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind

Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me
Cause as soon as I'm done I'll be on my way
To live eternally
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but its so hard to stay
When I have so much to say and you're so far away....
I love you
You were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you
When He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied
So far away
And I needed to know
So far away
And I need you to
need you to know</field>

You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids.
The ones who go out and the ones that are taught to live.
One groups taught how and the other group is taught why.
There's no need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.
Look what's happening now.
What are the reasons why and how?
And don't you think it sounds stupid when someone's treated
different cause they're not the same as me or you?
You live your whole life staring at a wall, your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall.
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids.
The ones who go out and the ones that are taught to live.
One groups taught how and the other group is taught why.
There's no need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.

            <field name="lyrics">My story starts the day they said "she cant be found"
The news so dark, heart stopped, I stood silent without a sound
It's over, she's finished, mother lies with my father and sister too
Cold-blooded, they suffered, shot down by the outlaws after you
Sorrow swallows my screams
Strength of the world - is on my shoulders
Strength of the world - is on my side
Strength of the world - the one true beholder
Ice in my veins - for those who've died
I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say
Avenge the dead kill all who cross me in my path
Suicidal, I never planned on coming back
I want it, I need it, revenge is dripping from my teeth
Need nothin', to feel power, and bring the killers to their knees
Nothin' ta lose vengeance ta gain (you know I'll never be the same)
So taste my breath I'm close behind you (so desperate on your final day)
Sorrow swallows my screams
Strength of the world - is on my shoulders
Strength of the world - is on my side
Strength of the world - the one true beholder
Ice in my veins - for those who've died
I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say
Sitting in silence with heaven above me I prayed every night by their graves
While I thirst for closure I feel it no longer
I can't turn my cheek away
I stand before you; I'll sin when I have to
But now I leave your side, to avenge my family's pride
I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say
Strength of the world - is on my shoulders
Strength of the world - is on my side
Strength of the world - the one true beholder
Ice in my veins - for those who've died
So far forever now alone, a greater punishment on me has been imposed
A killer falling from the light, I miss my family, I'll never be alright</field>

            <field name="lyrics">We've been through hell
Sewn up our eyes
Found fuel in meds
Viewed through the narrow
Encouraged fear when so inclined
Bought peace through wars
That doomed our children to die
Ego is sure to fix the world
Served up to happy boys and girls
I'd make a decision if granted the privilege
But I'm afraid my taste is unrefined
And no one likes cheap wine
When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
You own the burg
We sleep in streets
You dine then waste
We forage to eat
Well who pays the tab
When you cross the line?
Who writes the check?
Who's herding the swine?
Just takes a fence to rule the roost
As long as the scale has been reduced
How can we see the outside of the pen
When survival has possession of our minds?
Calmly walk the line
When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous find in an illusion
(vlader lauder sat in sorrow
For all his teeth had gone
He drank sweet rum
While fingering his gun
And eyeballed a feast
Not one bite he could eat
Somebody cut off his head!)
Dear radiation my sweet friend
Let agents dance upon my nerves
Let sunlight glow under my skin
Let toxins seep into my soul
When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous time
I will find in an illusion
It's an illusion</field>

Roll out of bed but I'm never quite alone
Tension is pulling me in all directions
And all these problems use me as a rope
Sometimes the pressure will just drive me crazy
At any time I could explode
I need some piece of mind, its got me tired
Don't wanna lose it, but I'm turning down that road
I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our lives
Work's hard, the day's too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time
I sit in traffic every single morning
Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind
Making the money so I feed my family
But I can't raise them, 'cause I ain't got the time
I got no free days on my busy schedule
I turn the page and it's the same
Don't like my situation, you don't either
Don't wanna look back scared of working life away
I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our lives
Work's hard, the day's too long
And thats just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time
But every now and then
I drive alone
An open road
Hot summer days
A gentle breeze that feels alright
Home alone
And I can't feel the pain
Only strain
Enjoy the sights
I feel alive
When actually here just feels alright
Far from home
I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our lives
Works hard, the days too long
And thats just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time</field>

So confused.
But everything makes perfect sense.
Can't feel the pain.
Emotional pain's so much deadlier.
Lost, you've just been raped.
Pain
Your friends can't help you.
Why won't they help you? Another reality.
This can't be happening.
Why is this happening?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck
Are you?
Trying hard to figure out what's done.
I scramble but now I run.
The images in my head.
All the problems that I've been fed.
Punching slowly my mind can't change the speed.
As my victims bleed.
No matter what I do or how hard I try.
I can't use my abilities.
Use my abilities.
Art of Illusion.
My razor sharp knife's edge, pierces my victim's body.
But I can't take their soul.
Punching through jello, stabbing not killing.

            <field name="lyrics">The problem with society's been how do we teach
And if they'll believe.
We'll fight this battle for years to come
Until we only accept that we can stand on our own.
Grandfather used his hands,
he worked them too the bone
(worked them to the bone)
Provide his family with a happy home, alone.
Don't take your oppression out on me.
My old man is all I'm meant to be.
This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so plainly uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?
Don't wanna be, they never say
But don't call us the liars

We've walked these alleys a thousand times
And scattered around a thousand lies.
They are trying to hold you till youll die,
it may be hard but keep your feet on the ground.
Why don't I have the finer, things that others have
(things that others have)
The chance is there if you want it all that bad.
So bad.
Don't take your oppression out on me.
My old man is all I'm meant to be.
This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so painful or not uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?
Don't try and get me confused.
Cause I do understand.
And sometimes people need help.
That they may need a hand
When this problems going on.
A thing you have to get straight
Is that you don't own my hand.
And I don't owe you a thing.
So don't think about how sorry
You feel when now your treated so bad.
This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so plainly uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired
And as a race we look back and we've come so far.
While some may conquer the others have had it so hard
But instead we just complain while there's no one for
us to fight.
I guess we're born in it and its how we keep our side
to pay.

            <field name="lyrics">So I arrived, naked and cold
A welcomed change from the abeyance
Of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel I appreciate the time
I'm not alone
(why don't you get my lawyer on the phone)
There were days, these child eyes
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
I found my heart for the first time
And I awakened in me
I left myself to navigate and oh I felt control
(It seems these sheep have quite an appetite)
Who is the crowd
That peers through the cage
As we perform here, upon the stage
As the boy, became a man
In came a calm sophistication
I can hardly understand
So lost in ego
Didn't notice when the time had slipped away
(yeah, everybody's got a sob story)
Jesus christ, was born to die
Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We're simply sociopaths with no communication baby
I see your angle but we differ
From our points of view
(so tell me, what's your cross to bear)
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers just not today
Hope my wheels don't abandon me now
Seein' that I'm out here alone
I'm runnin' out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice
Guiding me to her arms
Mother, I'm alright
It took the birth of sin
To snake-rattle the mind
Before a blow to the head
By the gavel of time to wake up
Won't you wake up?
When did the walking apes
Decide that nuclear war
Was the only solution
For them keeping the score
Just wake up
Can't you wake up?
(Do you know this is just a simulation don't you?)
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers just not today</field>

wicked, and cruel
The soulless man stood silenced, Mary's "word" rang
so true
Chastisement worse than the flood, spread the word
its all through
Don't kill the messenger girl
As if we haven't swam enough
in this life of misery
Voice your prophecy, shed some light
feel sorrow for mankids's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears
A stab in the dark but it wounded our will
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for
one last time
We've grown into the number six hundred sixty six
War breaks, a sign of the end, eternally expelled
Look to the sky for knowledge,
the stars align tonight
Eclipse and heaven shall fall
Now I know I've seen it all in my life of misery
Voice your prophecy, shed some light
feel sorrow for mankids's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears
A stab in the dark but it wounded our will
Dust the apple off, savor each bite
And deep inside you know Adam was right
lust and power, indulgence, no fear
Left with his sins, how does this end?
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for
one last time
As the prophets shed the light on what's to
come the crowds did gather
Your time is precious, they explained,
no time to worry, Messiah's coming
Don't go to sleep tonight, darling, hold me in your arms
These will be our final days and I can't let go
Walls are falling, churches burning, women ravaged,
children crying
Flesh is tearing, some still fighting
In this world of misery
Voice your prophecy, shed some light
feel sorrow for mankids's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears
A stab in the dark but it wounded our will
Dust the apple off, savor each bite
And deep inside you know Adam was right
lust and power, indulgence, no fear
Left with his sins, how does this end?
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for
one last time

Harbor in the shadows
Feel this weight of sin
Hammering away
Die with the guilt
Of a thousand AWOL soldiers
Die watch the scythe usher me astray
I can't go on this way
Not as I am today
The ugly side of me is strong
Take aim, a loaded gun
Pull back on all who run
A coward's truth inside the wrong
This means war
This means war
This means war
Lash your tongue of bane
Carry me to nowhere
Mental holocaust
Battle never ends
Lie, mask the pain
Of a child who's forsaken
Lie to myself
Praise the new regime
I left me long ago
Reasons you'll never know
No one to miss me when I'm gone
With no more words to say
No argument to stay
Another post I don't belong
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
No home to call my own
No finding someone new
No one to break the fall
No one to see me through
No name to carry on
No promise for today
No one to hear the call
No tattered flag to raise
Walk the razor's edge
Cut into the madness
Question all you trust
Buy into the fear
I see the man ripping at my soul now
I, I know the man
I know him all too well
There's nothing here for free
Lost who I want to be
My serpent blood can strike so cold
On any given day
I'll take it all away
Another thought I can't control
This means war
This means war
This means war

Mother cries - tortured voices as we crawl
Find me on my better days to lose it once again...
In a way
So try and love me while you can
And take the time to understand
As long as I can touch your face
You know I'll never leave this place
If only in my mind
I don't mind - read the writing on the wall
Mother cries - tortured voices as we crawl
Find me on my better days to lose it once again...
But I seem to find no better ways

Silence all I wanna say
With tendencies to run away, I run away
With you tonight
Launder all my sins away
And just like that mistakes are made, you know
Tonight the world dies

Don't you ask about me, ask 'bout somebody else

I can feel it, won't embrace it, it's overwhelming how far you take it
(Stuck in a state of questioning)
And don't you tell me you know we're destined,
you won't convince me, I won't listen
(Resentment building, you've put our lives on hold)
Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always unknown, I'll find my way there
but goddamn motherfuckers always wasting my time
I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control
Play your game you better walk away
cause your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out
Label me, that's fine, I'll be somebody else
(Nothing in front of me but holes ahead)
Lie about my life, have a story to tell
(Lights went down, was on the edge and I fell)
Oh you're so insightful, let me remind you to twist and break me,
should make you worried (Long way to go and you're right there)
Two-faced liar, don't try and know me, deceit brings fire,
makes sure you can't breathe (Pick at pieces of my body below)
I never bothered with all the rumors, too much garbage (all the same)
(I know my destination)
I'll stand right here, come on you falsehood deceitful liar (There's no shame)
Don't ever take my side, I know you're never right,
I'll justify the means (Nothing's what it seems)
I'll stand around and fight, but there's no point tonight,
been chained to this machine
Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always is unknown, I'll find my way there
but Goddamn Imposter are you out of your mind?
I walk down these roads alone and now you're seen here
My feelings that I'm having towards you are perfectly clear
(I control this ride)
My devils appetite is tonight and now I'm alright
But you Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time
Play your game you better walk away cause
your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out
I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control
Don' try and get the best of me (No one can help but your own self)
City makes my body ache (Lonely, don't try and prey on me)
I feel your world dying, no more use in tryin'
And my body's trashed and low,
but to you I'll never show myself or what's inside
And I've seen it all before and I'll settle the score,
I'll never join your side</field>

Sometimes when we're young, and always on the run
It gets so dark and I know that place yeah

The hands of time strip youth from our bodies,
We fade,
Memories remain,
As time goes on
There's nothing here to take for granted
With each breath that we take
The hands of time strip youth from our bodies,
We fade,
Memories remain,
As time goes on</field>

Try not to lose you
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception
Unmasked fear
I'll be here waiting, tested and secure
Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall
I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confined in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me
Nothing will last in this life
Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze till I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague
Break all your promises
Tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here
Tasting salvation's near
Nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall
I wish I could be the one
the one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confined in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me</field>

We meet, drink 'till trouble found us there
Living life as without a care
We've had our bouts, been black and blue
Its true, I've even gone to jail for you my friends
Bet your life that I'd do it again
(Until the End)
Don't change the way you think of me
We're from the same story
Life moves on, can't stay the same
But some of us, some worry
While some have gone their separate ways
Theres some still i caught up with the past instead
But move on, you're missing most of your life
They say its hard to stay the same
When some fail
While other men seem to gain, but friends
I'll be with you here until the end
(Until the End)
Don't change the way you think of me
We're from the same story
Life moves on, can't stay the same
But some of us, some worry
We're all falling forward
With no signs of slow
And some moving faster
But that's all that I wanted
I wanted
Ya know it's hard
It's passing by
Memories
Be out all night
So reminisce won't bring you back
Just look ahead and hold on tight
We're all falling forward
With no signs of slow
And some moving faster
But that's all that I wanted
I wanted
Don't change the way you think of me
Oh yeah
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end</field>

Because the moments I can feel you near.
They keep you close to me my dear.
And if they ever become to clear.

Now you're gone away,
Farther than yesterday.
But you never leave me,
Seems my mind replace.

A letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages
for anyone who cares
Collage of broken words,
and stories full of tears
Remembering your life
'cause we wish you were here
Nothing is harder
than to wake up all alone,
Realize it's not okay
it's the end of all you've know
Time keeps passing by
but it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind
but some too deep to feel
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel, tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain, inside
We're all just victims of a crime
Some days you'll find me
in a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself
'bout the things I'll never know
What's left here to find?
'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time
can we even up the score?
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel, tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain, inside
We're all just victims of a crime
Nothing lasts forever
For all good things it's true
I'd rather trade it all
while somehow saving you
It must have been the season
That threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall
Now I'm searching for a sign
So don't need your salvation
With promises unkind
And all the speculations
Save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason
A reason just to stay
And some just can't be bothered to
Stick around another day
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel, tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside (oh)
We've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime
I'm missing you (x4)</field>

Be yourself, by yourself, stay away from me.
A lesson learned in life, known from the dawn of

Are you talking to me?

Those same friends tell me your every word.

Rain plays a heart warming tune, on the pavement.
Emotions stir.
A feeling of warmness, compassion, I feel at home.
Disguised by surroundings.
As the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance
on their mistreated lives.
As the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance
on mistreated lives.
As the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance
on mistreated lives.
A silhouette stands still.
A cactus on a warm summer night.
But the rain falls cold
and the moon shines bright.
Black as night.
Cold as ice.
Warm as home.
Ready to live.
Stars they shoot.
In a clear.
Across the sky.
As does my time.
Waiting, wanting, feeling, emotion.
Crying, breaking, loving, nothing.
Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone,
thinking good times, and why'd they go?
Breaking down, breaking away from me.
Falling down, breaking away from me.
Fuck.
I need this place to get away from you.
Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone,
thinking good times, and why'd they go?

Do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been living
Life's so reckless, tragedy endless
Welcome to the family
Hey!
There's something missing
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection
Welcome to the family
Not long ago you find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you find yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now, can you look at yourself?
You can't win this fight
In a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight!
Hey kids! (hey kids)
I have to question
What's with the violent aggression
Details blurry, lost him too early
Welcome to the family
Hey!
Why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done, a casualty rerun
Welcome to the family
I try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now, so have you figured it out?
You can't win this fight
And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight!
Here for you and all mankind,
I've lost my mind
Psychotic rounds in to dementia
I won't be fine
I see you're a king who's been dethroned
Cast out in a world you'll never know
Stand there, place your weapon by your side
It's a war the end, we'll surely lose but that's alright
So have you figured it out now, so have you figured it out?
And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight
Deep inside where nothing's fine
I've lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside
I've lost my,
Deep inside where nothing's fine
I've lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside
I've lost my....</field>

Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain?

A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a leading role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears

The smell of fall.
Changing season.
The graveyard is alive, black cat across my path,
the chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead.
Imprisoned souls.
Trapped for eternity.
Black crows break the silence.

The garden of the dead s alive tonight and you can't stop it.
Just enjoy it.
Open up your mind and you will feel it too.
The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.
You can feel the thoughts of the dead.
Feeling the thoughts of the dead.

True or false, it's still there, teaching me.
True or false, still there, teaching me.
You can feel it tonight.
The wood has rotted away.
Take the time absorb it.
Their time is slipping away.
Stone all carved by hand.
Statues that resemble their faces.
They still breathe.
Come join us.

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone, and
I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts
As time crumbles away
Time crumbles away</field>

The face of beauty to fall for. 
I fall to my knees, deceitful. 

Brought down by feelings of regret. 
Again your mind has failed the test. 
Not everyone feels the same. 
Pacifist blinded by the game. 

Stand tall. They'll break your heart. 
Stand tall. They'll smash your ego. 
Stand tall. They'll tear you down.

Keeping my fate deep within your threshold
Petty inconvenience but it means the world to me

You have the power
To set me free
Caught in your grasp, how?
Just let me be
Give me control out
Out of these depths
A fiery hell
I pray for death

I've been the wrong one time and time again
Now I'm on my knees forgive me please
Tore out my heart and handed to me on a silver platter
Sew up the hole, emptiness in the place of compassion

You made me this way
I am the product of your creation
Sew up the hole, and now, look the other way
Now you've turned your back on me

You've turned away from me
The future's much to far away to see
I hope you learn the truth
Not the way things were meant to be with me and you</field>

This will never end, when I'll bleed forever (This will never end)

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

Outside shell is strong (There is nowhere to run and hide) confident
But slowly eats away (Stuck alone inside your head)
Like a man plagued with disease, I try to fight (Guess you're better off dead)
Through my pores it seems to seep (Your mind bleeding)
When I'll bleed forever

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, it's been so long

Stuck alone inside your head,
Better off dead
The phone would ring in the empty house,
No one's around

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

But in my life, I wanted more
I needed more, I taste more</field>

Disappointed, we don't agree, I don't need your praise
(Don't look my way for help, from the beginning you came to me)
Never asked you to like me
I don't need your praise (we won't play your games)

Look down on me, spit in my face
You're nothing to me, not to me

Darkened eyes you'll see
There is no hope, no savior in me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by, no one will care
What happens to me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore

My presence won't be ignored, no not today
Don't walk in my direction, turn the other way
(Don't look my way for help, from the beginning you came to me)
Asking questions, predetermined answers
You won't find them here (we don't want your opinion)

And I don't want you, I won't let you think
Compromise is near 'cause it's not near

Darkened eyes you'll see
There is no hope, no savior in me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore
Learned from years gone by, no one will care
What happens to me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore

I'm alone in here
No more feelings
Killed my fears
Don't ask you'll never know
You're left behind and I'll be exposed

Far away, you keep on trying
Holding me down, breaking away
Trying to distance my life
Not one in the crowd, but one with the answer
The one that can change your mind

But it's not true, I don't need you
Don't waste your time and don't waste mine
I'm not your friend, won't soothe your soul
And in the end you're all dead to me</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Two nights ago I was shot
A bullet sunk straight through the skull
A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
No pain as I awoke, but dead
Seeing the face of the man
The time as he lays down his gun
I knew this was going to take place
White silence, so peaceful, so numb

No one knows the time they're changing
No one will see through

You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my mother shed tears

No!
This gun has stopped time in its tracks
Has altered the course of my fate
Destiny is shattered and timeless
Closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace

I'll watch you call, calling for me,
You can't bring back time
Close your eyes and look away,
Fate exposed, won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
Descending entity in me

My voice has been taken from me
The more I listen, the more I have to say

You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my mother shed tears
And taste the blood that she cries,
And taste the blood that she cries

I'll watch you call, calling for me,
You can't bring back time
Close your eyes and look away,
Fate exposed, won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
Descending entity in me
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah</field>

We all know what to do but know one does it
Now this time has passed and full of regret
Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone
When they get back, it won't be the same
My life, you've always been there
Now you're gone and my heads spinning
Left the childhood, left the memories, left the good times in the past
Moving on your time has run out
Wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night

Never will I forget you, and all the memories past
So rarely I get to see your face
Growing I looked to you in guidance
We knew that time would kill us, but you're still so close to me

To me you were my life
To me you were my soul companion
Now you are so far away
Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had
Come back, to the days when we were young
Come back, to the days when nothing mattered
To the days when nothing mattered

And I feel that time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night</field>

Sometimes life is altered
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right

When I see you, I can read it in your eyes
Fate misunderstood (But things are bound to change)
Swallowed the lies, can't blame you for
Thinking with your heart

Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right

I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
I know, I know
Dark will turn to light, in time I'll be alright
I know, I know
I never imagined my life could turn out this way
So cold, so black, so alone

Living goes by fast, catch your breath
And it will pass you by
And it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold

Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right

Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation

            <field name="lyrics">This shining city built of gold, a far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye round here look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast, ten horns raised from his heads
Symbolic woman sits on his throne, but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The Beast and the Harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen, Myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once as her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world, sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss with her sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The day has come for all us sinners
If you'r enot a servant you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city looking back on her to see there's nothin' around
I don't believe in fairy tales
And no one wants to go to Hell
You made the wrong decision
And it's easy to see
Now if you want to serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever

She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings

In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do (finish you)

I feel it burn inside, burn like the rising sun
Lifted into the sky, took away the only thing I loved
I know after tonight all your power crumbles in my arms
So don't worry, I'll be fine, when my life ends, I'll leave this scar

A smoking gun in your hand, now don't you realize what you've done
Put a bullet in his back, your hero since you were so young
How could you kill the man who brought salvation through your pain
He must mean everything to end it all this shameful way

I started here so young and helped you get along
Just did it for the love, and people healed through us
Don't live your life in vain, don't take it out on me
You're cracked, so just remember, I'm not your enemy
I don't deserve to fall this way, by a man who felt betrayed

I felt so down now you're around to rescue me
Every note and every word i'm listening
Sometimes problems seem too deep to take
Sometimes I cry thinking my future looks so bleak
Finally, together we were destined, I know what's best for us in the end
Someone hear me, someone stop me, someone listen, why aren't you listening?</field>

I don't know where to begin, but I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're followin'

Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit behind the blood between the red and white and blue but it's too deep for you to see and everyone eventually will take the step cause it's in sight you take the left I'll take the right I fell the hate you've built for me and I say pay attention baby)

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease

But it wasn't a sin, a sorry life in judging every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit you forgot
How to speak how to ask all the questions

The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more I can do from on the outside looking in your government is listenin' to push you on the story of immortal father mortal son give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)
If they had it their way I'd burn in Hell and your future's a fuckin' disaster can't you see
Don't give them all the power when your future's in desperate trouble baby

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact you gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to
Running away from condition, I see you but you're running away from
Your scared seductive system

Most would claim I live a lie when pointing out it's easy to predict these things
Every color has its side, they live together vote but most won't read between these lines
Please help us, please save us of course they have control we're all the same
Up on the cross, crucified their problem drove the nail and let Him rot
Family and friends, it won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder 'bout how you sold you mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made will leave you empty

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact you gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to run

You've fallen asleep in denial
Look at the way we're dyin'
How it ends I'll never know
Just live you life blind like me</field>

Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (See it in my eyes)
Now I can understand
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Whoa, yeah!

You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day
The fear in you is here to stay
So keep the fuck away from me and learn to trust the words I say

Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes)

Now I can understand
Put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Huh! Yeah, yeah!

Running from me before I tear you down (Be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (It feels so right)
I won't help you, let you run away (Despise what you say)
Run towards the light exposing your soul (We won't be there by your side)
Salvation's dying (Somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end
Sweet child we'll miss you
Whoa, so far away, far away

I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes)
Now I can understand (Put faith in you for the last time)

Stand up and fight

Now fighting rages on and on
To challenge me you must be strong
I'll walk your land but don't be long
Two million soldiers can't be wrong

Its no fun but I've been here before
I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war
(Not the way I pictured this, I wanted better things)
Some are scared others killing for fun, I shot a mother in front of her son
(Change this from my consciousness and please erase my dreams)

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to god that our side is right
You know we won but still we lose, until I make it home to you
I see your mother filled with tears we grew up so fast where did those years go
Memories won't let you cry unless I don't return tonight

So many soldiers on the other side, I take their live so they don't take mine
(Scared to make it out alive now murders all I know)
Nobody tells me all the reasons were here, I am a weapon so there's nothing to fear
(Another day another life but nothing real to show for)

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to god that our side is right
You know we won but still we lose, until I make it home to you
I see your mother filled with tears we grew up so fast where did those years go
Memories won't let you cry unless I don't return tonight

Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun will never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight

Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive
Strangers blood on my hands, shot all I can
There were no silent nights watching your brothers all die
To destroy all their plans with no thought of me (no thought of me)
No thought of me

Walk the city lonely
Memories that haunt are passing by
A murderer walks your street tonight
Forgive me for my crimes, don't forget that I was so young
Fought so scared in the name of God and country</field>

But I'm too young to worry
These streets we travel on
Will undergo our same lost past

I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile
Holding you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come
But I don't want to leave you

I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over

Newborn life replacing all of us
Changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here so where do we go?
Will you take a journey tonight, follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?

I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over

Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real

So, what if I never hold you, yeah
Or kiss your lips again?
Woah, so I never want to leave you
And the memories of us to see I beg don't leave me

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over

Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real

Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day [then continues in the background]

            <field name="lyrics">My story starts the day they said "she can't be found"
the news so dark, heart stopped, I stood silent without a sound
It's over, she's finished, mother lies with my father and sister too
Cold-blooded, they suffered, shot down by the outlaws after you
Sorrow swallows my screams

Strength of the world, is on my shoulders
Strength of the world, is on my side
Strength of the world, the one true beholder
Ice in my veins, for those who've died

I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say

Avenge the dead kill all who cross me in my path
Suicidal, I never planned on coming back
I want it, I need it, revenge is dripping from my teeth
Need nothin', to feel power, and bring the killers to their knees
Nothin' ta lose vengeance ta gain (you know I'll never be the same)
So taste my breath I'm close behind you (so desperate on your final day)
Sorrow swallows my screams

Sitting in silence with heaven above me I prayed every night by their graves
While I search for closure I feel it no longer
I can't turn my cheek away
I stand before you; I'll sin when I have to
But now I leave your side, to avenge my family's pride

So far forever alone, a greater punishment on me has been imposed
A killer falling from the light, I'll miss my family, I'll never be alright</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Keep on writing you're just raping yourself
(Nothing can take my mind away) from them
Don't you ask about me, ask about somebody else
(Once I've fallen there's many stories to tell)
I can feel it, won't embrace it, its overwhelming how far ya take it
(Stuck in a state of questioning)
And don't you tell me you know we're destined, you won't convince me, I won't listen
(Resentment building, you've put our lives on hold)

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always is known, I'll find my way there
But Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time.

I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control
Play your game and walk away, your integrity don't mean a shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out

Label me, that's fine, I'll be somebody else
(Nothing in front of me but holes ahead)
Lie about my life, have a story to tell
(Lights went down, was on the edge and I fell)
Oh you're so insightful, let me remind you to twist and break me
Should make you worried
(Long way to go and you're right there)
Two-faced liar, don't try and know me, deceit brings fire, makes you can't breath
(pick at pieces of my body below)

I never bothere with all the rumors, too much garbage (all the same)
(I know my destination)
I'll stand right here, come on you falsehood deceitful liar 
(There's no shame)
Don't ever take my side, I know you're never right
I'll justify the means (nothing's what it seems)
I'll stand around and fight, but there's no point tonight, been chained to this machine

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always unknown, I'll find my way there
But Goddamn impostor are you out of your mind

I walk down these roads alone and now you're seen here
My feelings that I'm having towards you are perfectly clear (I control this ride)
My devil's appetite is tonight and now I'm alright
But you Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time
Play your game you better walk away cause your integrity don't mean a shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out

I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control

Don't try and get the best of me (no one can help but your own self)
City makes my body ache (lonely, don't try and prey on me)
I feel your world dying, no more use in tryin'
And my body's trashed and low, but you I'll never show myself or what's inside
And you've seen it all before but I'll settle the score, I'll never join your side.</field>

The soulless man stood silenced, Mary's "word" rang so true
Chastisement worse than the flood, spread the word, its all through
Don't kill the messenger girl
As if we haven't swam enough tin this life of misery

Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Fell sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears
A stab in the dark and it wounded our will
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time

We've grown into numbers six hundred sixty six
War breaks, a sign of the end, eternally expelled
Look to the sky for knowledge, the stars align tonight
Eclipse and heaven shall fall
Now I know I've seen it all in my life of misery

Dust the apple off, savor each bite
And deep inside you know Adam was right
Lust and power, indulgence, no fear
Left with is sins, how does this end?
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time

As the prophets shed the light on what's to come the crowds did gather
Your time is precious, they explained, no time to worry, messiah's coming
Don't go to sleep tonight, darling, hold me in your arms
These will be our final days and I can't let go

Walls are falling, churches burning, women ravaged, children crying
Flesh is tearing, some still fighting
In this world of misery

Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Fell sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears
A stab in the dark and it wounded our will
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time</field>

(Gets rid of the pain of being a man)

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried to drive on through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

As I adjust to my new sights 
The rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger and I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction follows me, show me what it's like to be set free

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here 
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me 
But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions but most just pass us by 
Don't want your absolution 'cause I can't make it right

I'll make a beast out of myself 
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here 
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me 
But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
I've known it from the start all 
These good ideas will tear your brains apart
Scared but you can follow me 
I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
so unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

I see a distant light, but girl this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see so how did this come to be
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife

'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here

A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

This peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope you might
take me back inside when the time is right

Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken; I'm choking on this ecstasy)
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live)

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope you might

Love to outweigh ignorance?

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

Come back to me, it's almost easy

Come back again, it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart
From the things I've done to you
It's hard to face but the fact remains
That this is nothing new

I left you bound and tied
With suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin
But deep inside I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

Come back to me, it's almost easy

Come back again, it's almost easy

Come back to me, it's almost easy

Come back again, it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you, it kills me to say
(Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong
Now let me make it right

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

I need that shot to enter my vein
My Brompton cocktail blend

'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle long

I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
In a lie

I'm tired, induced euphoria (induced euphoria)
To help me move along (help me move along)
I wanna meet my maker in peace, I want to feel alive again
So put that smile back on my face and mix it strong my friend

And leave how I arrived, so alive

I believe my sins have been forgiven
And I believe my choice will save me from this life
Please don't question why
My sins have been forgotten
I believe I'll find peace in afterlife
Please don't question why
I left this way

Like me motherfucker you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone

So how does it feel to know that someone's kid
In the heart of America has blood on their hands
Fighting to defend your rights
So you can maintain a lifestyle
That insults his family's existence
Well, where I'm from we have a special
Salute that we aim high in the air
Towards all those pompous assholes
Who spend their days pointing fingers
(fuck you)

Shhh quiet might piss somebody off
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your generous hypocrisy
Collecting enemies

Tabloid gossip queen worthless man
(there's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(right this way you've dug your own grave)

I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone

All the way from the east to the west we
Got this high society
Looking down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every
Direction and blaming their
Own nation for who wins the elections
They've never contributed a fucking thing to the
Country they love to criticize

Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first

Shhh quiet might piss somebody off

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(lies inside your head your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(broken glass your fake reflection)

I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking

There's nothing here for me on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps
And all the shops are closed

For me to take what's mine, until the end of time
We were more than friends, before the story ends,
And I will take what's mine, create what
God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long,
I was weak with fear that
Something would go wrong,
Before the possibilities came true,
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears,
Conjuring her deepest fears
(come here you fucking bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times,
I can't believe it,
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes,
Eyes over easy, eat it eat it eat it

She was never this good in bed
Even when she was sleepin'
Now she's just so perfect I've
Never been quite so fucking deep in
It goes on and on and on,
I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever,
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, we fell apart
Let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
But baby don't cry

Now possibilities I'd never considered,
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard,
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave,
To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it eat it eat it

Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, we fell apart
Let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
But baby don't cry

I will suffer for so long
(What will you do, not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, If it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again

We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

"Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life'"
"Yes, I do"
"Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life'"
"I do"
"I now pronounce you"

Full of ourselves, tied to our fate
The end is knocking
The end is knocking, yeah

We've all been lost for most of this life
(lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
(most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride

With peace of mind so hard to find
We're dwelling on the drastic signs
Another way to numb our mind
And as you close your eyes tonight
and pray for a better life
you'll see it flying helplessly away

We've all been lost for most of this life
(lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
(most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride</field>

Woke animal feelings in me
Took over my sense and I lost control
I'll taste your blood tonight

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
But now it's too late you've wasted all your time

Relax while you're closing your eyes to me
So warm as I'm setting you free
With your arms by your side there's no struggling
Pleasure's all mine this time

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
But now it's too late you've wasted all your time

Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure, unmask your desire
Perishing

We've all had a time where we've lost control
We've all had our time to grow
I'm hoping I'm wrong but I know I'm right
I'll hunt again one night

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
But now it's too late you've wasted all your time

Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure, unmask your desire
Perishing

Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we're built don't point the blame on me

Scream, scream, scream the way you would
If I ravaged your body
Scream, scream, scream the way you would
If I ravaged your mind

Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure, unmask your desire
Perishing</field>

It's hard to find, but that's alright yeah
Searching for the way, push harder everyday
It's deep inside, that shining light yeah
But I'm scarred, by barriers placed in my path
I'm scathed

This ride that takes me through life
Leads me into darkness but emerges into light
No one can ever slow me down
I'll stay unbound

Sometimes when we're young, and always on the run
It gets so dark and I know that place yeah
So don't be too concerned, you've got a lot to learn
Well so do I and we've got plenty of time yeah
Don't fall off the track yet with so many races to go
Hold on

This ride that takes me through life
Leads me into darkness but emerges into light
No one can ever slow me down
I'll stay unbound

Some live so wrong, with what we do is each his own
But living in fear, endless shame for countless years
I never lived in fear I knew I'd die another day
I never viewed my life as something... slipping away

Some live so wrong, with what we do is each his own
But living in fear, endless shame for countless years
I never lived in fear I knew I'd die another day
I never viewed my life as something... slipping away

There's nothing here to take for granted
With each breath that we take
The hands of time strip youth from our bodies
And we fade
Memories remain
As time goes on

There's nothing here to take for granted
With each breath that we take
The hands of time strip youth from our bodies
And we fade
Memories remain

One step from lashing out at you...
You want in to get under my skin
And call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you
What do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been
Belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk

Run your mouth when I'm not around
It's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing you song?
Those same friends tell me your every word

Are you talking to me?
No way punk</field>

When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all

Chances are that ya might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real

Still I'm on my way
On and on it goes
Vacant hope to take

Hey I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

I walked the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real

Memories seem to fade
On and on it goes
Wash my view away

Hey I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever

And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

Take you down now
Burn it all out
Throw you all around
Get you're fuckin' hands off me
What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate

For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
The only deal you'll find
I'll gladly take your soul

While it seems sick
Sober up quick
Psycho lunatic
Crushing you with hands of fate
Shame to find out when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside inferno awaits

Evil thoughts can hide
I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin
Release the dark within

This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive

This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive

This is now your life
Die buried alive</field>

All fear has been avoided
You say the words and my weapon is drawn

This one could be my last time
Some people call it war crime
I may be staring down a lethal sight

(To die)

Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering a man should never know
Leaving my faith on the danger line

I do this for my family
My daughter loves her daddy
Too many talk down on things they don't know

With colors never faded
Reckless and unabated
They may take me but never take us all (I'll crawl)

Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering no man should ever know
Leaving my faith on the danger line

I know what you're thinking
I've been there before
So think of the times
The time we spent laughing away
So think of the times at home

Now I found myself in my own blood
(never thought I'd lay in my own blood)
The damage done is far beyond repair
I never put my faith in up above
(never had much faith in up above)
But now, I'm hoping someone's there

Never meant to leave this world alone
I never meant to hurt the ones who cared
And all this time I thought we'd just grow old
You know, no one said it's fair

Tell my baby girl that it's alright
I've sung my last song today
Remind the Lord to leave his light on for me
I'm free</field>

Found a place for me to rest my head
While I may be hard to find
Heard there's peace just on the other side

Not that I could
Nor that I would
Let it burn
Under my skin
Let it burn

Left this life to set me free
Took a piece of you inside of me
All this hurt can finally fade
Promise me you'll never feel afraid

Not the I could
Nor that I would
Let it burn
Under my skin
Let it burn

I hope it's worth it, here on the highway, yeah
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you

Pills had a role now
There's nothing to take.
Nothing to trust.
No one to fake.
You'll find out sooner
That it's best if we just know our place

My infiltrated mind.
My lacerated soul.
You took me years
Create me control you.
Why let myself around with you aside?

God save us!
God save us all!
God hates us!
God hates us all!

Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!

Lie, rape, kill
Love, hate, fear

You better take your time
(Lie, rape, kill)
You better take it slow
Cause when you see the one

One click to end the day
Another story with a mangled scene
It couldn't happen any other way

You wanna talk about it?
I'm begging you to walk in my shoes any time
Watch the clock 'til you unwind
You wanna cry about it
It's making me consider that I've lost my mind
The way I see, you must be blind

So this is the world you left behind
This is the guilt that consumes you

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

Can't bribe me with money
Can't shower me with shame
Another killer from a broken home
Until you come on me with manic fame

You wanna know about it?
Well I'ma be fucking with you every time
Story broken, you're behind
Yeah when you ask about it?
You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
Seems we all have friends to find

So this is the hate I've been born to
Full are the tales of the untrue

So die alone
This is one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

And I'm waiting
Waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
(And all the promises I'll find)
No hesitating, you've pulled the trigger now your story's left behind
I know you want to see me fry
Lock my soul you hope to burn

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

To die unknown
Would crush the fish-lens we all see through
To clear the glare
Expose the ugliness we hold true</field>

Dragged ya down below
Down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
Peace of mind is less than never
Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
Burn the world your last endeavor

Flesh is burning
You can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have
Such easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while
They ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave
Until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness,
Turning, haunting, yearning
Pull the trigger

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

(While your nightmare comes to life)

Can't wake up in a sweat
'Cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons
Victim of your own creation
Beyond the will to fight
Where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
Loathing self-assassination

You've been lied to
Just to rape you of your site
And now they have the nerve
To tell you how to feel (feel)

So sedated as they
Medicate your brain
And while you slowly
Go insane they tell ya
"Given with the best intentions
Help you with your complications"

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Oh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

Fight
Not to fail
Not to fall
Or you'll end up like the others

Die
Die again
Drenched in sin
With no respect for another

Down
Feel the fire (fire)
Feel the hate
Your pain is what we desire

Lost
Hit the wall (wall)
Watch you crawl (crawl)
Such a replaceable liar

And I know you hear their voices (calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (these signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal

(As your nightmare comes to life)

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare</field>

We only only wake up when we sleep
Left by the lunar light
Troubles are all we find
Lost our way tonight

Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?

Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die

Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I could use some guiding light
Some place to go
If you hear me let me know

They all know
They all know

Ever since the day you left
My fate's been set alone
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight
So why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?

Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die

Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light
Some place to go
If you hear me let me know
If you hear me let me know

Aaaah

Help me find my way
I said help me find my way

No force inside of me
Stone cold lips and help me see
All lies into a degree
Losing you I wanna be
You'll find out I do
He maybe out of his mind
But some day you will find
That sanity's left us all blind
And dragged us all behind
Of moment's seemed to go's eyes
Crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die
I say it just moves on

If you'd only open your mind
Then someday you will find
Insanity's left us behind
And walked right through the night
I can see the picture's clear
As yesterday pictures of my own
I can hear the voice's begging you to stay
But know you're not alone

Save me,
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die

Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light
Some place to go
If you hear me let me know
If you hear me let me know

Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young

I tried to heal the broken love with all I could
Lived a life so endlessly saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal the broken love with all I could

Will you stay
Will you stay away forever

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book its burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold

A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find a place in my mind
Where you can stay you can stay awake forever

How do I live without the ones I love
Time still turns the pages of the book its burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me 'cause as soon as I'm done
I'll be on my way to live eternally

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book its burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but it's so hard to stay

When I have so much to say and you're so far away
I love you, you were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise

But I'll see you when He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands are tied
So far away and I need you to know
So far away and I need you to need you to know</field>

The depth of all we mean to be
If only in my eyes

Mother cries

Find me on my better days
To lose it once again
In a way

So try and love me while you can
And take the time to understand
As long as I can touch your face
You know I'll never leave this place
If only in my mind

I don't mind

My cry

Find me on my better days
To lose it once again
But I seem to find out better ways
To consciously pretend

Sadness all I want to say
And it seems to run away
I'll run away
With you tonight
Launder all my sins away
And just like that mistakes are made
You know
Tonight the world dies

I don't mind

A letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages
For anyone who cares
Collage of broken words
and stories full of tears
Remembering your life
'Cause we wish that you were here

Nothing is harder
Than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay
It's the end of all you know
Time keeps passing by
But it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind
But some too deep to feel

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

Some days you'll find me
In a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself
'Bout the things I'll never know
What's left to find
'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time
Can we even up the score?

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

And nothing lasts forever
For all good days it's true
I'd rather tred it all
For somehow saving you
It must have been the season
That've threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall
Now I'm searching for a sign

So don't need your salvation
With promises and kind
And all those speculations
Save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason
A reason just to stay
Some just can't be bothered
To stick around another day

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside (oh)
We've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime

In a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
And our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Hey kid (hey kid)
I have to question
What's with the violent aggression
Details blurry, lost him too early
Welcome to the family

Hey
Why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done, a casualty rerun
Welcome to the family

I try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now, so have you figured it out?
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
And our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight!

Here for you and all mankind
I've lost my mind
Psychotic rounds in rabid dementia
I won't be fine

I see you're a king who's been dethroned
Cast out in a world you've never know
Stand down, place your weapon by your side
It's our war in the end, we'll surely lose but that's alright
So have you figured it out now, so have you figured it out?

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
And our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find

Deep inside where nothing's fine

You're not invited, so step aside

That comes alive when you take off her clothes
There's no telling just where shes been
Ask around but no one seems to know yeah
(yeah)

Late at night when your looking to sin
Call her up and she'll lay down the law
You cant trust her cause she'll lie to your face
But that's not why you gave her a call
(yeah)

Waist deep inside
Now that's the burning desire

We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feel's alright
Til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
Cause she's here for you it's all yours tonight

You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know

Another thing about this girl I know
She's more comfortable down on her knees
Went to school got a job and then she shot it to hell
All cause shes born to please yeah

(yeah)

Don't get her mixed up because she knows what she likes
Can tell the difference between
Right or wrong
She know's your watching every one of her moves
Just more reason to string you along yeah

Your waist deep inside
Now that's the burning desire

We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feel's alright
Til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
Cause she's here for you it's all yours tonight

You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know

The first time's hard enough
But you made it through
The second time
I see the changes in you
She's got you somehow
Your needing her now
(yeah)

We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feel's alright
Til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice

Evil yours, now evil mine
So I robbed you blind, the voices
In my head could just a less than
Peaceful side

The endless possibilities
Controlling every fight

You can't break me, crushed the
Fears of yesterday
You can't change me, barriers our trust will fade

I've stood in the dark, been
Waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive, I'm not ready to die

Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all
Make me crawl, to daddy's little
Girl to read the writings on the wall

While cast into the nothingness
The final curtain call

You can't break me, crushed the
Fears of yesterday
You can't change me, barriers our trust will fade.
I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive, I'm not ready to die

Through the madness we find
Loyalty is no match for power
Save your body or lie, left to rot in
Your darkest hour
Friends won't help you now as long as your mine

You can't break me, crushed the
Fears of yesterday
You can't change me, barriers our trust will fade.

I've stood in the dark, been
Waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive

And I'll control the world one
Person at a time
As I damn the dead I'm trying to
Survive, I'm not ready to die

Oh!

I'm not ready to die

Some choose to shout when they speak and they'll be the star

They say we've lost our minds
We've just gained control

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee
No mockery
Somehow we still carry on

(Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear)

Silence your fear, we've got to move higher
High like the stars in the sky, guiding us all
Battle the will of those who conspire
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow

Destroy their perfect crime, watch the power fold

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee
No mockery
Somehow we still carry on

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea

We stand on the edge now
We've come so far
Through all the dust it becomes clear
You will always be my heart

There's no death, no end of time when I'm facing it with you

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us Acid rain

Stand near to me
Don't look be brave
Over the blackened moon
I'll carry you away
Through the planets we fly

Searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas
Fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in hell
Where many had to suffer
I stared the devil in the eyes

Walked many roads
To witness ancient idols
And found the great gates of fire

Had many stones
Question my conviction
Gave on these reason to rise?

The hate I'm searching
For bones he can borrow
while eyes gift in the night?
Final plight

Live again
I won't sin
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

Escape the hell
Of capitulated mortals
And drink the blood of a king
A desert rain
has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me
So it seems

Live again
I won't sin
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

My story ends
Not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world
Through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is
I've been told
So I go

Live again
I won't sin
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

I'm coming home

Out in the cold I lost my way
But storms won't last to clear the air
For something new
The sun came out and brought you through

A lifetime full of words to say
A hope that time will slow the passing day

I've been wrong, time's over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me
Crimson day

Don't speak, no use for words
Lie in my arms, sleep secure
I wonder what you're dreaming of
Lands rare and far
A timeless flight to reach the stars

A lifetime full of words to say
A hope that time will slow the passing day

I've been wrong, time's over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me
Crimson day

I've come so far to meet you here
To share this life with one I hold so dear
And I won't speak but what is true
The world outside created just for you
It's for you, for you

And I've been shamed with no words to find

Been known to take it too high
I gotta a inch with a loaded head trigger
And a one way ticket to fly

When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doing their time

Caught your eye in the corner,
Don't you look at me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter,
gotta fix what don't belong

I see the writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doing their time

That's just a price to play
So tell me what you like
Gotta hand on the kerosene match tonight, right

Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval and a dollar
Got a pretty little body to grind

I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
Watch the fall
You lost my attention
After all
Everybody's doing their time, time</field>

Pitch black vision

Engulf the earth in flames

Damnation cracks the sky

Give life to my last breath

Violence clashes my soul vacant
Cleanse me of all this sin

I bleed filthy
Born of fire
Savor this final hour

Engulf the Earth in flames

So my intentions are known
See I pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of feeling of being damned alone
I got a storybook of my own

Don't you see I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire

Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell ya who not to be

Now you know I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire

Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
Pardon your mind through the chains of the divine
Make way, the shepherd of fire

Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me it's never too late

I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
'Cause I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak

I am your wrath
I am your guilt
I am your lust
And you know it's right
I am your love
I am your stall
I am your trust

Know me by name

Not as I am today
The ugly side of me is strong

Take aim, a loaded gun.
Pull back on all who run.
A coward's truth inside the wrong.

This means war
This means war
This means war

Lash your tongue of bane
Carry me to nowhere
Mental holocaust
Battle never ends
Lie! Mask the pain
Of a child who's forsaken
Lie! To myself
Praise the new regime

I left me long ago
Reasons you'll never know
No one to miss me when I'm gone
With no more words to say
No argument to stay.
Another post I don't belong

This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war

No home to call my own
No finding someone new
No one to break the fall
No one to see me through
No name to carry on
No promise for today
No one to hear the call
No tattered flag to raise

Walk the razor's edge
Cut into the madness
Question all you trust
Buy into the fear
I see the man ripping at my soul now
I, I know the man
I know him all too well

There's nothing here for free
Lost who I want to be
My serpent blood can strike so cold
On any given day
I'll take it all away
Another thought I can't control

This means war
This means war
This means war

Hail to the king (hail, hail, hail, the king)

Blood is spilled while holding keys to the throne
Born again, but it's too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Thail'll escape and learn the price to be paid

Let the water throw it's shades of red now
Arrows black out all the light
Death is rotting in the town with armor
Thail've come to grant you your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

I walk in the noise, quiet employs
And darkness seems to know just where I am

Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die

There are words that never found my lips
There are words I'd soon forget
Thought the trick was never to look back
But it seems I've lost my grip, I slip
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow all the bullets bear my name

Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die

Took the road but should have chased the stars
Now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago, I know
I struck all the matches stuck in the ashes
Forgive me, won't you simply speak my name

Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die

The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now

A world that's void of all the anguish and suffering, pain

Better tame your convictions before you go and open the cage
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find

Never held a high regard for Darwin, selection takes too long
A little kick in the pool shouldn't do us wrong
Devouring the very last invention man would ever need
But exponential growth is a frightening thing, indeed

Sweet bohemian jury rounded up and hung in the streets
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find

Sometimes when I look up to the sky I have to wonder are we "summoning the demon" you and I?

Have you noticed that I'm needin' it more now, more than it needs me
Got a couple of billion that seem to agree
Surfing in an artificial dimension, but we're not alone
Now the master has become just a stepping stone, oh

Like a blow to the ego the bitter pills are harder to take

We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find
We're creating god, in search of the divine

Walking through the candy land of our desires

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm

Hey! It goes beyond big brother in the sky
Beyond the threat of martial law no Horus eye
No one came to cuff you they just handed you the chains
Blind follows the blind and now the one-eyed man is king

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm

Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed

No form of payment, no pot of gold will satisfy the debt of what he's owed
Spilling from the houses in a trance the children lined up on the road
Cursing at the piper as he lured your kids away
And led them to the river for what was their final day
No need for convincing on his pipe he played a song to fool them all
Fooled them all

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorn
And now the fire keeps us (keeps us)

Time seems to wait
(Take me higher)
Promise to see you again

It haunts to remember
All the memories of that day
Pre-flight demonstration
Led to desperate voices fueled by flames
Now I'm out here waitin'
Hoping you would send a sign
Came a million miles
And the earth grows small as I lovingly leave it behind

Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you my friend

We seem to have found it
All the hope we've been denied
There's more than we've been told
Had to find it on the other side
Now I must be dreaming
Face against the frozen glass
But there's no return now
And the blazing worlds salute
As we go flying past

Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you my friend
Light years above
(Take me higher)
Time seems to wait
(Take me higher)
Promise to see you again

Meet you in the stars tonight
There you find me drifting in the ether within the hill</field>

Far too many moons since you felt well and strong
You see, you could say goodbye but you don't have to die
Not ever

Engineer the wires to your brain
Architect a code so you won't feel the pain
With your family by your side and vigor in your eyes forever
Live Forever

I'm way up, a god in size, beyond the reach of mortals
I shed my human side
Farther, O' Father
I stare at my reflection, have I lost that boy inside?
Final paradigm

What's it really mean to be a man?
Think about your answer but please understand
While it's natural to fear, I'll make it disappear forever
I forever

I'm way up, a god in size, beyond the reach of mortals
I shed my human side
Farther, O' Father
I stare at my reflection, have I lost that boy inside?
Final paradigm

Singular I am

I have the question if these thoughts are mine
To live forever but did something in me die?
I'm clawing my skin but I can't feel it inside
I know the agony of pain would hurt so much better

I'm way up so far up
Have I lost myself tonight?
Father, O' Father
Have you lost that boy you used to know?</field>

Tell me were you calm when they took your life?

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

Shared with us the world well before your time
Though they took your voice words forever shine

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

As they spoke your fate a fearless man replied
"As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine"

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true</field>

Reverse the wager I've no means to pay
Toto has pulled back the green tonight, in sight
And blue pills coat with such disdain
I wore the shades for so long
That I've forgotten how to see
The curtain rises but who dares to pull the strings

I know this may be hard for you to believe in all
But you only exist because we allow it

I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?

By the way of cosmic rays
A subtle breakdown jarred the code display
A simulation as I can tell, our cell
Playing out a hopeless scene
We stand to lose all our charm
And faith just seems to wane
A billion years can seem a stunningly short time

You've been beaten down time and time again
But still you find yourself at the center of it all

I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?

You hear me, you had one thing to do, one thing
And you fucked it up, piece of shit

Nurse, patient 666158 needs to be sedated
We need 500 CCs of M
Oh hello there, dearie
I've been expecting you

Posturing the way I feel
Is truth only what we believe is real?
Marvel the sketches that paint the night, starlight
And take a breath before it's all erased away</field>

            <field name="lyrics">We've been through hell. Sewn up our eyes
Found fuel in meds. Viewed through the narrow
Encouraged fear when so inclined
Bought peace through wars that doomed our children to die

Ego is sure to fix the world
Served up to happy boys and girls

I'd make a decision if granted the privilege
But I'm afraid my taste is unrefined
And no one likes cheap wine

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize

You own the burg. We sleep in streets
You dine then waste. We forage to eat
Well who pays the tab when you cross the line?
Who writes the check? Who's herding the swine?

Just takes a fence to rule the roost
As long as the scale has been reduced

How can we see the outside of the pen when survival has possession of our minds?
Calmly walk the line

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous find in an illusion

(Vlader Lauder sat in sorrow
For all his teeth had gone
He drank sweet rum
While fingering his gun
And eyeballed a feast
Not one bite he could eat
Somebody cut off his head!)

Dear radiation my sweet friend
Let agents dance upon my nerves
Let sunlight glow under my skin
Let toxins seep into my soul

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous time I will find in an illusion
It's an illusion</field>

won't leave until you've died
murder born of vengeance
i closed my brothers eyes tonight. it's cold tonight as the clouds turn grey
and from my hands to my brothers grave
you took his side
you took his gift
feel the power of a fallen man
crestfallen man. far away in this land i must go
out of the sight of the one. a punishment sent from his hand
a hardship that no one should know
now go out of the sight of the one
away in this land you must go. where has he gone? what have you done?
a voice commands from high above this earth. from the soil his blood cries out to me
murder
liar

deceit. far away in this land i must go

there's a bed of skeletons waiting for me

they're waiting for my next move
human lives to me seem so unreal
can't see through the fog
see past the stereotype
belief
structure built up in you
i'll tear you down and the one who created you
if they didn't have one how would they act?
if we didn't have hope how would we behave?
would they still feel remorse
if they slaughtered innocent beings?
or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane?
a good friend once told me you are memory
without them we equal nothing
and all i can see is the place i wanna be
suddenly my life was so free
leaves at my feet
blown to the ground
their echoes are reaching my ears
night's coming fast
sun's going down
but keep away from me
keep away from me
we may have created the beginning
mentally
we may have created the beginning
physically
to the end of our human existence

the fear that's in your eyes

The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep
I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head
( I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head
(I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already

Don't waste your time on me you're already

I'm too depressed, to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait, till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault
(Chorus)
I never conquered rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide the time goes by
The tour is over I've survived
I can't wait till I get home
To pass the time in my room alone.</field>

I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, lets make, this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread a thought of our very first kiss
A target that I probably gonna miss
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over

I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say
I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
And later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husbands in jail
This state looks down on sodomy
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23,
And are still more amused by prank phone calls,
What the hell is caller ID?
My friends say
I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in Freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say
I should act my age
What's my age again?
(What's my age again?)
And that's about the time that she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years to go and fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never want to act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
What's my age again?</field>

Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
This place was never the same again
After you came and went
How could you say
you meant anything different to anyone
Standing alone on the street with a cigarette
on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breath for a while
I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is
I'll always be dreaming of you
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Are we alone do you feel it

The sad look on your face
The timing and structure
Did you hear he fucked her
A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing
When I move of failing now
And it happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And i've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
And maybe i'll see you
At a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by
On the arm of that guy
And i'll smile and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's okay
The charade it won't last
When he's gone I won't come back
And it'll happen once again

Sees through the master plan

When the shades have been pulled shut.
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic,
it makes no sense at all.
I'm ripe with things to say,
the words rot and fall away.
If my stupid poem could fix this home,
I'd read it every day
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoyed it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone,
Will you remember this night,
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems, they never solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them every day
We get along so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants,
Then why's there so much pain?
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoyed it this time.
You gave it all away.
It was mine.
So when you're dead and gone,
Will you remember this night,
Twenty years now lost.
It's not right
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoyed it this time.

So when you're dead and gone,
Will you remember this night,
Twenty years now lost.

Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm not coming home
Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm not coming home
Save your breath, I'm nearly

I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down
But all my friends are daring me to come over
So I come over and over and over
So let me buy you a drink
And we'll pretend that you think
That I'm the man of your dreams
Come to life in a dive bar
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh</field>

I no longer dream of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all

Hope it's not the creatures from above

As if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb
What if people knew that these were real

Id leave my closet door open all night
Know the CIA would say
What you hear is all hearsay
Wish someone would tell me what was right
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
I am still the skeptic, yes you know me
(Yes you know me)
Been best friends and will be till we die
(Die)
I got an injection
Of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies
Alright
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday

Dark and scary, ordinary, explanation, information
Nice to know ya, paranoia
Wheres my mother, bio-father

Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil (woah, ohh)

Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that i saw her...there
She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and that made it, i swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gona sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
17 without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin explanation
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, im gona sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
I'll never forget tonight (with the girl at the rock show)
I'll never forget tonight (with the girl at the rock show)
I'll never forget tonight (with the girl at the rock show)

It's useless, my name has made the list
And I wish, I gave you one last kiss

Buy some candy and cigarettes and we'll get in my car

I just want to be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone
My love life was getting so bland
There are only so many ways I can make love with my hand
Sometimes it makes me want to laugh
Sometimes I want to take my toaster in the bath
Because when I'm with you there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just want to be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw

Who's gonna be the odd man out?
I don't want to be the odd man out
Is this going to be the end
Or are you going to be my new girlfriend?.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Never found out why you left him
But this answer begs a question.
To blind to see tomorrow,
to broke to beg or borrow.
Young and Stupid
Left wide open, hearts are wasted
Lives are broken.
One more point of contention,
I need some intervention
Approaching failing tensions
Betray my short attention
Span the distance,
bridge the border,
beg forgiveness,
round the corner.
Everytime I look for you The sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs around.
I left another message, you are never around.
But everytime I look for you - the sun goes down, once more.
Will the last one out, please shut the door.
More time apart will give you
A few more months to argue.
Is this to much to live through
It always seems to far to drive
The point home,
send more letters,
Pray tomorrow,
Ends up better.
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs around.
I left another message, you are never around.
But everytime I look for you - the sun goes down, once more.
Will the last one out, please shut the door.
I never did do anything that she asked,
I never let what happend, stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant.
In spite of everything, in spite of everything..
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
I left another message, you are never around.
But everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs around.
I left another message you are never around.
But everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.</field>

I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy
Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer when you're hurt, for real
Cause you were driving me crazy
By your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start but the end's not too far away
Did you know I'm here to stay
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm and arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy
I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy
By your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start but the end's not too far away

takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous
when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero's just because
(yeah just because)
And my girlfriend
Likes U.L and D.H.C
And she's so smart and independent
I don't think she needs me
quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another
guy that she'd prefer
And when I feel like giving up
like my world is falling down
I show up at 3a.m.
She's still up watching vacation
and I see her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and
I know that everything
know that everything
know that everything
everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything
know that everything
know that everything
everything's gonna be fine
And my girlfriend
takes collect calls from the road
and it doesn't seem to matter
that I'm lacking in the buldge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero's just because
And when I feel like giving up

Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die
Just you wait and see
A school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alo-o-o-o-one?
I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone
Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile
A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

The small morning sun devoured the process
It's always been fun when I get a bit nervous
And it's hard to say but I feel a bit weightless
The more I admit, I feel a bit anxious
The more I go on, the less I can face this
And those rotten things that live in our shadow
We walk on the line of death and the gallows
And hope that we clear a path we can follow
It was the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
It doesn't hurt that much
When I was young, the world it was smaller
The cities were vast, the buildings were taller
I felt really strong-- my parents seemed stronger
But life has a way, it showers with greatness
Then takes it away, those pieces that made us
Then teaches you things you'd never imagine
We all get the same-- the memories, the burdens
The pictures we made, they still form a pattern
They cautiously say, "Does it all matter?"
It was the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
It doesn't hurt that much</field>

Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game
Then I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on anything
But I'd go through hell for you and
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This worlds an ugly place
But youre so beautiful to me
I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass
I'd ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker
I havent been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody

hes got jet black hair and blue green eyes

And every now and then he and i will sit together on the porch
And i take off his pants and i fuck him from behind
And I love him for his mind and soul
And I love his wrinkled scrotum too.
So if you see us passing by on some dreary rainy day
Take a look at the young boy and his naked..

Playing those stupid games as I always end up chasing you
I can't help myself anymore
Rehearsing my thoughts as I'm too scared to come to your door

But now you won't talk to me for something that i didn't do
It's not gonna work
And i'm trying not to think of you
I'm all confused as I think of the things that I would do
I'm all shook up as I get all nervous inside
My emotions are something that I will always hide my way</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You live in a world I cannot believe
You create a world I don't want to see
And your forest's a stand of dead trees
lost in the night
Did you ever think you'd live down the past
You just want to tie yourself to the mast
All your nightmares have come to at last
At least in your mind
Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm
Your hollow accusations no one ever hears
Your wounded senses of pride, a guilty souvenir
All your protests and vacant excuses
ring insincere
I just want to find a car to overturn
I just want to light a fire to watch it burn
Now we're past the point of no return
and no one is here
Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm
You are afraid
Uneducated on where this would lead
Going on for far too long
We are sorry for the greed
Leave us in pieces and places
War torn and wronged
In between whispers and screams
You permeate my soul
Lost between nightmares and dreams
You decimate this home
Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile
Forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this
Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would
If they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing something else
That hides away
But you and me
There're worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round
Yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back
The way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away
The way you do
Elise believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke
And the make-believe ran out...
So Elise
It doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile
Forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this
And every time I try to pick it up
Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands
But there's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else
I can really do
At all...

At night when i go to bed
and I know it sounds lame
but she's the girl of my dreams
And of course I'd do anything for her
I'd search the moons of Endor
I'd even walk naked through the deserts of Tatooine
Princess Leia where are you in the night
and who's laying there by your side
Every night i fall asleep with you
and I wake up alone
And even though I'm not as cool as Han
i still want to be your man
You're exactly the kind of Alderranian that I need
But when you when you were available
I was drinking colt 45's with Lando
I was hanging out in the cantina on Mos Eisley
Princess Leia where are you in the night
and who's laying there by your side
Every night i fall asleep with you
and I wake up alone
Princess Leia Princess Leia
Princess Leia where are you in the night
and who's laying there by your side
Every night i fall asleep with you
and I wake up alone</field>

I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I traced the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed, to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
(Chorus)
I never conquered rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait, till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault
(Chorus)
I never conquered rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide the time goes by
The tour is over I've survived
I can't wait till I get home
To pass the time in my room alone.</field>

I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy
Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer when you're hurt, for real
Cause you were driving me crazy
By your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start but the end's not too far away
Did you know I'm here to stay
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm and arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy
I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy
By your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever

Hope it's not the creatures from above

As if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb
What if people knew that these were real

Id leave my closet door open all night
Know the CIA would say
What you hear is all hearsay
Wish someone would tell me what was right
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
I am still the skeptic, yes you know me
(Yes you know me)
Been best friends and will be till we die
(Die)
I got an injection
Of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies
Alright
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
Dark and scary, ordinary, explanation, information
Nice to know ya, paranoia
Wheres my mother, bio-father
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
Twelve majestic lies...</field>

Surprises let me know she cares

Not in the mood, not just to justify
Not in the mood to think of what a lie

You always play to win
I don't need rehabilitating
I think I'm on another world with you (with you)
I'm on another planet with you (with you)
Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet
Space travel's in my blood
And there ain't nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out
Oh god, you know we won't live without it

Another planet, forever holding you down

Run out the back door
He's passed out on the floor
Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob
I think he humped the dog
But good things come to those who wait
Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21
White lies, bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol
Stole it from the mall
How's Chris marked with lipstick
Better call their fathers
Sleeping with your daughters
But good things come to those who wait
Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21
You dont belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
Too bad youre wrong, dont need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb
Turn low the radio
I think I hear my dad
Yelling at the band
But good things come to those who wait
Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21
You dont belong, you left the kids to carry on

Too bad you're wrong, dont need a mom dad slave drive song

We need guidance, we've been misled
Young and hostile, but not stupid.
Corporate leaders, politicians
kids can't vote, adults elect them
laws that rule the school and workplace,
signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe.
We really need to see this through,
we never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
if we're fucked up you're to blame
Let this train wreck burn more slowly,
kids are victims in this story
Drown the youth with useless warnings
teenage rules, they're fucked and boring
We really need to see this through,
we never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use

But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving
The good intentions that you had
now only came to this
and although she saw the mark the arrow missed
It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting
When routine gets boring
Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good
But some good things must end
And she said it could never survive
With such differing lives
One home one out on tour again
We may never come back
The strike of the match
The candle burning at both ends
And now she knows too much and I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move
I'll pretend that I'm fine
Show up right on time
But I know I'll never be that cool
I never wanted to hold you back
I just wanted to hold on
But my chance is gone
I know just where I stand
A boy trapped in the body of a man
And I'll take what you're willing to give
And I'll teach myself to live
With a walk-on part of a background shot
from a movie I'm not in
She's so important
and I'm so retarded
And now I realize
I should have kissed you in LA
but I drove home all alone
as if I had a choice anyway
Where are you coming from
What are you running from
is it so hard to see
And if you're feeling scared
remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything (everything)
You know that it meant everything to me
You know that it meant everything to me.</field>

With a good reason, a warning sign
This place is void of all passion
If you can imagine it's easy if you try
Believe me I failed this effort
I wrote a reminder this wasn't a vision
This time where are you Houston
Is somebody out there will somebody listen
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you
My head is made up of memories
Most of them useless delusions
This room is bored of rehearsal
And sick of the boundaries
I miss you so much
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I

I hope I won't forget you
Should I go back should I go back should I

Should I go back should I go back should I

Ladies and gentlemen, for your listening pleasure, Blink)
Passively one day as the sun rose out of it's house
So did this little old guy as he whistled out of his mouth
And happily and gay
Well I guessed exactly that
Because he found a special girl
That put him in a special trance
He fell in love so quickly
What the hell was he to expect
That the girl under his arm wasn't the same
As any other girl
That he had thought that he once met
I guess you could only blame fate
Things started getting weird as they started to kiss
She often felt his beard and remembered how her father she missed
And then quietly one day
He sang a song from deep within his heart
Causing some ingestion
He finished with a great big fart and
She knew at that one moment
That song was something she heard before
So she asked him to do that again
Then out the door they hurried
She was gonna find out for sure
So she analyzed his rear end
She said, "When I was a little girl my dad left my mom.
He used to always fart and sing this special song.
Now I wasn't quite so sure until your pants did fall.
'Cause now I know that your my dad because you use ben wah balls."
I said a wah, wah, wah-wah-wah,
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah...
I said a wah, wah, wah-wah-wah,
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah....</field>

Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm not coming home
Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm not coming home
Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down
But all my friends are daring me to come over
So I come over and over and over
So let me buy you a drink
And we'll pretend that you think
That I'm the man of your dreams
Come to life in a dive bar
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

            <field name="lyrics">Here nights are foggy and weird
Everyone I trust just disappears
Breathing life into my deepest fears
Take, now there's nothing to take
Now you're haunted by your worst mistakes
Watch me sinking underneath the waves
I don't wanna drink about it (staring down)
Driving out at 3 am (no way out)
My head is full, my mind is cloudy
(and then I woke up broken)
Finally make it here again
(too much, too much, too much)
Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note in red
If you need me
I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me
I'll be right here
Air, leave it up in the air
'Cause the people on the ground don't care
They don't notice but it's everywhere
Chase, now there's nothing to chase
Every day I feel so out of place
Let me wash away without a trace
I don't wanna drink about it (staring down)
Driving out at 3 am (no way out)
My head is full, my mind is cloudy
(and then I woke up broken)
Finally make it here again
(too much, too much, too much)
Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note in red
If you need me
I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me
I'll be right here
I'm out here in the deep end
I'm lower than I've ever been
I burn it down, it turns to smoke
And when I see the morning
It's colder than it's ever been
My bloodshot eyes see through the smoke
Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note in red
If you need me
I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me
I'll be right here</field>

The faint and broken-hearted
Hold it up, I've got something I cannot hide
Worst painkiller, that all-in filler
The apart and departed look in my eyes
Sad, how far you ran
I'll search this land
Up through the clouds
Then back here
We could reignite
Like fireflies
Like an atom bomb
At all hours
I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say and so goodnight
I will follow the trail to tomorrow
With my loneliness with sorrow all through the night
Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers
Just the bridges and the waters
Their clues left behind
Sad, how far you ran
I'll search this land
Up through the clouds
Then back here
We could reignite
Like fireflies
Like an atom bomb
At all hours
I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say and so goodnight
I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say and so goodnight
There's nothing left to say and so goodnight
Goodnight</field>

Maybe I'm afraid of commitment
Maybe you're too distracted to see that
Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel
I think of all the things I'd say to you if I had the chance again
I think of all the things I'd scream
But I think it's for the best
That you and I just don't connect and
Things are never quite what they seem
Will there ever be
Someone to give her heart to me
Or would I be to blind to see it
I wouldn't make a sound
I'd keep it underground
It always seems like I'm running around around
Running around around
Round
Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel</field>

Good things haven't happened yet
I'm empty as a movie set

Hey here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey here's to you California
Wearing all black out on the beach
Faces I've seen in magazines
Let's take a walk out on the pier
Watch the shoreline disappear

Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die
Just you wait and see
A school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alo-o-o-o-one?
I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone
Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile
A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
Just you wait and see
As school life is a

A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing
When I move of failing now
And it happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And i've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
And maybe i'll see you
At a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by
On the arm of that guy
And i'll smile and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's okay
The charade it won't last
When he's gone I won't come back
And it'll happen once again

when an XKE pulled up on the right.
He pulled down the window of his shiny new jag,
and challenged me then and there to a drag.
I said "You're on buddy, my mills runnin fine, let's come off theline now at Sunset and Vine.
I'll go you one better if you've got the nerve, lets race all theway to 'Dead Man's Curve.'"
Ooh ooh ooh Deadman's Curve
ooh ooh ooh Deadman's Curve
Won't come back from Deadman's Curve
The street was desserted late friday night
We were buggin eachother while we sat at the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green-
you should've heard the whine from my screamin machine
I flew passed the LaBrea, Schwabs, and Crescent Heights,
and all that Jag could see were my 6 tail lights.
He passed me at Doheny and I started to swerve.
I pulled her out and there we were at Deadman's Curve.
Ooh ooh ooh
"Well the last thing I remember doc, I started to swerve"
"And then I saw the jag slide into the curve..I'll never forgetthat horrible sight."
"And this I found out for myelf: that everyone was right."
Won't come back from Deadman's Curve
deadman's curve (ooh ooh ooh) to fade

naked at night
Bent over to show some moonlight
Pulled out some beer and gulped it down
Nude in a gutter is how I was found
Thrown in a police car and the door slammed
no noise just silence as I screamed my dick was jammed
Now in prison for one month no one to see
All I got is this guy Ben Dover
Don't like hesh-don't like rap-
kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat-
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower cause I stunk-
Smoked a bong killed a cat-
had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude-I wore a thong-
For a hobby I make bombs
Went to a farm to tip some cows
Forgot that I left my pants down
Bent over to pick them up
Felt a twelve gauge next to my humdididum
The famer took me to his house
Showed me the closet from the inside out
The police came and took me away
Saw Ben Dover again and he's still gay
Don't like hesh-don't like rap-
kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat-
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower cause I stunk-
Smoked a bong killed a cat-
had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude-I wore a thong-
For a hobby I make bombs

I fell through
Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me
Because I blew it once before
Shit dad
Please don't kick my ass
I now i've seen you trashed at least one time
Can I blame it
On one of my dumb friends
It's been awhile since i've used that line
You couldn't wait

Disaster, disaster
Fall comes a loaded gun
Black ties for everyone
Can you read my mind
Fall in my arms again
Grey stones that break apart
French braids demonic art
The dead come alive
Fall in my arms again
Again
I'm scared of the dark my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Hold on you're breaking up
Disaster, disaster
Disaster, disaster
White stones of hollow eyes
Death comes you better hide
Never rest in town
Fall in my arms again
Full moon on a rotten night
Eighteen and a wind came by
Not a soul around
Fall in my arms again
Again
I'm scared of the dark my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Your soul it will float like a dove
Your words they will scream out our love
Your lips they will stutter with flavor
You can't shake the taste of the blood
Hold on you're breaking up
(Breaking up)
I'm scared of the dark my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Your soul it will float like a dove
Your words they will scream out our love
Your lips they will stutter with flavor
You can't shake the taste of the blood
Hold on you're breaking up

Who tells them all to laugh?
Who tells them all to talk about me?
And I'm not sure what my purpose is for being here
Why do they, why do they
Always kick me in the groin when I come near
And I'm not complaining it just hurts after a bit.
I don't know what I'm feeling
I'm just so sick of seeing
All those dumb, lame, and retarded broads
Who often just sit kick back
As I am not so relaxed
I often wonder why they act so odd
Because no worse a time
When it's just your time to
Think you should make your move
It doesn't work as your just a jerk with no excuse
What about that situation
All night procrastination
Takes you to the point when you lead her to her door
There is nothing left there to say
I guess you best be on your way
But before you go you got to do that chore
No worse a time
When it's just your time to
Think you should make your move
It doesn't work as your just a jerk with no excuse
Please won't you buy in
I'm always tryin'
I keep on tryin'
There's only so much pride that I can lose
I hope that when you see me
You see right through me
Come on now, honestly
I'm so sick of endin' up without a clue.</field>

Paranoia my paranoia
Can't let it go, it never lets me go

Forecast into the freezing cold
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
I'm the last and the first in a very sad set of eyes
To the bone, to the knees, to the factory line
I am numb to the shot, I have a crippling fear of heights
'Cause the fall sounds a lot like a symphony of cries
Your only hope is burning down the chapel
All getting washed out with the tide
We need to find some middle ground
It's always sex or suicide
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs

And I don't think that I'm better than you inside
And you can take off your disguise
Cause I can see the truth that's hidden
Behind your eyes
And all those words that you don't say just mean less and less each day
You can't make me shed a tear
I think about tomorrow
Another day of sorrow
But I don't think that I'll be here
And I don't want your lies
And I don't think that I'm better than you inside

I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there

Your alright without me

Its long way back to the middle of the road
Finding our way back home
It dont mean

I'm the one and only son you never had
I'll be fine without you
Late at night I hear you grab your coat and car keys
You'll be fine without me

Because they are rarely honest
What's with the jokes, all the routines they play
Screw with my head, now I cave in 'till they their way
Guys like to run, chicks like to yell, you see
Guys hate to fight, girls think it's therapy
Hold on, hold on

Down down down down

Another guy, you think itd be unlikely
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me
Shes a dove, shes a fuckin nightmare
Unpredictable, its my mistake to stay here
On the go and its way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
I heard it once, Im sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you havent got a chance now
Shes a dove, shes a fuckin nightmare

You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail
He's a player, diarrhea giver, tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to Slayer
I'd like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up
She found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies
Be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe
I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heartache
He's a fuckin weasel
Decisions make my mind ache
Want to make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl chose the one guy who makes you want to kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy who took and ran away

And I know you feel empty all the time
You'll never listen to anything that I say
She's better off sleeping on the floor
Because she fell right off
When all is said
You know it's okay to just want more
Why leave when you claim it is love
But why stay when you're not the only one
She's proved she's strong
Be brave be strong
She's better off sleeping on the floor

But this answer begs a question.
To blind to see tomorrow,
to broke to beg or borrow.
Young and Stupid
Left wide open, hearts are wasted
Lives are broken.
One more point of contention,
I need some intervention
Approaching failing tensions
Betray my short attention
Span the distance,
bridge the border,
beg forgiveness,
round the corner.
Everytime I look for you The sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs around.
I left another message, you are never around.
But everytime I look for you - the sun goes down, once more.
Will the last one out, please shut the door.
More time apart will give you
A few more months to argue.
Is this to much to live through
It always seems to far to drive
The point home,
send more letters,
Pray tomorrow,
Ends up better.
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs around.
I left another message, you are never around.
But everytime I look for you - the sun goes down, once more.
Will the last one out, please shut the door.
I never did do anything that she asked,
I never let what happend, stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant.
In spite of everything, in spite of everything..
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
I left another message, you are never around.
But everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs around.
I left another message you are never around.
But everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.</field>

Show me the way to bed

Fuck it, it's such a blur

I love all the things you do
(I'm feeling this)
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear
(I'm feeling this)
Our breathing has got too loud
(I'm feeling this)
Show me the bedroom floor
(I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror
(I'm feeling this)
We're taking this way to slow
(I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here
(I'm feeling this)
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
This place was never the same again
After you came and went
How could you say
you meant anything different to anyone
Standing alone on the street with a cigarette
on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breath for a while
I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is
I'll always be dreaming of you
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Are we alone do you feel it
so lost and disillusioned</field>

This air is too thick to breathe so just drive
These eyes are too sick to see, don't leave me behind
Something's swimming in my blood, something's rotting in my brain
When I'm smothered from the blood I can't recognize your face
I need to leave so just drive
It's getting too thick to breathe, so just drive
This eyes are to sick to see you leave me behind
Something's swimming in my blood
Something sweating in my brain
Looks like another flood, I can't recognize your face
I need you to just drive
Burning lights on the street
I'm fight fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated
They'll take you away from me
Dead and lost in a dream
This is the last of me
I'm always fighting the gravity
Tonight is too much for me to give in
Tomorrow is just the darkling hall to an empty room and
Far away from you
Burning lights on the street
I'm fight fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated
They'll take you away from me
Dead and lost in a dream
This is the last of me
I'm always fighting the gravity
I'm always fighting the gravity

To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think its lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, lets make, this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread a thought of our very first kiss
A target that I probably gonna miss
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, lets make, this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, lets make, this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

Lets make this last forever

Her subtle hint of life is so innocent and scary
So tell me that you're here boy, she says as if she knows
When God took her with time, God made me quite alone
It's like the universe has left me, without a place to go
Without a hint of light, to watch the movement glow
And our song was slowly starting, your memory felt so real
At first against my will, but god invented chills
Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal
The kids are in a hurry and I'm just full of fear
The lights make bodies blurry, It's getting hard enough to hear
It's like the evidence is cared for, and evidently clear
If I never leave this dancefloor, I'll never leave you here
Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal
I felt your ghost tonight, and God it felt like hell
To know you're almost mine, but dreams are all I feel
Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, it fucking hurt like hell
I felt you here tonight, but dreams can't all be real</field>

Mom get in the car and let's drive away
She said I'm sorry mark but there's nowhere to stay
Gave up all her hope and went back inside
Hid her broken heart and let the engine die
Go go go go

Why do evil men get away with it
Can't you see that I'm in a world of shit
Turn your back on hope and go back inside
Stop my bleeding heart and let the engine die

And I wont forget you
I'll write you once a week she said
Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game
Then I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on anything
But I'd go through hell for you and
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This worlds an ugly place
But youre so beautiful to me
I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass
I'd ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker
I havent been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place
But you're so beautiful.</field>

Sometimes I just don't know where I belong
Save yourself, we're always saying
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
Gone through hell the battles, we fought
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
You're not the only one who grew up feeling scared
You're not the only broken heart gone on repair
Everyone's gone missing
Everyone's done wrong
Sometimes we both fly too close to the sun
Save yourself, we're always saying
We're not the same we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
Gone through hell the battles, we fought
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days

We're getting out

We're not growing up

We fell in love by the side of the road
This desert will break you down
The veins you cut
Your smoking tongue is the end of us all
But you only care about
Fame and fortune
Watching others tortured
Casting your reflection
Grocery store perfection
This is the last time
Sent to the front line
With dirty boots on the ground
You said I'll make this all mine
You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone
Yeah your heart's all gone
Blackjack and architect
Let's drink ourselves to death
The crimes of everyone
Passed down from father to son
Hopeless and destitute
Destroyed my gratitude
Your strongest lines of defense
Are all just self-inflicted wounds
You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone
You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone
Yeah your heart's all gone
You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone
You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong

Apologize for the past
Talk some shit take it back
Are we cursed to this life
Fuck I can't let this kill me

Do one thing for me tonight

The last star left in heaven
Is falling down to earth and
Do you still feel the same way
Do you still feel the same way
Fuck I can't let this kill me
let go

Everything you've ever hoped for
Waiting there outside your front door
Bleeding to death
Everything you've never wanted
Here to seem just like that haunted place
They say for everyones dying breath
Hey I'm sorry I lost the melody

Hey I'm sorry I lost your memory

When we fall asleep I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day
Are you alone with all your thoughts
Your suitcase full of books you bought
The war we fought and all the battles fought
In spite of search exceeding expense
Everything you've ever hoped for
Waiting there outside your front door
Bleeding to death
Everything you've never wanted
Here to seem just like that haunted place

The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep
I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head
( I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head

'Cause joy is something they don't bring me
My girlfriend is by my side
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice
Their whiny voices get irritating
It's Christmas time again
So I stand with a dead smile on my face
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste
Oh God, I hate these Satan's helpers
And then I guess I must have snapped
Because I grabbed the baseball bat
And made them all run for shelter
Its Christmas time, again
Its time to be nice to the people you cant stand, all year
Im growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you dont wanna get beat down
Just leave the presents and leave me alone
Well, I guess its not cool to freak on Christmas Eve
Cause the cops came and arrested me
They had an unfair advantage
And even though the jail didn't have a tree
Christmas came a night early
Cause a guy named Bubba unwrapped my package
I wont be home, I wont be home for Christmas
I wont be home, I wont be home for Christmas</field>

I will go down as your lover, your friend
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you</field>

(im not sure that the chorus is right
i just went with what i thought sounded semi-close).

for 2nd verse, i'd just play the chorus, just alot softer.

'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
I'll see you around
And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again
Just yesterday
It always seemed like such a dream
We're unstoppable, indestructable
Nothing happens to our machine
And there's no harm
At least nothing we can see
As for you, not so true
You couldn't choose whose road he would lead
What a loss
You just lost all your sleep
And we've always thought
That this could never happen, you see
That it's so hard
You gotta get up on your feet
'Cause the only way, I gotta say
Is to move on through the week
Don't bite your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around
And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again
I'm Sorry
I'm Sorry
I'm Sorry
I'm Sorry
(Sorry...) It's happened to you
(Sorry...) It's happened to you
(Sorry...) It's happened to you
(Sorry...) It's happened to you
Don't bite your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around
And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again

The minds of people who try to discuss
A light will shine through
When no one can save you
And you feel
The eyes of people who try to decide
You'll find yourself lost
Inside of the chaos

The truth is never far away
You always give yourself a way
[I can't even smile]
Through open eye, a slide of him
Won't you reveal to me?
Reveal to me...
The world is filled with
The lives of people who try to define
The lines that find you
Can anyone save you?
Go down the hall
Drink from the bottle
And never go home
No one's to blame
We're always the same
[We're always the same]
The truth is never far away
You always give yourself a way
[I can't even smile]
Through open eyes, a slide of him
Won't you reveal to me?
The truth is never far away
You only have yourself to blame

Through open eyes, a slide of him

takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous
when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero's just because
(yeah just because)
And my girlfriend
Likes U.L and D.H.C
And she's so smart and independent
I don't think she needs me
quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another
guy that she'd prefer
And when I feel like giving up
like my world is falling down
I show up at 3a.m.
She's still up watching vacation
and I see her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and
I know that everything
know that everything
know that everything
everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything
know that everything
know that everything
everything's gonna be fine
And my girlfriend
takes collect calls from the road
and it doesn't seem to matter
that I'm lacking in the buldge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero's just because
And when I feel like giving up
like my world is falling down
I show up at 3a.m.
She's still up watching vacation

Stop draining the color out of my scene
Just play me something I can dance to
I can dance to anything you wanna sing
So lock me up in the studio
Fill it up with sound and scenarios
Stop blocking the driveway with your car
Put the butterfly in the bell jar
It's the first time that I'm worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey, on the highway
Through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's a long road
Hear a stranger's voice in the front yard
Let the arrow's tip past the deadline
Get another stamp in your passport
Wash your breakfast down with some red wine
Delete the progress on your game
Try to fall asleep while your ears ring
From the loudest songs on your mixtape
I can dance to anything you wanna sing
No reason, no action, no silence, no help here
Nobody came running up by my side
It's the first time that I'm worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey, on the highway
Through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's the first time that I'm worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey, on the highway
Through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's a long road
To get it right
It's the first time that I'm worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey, on the highway
Through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's a long road</field>

When there was once so much to do
Was once a green mansion, but now it's a wasteland
Our days of wreckless fun are through
Go!
Kids in a fast lane living for today
No rules to abide by and no one to obey
Sex, drugs and fun is their only thought and care
Another swig of brew another overnight affair
House of the filthy, house not a home
House of destruction where the lurkers roamed
House that belonged to all the homeless kids
House of the filthy, house not a home
House of destruction where the lurkers roamed
House that belonged to all the homeless kids
Kids of the black hole
Messages and slogans are the primary decor
History's recorded in a clutter on the floor
Inhabitants that searched the grounds for roaches or spare change
Another night of chaos is so easy to arrange
House of the filthy, house not a home
House of destruction where the lurkers roamed
House that belonged to all the homeless kids
House of the filthy, house not a home
House of destruction where the lurkers roamed
House that belonged to all the homeless kids
Kids of the black hole
The nights of birthdays
The nights of fry
The nights of endless drinking
The nights of violence
The nights of noise
The nights that had to end for good, still not understood, by the girls and boys
Carefree in their actions as for morals they had none
When the girls were horny who would be the lucky ones?
Pushing all the limits to a point of no return
Trashed beyond belief to show the kids don't wanna learn
House of the filthy, house not a home
House of destruction where the lurkers roamed
House that belonged to all the homeless kids
House of the filthy, house not a home
House of destruction where the lurkers roamed
House that belonged to all the homeless kids
House of the filthy, house not a home
House of destruction where the lurkers roamed
House that belonged to all the homeless kids
House of the filthy, house not a home

It's Friday night let's lose our minds
In a downward spiral
Here we go
Because we got no control
Friday nights always save my life
From the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands
Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend
I can feel my head falling off my neck
I need something to keep going
So just take my hand only second's left
The clock's running our time's coming</field>

The summer air is way too sweet
The way I feel inside is worse than poison
Washed up standing on a beach
Something inside is incomplete
I numb the pain for one more night of mourning
This is the one last time
I promise one last time
I'll take the last train home
(The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
(The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
(The only time I feel alive
is when I find something I would die for)
The last train home
I'll take the last train home
(The only time I feel alive
is when I find something I would die for)
The last train home
The tidal wave and aftermath
I'm seasick from the years we've passed
Adrift at sea with no one left to rescue
Tonic and a fifth of Gin
She said goodbye and left again
These empty rooms are deafening without you
This is one last time
I promise one last time
I'll take the last train home
(The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
(The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
(The only time I feel alive
is when I find something I would die for)
The last train home
I'll take the last train home
(The only time I feel alive
is when I find something I would die for)
The last train home
Life's so strange
Time won't change
The world slips by, unafraid
and she never cared much anyway
Life's so strange
I'll take the last train home
(The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
(The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
(The only time I feel alive
is when I find something I would die for)
The last train home
I'll take the last train home

Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded, cards are folded
Under the moonlight
Can you remember
you remember the last time we woke up sober?
Can you remember
you remember the last night you ran me over?
Are we halfway gone or halfway there?
Left alone we're only halfway home
Sink like stones, fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under, slowly drown
I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder
Mind is open, thoughts are woken
There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken, love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight
Can you remember
you remember the last time I left hungover?
Can you remember
you remember the last night that I stayed over?
Are we halfway gone or halfway there?
Left alone we're only halfway home
Sink like stones, fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you

All's fair in love and war
until you say it isn't but you're wrong
Words on the back of flyers
My clothes are in the dryer
It means nothing
Nothing is changing La familia is dead and gone
The children grew up and moved on
Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time
I'm only asking for what is mine
It wanted everything
I got it now I'm gonna throw it away
I'll throw it away yeah
Prime select and a box of glazed
Pulling fly-bys on days
When we were young and innocent
Elbow drop sundays
When mark eaton got beat to shit
Laughing at the bands we hate
all the spots we used to skate
They're still there but we've gone our own ways
I know it's for the best
But sometimes I wonder
Will I ever have friends like you again
Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time
I'm only asking for what is mine
It wanted everything
I got it now I'm gonna throw it away
I'll throw it away yeah
(repeat)
You're gonna drown in the mess you make
You self-inflicted hate
You turn you back on the friends yo lose
When they don't follow all your rules
But people are what they want to be
They're not lemmings to the sea
maybe it's time that you looked at yourself
Stop blaming life on someone else</field>

Wrote a song, on an old guitar
But the words were wrong
they made you walk away
Said I could have anything I wanted
forevermore
Said I could be anyone I wanted
but I was bored
Every day, turns into sleepless nights
My head is spinning with the sadness
of a long lost feeling
Golden years, where I would smash the mirrors
My head is spinning with the sadness
of a long lost feeling
Found a wreck on the ocean floor
Like a tidal wave you washed it all away
Heard a song, on the radio
All the words were right, it made me wanna stay
Said I could have anything I wanted
forevermore
Said I could be anyone I wanted
but I was bored
Every day, turns into sleepless nights
My head is spinning with the sadness

Glitter on the highway
Glitter on the front porch
Glitter on the hallway
Well the Love Shack is a little place where we can get together
Love Shack baby! Love Shack baby!
Love Shack, that's where it's at! Love Shack, that's where it's at!
Huggin' and a kissin', dancin' and a lovin', wearin' next to nothing
Cause it's hot as an oven
The whole shack shimmies,
When everybody's movin' around and around and around!
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin' baby!
Folks linin' up outside just to get down
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin' baby
Funky little shack! Funky little shack!
Hop in my Chrysler, it's as big as a whale and it's about to set sail!
I got me a car, it seats about 20
So come on and bring your jukebox money.
Well the Love Shack is a little place where we can get together
Love Shack baby, Love Shack bay-bee.
Love Shack, baby Love Shack, Love Shack, baby Love Shack!
Bang bang bang on the door baby! Knock a little louder sugar!
Bang bang bang on the door baby! I can't hear you!
Bang bang! On the door baby
Bang bang! On the door
Bang bang! On the door baby
Bang bang!
You're what?..
Tin roof, rusted!
Love Shack, baby Love Shack, Love Shack, baby Love Shack!
Love Shack, baby Love Shack, Love Shack, baby Love Shack!
A lot of love at the love shack</field>

I just want to be alone with your smile
Buy some candy and cigarettes and we'll get in my car
We'll blast the stereo and we'll drive to Madagascar
Because when I'm with you there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just want to be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone
My love life was getting so bland
There are only so many ways I can make love with my hand
Sometimes it makes me want to laugh
Sometimes I want to take my toaster in the bath
Because when I'm with you there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just want to be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone
Who's gonna be the odd man out?
I don't want to be the odd man out
Is this going to be the end
Or are you going to be my new girlfriend?.</field>

Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone
Let's take some time to talk this over
You're out of line and rarely sober
We can't depend on your excuses
Cause in the end it's fucking useless
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long
I remember shots without a chaser
Absent minded thoughts now you're a stranger
Cover up the scars put on your gameface
Left you in the bar to try and save face
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long
So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over

There's so much more that I needed and

soon we'll all be gone
Man on a mission can't say I miss him around
Insider information, hand in your resignation
Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found
Tight lipped procrastination
Yeah later, see you around.</field>

No matter what I do
I've always assumed that
I can't go on sucking on my thumb
Sifting through my toys
Resting at my door
After thinking that I couldn't read
Sitting on the porch
And waiting for porno
While sucking on my damn fugi
I don't know why
I just want to die
And here's 2 bucks for you
This is the part where I should really part
But I guess I've got nothing to do
I don't know why
I just want to die
And here's 2 bucks for you
This is the part where I should really part
But I guess I've got nothing to do
What'd our grandma think of me
All that I've got to do
Guess I should its a wonder
My breath
its how the streets cave in everyday
Oh how the antelopes
Tom's thumb just walked right through my nose
What'd our grandma think of me
All that I've got to do
Guess I should its a wonder</field>

Break down in L.A.
Giving up, giving in to a feeling of violence
There's hell to pay
So let's light another match, stop living in the past
Where nobody can hear me now
Blow the lock off the cage, watch the children come of age
When their parents stop to take a bow
Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Maybe there's no one there at all
Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong when everything you loved is gone
Slow down and stop living in the shadow of a helicopter
Line 'em up on the wall, coming out with their hands up
Give 'em all the chair
Let it burn, let it fall, let the end of the world come
Who's left to care?
Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Nothing takes root, though they bend and toil
Maybe there's no one there at all
Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong when everything you loved is gone
Slow down and stop living in the shadow of a helicopter
Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong when everything you loved is gone
Slow down and stop living in the shadow of a helicopter
Stop living in the shadow of a helicopter</field>

I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Pulled me up, underneath this heavy burden
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach
Torn apart like broken hearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge
so I won't find my way home
Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company when I'm bent
When I cracked, when I'm broken
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach (Out of reach)
Torn apart like broken hearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
Fifteen times a night
When the sun's gone down
In the dark awake and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day
When you ckeck your phone
And I won't be there, and you're all alone
Because we always lived in the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way
through a Hitchcook film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
Because it's only fun on the edge of oblivion
(Oblivion)
Torn apart like broken hearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone</field>

She has her curlers set,
Her credit cards are paying the funds
Hes not that old, I've been told a strong sexual goal
He goes out every day, she goes every way, oh yeah
And they don't even care at all
She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they typically
They starve for attention before
She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt
He wants to bone, this I know she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight, oh yeah
And they don't even care at all
She's open waiting for more

And it is way too unhealthy

Cause I have the time and the liberty
To play with my pet sally
Please don't go away, sally please
No more lonely showers and uneaten foods
My salamander has hygiene too
And he thinks of me the way I think of you
The only next step is for him to say I do
Sally please don't go away
I won't be living in yesterday
The lonely nights
Getting beat up by gays in bar fights</field>

I am the prodigal son, a shameful prodigy too
I am the love of your life, battering ram and confused
I turn each day into night, I stand there waiting for you
There is desire to fight, but I have nothing to prove
With the crowd and some lights, I start to feel things move
Do you have something to hide? 'Cause I think that we all do
I am a child inside, back up and give me some room
I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night, a fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home
Don't start to panic for me, 'cause I have nothing to lose
I am as bright as the sun, I burn up all that I choose
Up on the side of the field I see a city with lights
I touch her face when I kneel, she tells me she's not alive
I am too nervous to run, the kids who scatter and hide
Still reach and grab for someone, but end up buried alive
Her world is waiting for me, a world that I rarely used
I start to feel my feet, they kick down walls as they move
I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night, a fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home
I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night, a fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside
So let me go, go
So let me go, go

The next day the sun will always rise
Every day that you waste
Every promise you break
Slips beneath the floor
It's a permanent state from a moment's mistake
But life's worth so much more
You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
They don't care about you
No future!
Let the music seal your fate
You can run but life won't wait
They don't care about you
No future!
She said that it's to late to try
Someday I'll smile and say goodbye
Every night that you fight
Every demon in sight sleeping on the floor
Wide awake from the dream,
with a shake and a scream
Hope for so much more
You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
They don't care about you
No future!
Let the music seal your fate
You can run but life won't wait

And I wish, I gave you one last kiss

Forget when I don't meet expectations,
Everything you wished came true,
In the end we all blamed you,
Even though as they all know,
You weren't the only one (two three four)
Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I gotta wonder why you'd leave it out for me.
Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard, I'm hating everything
Please don't remind me, put your past behind me,
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
Am I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend
And if we can have another day,
I've got so much left to say, i'd tell you everything
And i'll laugh when I think about the past,
When I see you after class you're hating everything
Please don't remind me, put your past behind me,
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
Am I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend
Please don't remind me, put your past behind me,
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
Am I am not fine, last night I saw you online

On our way to the show
Chicago
Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Oxblood traces of the night before
We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss? "
We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
We are the broken
No end in sight
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
There's no use trying
We lost the war
Now the dead and dying
Are back to even the score
We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na

You got you got you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue

Mistakes are hard to undo
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong
I think it's disgusting believing and trusting
If I gave a fuck there would be nothing for me to prove
Although it's amusing it's slightly confusing
I've done all I can but her ego is still hard to move
You got you got you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue
No one no one no one likes a drop out
Mistakes are hard to undo
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I know what it's like to be alone sitting in your room
Listening to all the doubts that your parents have to say to you
And as your head gets all cluttered inside
Try to stay awake
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take
So hold in all your aggresions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin
It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be you're not alone
I know what it's like to be denied at everything you do
It's not the same reason why that
Makes you change the things that you once knew
As your head gets all cluttered inside
Give more than you take
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take
So hold in all your aggresions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin
It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be you're not alone
You say you want to take off your shoes and
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week (Go!)
You say you want to take off your shoes just to
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week
So hold in all your aggresions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin
It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be you're not alone.</field>

I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had
I hope, hope that it lasts
Give in, forget the past
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest this breaks my heart

Why did we have to go date?
Its too easy to complicate
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest,this breaks my heart

Wake up and see someone else's morals
What right to you
Might be true
It's a different point of view to you
You cannot see things that are different to me
And I can't understand why you cannot see
The things that I cannot see
I see what you don't see
I see what you don't see
Turn around and the shadows are all around me
Two different people, two different places
Through a one way window with two different faces
Agreements are not reached, faces are forgotten

            <field name="lyrics">Nineteen, your eyes are glowing into my beating heart,
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm,
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts.
I've got my eye on you, whatca gonna do?
Day dream near a stream with a winter bite,
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night,
And I can't picture you, but I sure got the feeling right,
What a crazy world, pretty little girl.
And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise,
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news,
When you reach for my hand I was scared in your room,
We fell on the floor and we started to move,
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop,
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued.
She said, if you break my heart then I'll change your mind,
And I'll do it again.
If you play the part then I will play mine,
And I'll do it again.
If we miss the mark, if we hold on tight,
We'll be there to try it again.
Nineteen, as we roll across the bedroom floor,
Your eyes, they came alight as you're dreaming
of our future home,
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old,
What a crazy world, pretty little girl.
In the rain, with a drink from the back of the bar,
I'm raising my voice, you raise it up more,
We forget that our lives have been apart it is hard,
We thought we are close but it still feels far,
And we learn to get by if we learn to have scars,
We learn to forgive and except who we are.
You said, if you break my heart then I'll change your mind,
And I'll do it again.
If you play the part then I will play mine,
And I'll do it again.
If we miss the mark, if we hold on tight,
We'll be there to do it again.
Wait a minute, hold up a second,
Don't leave me here with this feeling,
Like I'm the one for regretting,
Like I never did coke for a spoke,
Like I never did pulled out that weapon,
And stick that knife through my back,
Was I supposed to except it, when your words are like,
More than just sticks and stones, kinda like a bullet,
I don't tip that lies in my bones and I can't just swallow it,
My pride is more than all that I own, so I gotta give it away,
Some of the times I'm all the way wrong, but can't you see past,
Me and see my fucked up home, that made me the meanest,
The devil is just singin alone to the song I write, to alone at night,
And I hang up the phone, and bite my tongue,
Cause I know that me and you is just only right, but one?
It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot,
Every year has been great and a few have been tough,
And the kids they will reach for the stars up above,
I said, relax as we're cheering them on,
All the ropes to the life from the crypt to the grave,
We started alone, in the end we're ok.
You said, if you break my heart then I'll change your mind,
And I'll do it again.
If you play the part then I will play mine,
And I'll do it again.
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight,
We'll be there to try it again.</field>

I can't listen no more
It's late, so shut up
Is one night too much to ask for?
You are a haunted house
You're superstitious
You are the coldest stone carved marble faces
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again
This bed, on fire
I can't sleep here no more
Too late and tired
Dreaming down on the floor
I am a haunted house
I'm superstitious
I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
(I won't fall down, I won't fall down)
I'm barely standing on the ground
(Barely standing on the ground)
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

Somethings wrong,
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song, to lead you on
I learned a lot today
Not sure if i'll get laid and
Not sure if i'll fail or pass
Kissed every girl in class
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up, when it's all done.
On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong,
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song, to lead you on
Break the truth
With more bad news
He left a scar, size: extra large
Sip a drink of the alcohol
End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and movements slow
Too high, got vertigo
He took a shit in the bathroom tub
And fed the dog the brownie drugs
Tried hard to not get caught
He fucked a chick in a parking lot.
On and on, reckless abandon
Somethings wrong,
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song, to lead you on
Break the truth
With more bad news
He left a scar, size: extra large
Break a window and bust a wall.
Making fun of your friends mom
Turn the music up way too loud.
Charge the pizza to the house.
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done
On and on, reckless abandon
Somethings wrong,
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song, to lead you on

Jealousy for you and me

Act like I'm not around
The coast will probably never clear
Can I please go home now?
I had that dream
About you again
Where I wait outside
Until you let me in
And there I stay
Lay beside me
And listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying
Until the summer comes
I had that dream
About you again
Where you drive my car
Right off a fucking cliff
And now I'm breathing deeply
Walking backwards
Finding strength
To call and ask her
Roller coaster
Favorite ride
Let me kiss you
One last time
Make me promise
That I will never tell
All I remember's
The way your bedroom smells
I had that dream
About you again
Where I wait outside
Until you let me in
And now I'm breathing deeply
Walking backwards
Finding strength
To call and ask her
Roller coaster
Favorite ride
Let me kiss you

The kind that repeatedly say no
But that's alright
I'm older than you so I've got time
What have you said, reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time
We've all seen the bridge
A broken seam and a girl on one side
You think your words will work
They only work when you lay down and close your eyes
I thought of all the lines
All the right ones used at all the wrong times
But that's alright
Depression's just a sarcastic state of mind
What have you said, reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time
I don't want to live alone
I don't want to live in
My broken dreams of you
I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you
I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you.</field>

She creeps up like a spider, and wants you deep inside her

Cause good girls who like to sin
Way back at the starting line
Where Eve was on Adam's mind
And he was the first to go
In search of the great unknown
And falling yet again
Cause good girls, they like to sin
You are a hero and survivor, your eyes are getting tired
There's claw marks under your spine, it happens all the time
The silent evil daughters, like sirens on the water
You've been the perfect crime, it happens all the time

And he was the first to go
In search of the great unknown
And falling yet again
Cause good girls, they like to sin
That's how it was to all begin
Cause good girls who like to sin
Way back at the starting line
Where Eve was on Adam's mind
And he was the first to go
In search of the great unknown
And falling yet again
Cause good girls, they like to sin</field>

But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober
I woke up in the pouring rain
West side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye
Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you really got me now
Black sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night
I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober
She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell on to the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside
And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together
I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober</field>

Moments of peace that just slip through me so fast
Just when I think that they are gonna stay
Everything inside me just starts fading away
Sometimes it seems like all I hope for
Just gets thrown down on the floor
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that I could run away
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say
She looks at me and doesn't know the words to say
But it's not you, I just don't feel quite right today
All these things I say and do were never planned
But how the fuck am I supposed to make you understand that
Sometimes it seems like all I hope for
Just gets thrown down on the floor
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that I could run away
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say.</field>

When the shades have been pulled shut.
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic,
it makes no sense at all.
I'm ripe with things to say,
the words rot and fall away.
If my stupid poem could fix this home,
I'd read it every day
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoyed it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone,
Will you remember this night,
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems, they never solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them every day
We get along so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants,
Then why's there so much pain?
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoyed it this time.
You gave it all away.
It was mine.
So when you're dead and gone,
Will you remember this night,
Twenty years now lost.
It's not right
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoyed it this time.
You gave it all away.
It was mine.
So when you're dead and gone,
Will you remember this night,
Twenty years now lost.
It's not right.

I wish I could explain myself
But words escape me
It's too late
To save me
You're too late
You're too late
You're cold with disappointment
While I'm drowning in the next room
The last contagious victim of this plague between us
I'm sick with apprehension
I'm crippled from exhaustion
And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me

            <field name="lyrics">Push it out
Fake a smile
Avert disaster
Just in time.
I need a drink
Cause in a while
Worthless answer
From friends of mine.
It's dumb to ask
Cool to ignore
Girls posess me
But they're never mine
I made my entrance
Avoided hazards
Checked my engine
I fell behind
I fell behind
She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this, like the prom.
I get too scared to move, cause I'm a fuckin' boy.
Remember when
I was in
The grocery store
Now's my time
Lost the words
Lost the nerve
Lost the girl
Left the line
I would wish
Upon a star
But that star
It doesn't shine
So read my book
With a boring ending
A short story
Of a lonely guy.
Who fell behind
She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this, like the prom.
I get too scared to move, cause I'm a fuckin' boy.
She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm alway's nervous on days like this, like the prom.
I get too scared to move, cause I'm still just a stupid
Worthless boy.</field>

But the signal seems to disappear
So what's the problem Houston's calling

Like a handgun in a firefight
Dive in slow motion towards the ocean
Let's run away
Let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright
We're teenage satellites
I'm kind of nervous of the consequence
As we climb over the neighbor's fence
The longest summer's nights are numbered
Then you kissed me like a storm at sea
Like I'm the only one you'll ever need
We're left abandoned in the deep end
Let's run away
Let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright
We're teenage satellites
We are a slow descent
Forgotten astronauts
We are an avalanche
We're just an afterthought
Let's run away
Let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright
We're teenage satellites</field>

In a big apartment house
She's living with her boyfriend now
She drives off every day for school and work
She washes dishes now
And watches tv on the pull out couch
But every day's the same x2
And every day's the same x5
White girl moved back to the suburbs
And she finally found a man
Who knows how to take care of her
She bought the perfect little house
And the lawn's well manicured
And she'd never missed a day of work
And every day's the same x7
White girl couldn't go on knowing
She was just here wasting her time
She drowned in the lake last night
They found her bloated body floating
But she still walks around
Performing all her daily chores
She still don't know what life's about
She still don't know what life's about
Cause every day's the same
And every day's the same x6.</field>

it would be be nice if things would turn out right, turn out right, yeah.
don't think I'll ever see the day.
I must have done something wrong or maybe pissed off God.
I, I think of chinese food when i think of life-
its sweet and sour
my lifes as sweet as saccharin
you know three week old milk and grapes are not the same, they're not the same, no
i am the one johnny carcinogen
i must have fucked with some witch, in turn she cursed me, cursed my life
At the end of the longest line
thats where i will always be
if you need to find me, you just go to the end of the longest line
"But officer that was a yellow light," "The ligt was red, son."
isobordanation, reckless driving.
i must be wrong, this can't be right, i don't belong-
this world is much too dangerous.
for someone lacking luck like me

Then you showed up and it began to heal
Cause you're the only thing that matters
Cause you're the only thing that's real
Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
Cause you're the only thing I feel
Someday you'll come back to me
And I'll say something bitterly
And you'll go racing toward the kitchen
Grab a knife erase my vision
Take may flatscreen television
And my paintings by Marilyn Manson
Cause you're the only thing that matters
Cause you're the only thing that's real
Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go

My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30
This things at a frat house but people are cool there
Reluctantly I followed but I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
Said I paid my 3 and the girls got in free
Shined the beer for tequila and we headed into the party
And than in the backyard some terrible ska band
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame all the girls look the same
All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed
In my bed back at home watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from anywhere state
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party
And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blond hair
She wasn't wearing underwear, at least I prayed that
She might be the one, maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sunrise
But that night I learned some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With they way that they dress
With those things on their chests
And the things they suggest to me
I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping, the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys
How she's down with the wise well-constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless then sit here and hate this
Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party
So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blond hair
She won't be wearing underwear, and you'll discover
This girl's not the one, and she'll never be fun
You should just turn and run because you'll find out that
Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With they way that they dress
With those things on their chests
And the things they suggest to me
Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard</field>

Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that i saw her...there
She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and that made it, i swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gona sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
17 without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin explanation
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, im gona sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
I'll never forget tonight (with the girl at the rock show)
I'll never forget tonight (with the girl at the rock show)
I'll never forget tonight (with the girl at the rock show)

The stage is slowly crumbling
Smash boards and try to stay alive
A few drinks and you love broken lights
Go hide and call the cavalry
Let's dance in perfect harmony
Get close, the crowd will come apart

And time runs your life

The difference between east and west
Money is so much less
Not that I`m poor, just to fine
I wish that the clock would often just be stopped
And then we'd look
Into the time

time to wake up
where's your daughter?
hurt's to break up
she was stronger
all my friends say
please don't love her
what did i gain? now
i miss her so
i used to hate the lipstick
it stained and tasted so sick
the pantyhose and the bras
she threw on my guitars
Shit Fuck I made a mistake
i thought i needed a break
the truth is i'm such a dick
it's broke and can't be fixed.

But now I'm a man who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say
To me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step ahead to
Hear from you again
Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I'd
Much rather be riding prone, than
Be just another one you are lame to
Don't talk to me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step ahead to
Hear from you again
Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I'd
Much rather be riding prone, than
To be just another one you are lame to.</field>

There's no one like him in all the world
'Cause you can always see
Those girls down on there knees
In those dark sweaty rooms
Planning out his thoughts
He's waiting for just the right
One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more
He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at 'cause
He is the one that scores
I saw my friend there
Out on the field today
I asked him where he's going, he said
"All the way," now
One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more
He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at 'cause
He is the one that scores
Go!.</field>

She dresses like a man
shes not as feminine as she used to be before
now she is so damned masculine
I close my eyes my moms not a woman anymore
shes wearing a disguise
everytime she leaves through that door
my moms not quite the same
as she was in the past
if I misbehave she kicks my ass
my moms not quite the woman that she was before
when my friends come over
she likes to wrestle them down to the floor my
moms a transvestite.</field>

I never dreamed that I'd spend my days
Staring at some tube emitting cathode rays
I need my TV
What's happening in this world, I don't care at all
But it better not pre-empt Monday Night Football
I can't even come up with my own views
I'm taught how to think from the evening news, oh

We might have had it all
I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow
But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you
But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long.

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night
You have your other friends
They were there when you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't leave your side
But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long
It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night!
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now Like I let you down then
So Sorry, It's Over

All around our life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again
With a friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs
And still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills,
The kind that kills when the pain begins to start
We'll get this straight
Do you want me here?
As I struggle through
Each and every year
And all these demons,
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
Everyone's cross to bear's a crown
They wear on endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world
That changes life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights,
Stays up all night to celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale
Of how we die alone some day
We'll get this straight
Do you want me here?
As I struggle through
Each and every year
And all these demons,
They keep me up all night

And each time you walk right on by
CHORUS
Like violence you have me forever and after
Like violence you kill me forever and after
Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims are left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still as you fall asleep(fall asleep)
Like violence you have me forever and after
Like violence you kill me forever and after
Like violence you have me forever and after
Like violence you kill me
Like violence you have me forever and after
[Lady Voice:]
My dearest
I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together
And will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come
I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately
I've read you're letter through at least 4 times
And will probably read it more times before I'm through
I've been sitting here
Looking at you're picture and getting more home sick every minute
I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of
Except of course you, yourself
I keep thinking of you darling
Keep wishing I could be home with you
I want to leave in the worst possible way so I can come home to see you But:
Things don't look so good on that subject
This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now
I'm completely lost without you darling
I've never realized I could miss anyone person so much
I just hope it won't be too much longer till I'm able to be with you again
And live a sane and normal life.</field>

The lonely guy I am, I'll wait for her to changee
I've been here two days, I'll sure be here tomorrow
I'd eat her all if she were on my dinner plate
(And I wish)
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home
I can't be too cool in a tree with my pants down
The air is cold and I've got splinters in my feet
She caught me once, but I don't think that she cares now
Unlike before, her view is now blocked by a leaf
(And I wish)
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home
I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning through my head
Right after supper her brother shower's twice a week
He kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred
I've made mistakes by looking in the wrong window
Her dad is big and I've never seen his face
I've been here two days, and I'll sure be here tomorrow
My lady's so sweet, she likes to entertain
(And I wish)
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home
I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning in my head
Right after supper her brother shower's twice a week

as I drive away
wishing that I could take back all those words that meant nothing
that I didn't say
I'm trying to be what you want me to be
But it's so damn hard to keep playing the part of the fool
week after week
I think you need some time alone
You say you want someone to callyour own
Open you eyes
you can suck in your pride
you can live your life all on your own
I this all going to be just another time
that we play this game
I've tried to convice you that things could be different
but somehow they end up the same
But what did you expect from me
What am I supposed to do
you say that you're starting to fell like you're getting lost
Well I do too
I'm not gonna live this lie again
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when
I'll open my eyes
Iv'e got somethin inside
I'll just jack off in my room until then
It's never over till its done
and I don't think that you're the one (4x).</field>

And stealing her away from her world
She and I would run away
I think of all the things that I'd say
We'd talk about important things
And I picture it in my dreams
She'd teach me about modern art
And I'd show her it's okay to fart and
Maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her
Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and wondering if I'm
Sitting at home, thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time
Remembering how she laughed at Kinko's
When I made fun of that guy
Remebering the look she gave me
When I told her that I used to fry
I really want to ask her out
But my ego could never take it
And even if I got the balls
You know that the Cougar would never make it
And in my town you can't drive naked
And maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her
Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and wondering if I'm
Sitting at home, thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Wasting my time thinking about a girl</field>

Can't forget
Can't give in
What went wrong?
‘Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life
I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place, it's fucking cursed
In it's plague
And I can never escape
When my heart, it explodes
I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in

You fucked up my life

I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out, and she took off my pants

Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say
I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
And later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husbands in jail
This state looks down on sodomy
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23,
And are still more amused by prank phone calls,
What the hell is caller ID?
My friends say
I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in Freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?

I should act my age
What's my age again?
(What's my age again?)
And that's about the time that she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years to go and fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never want to act my age

The small morning sun devoured the process
It's always been fun when I get a bit nervous
And it's hard to say but I feel a bit weightless
The more I admit, I feel a bit anxious
The more I go on, the less I can face this
And those rotten things that live in our shadow
We walk on the line of death and the gallows
And hope that we clear a path we can follow
It was the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
It doesn't hurt that much
When I was young, the world it was smaller
The cities were vast, the buildings were taller
I felt really strong-- my parents seemed stronger
But life has a way, it showers with greatness
Then takes it away, those pieces that made us
Then teaches you things you'd never imagine
We all get the same-- the memories, the burdens
The pictures we made, they still form a pattern
They cautiously say, "Does it all matter?"
It was the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
It doesn't hurt that much</field>

Did he tell you that he loved you
Did he hold you untill the sun did rise
And did he look into your eyes
And ask you to falate him
And stick a finger or two in his ass
[Chorus]
He seems like a to-tal asshole
Grand-pa is a total fucking asshole
Who would ever want a dirty greasy finger in his ass
He rubs his dick in broken glass
When you fucked grandpa
Did he kiss you soft and tender?
Did he tie your hands behind your head
And was it on your mothers bed?
[*Chorus sung softly under these words*]
This is fucking stupid man
I cant believe you have sex with your own grandpa!
I mean you guys are related!
Whats he gunna do?
Take out his false teeth?
And just lay them on the side of your bed?
Man you like to fuck him in the bum
And have everyone come in and watch and masturbate?
Come on this place is stupid! I hate you all
Im not even gunna have sex with my mom tonight!
Common this is stupid!
I Hate you!</field>

Taking your last breath
Counting down the time

Strike a match and start a wildfire
I'll own all my mistakes
Won't give you what you take
Watch you burning in the wildfire

Watching me fall
All the time I wasted
Learning to crawl
From the ashes as this world comes crashing down

I kinda lost my way, I can't find it
And I caught a short ride
To the grave and back this season
I can try to get by
But every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy
A bit strange and a little bit manic
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharper rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land
On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading

Why do you say what you don't mean?
To those people who don't care about one thing that you might
need
And you just don't know
Your actions always shine the most
To those people who don't care if you end up alone
You need some time to sew
All those bridges that you burned
'Cause there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn
Have you made up your mind?
How have you known what you decide
To those people who just think that you are telling lies
So I give up
I made it clear as it can be
To those people who don't care about one thing that you might
need
You need some time to sew
All those bridges that you burned
'Cause there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn
Oh, you need some time to sew
All those bridges that you burned
'Cause there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn</field>

I'm saying what I've said all along
Because I know the things that are important to me
Because life is too short to be long
And those thoughts
That I've kept inside
With those words
That I could not hide
Before those times that always remind me
That all I ever did was try
So change your tune one step to make a stand
I want to speak my mind start my own african tribe
I'm alone, Now run into the deepest pile of shit
Cause that's where I'm going to blend in...
go!
Those choices that I've never made
With those decisions that once cut me a break
Cause after all what's left in the end
There's somethings that they just can't take
So take a bow
Well you're not that great
Go pat your back
Go off and masturbate
Cause one thing that you know for sure
Your hand is not a lonesome date</field>

So tell me how it should be!
Try to find out what makes you tick
As I lie down
Sore and sick
Do you like that?
Do you like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate
And I don't mind
Just let me say that I like that
I like that
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be!
Desperate, I will crawl
Waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone
What have I become?

Return to ash, defeated after all

Let go, we know this kind of life
We live, we breathe, we die
They call me to the light
Forever lost inside
With every dream we find
We feed, we burn, we lie

Fade away to the wicked world we left

Skin white as winter

I fall relieved, violent and empty
Alive to see, suffer in silence alone
Into your eyes I live

We'll break these chains

Oh light, carry me over the ground

Love won't lie
Tell me it's over, so long

I feel no more, the suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, inside my skin
It's no longer human, it's a beast, a merciful, ferocious, fearless
You're a madman
Tampering with nature
Every man's ambitions
Carry me through this world alive (of lie)
I feel no more, the suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, inside my skin
Carry me through this world alive (of lie)
(Fight the animal)
I feel no more, the suffering
(Fight the animal)
Bury me in this cold light
(Fight the animal)
I feed the wolf, inside my skin</field>

One at a time,
Ready to play,

We've got to move,
Steady the helm.

Fire your guns,
It's time to roll,
Blow me away,
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall,
We'll shake it off,
Show me the way.
[Chorus]
Only the strongest will survive,
Lead me to heaven when we die,
I am a shadow on the wall,
I'll be the one to save us all.
There's nothing left,
So save your breath,
Lying in wait.
(Caught inside this tidal wave)
Your cover's blown,
Nowhere to go,
Holding your fate.
(Loaded I will walk alone)
[Bridge]
Fire your guns,
It's time to roll,
Blow me away,

After the fall,
We'll shake it off,
Show me the way.

Only the strongest will survive,
Lead me to heaven when we die,

Lead me to heaven when we die,

Well mannered gardens well tempered seas
We're gathered in reason I should believe
That this is different that this feels free
How could this be
I'm on my way to better days
I'll find my faith, I'll find a way
I'm on my way to better days
I'll find my faith
I will slip again, and you'll find me
I will live again, and you'll find me
Run, but carry the meanings of your past
I'm on my way to better days
You'll find your faith, you'll find a way
You're on your way to better days, you'll find your faith
Oh
I'm on our way to better days
We'll find our faith, we'll find a way
We're on our way to better days,
We'll find our faith, we'll find a way
We're on our way to betters days,
We'll find our faith
I'm on my way

I have nothing here
Sick of all that was
Tired of all that is
Every hated love
I have broken in
Sick of fucking up
Tired of falling in
And all that I regret
I have before, I will again
Its over now
(Are you running away?)
I come apart
(As I lie awake!)
Its in my blood
(Let the sky fall down!)
I wont let go
(My oblivion!)
Counting every breath
I am my own fear
Nothing ever was
Nothing ever is
Every halo lost
I am worn within
Nothing left to harm
Nothing left to live
And all that I regret
I have before, I will again
Its over now
(Are you running away?)
I come apart
(As I lie awake!)
Its in my blood
(Let the sky fall down!)
I wont let go
(My oblivion!)
Face the monster Ive become
(And fight! I will not become!)
In the ground we rise to burn
(Maybe your life will let me love!)
Forgive my heart
Its over now
I come apart
Its in my blood
(Let the sky fall down!)
I wont let go
(My oblivion!)</field>

One at a time,
Ready to play,

No time to lose,
We've got to move,
Steady the helm.

Fire your guns,
It's time to roll,
Blow me away,
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall,
We'll shake it off,
Show me the way.
[Chorus]
Only the strongest will survive,
Lead me to heaven when we die,
I am a shadow on the wall,
I'll be the one to save us all.
There's nothing left,
So save your breath,
Lying in wait.
(Caught inside this tidal wave)
Your cover's blown,
Nowhere to go,
Holding your fate.
(Loaded I will walk alone)

Fire your guns,
It's time to roll,
Blow me away,

Tear the whole world down
Failure
Tired of feeling lost
Tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down
Tear the whole world down
Tired of wasted breath
Tired of nothing left
Tear the whole world down
Tear the whole world down
We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight
Failure, failure
We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight
Failure, failure
Failure</field>

I chain the beast crawling inside myself
I hear the call of violence
I sleep no more and I can't
I've lost it all
Carry me through this world alive (of lie)
I feel no more, the suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, inside my skin
I can see the devil closing in
I choke the breath that dies to cry for help
I feel the pull of gravity
I bleed no more, and rise again
I've lost it all
Carry me through this world alive (of lie)
I feel no more, the suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, inside my skin
It's no longer human, it's a beast, a merciful, ferocious, fearless
You're a madman
Tampering with nature
Every man's ambitions
Carry me through this world alive (of lie)
I feel no more, the suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, inside my skin
Carry me through this world alive (of lie)
(Fight the animal)
I feel no more, the suffering
(Fight the animal)
Bury me in this cold light
(Fight the animal)
I feed the wolf, inside my skin</field>

But I caught your lie and you know I did, now I'm lost in you,
Like I always do and i'd die to win, cause I'm born to lose
Firefly could you shine your light,
Now I know your ways, cause they're just like mine,
Now I'm justified, as I fall in line,
And it's hard to try, when you're open wide
Take my hand, we'll be off and then, we'll come back again
To a different land, now I like this way, you can go away,
If you guess the name you cannot replace
Firefly could you shine your light,
Now I know your ways, cause they're just like mine,
Now I'm justified, as I fall in line,
And it's hard to try, when you're open wide
Bring me your enemies
Lay them before me, and walk away, walk away, walk away!
Firefly could you shine your light,
Now I know your ways, cause they're just like mine,
Now I'm justified, as I fall in line,
And it's hard to try, when you're open wide
Fuck you, firefly have you lost your light, now I hate your ways
Cause they're just like mine, so you've lost my friend such a
Sorry end and I don't know why, so I choke and smile, smile!</field>

It's a sign, I get it, I wanna stay
By the time I lose it I'm not afraid
I'm alive but I can Surely fake it
How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me
You're the part of me that I don't wanna see
Forget it
There's a place I see you follow me
Just a taste of all that might come to be
I'm alone but holding breath you can breathe
To question every answer counted
Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way
Forget it
It's a crime you let it happen to me
Out of mind, I love it, easy to please
Nevermind, forget it, just memories
On a page inside a spiral notebook
Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way
I can live forever here
Forget it
How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me
You're a part of me that I don't wanna see
I can live forever here</field>

Light up the sky
I'm all out of breath
My walls are closing in
Days go by
Give me a sign
Come back to the end
The shepherd of the damned
I can feel you falling away
No longer the lost
No longer the same
And I can see you starting to break
I'll keep you alive
If you show me the way
Forever - and ever
the scars will remain
I'm falling apart
Leave me here forever in the dark
Daylight dies
Blackout the sky
Does anyone care?
Is anybody there?
Take this life
Empty inside
I'm already dead
I'll rise to fall again
I can feel you falling away
No longer the lost
No longer the same
And I can see you starting to break
I'll keep you alive
If you show me the way
Forever - and ever
the scars will remain
I'm falling apart
Leave me here forever in the dark
God help me I've come undone
Out of the light of the sun
God help me I've come undone
Out of the light of the sun

No longer the lost
No longer the same
And I can see you starting to break
I'll keep you alive
If you show me the way
Forever - and ever
the scars will remain
Give me a sign
There's something buried in the words
Give me a sign
Your tears are adding to the flood
Just give me a sign
there's something buried in the words

Your tears are adding to the flood
Just give me a sign
There's something buried in the words

And hate what you've become
Intoxicated eyes
No longer live that life
You should have learned by now
I'll burn this whole world down
I need some peace of mind
No fear of what's behind
You think you've won this fight
You've only lost your mind
You had to have it all

The lonely road
The one that I should try to walk alone

You wouldn't like me
Keep moving on until forever ends
Don't try to fight me
The beauty queen has lost her crown again
So here we are

The one that I should try to walk alone
I'll be home tonight
Take a breath and softly say goodbye
Goodbye
So why are you so eager to betray ?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up
So why are you the one that walks away ?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up
So here we are

Escape the pain inside
'Cause I don't want to fall
Or let you go
Love left me hollow
I'm with you in the end
Cold, crippled, and shallow
Don't leave me here again
Fruit of life
I can hear the voices of the hive
Chemicals collide
Loaded smile
Light the way for those you left behind
Set the earth on fire
'Cause I don't want enough
I want it all
Love left me hollow
I'm with you in the end
Cold, crippled, and shallow
Don't leave me here again
I can't go on
You are bound to break me in
I come undone
Don't you drag me down again
I've come undone!
Love left me hollow
I'm with you in the end
Cold, crippled, and shallow
Don't leave me here again

There's a yellow brick road

'Cause I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Like home
I've, got a southern belle too
And ruby red shoes
And a body of straw
Are you sick of it all?
There's a man made of tin
With an oil can grin
And I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too
There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home
And I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
And you let me go down
To the end of the road
And the black and the white
A technicolorful life
Can I stand by your side?
We can make it alright
Like home
'Cause I'm home
There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
And you let me go down
To the end of the road
And the black and the white
A technicolorful life
Then another arrived
It's a cowardly lion
What I want from this world
What I wanna resolve
When I want you to stay
So I want you to wait
I don't wanna be bold
I don't wanna be cold
I don't wanna grow old
I don't wanna grow old</field>

Hopeless
I'm falling down
Filthy
I can't wake up
I can not hold on
I will not let go
Worthless
It's over now
Guilty
There's no way out
I can not hold on
I will not let go
Silent I go under
I am not afraid
I can see the daylight shine
And slowly drift away
Safe to say it's over
Sink into the grave
There is nothing left inside
But I am wide awake
I can hear the devil call my name
Hopeless
I'm falling down
Filthy

Fall
Watch the end through dying eyes

Take the fall and run to Heaven

Bothered by the part we end,

Dead if I can't make it out.

I am frail and withered
Cover up the wounds
That I can't hide
Walls that lie between us
The saint within the sinner
I have lost the nerve
But it's all right
Carry the wounded and shut your eyes
All will be forgiven
None will rise
Bury the fallen and lead the blind
I will fight the loss
Dead inside
Into the nothing
Faded and weary
I won't leave and let you fall behind
Live for the dying
Heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive
Leave me at the bottom
I am lost forever
Letters from the dead
Say goodbye
Sorrow falls upon us
This will be the last time
Days begin to end
But I'll get by
Follow the hopeless
And shut your eyes
All will be abandoned
None will shine
Gather the broken and leave this life
Lying in the earth
Side by side
Into the nothing
Faded and weary
I won't leave and let you fall behind
Live for the dying
Heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive
I'll keep you inside
Where I lead you cannot follow
Straight into the light
As my breath grows still and shallow
Into the nothing
Faded and weary
I won't leave and let them fall behind
Live for the dying
Heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive
Stay with me
You're all I have left
I know we can make it out alive
Stay with me

You have failed to find what's left
I will suck you dry again
Same are not worth saving
You are such a pretty mess
I will choke the life within
Now you want to take me down
As if I even care
I am the monster in your head
And I thought you'd learn by now
It seems you haven't yet
I am the venom in your skin
And now your life
Is broken
After the lights go out on you
After your worthless life is through
I will remember how you scream
I can't afford to care
I can't afford to care
I am suffocating
You have failed to pull me in
I will drag you down again
Life is unrelenting
Feeding lies into my head
i will feed the lies you live
Now you want to take me down
As if I even care
I am the monster in your head
And I thought you'd learn by now
It seems you haven't yet
I am the venom in your skin
And now your life
Is broken
After the lights go out on you
After your worthless life is through
I will remember how you scream
I can't afford to care

Never again, never again

Sober and silent, faded and violent
Hopeless I fight to fall between
Never Surrender, out of the embers
Save a space inside for me

While I bend to your will
I've felatted myself
Tied to the needle
My drunk libido
Mind your own ego
The faster we go
You are an asshole
King of the castle
I am the meager
Follow the leader
Would you want to
Feel the way that I do?
While I bend to your will
I've felatted myself
And I know that you don't
Like the way that it goes
We're all in so begin
But just remember:

Your cover's blown
Nowhere to go

Or just the notion love,
Of a heart to wrap around so I can find my way around
Safe to say from here,
Your getting closer now,
We are never sad cause we are not allowed to be
Rain rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.
Rain rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.
To lie here under you,
Is all that I could ever do,
To lie here under you is all,
To lie here under you is all that i could ever do,

There's no way that I'm running away
I'm used to making it worse
Made up of four letter words
You wanna know what it was
Now isolated and gone
You fall apart at the seams

suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
what did you say
willing to drown in a tidal wave
take me away
let believe that you're on your way
look what you did
suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
I'm on the floor
battered and bored
you got a taste
I can't ignore
I'm all alone
out in the cold
I'll never know
your sugarcoat
you're ready to blow
you're ready to go
but I'll never know
your sugarcoat
is just as sweet as I am
[chorus x 2]
red
your eyes are red</field>

I've lost the hope that I have lived
And now, at last, it comes to pass
We sleep, we dream, we have no less
Along the path we lost our way
It's all a game that I must play
And now the weak that fall
Return to ash, defeated after all
Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you
Let go, we know this kind of life
We live, we breathe, we die
They call me to the light
Forever lost inside
With every dream we find
We feed, we burn, we lie
The fall of humankind
The everlasting light
Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you
Let go
Save this selfish world
Let go
Save this selfish world
Let go
Save this selfish world
Let go
Save this selfish world</field>

No!
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be!
Try to find out what makes you tick
As I lie down
Sore and sick
Do you like that?
Do you like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate
And I don't mind
Just let me say that I like that
I like that
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be!
Desperate, I will crawl
Waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone
What have I become?
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane

I still try to find my place

Bury the wounds deep inside
Rupture the fault line breaking
Dream of the world left behind
Show us we're worth forsaking

Darkness is overtaking
And when the fear is satisfied
I'll be forever changing
As we all realize
So I'll wait for you

As I open up the sky

Follow the sun light down
Cry clear and loud
Heaven won't help us now
But it's better this way
Warm light wash me away
So I'll wait for you

Deface the life inside of me
Drain the heart with atrophy

Full of fear, ever clear.

Curious, venemous, you'll find me, climbing to heaven.
Nevermind, turn back time.
You'll be fine, I will get left behind.
Show me what it's like to dream in black and white,
So I can leave this world tonight.
Holding on too tight.
Breathe the breath of life,
So I can leave this world behind.
It only hurts just once.
They're only broken bones.
Hide the hate inside.

So I will go on until the end.
Surround me, it's easy to fall apart completely.
I feel you creeping up again (in my head).
It's over, no longer,
I feel it growing colder.
I knew this day would come to end
so let this life begin.
Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough, it never is
So I will go on until the end.
We've become desolate.
It's not enough, it never is.
But I will go on until the end.
I've lost my way.

Living is hard enough without you fucking up
Why give up, why give in?

Let it go
If you could
When love dies in the end

Your sick twisted smile
As I lay underneath
Your cold jaded eyes
Now you turn the tide on me
'Cause you're so unkind
I will always be here
For the rest of my life
Here we go
Does it hurt
Say goodbye
to this world
I will not
Be undone
Come to life
It gets worse
All in all
You're no good
You don't cry
Like you should
I'll be gone
when you fall
Your sad life
Says it all
So I'll find what lies beneath
Your sick twisted smile
As I lay underneath
Your cold jaded eyes
Now you turn the tide on me
'Cause you're so unkind
I will always be here
For the rest of my life
Don't carry me under
You're the Devil in disguise
God sing for the hopeless
I'm the one you left behind
So I'll find what lies beneath
Your sick twisted smile
As I lay underneath
Your cold jaded eyes
Now you turn the tide on me

Oh, I've done it again
Dug a little deep and it's all caved in
Now I free fall in a black hole

No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
Don't swear to God he never asked you (Oh no)
It's not his heart you drove a knife through (Oh no)
It's not his world you turned inside out (Oh no)
Now his tears still rolling down (You're so damn cold)
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold (You're so damn cold)
Don't you know you've lost control? (Oh)
Forget about the things you think I know (Oh)
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)
No secrets, you can't keep me

I think we're too close for comfort
So now don't rock the boat
Don't calm the storm
God already gave you his answer
Think you're sorry, it's over
The whistle has been blown now
Think you got the wrong number
I'm breaking up
Wanna make a connection
Can't get no reception
Leave a message after the tone
'Cause it's got my head running 24 7
I don't know if I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
(Everybody's full of...)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Don't move a muscle
No, we can't have a struggle
But the "situation is in control"
So play pretend that it's all good
You could tell the Messiah
His pants are on fire
I'll politely decline
I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand
Then block out all the sadness
Lalalalalalalala
'Cause it's got my head running 24 7
I don't know if I can figure it out
It's all messed up
only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
(Yeah, everybody's full of...)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
And it's got my head running 24 7
I don't reckon I can figure it out
It's all messed up
only one thing I know for sure
(We're so fucked)
And we all march on
like we know the way to heaven
Who the hell died and made you the king
We don't know what we want, but we know that we want it
Yeah, we want it, yeah, we want it right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh!
(Fuck you)
Everybody is full of
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
(Oh, now everybody full of...)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
(Every, every, everybody full of...)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

Got a hole in my soul, growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take one more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay, and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?
Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take one more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me

In the universe's magic (Magic) , oh, no

When the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
It still has me choking; it's hard to explain
I know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain
So don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way
to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way

So I wanna hear your mother tongue
And yeah, I could be punching
But I always tend to fluctuate
And I feel sick that I'm buzzing, oh, love, I'm in trouble
I'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place
I never wanna get wet
But I think we're chosen like our fates were woven
And all of those bad choices were left turns on the way</field>

Didn't know what I had planted

I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the true
Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth

Sink to the floor, I sink to the floor
I sink to the floor
Light as a feather, stiff as a board
You were in my dream last night
But your face was someone else's
A twitch in my spine, a mutual disorder
Isolation neophyte
Too afraid to taste your conscience
You march in the dark, little lamb to the slaughter
I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?

I'm not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose
I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we are going to need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell epiphany?
Before the truth will set you free
It'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be
You're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now
One ear and right out the other one
Because all you ever do is chant
the same old mantra
Could I have your attention please
It's time to tap in to your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now your sinking
What were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week
Before the truth will set you free
It'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be
You're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now
One ear and right out the other one
Because all you ever do is chant
the same old mantra
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for is a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
Y'know you gotta work
the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe
Before the truth will set you free
It'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be
You're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free
It'll piss you off

You said the world's already full enough
Of defeated people, and you would not be one
Always a choice to move yourself along
And find better
And I hope that's where you are
Yeah, I know that's where you are
A doppelgänger with a telling scar
I saw the Universe hidden in your heart
Wish I told you this before it got too dark
Where do you start
When you know it has to end?
How a flower in the rain
Only grows more when it's grey
You just shined on brighter
Making gold out of the pain
I can die, but I can't break, you said
You can rule, I won't obey
As long as I'm still smiling
Well, I don't know what to say</field>

You on the edge of your seat
Ain't you got some place to be?
Was hoping the suspense would kill you
Tell me, how would you begin?
Watching and waiting to sink your teeth in
Come on and give me your expert opinion
Ah, fuck it
I settle down in a dump
Heard a crowd screaming "Jump"
So I came to the window
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
I said, "What the fuck have I done? "
They said, "We just want your blood
You know we like you better in limbo"
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue
But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you tryna put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed?
I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me
This is how I grow, it's how I thrive
So why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
(Why you gotta kick me when I'm down?)
Yeah, I know it's all in good fun, but
Don't say it's coming from love now
I see those arms in akimbo
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
And don't set that phaser to stun
'Cause what doesn't kill me, well, it better run like hell
Yeah, you better run like hell
So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue
But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you tryna put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed?
I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me
This is how I grow, it's how I thrive
Remember this line that you crossed?
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no turning back now
Now that you've opened the gates
Corrupted the memory, error, failsafe
(Commence the countdown)
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
Remember this line that you crossed?
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no way to fix us, no
Oh, God, what the fuck have you done?
I loved you like daughters, I loved you like sons
So tell me, yeah tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you tryna to put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed?
I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me
This is how I grow, this is how I thrive
Why you gotta kick me when I'm down?

Yeah I keep picking petals
Got my heart and my head all in the wars
Cos some kid from A n R
in a Patagonia
Said he don't really get it
So I keep picking petals
All I wanna know do you love me anymore
Cos some kid on the gram says he used to be fan
But this shit ain't heavy metal

The world's a funeral, a room of ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kicked the chair but
we, we help tie the rope
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
So come rain on my parade
Cause I want to feel it
Come shove me over the edge
Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back
You must of made some kind of mistake
I asked for death
but instead I'm awake
The devil told me "No room for cheats"
I thought I sold my soul
but he kept the receipt
So leave the lights on I'm coming home
It's getting darker but I carry on
The sun don't shine but it never did
And when it rains, it fucking pours
But I think I like it
And you know that I'm love with the mess
I think I like it
So come rain on my parade
Cause I want to feel it
Come shove me over the edge
Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back
So come rain on my parade
Cause I want to feel it
Come show me over the edge
Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back</field>

Before we make you swallow it
It's moments like this where silence is golden
(And then you speak)
No one wants to hear you
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
I'm begging you to spare me
The pleasure of your company
When did the diamonds leave your bones?
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
No one wants to hear you
(Save your breath)
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
You think that no one sees this
I think it's time you knew the truth
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
When did the diamonds leave your bones?
Leave your bones
You're not a shepard, you're just a sheep
I'll cut my depths of everyone you meet
You're all flesh with no bones
Feed them to the sharks
And throw them to the walls
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break

Like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart
Right from the start
But I couldn't even see
The forest for the trees

Just cos' yours faded
Well hate is gasoline

I've forgotten what I'm on about
Looked on the bright side, got keratitis
And you can't sit there
unless you're righteous
I wear a happy face like I'm Ed Gein
I feel all numb now, is that a feeling?
Like a plastic boxed orange with no peel on
I wanna waste, I wanna waste
I wanna waste away
Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oi, Debbie Downer, what's your problem?
Don't wanna be here, still, call a shotgun
You got the Fomo coursing through my veins
This is not a drill, no, this is the real world
Domesticated, still a little feral
Well, don't you know to chew
with your mouth closed?
And it's all gone wrong
Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life, alright
I got a Type 2 kinda thirstiness
A far-out otherworldliness
And one day this might hurt me less
But everybody knows I'm still down
Don't tell me what the butcher does
There's no need for the obvious
So ugly, still, it's kinda lush
But everybody knows I made vows
Left feet on the podium
Can't think of an alternate
And, hell yeah, I'm the awkwardest
But everybody knows I got bounce
Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life

Says I'm better off dead

You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got
And it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fucking louder

Don't wake us up
We'd rather just keep dreaming
Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles, I'm going round in circles
The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay

Sing along
Let's sing along

A little fucking louder

When I cut you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here?
Do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim?
Or simply disappear?
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Sing it
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Wake up
Take my hand and
Give me a reason to start again
Wake up
Pull me out and
Give me a reason to start again
Time stands still

One more time I'm on my knees as I try to walk away
How has it come to this?
I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it a thousand fucking times
That I'm Ok, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me, and I can't seem to sleep
It's not just you're not with me, it's just you never leave
I've said it once a thousand fucking times
You say this is suicide,
I say this is a war
And I'm losing the battle
Man down, man down, oh

This is a war I can't win!

            <field name="lyrics">I've lost the plot again
Tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
There's a few quid to be made...
And my soul's a sorry state
So come on down, you're empty lovers.
Worms come out of the woodwork
And the snakes start to sing.
Do you feel the chill,
Clawing at the back of your neck?
I start to spill,
Did you really think that you could fix me?
They'll sell your bones for another roll.
We'll sharpen your teeth.
Tell yourself that it's just business.
Worms come out of the woodwork.
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt.
Rats come out of the holes they call home,
I fall apart.
And the snakes start to sing.
Don't say I'm better off dead,
Cause heaven's full and hell won't have me.
Won't you make some room in your bed?
Oh, Well you could lock me up in your heart,
And throw away the key.
Won't you take me out of my head?
I'm just a would've been, could've been,
Should've been, never was and never ever will be.
We'll sharpen your teeth.
Tell yourself that it's just business.
Would've been, could've been,
Should've been, never was and never ever will be.
Worms come out of the woodwork,
And the snakes start to sing.
Worms come out of the woodwork.
Leeches come from out of the dirt.
Rats come out of the holes they call home,
And I fall apart.
And the snakes start to sing.
If you can't soar with the eagles,
Then don't fly with the flock.
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection,
In the knife my Mother held?
Or the hell in my Father's eyes?
If you can't soar with the eagles,
Then don't fly with the flock.
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour?
The apple of your eye?
Or just another step to climb?
If you can't soar with the eagles,
Then don't fly with the flock.
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection,
In the knife my Mother held?
Or the hell in my Father's eyes?
If you can't soar with the eagles,
Then don't fly with the flock.
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour?
The apple of your eye?
Or just another step, a fucking step to climb!</field>

Someone call an ambulance, I got wounds to

Someone call a doctor, I fear this is the end
This happens all the time
This happens every day
But I never seem to quit
The wolves never stay at bay
I hate to say I told you so, but fuck it, I told you so
Don't say a word, I already know
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
[X2]
Someone call an exorcist and help me kill this curse
I can't stop the bleeding and it's only getting worse
Get the fuck up
This is it, the sound of giving in
Yeah, get the fuck up
This is it
The end of everything
Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
Lost in a dream, never fell asleep
I've come back to old remedies</field>

Oh, give me a break you deluded, ireful, self-serving prick
If you really believe in the words that you preach,
Get off your screens, and onto the streets
There will be no peaceful revolution!
No war without blood!
You can say I'm just a fool, that stands for nothing
Well, to that,
I say you're a cunt

Divided, we'll fall

We're fucked, but you're makin' it worse!

Can anyone respond?
It's like an avalanche
I feel myself go under
Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
Am I broken? What's the chance I will survive?
Don't sugarcoat me, cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight cause I'm running out of time
I need an antidote now, what can you prescribe?

You can only wear a crown of thorns for so long
We built an empire and you took the throne
But you built it from bayonets and sat there alone
I hope your queen was worth it,
Do you still serve her on your knees?
Because you sat when the world was at your feet,
Just slept while we lived the dream
You won't miss the water,
Till the river runs dry
You won't miss the sunset,
Till it burns out the sky
You won't miss what you have,
Till it's finally lost
But you don't miss a bastard,
When you're bearing his fucking cross
Blacklist
Nothing but a blacklist
With friends like you,
There's no need for enemies
With friends like you,
There's no need for anything
Blacklist
You're nothing but a blacklist
Well, truth be told
I'm a little bit gutted
I mean you were always a prick,
But we still seemed to love you
We started this together and it should have stuck
But there's no room for a useless, miserable fuck
Well I know I was a cunt in the final days
It just filled me with venom, filled me with rage
To see someone not give a shit,
Despite of all of this
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
You're on my blacklist and there's nothing left to say
We're finished breaking our bones, dragging dead fucking weight</field>

And it's getting worse now
It makes no sense but it must be right
The blood and sweat you sacrificed
Was it all for nothing
Cause you found no sign and see no light
We hear no voice when we pray at night
But we swore and now it's too late to turn back
You're not blessed you're cursed

The minutes are hours, the hours are days
I feel infected by your presence, you speak in tounges
I smell the lies dancing on your blackened lungs
I whispered in her ear:
Fear me dear, for I am Death
I'll take your hope, your dreams, your love
'Til there's nothing left
I whispered in her ear:
You better fear me dear, for I am Death
And I'll take that shit you call a life
And I'll see them fucking break
I'll take your hope
I'll take your fucking dreams
I'll take your love
I'll take everything you fucking bitch.
I'll steal the diamonds from your eyes
I'll turn your promises into lies
I'll steal the diamonds from your eyes
I'll turn your promises into lies
It's 3:18, mouth tastes like the corpse of every pregnant teen
The hours are days, the days are dead
I feel infected by your presence, you speak in tounges
I smell the lies dancing on your blackened lungs
I hear the fear in your voice, but you shouldn't feel a thing,
Your life's already worse than any pain that I could bring
That I could bring
That I could bring
I could make it December every day,
But you're so blind, it may as well be May
And I whispered in her ear:
You better fear me dear, for this is Death
And I whispered in her ear:
Fear me, 'cause I am Death
One more time
I whispered in her ear:
Fear me dear, for I am Death,
I'll take everything you ever loved
I whispered in her ear:
You better fear me, for I am Death.
For I am Death.

Are we just dreaming
In the city that never sleeps?
'Cause I can't be seeing
What my eyes tell me
Am I just dreaming?
This can't be in my veins
Everything I ever knew

Hallelujah, Well I'm saved
Just a dozen steps and 28 days
It's a miracle, I'll be born again
As the Lord as my Shepard
I will find a way
Fuck your faith, no one's gonna save you
Fuck your faith
There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No death can touch the crooked young
There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No death can touch the crooked young
The crooked young
We don't sleep, we don't eat
We speak in tongues
We can't die, we're dead inside
No death can touch the crooked young
Believe in the one
Fuck yourself
The faceless won't save you
The clouds will eat your fucking prayers
There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No death can touch
Hallelujah
I say it's a miracle, thank you Jesus
Hallelujah, I say
Fuck your faith, fuck your faith</field>

There is nothing above, there is nothing below.
Heaven and Hell lives in all of us,
And I've been cast astray.
I am an ocean, I am the sea,
There is a world inside of me.
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep,
No set of lungs could salvage me.
Only a shipwreck, only a ghost,
Merely a graveyard of your former self.
We just watched the waves crash over.
I've been cast astray.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
(No one needs to know)
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
(No one needs to know)
I am an ocean, I am the sea,
There is a world inside of me.
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep,
No set of lungs could salvage me.
Save yourself, save your breath,
The tides too strong, you'll catch your death.
So breathe for me, just breathe.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
If we make it through the night, if I make it out alive,
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead.
And you say that you can save me,
Don't hope to ever find me,
I fear I'm too far gone.
Pray for the dead
If we make it through the night, if I make it out alive,
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead.
And you say that you can save me,
Don't hope to ever find me.
I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your full undivided attention?
There is something you all really need to know:
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive.
You say that you can save me,
Don't hope to ever find me
I fear I'm too far gone.
Pray for the dead

Limb from limb
Will the hunger ever stop?
Can we simply starve this sin?
That little kiss you stole
It held my heart and soul
And like a deer in the headlights
I meet my fate
Don't try to fight the storm
You'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you
And on my deathbed all I'll see is you
The life may leave my lungs
But my heart will stay with you
That little kiss you stole

And like a ghost in the silence I disappear

            <field name="lyrics">I was raised in the valley, there was shadows and death.
Got out alive but with scars I can't forget.
This kid back in school, subdued and shy.
An orphan and a brother and unseen by most eyes.
I don't know what it was that made a piece of him die,
Took a boy to the forest, slaughtered him with a scythe.
Stamped on his face, an impression in the dirt.
Do you think the silence makes a good man convert?
We all have our horrors and our demons to fight.
But how can I win, when I'm paralyzed?
They crawl up on my bed,
wrap their fingers round my throat.
Is this what I get for the choices that I made?
God forgive me, for all my sins.
God forgive me, for everything.
God forgive me, for all my sins.
God forgive me, God forgive me.
Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night.
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight.
Don't go.
Don't go.
[Lights]
If I let you in, you'd just want out.
If I tell you the truth, you'd vie for a lie.
If I spilt my guts,
it would make a mess we can't clean up.
If you follow me, you will only get lost.
If you try to get closer, we'll only lose touch.
Yes you already know too much,
and you're not going anywhere.
Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much.
Tell me that you love me 'cause I need you so much.
Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much.
Say you'll never leave me 'cause I need you so much.
Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night.
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight.
Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Don't go.
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night.
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight.

It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay, and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?
Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper

Surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded, by vicious cycles
Are we truly alone?
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded
Let 'em sing, let 'em sing!
The deeper you dig, the darker it gets
There's nowhere else for us to go
We live what we learn, and then we forget
We'll never find our way back home, come on!
They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane

You left like a house in a hurricane
The wolves are at my door
But I can't see the writing on the walls
The wolves are at my door
Waiting for my empire to fall
It's the start of the end
Surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded, by vicious cycles
So call it the end, and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded
Let 'em sing, let 'em sing!</field>

I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill
Everything and everyone - say you'll do it but never will
You can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
You can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
You can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
I am my father's son
Cuz he's a phantom, a mystery and that leaves me nothing!
How many times have you wanted to die?
It's too late for me - all you have to do is get rid of me
You can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
You can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
You can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
It's all in my head
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
I tried - you lied to me for so long
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it
Freak on my antics and give me a choice
Doesn't matter if I give a shit - it's shit that you gave me
You can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
You can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
You can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
It's all in my head
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
Do you wanna feel pain? takin' my name in vain
Caring never felt so lame inside
Anybody else got pride? do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse my ride
Who the fuck are you? fuck you!
Better suck it up'cause you bled through
Better get away from me
Stay the fuck away from me!
I feel safe - seems your saved
I feel safe - seems your saved
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Motherfucker
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new...</field>

and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel something
'cause I'm still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you'll never leave my side
Show me what I can't see
When the spark in your eyes is gone
you've got me on my knees
I'm your one-man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I'll never leave your side
Cause I'm telling you you're all I need
I promise you you're all I see
Cause I'm telling you you're all I need
I'll never leave
So you can drag me through Hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you
Come sink into me and let me breathe you in
I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen
So dig two graves cause when you die
I swear I'll be leaving by your side
So you can drag me through Hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you cause I'm under you spell

teen
The minutes are hours, the hours are days
I feel infected by your presence, you speak in
tongues
I smell the lies dancing on your blackened lungs
I whispered in her ear:
Fear me dear, for I am Death
I'll take your hope, your dreams, your love
'Til there's nothing left
I whispered in her ear:
You better fear me dear, for I am Death
And I'll take that shit you call a life
In a single fuckin' breath
I'll take your hope
I'll take your fucking dreams
I'll take your love
I'll take everything you fucking bitch.
I'll steal the diamonds from your eyes
I'll turn your promises into lies
I'll steal the diamonds from your eyes
I'll turn your promises into lies
It's 3:18, mouth tastes like the corpse of every pregnant
teen
The hours are days, the days are dead
I feel infected by your presence, you speak in tounges
I smell the lies dancing on your blackened lungs
I hear the fear in your voice, but you shouldn't feel a thing,
Your life's already worse than any pain that I could bring
That I could bring
That I could bring
I could make it December every day,
But you're so blind, it may as well be May
And I whispered in her ear:
You better fear me dear, for this is Death
And I whispered in her ear:
Fear me, 'cause I am Death
One more time
I whispered in her ear:
Fear me dear, for I am Death,
I'll take everything you ever loved
I whispered in her ear:
You better fear me, for I am Death.
For I am Death.
For I am Death

Don't stop till your feelin' wet
I'm no saint, your no better
One more time we are together
How do you say goodbye,
How do you say goodbye,
When you've hardly said hello?
The only way we know
How do you say goodbye, when you've hardly said hello?
Lets fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Lets fuck till our lungs give out,
It wont be long It's hard to remember, I didn't forget
Let's fuck until our hearts give up.
It won't be long.
A night to remember, a day to forget.
If our lives were diamonds we'd be rich.
Your voice makes my heart skip beats.
So, keep quiet before it quits on me.
Your voice makes my heart skip beats.
So, keep quiet before it flat lines.
Before it flat lines
I've been terrible at night.
We can only wake up here in this bed.
Sunken into you; tangled in sheets.
Buried in blankets six foot deep, again
Kick it.
Lets fuck, till the suns comes up
Till the echo rumbling
It's hard to remember,
I didn't forget
Dont stop till your feelin' wet
I have no shame, your no better
One more time we are together
How do you say goodbye,
How do you say goodbye,
When you've hardly said hello?
We're young and in love
Heart attacks waiting to happen
So come on closer, tell me its all in our heads
We're young and in love
Heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words</field>

It's moments like this where silence is golden

No one wants to hear you
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
I'm begging you to spare me
The pleasure of your company
When did the diamonds leave your bones?
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said

Go to hell, for heaven's sake
When did the diamonds leave your bones?
Leave your bones
You're not a shepard, you're just a sheep
I'll cut my depths of everyone you meet
You're all flesh with no bones
Feed them to the sharks
And throw them to the walls
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we make

There's a voice in my head
Says I'm better off dead

To a happy song, I'll be alright
You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got
And it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song
You'll be just fine cause

And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel and
I'm going round in circles, going round in circles
Don't wake us up
We'd rather just keep dreaming
Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles, I'm going round in circles
The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay
Let's go
Sing along
Let's sing along
A little fucking louder
A little fucking louder
Well don't you feel so much better

But the label had fell off
Just minding my own meltdown
It was then I heard the cannibals, cannibals
They said hey kid..
You got that something special
(It's now or never)
You wanna live forever
(It's now or never)
You know what we want, you should give it to us
(It's now or never)
But there's no pressure
And I keep picking petals,
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
cos a kid on the gram
In a black dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright)
(That's alright)
I tried to do a headcount
But I cut off all the crusts
Said they liked it better curly
Then they gut me like an animal
They said hey man
You had that something special
(It's now or never)
Let's keep it quintessential
(It's now or never)
You know what we want why not give it to us
(It's now or never)
But there's no pressure
So I keep picking petals
I'm afraid they don't love me anymore
Cos some kid on the gram
In a black dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
Yeah I keep picking petals
Got my heart and my head all in the wars
Cos some kid from A n R
in a Patagonia
Said he don't really get it
So I keep picking petals
All I wanna know do you love me anymore
Cos some kid on the gram says he used to be fan
But this shit ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright)
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
cos a kid on the gram
In a black dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
Yeah, I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore

As subtle as a shotgun, and as heavy as a brick.
Cause I'm staring at the devil and the truth of it is,
He's a lot more familiar than I care to admit.
If only I could focus,
Maybe if I could see.
If I didn't know any better,
I would say he looks just like me.

It is to really change, even hell
Can get comfy once you've settled in.
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave.
No matter how fucked you get,
The sun will return and you come back down!
The funny thing is all I ever wanted I already had..
There's glimpses of heaven in everyday!!
In the friends that I have, the music I make,
The love that I feel, I just had to start again..
The days are a death wish
A witch hunt for an exit
I am powerless...
The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless...
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Idle in halls and nameless faces
I am powerless...
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
I can fear death no longer
I've died a thousand times
A wasteful universe
And we don't know our soul was
The emptiness inside our heads
But no one dares to dwell...
Throw me to the flames
Watch me burn!
Set my world ablaze
Watch me burn!
How are we on a scale of one to ten?
could you tell me what you see?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?
Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
Have you been skipping meals?
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me (burn)
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me (burn)
Hold me close, don't let go

Wish I told you this before it got too dark
Where do you start
When you know it has to end?
How a flower in the rain
Only grows more when it's grey
You just shined on brighter
Making gold out of the pain
I can die, but I can't break, you said
You can rule, I won't obey
As long as I'm still smiling
Well, I don't know what to say</field>

My heart bleeds out sorrow
Oh, Would this scorn her of romance?
I can't see your faces.
My heart turned black before
I choke on the best of reasons
Love's gone and never coming back
Can I frame your love in my head
I wanna wake you up to shine
I'll wake you up to shine
Don't you wish you could close your eyes
And pretend but this suffocating memory just wont end.
You could have saved us
Instead you erased us
Now this loves gone wrong
With Your precious little impulse
You fucking talk, now your left to silence
Oh,
The universe is filled with different views
Some are right and some are wrong.
It's hard to sort out until this screaming turns around.
Just take the wheel and kill us both
Wishing some day you'll be thinking
The universe is filled with different views
Some are right and some are wrong.
Take the wheel and kill us both.
Don't you wish you could just close your eyes
And pretend that this suffocating memory dies
Just die
Just die
For you I would die!</field>

(In the dark)
Oh, I've done it again
Dug a little deep and it's all caved in
Now I free fall in a black hole
I know I'm getting warm 'cause I feel so cold
But I'm looking on the bright side now
Tryna figure out somehow
(None of this is real, no)
It's looking like I write off now
I think we need to talk like now
So, don't swear to God he never asked you
It's not his heart you drove a knife through
It's not his world you turned inside out
Now his tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)
Deathblow, look at you go
Brought a T-62 to a Rodeo
So tall it broke the fourth wall
Guess my fairytale has a few plot holes
Well, I'm looking on the bright side now
Tryna figure out somehow
(None of this is real, no)
You can give the act up now
Yeah, go ahead and take a bow
So, don't swear to God he never asked you
It's not his heart you drove a knife through
It's not his world you turned inside out
Now his tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?

Just a little faith in anyone or anything
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
('Cause it's all come caving in)
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
(And it's time I knew you, so)
Don't swear to God he never asked you
It's not his heart you drove a knife through

The sirens and the sergeants didn't seem to mean a thing
Hide your fangs all you want, you still need the blood
Tell us that it's different now, you're up to no good
(Take my hand, show me the way, we are the children that fell from grace)
(Take my hand, show me the way, we are the children that can't be saved)
One more nail in the coffin, one more foot in the grave
One more time I'm on my knees as I try to walk away
How has it come to this?
I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it a thousand fucking times
That I'm Ok, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me, and I can't seem to sleep
It's not just you're not with me, it's just you never leave
I've said it once a thousand fucking times
You say this is suicide,
I say this is a war
And I'm losing the battle
Man down, man down, oh
Is this what you call love?
This is a war I can't win!
One more nail in the coffin, one more foot in the grave
One more time I'm on my knees as I try to walk away
Everything I've loved became everything I lost
I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it a thousand fucking times
That I'm Ok, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me, and I can't seem to sleep
It's not just you're alone with me, it's just you never leave
It's not just you're alone with me, it's just you never leave
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends

Oh my god!

We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!)
Fallen apart

Your lips are turning blue
I know you wish you were dead to the world

You're scared, I can see you tremble
Shaking like a dog, shittin' razorblades
Feel the shadows like a stranger

Are you looking forward to the day to feel like you'll fit in?
Well, join the club

The same old, same number that nobody knows
My heart is a dead horse, there's no point in beating

I'm not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose
I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we are going to need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell epiphany?
Before the truth will set you free
It'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be
You're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now
One ear and right out the other one
Because all you ever do is chant
the same old mantra
Could I have your attention please
It's time to tap in to your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now your sinking
What were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week
Before the truth will set you free
It'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be
You're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now
One ear and right out the other one
Because all you ever do is chant
the same old mantra
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for is a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
Y'know you gotta work
the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe
Before the truth will set you free
It'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be
You're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free
It'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be
You're gonna lose the plot

'cause life's so much brighter when they go
You rained on my heart for far too long
Couldn't see the thunder for the storm
Because I cut my teeth
and bit my tongue
til' my mouth was dripping blood
but I never dished the dirt
just held my breath
while you dragged me through the mud
I don't know why I tried to save you 'cause
I can't save you from yourself
when all you give a shit about
is everybody else
And you just can't quit
Why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop
You need a taste of your own medicine
Cos I'm sick to death of swallowing
watch me take the wheel like you
Not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
so I'm sorry for this
it might sting a bit
Some people are a lot like clouds you know
'cause life's so much brighter when they go
and I spent too long in a place I don't belong
couldn't see the thunder for the storm
But you won't admit
Why don't you get a grip
'Cause you can't keep going on and on and on like this
No you just can't quit
Why don't you deal with it?

It still has me choking; it's hard to explain
I know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain
So don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way
to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me; fala, "amo"

But your face was someone else's
A twitch in my spine, a mutual disorder
Isolation neophyte
Too afraid to taste your conscience
You march in the dark, little lamb to the slaughter
I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof

Just like
Hollywood but
Laced
In sick.
The sun goes down and so does she.
The sun goes down and so does she.
Sold out the love that she had left with a cut of the
Throat.
Drinks all round on her before she strolls to the Moat.
So count you fucking blessings.
Because im counting every lie.
Christ, I'm asking you for just one thing: eradicate,
This disease.
Close your eyes
Pray for plagues.
Oh lord cleanse this earth
And bring upon our doomsday.
So clap your hands to the sound
Of everyone first born dying now.
Watch the rivers flow with blood
Death with stand were life once stood</field>

Your blood, my hands,

Run for the hills,
Astray from the capital
Run for the hills,
Astray from the capital
And if you think you're alive,
Well, you're better off fucking dead
Sewn my eyes
In hope I won't see your smile

Ten thousand voices fill my broken lungs

So take a deep breath, let's disappear
No one will listen so why are we still here
And in the black hole you will see it
[Chorus]
'Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall
So let's run
So let's run
Your hand's a hurricane, it moves in waves
A perfect storm that keeps you wide awake
But through the silence, you will feel it
So take my hand and let's away
You know there's nothing here that can stay
And in the darkness you will see the sun
[Chorus]
Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall

So give me your every, give me your everything
And let's get away

I know that we're more than another brick in the grave
So give me your every, give me your everything

And I've seen it all before

There is something I must confide
I think we've lost our touch
There's no sparkle in those eyes
What an awful mess I've made
There's nothing left to save
Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before
I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record

And my bones catch a fever
When I cut you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here?
Do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim?
Or simply disappear?
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Sing it
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Wake up
Take my hand and
Give me a reason to start again
Wake up
Pull me out and
Give me a reason to start again

Wanna make a connection
Can't get no reception
Leave a message after the tone

I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand
Then block out all the sadness

I don't reckon I can figure it out
It's all messed up
only one thing I know for sure

And we all march on
like we know the way to heaven
Who the hell died and made you the king
We don't know what we want, but we know that we want it
Yeah, we want it, yeah, we want it right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh!

Everybody is full of
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

but for me, this distance is decay.
so line my throat with lipstick and leave my blood for flies.
I'll gurgle the blues under a sea of lies.
before you take me to sea, let me kiss the bride.
now take my body to the shore and ill wait for the tide.
I will always love you

I have always failed you

I chose to promise myself that Id never let you down.
To capture this moment would be the best idea yet.

This room is now my friend.
Ill stay here and wait it out until the pressure ends.
I cant wait!!! Everything around me is a test to see I can last.
I dont know if I can
Wheres my strength at?
I made a promise to myself that Id always be around.
I should capture this moment, before I let you down.
Im sure that Ill be heard,
Ive got too much to lose to fly away and leave all of this behind.
So capture this moment, before I forget why Im here.
Im killing the only person in life I thought I knew.
The only person left to blame for this is you!
Ive got things to say that I know you want to hear.
I can see through you perfectly clear.
Dont go too far
I chose to stay here
Remind me where we are.</field>

But there's no word of hell on the way back down
You said it's now or never,
You only live once
Would you be so quick to walk over to my grave?
You said you'll never be younger than you are tonight
Now I've never felt weaker in all my life
You said it's only a one off, only a line
But now it's a circle, all of the time
Well, it's a one man cult and he's serving his line
It's a "Lust For Life" but it's a lifeless wine
He kissed her hand and then he found out her name,
It's Death and now he can't seem to wake
You can't run with the foxes and yet hunt with the wolf
Are you addicted?
Tell me the truth
I think I'm losing my mind
They say the poison's in the dosage and they must be right
Left with panic attacks and death riding our backs
It all looks so much worse on the way back down
I'm so fucked up since I hit the ground</field>

Death is the only salvation you'll fear
Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick
What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
Cloak and daggers murder the truth
The bitter taste, there's nothing else
I'll bow for your king when he shows himself
Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues
Show me your face, show me a reason to think,
My soul can be saved if I sell you my sins
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation for me
Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues
(The house of wolves you built)
(The nest of wolves you built)
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns
So when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is 2 foot wide and 6 foot deep
Yeah!
And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is 2 foot wide and 6 foot deep
And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see

Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear

Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy</field>

Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

Like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart
Right from the start

Cos' what we had
Well it could of been something
I guess it wasn't meant to be
So how dare you
Try and steal my flame
Just cos' yours faded
Well hate is gasoline
A fire fuelling all my dreams

You got a lot of nerve
But not a lot of spine
You made your bed

I've been hiding in these trenches for far too long
All is fair in love and war or so they say
Come on, come on, there has to be a better way
Get up, get up, let's leave this mess
I know a place that we can get away from all of this
Come on, Come on, Get up Get up
I've been dreaming of us leaving
Everything and everyone we've ever known
I've been thinking all these visions must be a sign,
So hold on and don't let go
No, we can't leave till you tell me everything
So come clean, don't talk in tongues
It's time to bring out your dead
And the skeletons that you've been hiding
Tell me everything I need to know
Bring out your dead
I couldn't see a thing till I shut my eyes
I never knew a thing till I lost my mind
I would sell my soul to know it all,
But I held the keys all this time

And I'm not trying to change your eyes so don't panic
Cause I'm not selling

Don't come crawling back to me when you break down

Alone, on this silent beach
There is nothing we can do
There is nothing we can do

The sky, it burns itself out
The sky, it burns itself out
The sky, it burns itself
The trees rot down to nothing
Throats dry out and corpses fill the sidewalks
These promenades, our graveyards
The sky, it burns itself out
The sky, it burns itself out
There is nothing we can do
The sky, it burns itself
And I think we're all about to fucking die
The trees rot down to nothing
Throats dry out, and corpses fill these sidewalks
These promenades, our graveyards
Kneeling down on what's left, sacrificed upon doom's day
Oh, if we could take it back and see one last twilight
Take a picture, take a picture
Take a picture, take a picture
Take a picture
Take a picture, take a picture
Take a picture, take a picture
It will last longer
Our hands in prayer formation
Our elbows on the bed
One last try for Heaven
Thinking who wants flowers when you're dead?
You're dead

Was hoping the suspense would kill you
Tell me, how would you begin?
Watching and waiting to sink your teeth in
Come on and give me your expert opinion
Ah, fuck it
I settle down in a dump
Heard a crowd screaming "Jump"
So I came to the window
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
I said, "What the fuck have I done? "
They said, "We just want your blood
You know we like you better in limbo"
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue
But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you tryna put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed?
I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me
This is how I grow, it's how I thrive
So why you gotta kick me when I'm down?

Yeah, I know it's all in good fun, but
Don't say it's coming from love now
I see those arms in akimbo

And don't set that phaser to stun
'Cause what doesn't kill me, well, it better run like hell
Yeah, you better run like hell
So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue

Remember this line that you crossed?
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no turning back now
Now that you've opened the gates
Corrupted the memory, error, failsafe
(Commence the countdown)
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
Remember this line that you crossed?
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no way to fix us, no
Oh, God, what the fuck have you done?
I loved you like daughters, I loved you like sons
So tell me, yeah tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you tryna to put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed?
I won't stop at the roof

Oh, what a wonderful life
(Oh, what a wonderful life)
(Oh, what a wonderful life)
Alright
I got a Type 2 kinda thirstiness
A far out other worldliness
And one day this might hurt me less
But everybody knows I'm still down
Don't tell me what the butcher does
There's no need for the obvious
So ugly still it's kinda lush
But everybody knows I made vows
Left feet on the podium
Can't think of an alternate
And hell yeah, I'm the awkwardest
But everybody know I got bounce
Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life</field>

but we're not there to watch it fall
on the vacant canvas
we should be waiting
with our face down on the grass
staring till our eyes give way
let's paint this city black
while the night's still young
you
this cherry sunset withers
our words
as frail as paper
a dawn i thought we'd never see
alone on this silent beach
there is nothing we can do
there is nothing we can do
the sky
it burns itself out
the sky
it burns itself out
the sky
it burns itself out
the sky
it burns itself
the trees rot down to nothing
throats dry out and corpses fill the sidewalks
these promenades
our graveyards
the sky
it burns itself out
the sky
it burns itself out
there is nothing we can do
the sky
it burns itself
and i think we're all about to fucking die
the trees rot down to nothing
throats dry out and corpses fill these sidewalks
these promenades
our graveyards
kneeling down on what's left
sacrificed upon dooms day
oh
if we could take it back and see one last twilight
take a picture
take a picture
take a picture
take a picture
take a picture
take a picture
take a picture
take a picture
take a picture
it will last longer
our hands in prayer formation
our elbows on the bed
one last try for heaven
thinking who wants flowers when you're dead?
you're dead
when you're dead

and then i found out how hard it is to really change. even hell can get comfy once you've settled in. i just wanted the lonely inside me to leave. no matter how fucked you get
it's always there when you come back down. the funny thing is all i ever wanted i already had. there's glimpses of heaven in every day. in the friends i have
the music i make
the love that i feel. i just had to start again. the days are a death-wish
a witch-hunt for an exit
i am powerless. the fragile
the broken
sit in circles and stay unspoken
we are powerless. because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
silent halls and nameless faces
i am powerless. everybody wants to go to heaven
but nobody wants to die
i can't fear death
no longer
i've died a thousand times
why explore the universe
when we don't know ourselves?
there's an emptiness inside our heads
that no one dares to dwell. throw me to the flames
watch me burn!
set my world ablaze
watch me burn!
how are we on a scale of one to ten?
could you tell me what you see?
do you wanna talk about it?
how does that make you feel?
have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
have you been skipping meals?
we're gonna try something new today
how does that make you feel?
hold me close
don't let go
watch me
hold me close
don't let go

hold me close
don't let go

i always knew this is gonna end in tears
didn't think your wrists would keep a souvenir
and i thought that i had heard it all
till i heard your lover screaming down the phone
i know i said i was under your spell
but this hex is on another level
and i know i said you could drag me through hell
but i hoped you wouldn't fuck the devil

you know
'cause life's so much brighter when they go
you rained on my heart for far too long
couldn't see the thunder for the storm
because i cut my teeth and bit my tongue
till my mouth was dripping blood
but i never dished the dirt
just held my breath
while you dragged me through the mud
i don't know why i tried to save you 'cause
i can't save you from yourself
when all you give a shit about is everybody else
and you just can't quit
why don't you deal with it?
i think it's time to stop
you need a taste of your own medicine
'cause i'm sick to death of swallowing
watch me take the wheel like you
not feel like you
act like nothing's real like you
so
i'm sorry for this
it might sting a bit
some people are a lot like clouds
you know
'cause life's so much brighter when they go
and i spent too long in a place i don't belong
i couldn't see the thunder for the storm
but you won't admit
why don't you get a grip?
'cause you can't keep going on and on and on and on like this
and you just can't quit
why don't you deal with it?
i think it's time to stop
you need a taste of your own medicine

i feel you're lonely

(the way that like

if you actually look at a dolphin
like its head
like
yeah
you can see it's like
it's some
it's like a smarmy dude
like
you can see its face stretched out
you can see a human face
it's almost fuckin' liquified
you can literally see it's a human's face
you can see him smiling
and he must think we're fucking psychopaths
like imagine being a dolphin and just lookin' at humans
you'd be like "the fuck are you lot doing?"
(yeah
like
it's like when i was reading about that island in venice
what they do to the one that's crying is put it inside
like the idea of like science labs)
i literally just
you know what? i would like to swim
you can just
i don't even know what i'm talking about
you can just tell
it's just that creature has just as much emotions and
brainwaves and thought patterns and
conscience and fucking. what's that word?
(these guys use eighty-eight percent of their brain
more than us)
sentience
that's the word

you set me on fire

they call me a nihilist
i guess i'm just unclear
to why i bother
why i try
death is on my mind so much
it makes me wanna die
i've lost my wife this year
we've lost our friend
always fighting battles
but they never seem to end
are we just ladders
in a world of snakes
'cause if life is one big fucking game
well i don't wanna play it
so come and sing me
sing me asleep
i dealt with too much fucking shit
now i'm in too deep
cut off my wings
my flowers bloomed
you want salvation
but i'm sorry
we're all doomed
cut off my wings and come lock me up
just pull the plug yeah
i've had enough
tear me to pieces
sell me for parts
you're all vampires so here
you can have my heart
you can have my heart
you can have my heart
the world's a funeral
a room of ghosts
no hint of movement
no sign of pulse
only an echo
just skin and bone
they kick the chair but we
we help tie the rope
you can have my heart
you can have my heart
you can have my heart
so come rain on my parade
'cause i wanna feel it
come shove me over the edge
'cause my head is in overdrive
i'm sorry
but it's too late
and it's not worth saving
so come rain on my parade
i think we're doomed
i think we're doomed
and now there is no way back
you must've made some kind of mistake
i asked for death
but instead i'm awake
the devil told me "no room for cheats"
i thought i sold my soul
but he kept the receipt
so leave the light on
i'm coming home
it's getting darker
but i'll carry on
the sun don't shine
but it never did
and when it rains
it fucking pours
but i think i like it
and you know that i'm in love with the mess
i think i like it
so come rain on my parade
'cause i wanna feel it
come shove me over the edge
'cause my head is in overdrive
i'm sorry

i think we're doomed

All is fair in love and war or so they say. Come on, come on, there has to be a better way. Get up, get up, let's leave this mess. I know a place that we can get away from all of this. I've been dreaming of us leaving everything and everyone we've ever known. I've been thinking all these visions must be a sign, so hold on and don't let go. No, we can't leave 'til you tell me everything. So come clean, don't talk in tongues. It's time to bring out your dead. And the skeletons that you've been hiding. Tell me everything I need to know. Bring out your dead. I couldn't see a thing 'til I shut my eyes. I never knew a thing 'til I lost my mind.</field>

With blood shot eyes I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
The moments die, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Oh yeah
This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end? I'm hoping
My world is over one more time
Let's go!
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come
Better!

I get the feeling this is never getting any better
Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake

First you wanna hate me, then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feeling, I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feeling, now I'm letting you go
Coldest heart I've ever known, now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me, then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feeling now I'm letting you, letting you go
So I know this hasn't gone the way that we expected
You had to try and make a fool of me
and leave a bitter taste
I tried to compromise with open eyes
but we're disconnected
Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake

My blood is boiling inside of my veins
An evil feeling atacks (atacks)
My body shaking there's no turning back
Don't take your eyes off the trigger
I'm not to blame if your world turns to black
As your eyes start to blister
There's just no hope for a final embrace
So here we are
I'm in your head
I'M In Your Heart
You were told to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal (Your Betrayal)
I was told to stay away
Those two words I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal (Your Betrayal)
Is it my turn to die?
My heart is pounding I say goodbye
So now I dance in the flames
I love you crying and screaming my name
You said that we'd be forever
How could you kill me and lie to my face
Now that we can't be together
There's just no hope for a final embrace
So here we are
I'm in your head
I'M In Your Heart

Soak the place and light the flame

Take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
The ring of the bells, feeling you resonate
Into the night, hearing you fade away
Do or die, this is a choice that I'm making
And it feels like I'm living a lie
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith, I'll

Take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out
So fill your lungs, inhale the future

Release the pressure!

Those painful times, so alone, so ashamed,
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain

Caution, there's just no limits to the boundaries you push
I warned you but still you just fuck with my mind
There's no escape from this rage that I feel,

You ain't no angel.
You like to scream, use words as a weapon.
Well go ahead take your best shot woman.
I wanna leave you, it's easy to see,
But guess what honey it's not that easy..
We get so complicated (complicated!),
This finger's for our memories.
So rip my pictures from your wall,
Tear them down, and burn them all.
Light the fire and walk away,
There's nothing left to say, so,
Take the ashes from the floor,
Bury them to just make sure,
That nothing more is left of me,
Just bittersweet memories.
I wanna run and escape from your prison,
But when I leave I feel something is missing.
I'm not afraid that's easy to tell,
This can't be heaven,
It feels like I'm in hell.
You're like a drug that I can't stop taking,
I want more and I can't stop craving.

You just wouldn't listen

Tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
They won't mean anything
I hope it hurts
You've only got yourself to blame
And I can't take this anymore
I'm over it
So over it
Breathe in breathe out
I feel it coming round again
Breathe in breathe out
Don't wanna ride your carousel
Breathe in breathe out
Don't know how much more I can take
Breathe in breathe out
Just stop cos I'm about to break</field>

You make me feel dead when I'm talking to you
You'll take me for granted when I'm not around
So burn all your bridges cause I'm not going down
This time I will be heard
I'm not gonna burn
It's funny how the table,
How the table turns
You fake (fake) your damnation
You pray (pray) for salvation
Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone!
I hope you're unhappy and hurting inside
I want you to choke when you swallow your pride
Lay in your coffin and sleep with your sins
Give me the nails and I'll hammer them in right now
This time you won't be heard
You're gonna burn
It's funny how the table,
How the table turns
You fake (fake) your damnation
You pray (pray) for salvation

You can die and rot alone!

Another chance to not be the afflicted
Another cynical, a little critical
We're not the ones that seem to wanna make life difficult
We're all alive, let's build the future

No killing time, we're gonna use it
Can't turn it back around so don't abuse it
We've got a voice, let's break the silence
Another chance to think and show defiance
Look at our history, don't put it on repeat
Let's make a stand and drag ourselves out of this misery
No killing time, we've gotta use it
Can't turn it back around so don't abuse it

A pair of daggers cutting through my mind
Your stare it rips a hole into my life
Am I supposed to leave this all behind?
It's on my skin
Your scent is poison when I breathe you in
It's there with every single breath I take
If this is it then don't resuscitate
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine
It's on my skin
Your scent is poison when I breathe you in
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time (for the very last time)
Don't you speak
You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak
I guarantee I won't be losing sleep
'Cause you're the one that made this end complete
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine
Don't you speak
You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time (for the very last time)
Breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine
Don't you speak
You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak

Nothing makes sense anymore
(Am I falling to pieces?)
I won't dwell on tomorrow
'Cause it feels like such a wast of time
And it cuts me from the inside
But I know I'm gonna be alright
My eyes are wide open
Build me up, build me up to tear me down
Sick of going through the motions
You're the gravity that keeps me falling
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Giving up, giving up so you should know
My eyes are wide open
You're the gravity that keeps pulling me down
Still stuck going nowhere
Been here many times before
Never knowing the reason
Blocking out all the voices
Screaming just to be ignored
Were never given a reason
I won't never dwell on tomorrow
'Cause it feels like such a waste of time
And it cuts me from the inside
But I know I'm gonna be alright
Forgiven, forgotten
Not looking for apologies
It feels like I'm broken
But I know I'm gonna be alright

You pour your salt into my wounds

Forget your pretty little lies

Wound up like a hurricane

Can't wait to self-destruct
Can't wait to let it go

So come and get my money (Woah-oh-oh-oh)

Can you see your fever taking over me?
I can feel your fever taking over
Got a dirty feeling that you're the remedy
Woah, Come On
So I'm looking for a spark
I've got a fire to re-ignite
Don't worry you won't get burned
So don't put up a fight
Push hard to breaking point
And I'm ready to overload
No limits and no regrets
It's time to sell my soul

Got a dirty feeling that you're the remedy

Come here you naughty girl
You're such a tease
You look so beautiful
Down on your knees
Keep on those high-heeled shoes
Rip off all your clothes
You smell so fucking good
You make me lose control
Losing Control (You're what I want)
Selling My Soul (You're what I need)
Losing Control (You're what I want)
I Can'T Let You Go

Are you listening to me?
I will fight, the last fight

No silver lining on the cloud that covers you
Let it pour and soak you through
No hope, just desperation

Without my soul your a gun without a trigger
Vengeance is burning, who made you the king of the dead?

No mistakes your in force
Are you hearing this?
You want to test me?
I know, I'll Destroy you!
Save your breath, there's nothing here left
I'm telling You!
Everyday seems like I'm running with the reaper
Kicking and screaming, the demons are singing
It's to late as the break is getting deeper, weightless
I'll make you a Slave Of The Dead

No voice to scream or shout
Escaping feels untouchable
I know I must get out
Wake my
Wake myself from all this danger
Claw my
Claw myself from six feet under
No, no, no
Am I stuck here like a prisoner of war?
I will breathe once more
I will breathe once more
These feeling's overwhelming
It just won't go away
I'm captive in this nightmare
And this is where I'll stay
Wake my
Wake myself from all this danger
Claw my
Claw myself from six feet under
No, no, no
Am I stuck here like a prisoner of war
I will breathe once more
I will breathe once more
My anxiety is rising
It just won't go away
All this tension keeps building
Please, just leave me to die!
Make, make, make it go away
All I wanna do is live another day
Make, make, make it go away
All I wanna do is live another day

(my world is over, close the door)
Her skin reflects behind the blur
I’m intoxicated
Where am I from? Why am I here?
(you're so predictable)
fingers running through my hair
I’m a new addiction
She steps out from her underwear
(so beautiful)
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
What can I do to make you feel…
…you're wanted
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
I’m suffocating under words of sorrow (words of sorrow)</field>

Your words have ripped out my insides
I find revenge within my soul
I've tried a thousand times before
To leave my demons behind me for good
I'm trapped with no escape to find
Lost without hope
Hope is now lost
As I hang on for one more tomorrow
Heart turn to black
I'm not coming back
I know I can't last
‘cause I feel like I'm dead to the world
Feel like I'm dead to the world
I've craved the feel of your caress
No chance to hold you or hurt you again
I've gone way too far this time (time)
Too far this time
I craved the sound of your distress
I loved to take out my failures on you
I'm not the old forgiving kind
Lost without hope
Hope is now lost
As I hang on for one more tomorrow
Heart turn to black
I'm not coming back
I know I can't last
‘cause I feel like I'm dead to the world
I feel like I'm dead to the world
I feel like I'm dead to the world
I'm dead to you and you're dead to me
Seems like the gods are punishing me
Shackled in chains I just can't break free
Hands around my throat tighten the grip
Bound by my sins so my wings have been clipped
I'm paying the price, I'm doing the time
Serving my sentence for doing this crime
So show me the heavens or drag me to hell
This story is over, I bid you farewell
I bid you farewell, now drag me to hell</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Ten years ago
I got a call that nearly killed me
Repeat yourself, my hands are shaking
When I was told my friend was gone
I felt so guilty
A thousand questions left unanswered
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll serenade before I do
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?
Ten years ago
I stood beside the wood that held you
I must sit down, my legs are shaking
We let you go
With gifts of plectrums for your journey
And melodies to help you on your way
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll serenade before I do
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?
I'll bleed if you want me to
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll bleed if you want me to!
On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening (I know you're listening)
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go (ten years today!?)
Where did you go (ten years today!?)
Where did you go
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?</field>

Your face is alive and bright.
But you can't see how weak you are
'cos I could end it tonight.
It's the feeling you get when you think
that someone behind is watching you.
Well I can tell you now that someone is me
And I'm about to make it right.
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor!
I creep up from behind, touch your neck
move down to your spine.
You take a look and breathe so sharp
It's just a matter of time.
Don't scream, I ask of you
but then you let one out so now it's time to go.
I come down on you like a ton of bricks
all over so now it's time to go.
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor

Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd (hit the floor!)

Can I die with you so we can never grow old ?
Cut the ties,
With this note you left behind,
As I read the word I hear you telling me why.

Too late, too late,
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late,
Can't even ask you why.
Now I'm wasting,
Away in my own misery.
I hope you're finally gone,
To a place where you belong.

My sadness shows,
As your name is carved in stone,
Can't erase the words so the reality grows.
I wish I died,
On that night by your side,
So just kill me now and let the good times roll!

Too late, too late,
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late,

Will you wait for me?
Will I see you on the other side?
You won't have to wait too long
(Yeah, yeah)
Will you come for me?
Will you take me to the other side?
Cause here I don't belong.

Too late, too late,

Too late, too late,

The ace of spades

Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil
Going with the flow, it's all a game to me
Seven or eleven, snake eyes watching you
Double up or quit, double strike or split
The ace of spades
The ace of spades
You know I born to lose, and gambling is for fools
But that's the way I like it baby
I don't wanna live forever
And don't forget the joker
Pushing up the ante, I know you've got to see me
Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be

Now feel the heat as the temperature spikes
Bodies are thrashing the fire ignites
We're gonna watch it burn
Let it turn to dust
Behold the madness
Such a beautiful sight
It will never get old
Here's to chaos tonight
So here we are
Weapons in arms
Army of noise has come to destroy
We will not fall
Brothers in arms
We will deploy our army
An army of noise
Embrace the noise let it rip through your brain
A legion of snakes that are shedding their skin
A new aggression is starting to breed
Theres no holding back
Are you ready to bleed?
Scream out, eyes wide
A venomous mainline infects you inside
So feel the sound as it pounds in your chest
Eardrums exploding bodies possessed
We're laying down our souls
Lay them down to rest
Behold the madness
Such a beautiful sight
It will never get old
Here's to chaos tonight
So here we are

Ashes of the innocent,

Taking scars of victory,
The time has passed too fast.
Singing broken melodies,
Like shards of broken glass.
Ripping through my riverie,
These scars will never last.

We get so complicated (complicated!),
This finger's for our memories.
So rip my pictures from your wall,
Tear them down, and burn them all.
Light the fire and walk away,
There's nothing left to say, so,
Take the ashes from the floor,
Bury them to just make sure,
That nothing more is left of me,
Just bittersweet memories.
I wanna run and escape from your prison,
But when I leave I feel something is missing.
I'm not afraid that's easy to tell,
This can't be heaven,
It feels like I'm in hell.

You won't win that fight
If you take me on
You'll find my breaking point
I'm at my breaking point!</field>

It's all just too much
I guess my best was not good enough
And something is certain
I miss you around
And all that I want is to be with you
You kept me breathing under the water
When everyone else left me to drown
You were the light that shone through the darkness
Now I'm blind 'cause you're not around
I know I'm not perfect, I let you down
I guess that I'm paying the price for it now
You kept me breathing under the water
When everyone else left me to drown
You were the light that shone through the darkness
Now I'm blind 'cause you're not around
I don't know how we got here
But I know I don't belong
I don't know how we got here
Or why I'm holding on</field>

With nothing left to say
Staring at the walls
Want make them go away
I need to show
The world that I'm alive
I have to break this silence
Empty out my lungs
I will be heard
Don't hold me back
Don't try and pacify
This might be hard to hear
Don't try and heal me when I'm broken
I need to hurt for me to feel
Feel anything
Don't try and fix me when I'm broken
I need to hurt for me to feel
Feel anything
I need a darker place
To go and find myself
I don't wanna hate
Or live with my regrets
I have to show
I'm strong and I'll survive
I need to break this silence
Better mark my words
I will be heard
Don't hold me back
Don't try and pacify

Don't try and heal me when I'm broken

Not dead or alive
No feeling to find
Like I've been hypnotized
How do I see
A lot in the dark
When nothing is real
And I don't hear a heart
I can't wake up from this cold dark state
Of hopelessness, so numb to everything
It's under my skin
Living within
I'm chained to my mind
So undignified
Run from the tide
That's rising so high
Come wash me away
'Cause I've no will to fight
Time won't wait for me to bend and break
Don't want to be so numb to everything
(In this coma!)
I'm free falling and the black hole opens
Vicious circle leading me to lie
I keep swimming through an empty ocean
In slow motion, in slow motion
I'm free falling and the black hole opens
Vicious circle leading me to lie
I keep swimming through an empty ocean
In slow motion, in slow motion
Time won't wait for me to bend and break
Don't want to be so numb to everything

I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
Yeah!
Under this pressure
I want to disappear
Turn on the lights as I need some clarity
So overwhelming
It's bearing down on me
And when it ends all this weight is crushing me
And nothings easing, waiting
Patience is wearing
Nothings helping, wasting
Mentally vacant
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
It's never ending
I see no end in sight
So pull the plug
that broke and charges through the night
It's almost over
And I can see the light
I still can't focus, need a spark to turn it on
And nothings easing, waiting
Patience is wearing
Nothings helping, wasting
Mentally vacant
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
And through it all
It seems so right
But through it all
I sacrifice
When it's holding you down (holding you down!)
When there's no strength to fight
(no strength to fight!)
When it's dragging you out (dragging you out!)
Find the will to survive
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
Yeah!

You've gotta sit..
Back..
And hold tight.
There's Forces working in our heads
But we don't understand them
I need a map to find my way out all the time
There's Curses Lurking in our heads
But we don't want to find them
We need to come back down and face what we've become.
We've become...
The more I think
The more I wish I would stop and hit rewind
What I would give to have or take back then
When no-one really cares
I remember when we all used to
Kick back and take days off school.
So many times I'd smile
Many times I've cried
But never did we try
Never did we try...
Theres Forces working in our heads
But we don't understand them
I need a map to find my way out all the time
There's Curses Lurking in our heads
But we don't want to find them
We need to come back down and face what we've become.
It's haunting me..
I'm so alone
I just want to find my way back home
I'm so alone...
Theres Forces working in our heads
But we don't understand them

There's Curses lurking in our heads

Your words have ripped out my insides
I find revenge within my soul
I've tried a thousand times before
To leave my demons behind me for good
I'm trapped with no escape to find
Lost without hope
Hope is now lost
As I hang on for one more tomorrow
Heart turn to black
I'm not coming back
I know I can't last
‘cause I feel like I'm dead to the world
Feel like I'm dead to the world
I've craved the feel of your caress
No chance to hold you or hurt you again
I've gone way too far this time (time)
Too far this time
I craved the sound of your distress
I loved to take out my failures on you
I'm not the old forgiving kind
Lost without hope
Hope is now lost
As I hang on for one more tomorrow
Heart turn to black
I'm not coming back
I know I can't last
‘cause I feel like I'm dead to the world
I feel like I'm dead to the world
I feel like I'm dead to the world
I'm dead to you and you're dead to me
Seems like the gods are punishing me
Shackled in chains I just can't break free
Hands around my throat tighten the grip
Bound by my sins so my wings have been clipped
I'm paying the price, I'm doing the time
Serving my sentence for doing this crime
So show me the heavens or drag me to hell
This story is over, I bid you farewell
I bid you farewell, now drag me to hell</field>

Don't try to silence and bury me,
Don't push me cause' I won't go quietly

Let them put us down, hope we're not around
They pray we go away, but we're here to stay
Time is on our side, our two worlds collide
These four words might help, just go f@#k yourself!
So let's go, relieve the pressure

When there's nothing else

It's a useless ploy
Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall
It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination
A now blacked heart
Is reaching out in divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of you life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end forcing you to bend
Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
It's domination pushed into living hell

When I'm just born to die
We're all born to die
Born to die
(2x):
Never before, never again
Behold this travesty
Never before, never again
Behold adversary
No more sorrows
No tommorows
I've never felt
Alive before
With every hour
Give me the power
I need the strength
To carry on
On and on
(3x):
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
We're all born to die
Born to die
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
Born to die
To die (3x)</field>

Can you hear the raining force?
blows out all your windows
and barricades the doors
mother natures fury takes you by the hand
showing all no mercy
wreaking death upon the land
GO!!
Caught in the eye of the storm
did the heaven just lock up and fall
We are caught in the eye of the storm
all thats left are just bodies to mourn
can you see the lighting?
can you feel the winded force?
pack up your belongings let chaos take control!
(TAKE CONTROL)
mother natures fury takes you by the hand
rip this world to pieces
did farewell to all you know (GO!!)
Caught in the eye of the storm
did the heaven just lock up and fall
We are caught in the eye of the storm
all thats left are just bodies to mourn
YEEEAHH!

Everybody wants to lose control
The music's turned up loud and the lights
Are turned down low
Wound up like a hurricane
And my head is about to explode
Can't wait to self-destruct
Can't wait to let it go
(Woah-oh) She hits the stage
(Woah-oh) She makes me crave
So come and get my money (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
I can feel your fever taking over
Can you see your fever taking over me?
I can feel your fever taking over
Got a dirty feeling that you're the remedy
Woah, Come On
So I'm looking for a spark
I've got a fire to re-ignite
Don't worry you won't get burned
So don't put up a fight
Push hard to breaking point
And I'm ready to overload
No limits and no regrets
It's time to sell my soul
(Woah-oh) You're what I want
(Woah-oh) You're what I need
So come and take my money (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
I can feel your fever taking over
Can you see your fever taking over me
I can feel your fever taking over
Got a dirty feeling that you're the remedy
That you're the remedy
Come here you naughty girl
You're such a tease
You look so beautiful
Down on your knees
Keep on those high-heeled shoes
Rip off all your clothes
You smell so fucking good
You make me lose control
Losing Control (You're what I want)
Selling My Soul (You're what I need)
Losing Control (You're what I want)
I Can'T Let You Go
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I can feel your fever taking over
Can you see your fever taking over me
I can feel your fever taking over
Got a dirty feeling that you're the remedy
That you're the remedy
You are the remedy</field>

Wooo ooh ooooh
Forget about the shit that we've been through
I wanna stay here forever and always
Wooo ooh ooooh
Standing here in front of all of you
I wanna stay here forever and always
These days are dead again
It's empty from the start
And it drives me crazy
The hours drift away
It hurts to remember
This will soon be over
Should it all come crashing down around me
Would you be there should I stumble and fall?
To pick up the pieces...

'Cause it feels like such a wast of time
And it cuts me from the inside
But I know I'm gonna be alright
My eyes are wide open
Build me up, build me up to tear me down
Sick of going through the motions
You're the gravity that keeps me falling
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Giving up, giving up so you should know
My eyes are wide open
You're the gravity that keeps pulling me down
Still stuck going nowhere
Been here many times before
Never knowing the reason
Blocking out all the voices
Screaming just to be ignored
Were never given a reason
I won't never dwell on tomorrow
'Cause it feels like such a waste of time
And it cuts me from the inside
But I know I'm gonna be alright
Forgiven, forgotten
Not looking for apologies
It feels like I'm broken
But I know I'm gonna be alright

Oh my god have I done it again,
There's a pulse and it's deafening.
I can't help what I hear in my head,
It's the switch that I flick they said.
Hand of blood, I don't wanna feel my heart is breaking.
Hand of blood, I don't wanna see my life is burning.
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take, or are you blind and seeing nothing?
(I saw you run) I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take or are you scared of being nothing?
There's a stain on my hand and it's red
Oh my god, am I losing it?
I can't help what I've done or I've said
It's the button I push
Hand of blood, I don't wanna feel my heart is breaking
Hand of blood, I don't wanna see my life is burning

Unsure of your fate, uncertainty waits your struggle within
No end and no beginnings

There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water

Time [?] left as you waste or hope disappears
So [?] now nothing is left, death is hunting the weak
Now break these chains with broken bones, become the enemy
The [?] sight, now you're [?] show no empathy
Unsure of you fate, uncertainty waits your struggle within

Our time has ended
I feel it's only just begun
And I’m frustrated
I can’t believe your not the one
My ears are bleeding
Her voice resides inside my head
And now I'm choking
(release this noose around my neck)
Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they’re gone
These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me?
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words..
to you...
The clock is ticking
My heart is bursting through my chest
And now I’m crying
(these tears are pouring off my face)
The chair is creaking
Her voice resides inside my head
And now its over
(you put this noose around my neck)
Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright?
To iron out the creases
You must lacerate me till they’re gone
These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me?
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words..

Heaven, Where is my angel?
I need her now (holding me)
Heaven, Where is my angel
I need her now..
Holding me..
Tonight

Well I can tell you now that someone is me
And I'm about to make it right.

Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor!
I creep up from behind, touch your neck
move down to your spine.
You take a look and breathe so sharp
It's just a matter of time.
Don't scream, I ask of you
but then you let one out so now it's time to go.
I come down on you like a ton of bricks
all over so now it's time to go.
Why do you take it all?

Uneasy feeling that something ain't right
And now you're all alone
Footsteps creeping up from behind
Your worst nightmare's coming to life
You better run or stand and fight
Your time has come
Start coming to terms that your life is over, over
Reaching out as the angels stare
Crying out in loving memory
Holding on for a final prayer
Crying out in loving memory
Time stops, eternity waits
Blood flows so cold
Blinded by darkness, beams so bright
Now the truth unfolds
In death, there is nothing divine
Salvation's living to die
You can't outrun, you can't outfight
This can't be won
Start coming to terms that your life is over, over
Reaching out as the angels stare
Crying out in loving memory
Holding on for a final prayer
Crying out in loving memory
Start coming terms that your life is over, over

Take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
The ring of the bells, feeling you resonate
Into the night, hearing you fade away
Do or die, this is a choice that I'm making
And it feels like I'm living a lie
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith, I'll
Jump into the fire, no fear, I'll
Take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out
Release the pressure!
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out
Release the pressure!
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out
Jump into the fire, no fear, I'll
Take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
(Jump into the fire)
(Jump into the fire)
I'm not caving in!

No longer you'll suck my blood
(You can't keep away, you need another day)
Hey leech!
You think that you are here to stay
(You can't keep away, you need another day)
Seems to me, insanity
As way to pour off our reality
You're so delusional yet
Go and feed your empathy and
Cut on the weak that believe in your lies
You're so delusional yet
Nobody's listening
Nobody cares
Nobody's listening
Nobody, nobody cares
Your invitation, it doesn't exist (doesn't exist)
So tell me why you keep crashing the party
No invitation, but you can't resist (you can't resist)
So tell me why you keep crashing the party
Hey leech!
You're living in a world of lies
(You're this fictional, so unpredictable)
Hey leech!
This time I'm right the story ends
(You're this fictional, so unpredictable)
Run motherfucker, it's time to hide
Go bury yourself in a grave of lies
You're so delusional yet
Fast, that ring on a lonely hole
And watch from below is a truth on pools
You're so delusional yet
Nobody's listening me
Nobody cares
Nobody's listening me
Nobody, nobody cares
Your invitation, it doesn't exist (doesn't exist)
So tell me why you keep crashing the party
No invitation, but you can't resist (you can't resist)
So tell me why you keep crashing the party
Nobody's listening
Nobody cares
Nobody's listening
Cause' nobody cares
Your invitation, it doesn't exist
So tell me why you keep crash and parting
No invitation, but you can't resist
So tell me why you keep crash and parting
Your invitation, it doesn't exist
So tell me why you keep crashing the party
No invention but you can resist
So tell me why you keep crashing

What I've done or what I've said to make
make you feel this way
I get the feeling this is never getting any better

First you wanna hate me, then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feeling, I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feeling, now I'm letting you go
Coldest heart I've ever known, now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me, then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feeling now I'm letting you, letting you go
So I know this hasn't gone the way that we expected
You had to try and make a fool of me
and leave a bitter taste
I tried to compromise with open eyes
but we're disconnected
Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake

This is straight from the heart
You need to take or reconcile
You wanna push me away
You wanna sacrifice what we have
I will not beg you to stay
And it hurts me to say
You're not alive

Living your life on the edge of a knife
Living your life on the edge of a knife
You're not alive

Living your life on the edge of a knife
Living your life on the edge of a knife
Don't know you're alive
Why don't you try and make things right
‘cause if you want to survive
You'll have to take a look inside
Poison – it runs through your veins
You wanna sacrifice what we made
And then is all that remains
And it hurts me to say
You're not alive

Living your life on the edge of a knife
Living your life on the edge of a knife
You're not alive

Living your life on the edge of a knife
Living your life on the edge of a knife
Hey! You're dead inside!
You never knew you were fucking alive
Hey! You're dead inside!
You're too weak, you will never survive

I'm calmer like crimson
Throwing down like water
I saw her when she hit the ground
Now, it's over

Proof, when they tear you up
When they start to fuck
When they start to piss down on my scars

We can never say that
You are gone till it comes

There's no easy way out,
There's no shortcut home.
There's no easy way out,
Giving in can't be wrong.
I don't wanna pacify you,
I don't wanna drag you down.
But I'm Feeling like a prisoner,
Like A Strange in a no-name town.
I see all the angry faces,
Afraid that could be you and me.
Talking about what might have been,
Thinking about what it used to be.

There's no easy way out,
There's no shortcut home.
There's no easy way out,
Giving in can't be wrong.
Baby baby we can shed this skin,
We can know how we feel inside.
Instead of going down an endless road,
Not knowing if we're dead or alive.
Some things are worth fighting for,
some feelings never die.
I'm not asking for another chance,
I just wanna know why.

Too numb to feel alive
So why the fuck are these thoughts in my head?
Reach in and pull them out!
Still nothing feels the same
Too late to hesitate
Why can't I run and escape from myself
And live again?
Why can't I run and escape from myself?
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
'Cos I know that in the end
There's no way out
Oh my God is this really the end?
I guess I'm not alright
I just can't tell what is real anymore
I'm trapped in my own hell
I know this can't be real
This negativity
Is dominating and smothering me
I just can't breathe
I just can't tell what is real anymore
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
'Cos I know that in the end
There's no way out
There's nothing left for me
Just tainted memories
There's no one here for me
Just let me be
Why can't I run and escape from myself
I just can't tell what is real anymore
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
'Cos I know that in the end
There's no...
No way out!
Yeah!

Why you wouldn't listen
Watching you decline
What were you expecting
I can't save you from yourself
When you don't want saving
It's on your head
Don't point the finger point the blame
Cos the warning signs were clear
You just wouldn't listen
I know it hurts
Tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
They won't mean anything
I hope it hurts
You've only got yourself to blame
And I can't take this anymore
I'm over it
So over it
Breathe in breathe out
I feel it coming round again

Woah, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh
Please don't pretend
Woah, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh
It's not the end
I won't take this
You lost my sympathy
I, I have had enough of this
Stand by your fall from grace
Let it sink, don't swim
I was in too deep
But I can't let
You take another piece of me
You can break me down
Little bit by bit
But I won't let you
Keep another piece of me
Let it sink, don't swim
I was in too deep
But I can't let
You keep another piece of me
You can break me down
Little bit by bit
But I won't let you
Keep another piece of me</field>

This time we must be sure
No going back, no bow to take
Can't even hesitate
We've nothing left to lose
There's no one here but fools
A rush of blood
A bitter taste, this world has sealed our fate
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Now we're playing God
Playing God
Playing God
No one will stop us now, we're playing God
Thrown out, cast aside
Rejection won't subside
Don't turn the cheek, don't walk away, it's time to decimate
Let's make them hurt and pay
Their turn to run away
Tonight we fight
We make a stand, a dance on shallow graves
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Now we're playing God
Playing God
Playing God
No one will stop us now, we're playing God
Nothing can stop us if we're playing God
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Now hear our noise,
Hear us coming so loud and so clear
This is our call to arms, and confrontation is near
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Now we're playing God
Playing God
Playing God
No one will stop us now we're playing God
Nothing can stop us cause we're playing God
I'm playing God</field>

Hey, don't walk away
I'm not done with you, you're not done with me
Stop, we can't survive
Will you die for me? 'Cause I'll die for you
I, I'm not insane
Cut my heart with this razor blade
Take this sacrifice
You can't beat on me, cannot beat on you?
Come take this sacrifice (2x)
You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain
Over and over again
You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain
And nothing in between!
Hey, there's no escape
You can't run from me, I can run from you
Bow, cause I am your God
Will you pray to me?
Cause I'll pray for you!
Push your sins aside
Nobody cares to his fuck inside
Embrace your empathy
I don't care for you, you don't care for me!
Embrace your empathy (2x)
You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain
Over and over again
You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain
And nothing in between!
You don't want to hear truth!
You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain
Over and over again
You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain
And nothing in between
No, nothing in between!
No, nothing in between!
Come take this sacrifice!</field>

So you wanna play games with my head?
But you, make me fall apart, I wish that I was dead
I just can't believe I fell, for such a blackened
heart
You played me for a fool and used me from the start
Fuck you (fuck it all)
I just want to know the truth,
but the words from your heart they just cloud,
All the negativity, forces me down into (silence)
But still I can dream,
I wanna know, I wanna know
If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside
Now I fucking hate you, with all of my heart
Just disappear, and never will I fear for my life
I just want to be alone,
And never, no never, will I be unhappy and low,
I wanna know, I wanna know
If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside
You're so pretty on the outside
You're so pretty on the outside
So you wanna play games with my head
But you make me fall apart, and wish that I was dead
Can't believe I fell for such a blackened heart
You played me for a fool and just used me from the
start
I just wanna know the truth (but the words from your mouth)
All your negativity (you keep forcing me down)
Into silence I can dream (into silence I can dream)
Into silence I can dream
If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty? (pretty!)
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty? (pretty!)
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside
Whoa, you re so pretty on the outside
Whoa, (you re so pretty on the outside)
You're so pretty on the outside!</field>

Kicking and screaming and going to swinging
Without my soul your a gun without a trigger
Vengeance is burning, who made you the king of the dead?
This is a war
That can never be won
Let me go!
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell!
This is a war

Raising Hell!
Your just choice, are you impress of your master?
No mistakes your in force
Are you hearing this?
You want to test me?
I know, I'll Destroy you!
Save your breath, there's nothing here left
I'm telling You!
Everyday seems like I'm running with the reaper
Kicking and screaming, the demons are singing
It's to late as the break is getting deeper, weightless
I'll make you a Slave Of The Dead

On a road to nowhere
Trapped in a world of endless days,
My engine's stalling (Road to nowhere)
Body and mind are breaking down
On a road to nowhere
Destiny silent, hear no sound
As I wait forever.
Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
Feelings have failed me
Left me cold
On this road to nowhere
(Road to Nowhere)
Dreams are my saviors,
Save me now,
'Cause I know I'm fallin' (Oh yes)
Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
Candles burn slowly,
Flames shine so brightly
Light in the darkness,
Save me from madness again
Only the lonely,
could possibly know me
Heat keeps on rising,
Fire engulfs me again
KEEPS ON RISING
Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you</field>

You screamed his name and I came in your direction
Fists start to fly, say goodbye

So I… (spit you out)
To what I cut the ties? or do I
(hold on tight)
(Time has come for me to realise
All the things I loved I now despise)
But it’s my life
(I’m taken back what’s mine)
It’s our time
(To rise above)
It’s my life
(I’m taken back what’s mine)
It’s our time
Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don’t feel it’s over
I’ve never felt this way before
With you around me I don’t feel it’s over
I am what I am
So I… (spit you out)
And you justified, how I…
(Time has come for me to realise
All the things I loved I now despise)
But it’s my life
(I’m taken back what’s mine)
It’s our time
(To rise above)
It’s my life
(I’m taken back what’s mine)
It’s our time
Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don’t feel it’s over
I’ve never felt this way before
With you around me I don’t feel it’s over now!
[guitar solo]
(I know you’re faking
You try to get me back
I know your faking it)
But it’s my life
(I’m taken back what’s mine)
It’s our time
(To rise above)
It’s my life
(I’m taken back what’s mine)
It’s our time

(I've taken everything)
This is our time to lose control!
(What do you want from me)
You line them up we'll put them down
This is so frustrating
To watch you sleezing all around
Yet you keep on smiling
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
What can I do to make you feel…
…you're wanted
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
I’m suffocating under words of sorrow (words of sorrow)
Her skin reflects behind the blur
I’m intoxicated
Where am I from why am I here
(your so predictable)
Fingers running through my hair…
…but its all just fiction!
She steps out from her underwear…
…so beautiful
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
What can I do to make you feel…
…you're wanted
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
I’m suffocating under words of sorrow (words of sorrow)
Go!
(there's bodies lying on the floor)
But I keep on staring…
(my world is over, close the door)
Her skin reflects behind the blur
I’m intoxicated
Where am I from? Why am I here?
(you're so predictable)
fingers running through my hair
I’m a new addiction
She steps out from her underwear
(so beautiful)
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
What can I do to make you feel…
…you're wanted
What can I do to make you see…

I'm always thinking of you
And all the things that you do
Self-centred satisfaction
No more will I run from you
Dysfunction family values
I'll die but i will not fear
Stop talking words of wisdom
You fool I'm standing right here
Chorus:
The world is on your shoulders
The weight it's crushing me
Now we're all getting older
Take it out, take it out
Take it out, take it out
Take it out on me
Take it out on me
Take it out on me
Take it out on me
Vent your frustration
On me
I feel so much destruction
In everything that you do
Anger is creeping in me
Watch i don't expolde on you
My rage it comes so quickly one
Spark and will ignite
Self-harming mutilation cuts deep
But the pain feels so right
(Chorus)
This fire burns inside
Turning things inside
There's no where left to hide
This fire burns inside
This fire burns inside
This rage can't be denied
(Chorus)
Take it out</field>

With blood shot eyes I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
The moments die, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Oh yeah
This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end? I'm hoping
My world is over one more time
Let's go!
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come
Better!
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home</field>

You pour your salt into my wounds

            <field name="lyrics">Ten years ago
I got a call that nearly killed me
Repeat yourself, my hands are shaking
When I was told my friend was gone
I felt so guilty
A thousand questions left unanswered
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll serenade before I do
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?
Ten years ago
I stood beside the wood that held you
I must sit down, my legs are shaking
We let you go
With gifts of plectrums for your journey
And melodies to help you on your way
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll serenade before I do
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?
I'll bleed if you want me to
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll bleed if you want me to!
On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening (I know you're listening)
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go (ten years today!?)
Where did you go (ten years today!?)
Where did you go
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?</field>

Your fingernails that marked my back now rot in earth
The sheets we slept in blew away and now the storm is over
The taste of you inside my mouth remains but still I’m hearing
There’s no love, everybody’s crying
There’s no truth, everyone’s misguiding
And now the end is here!
There’s no more pills to swallow!
The bitter taste I feel won’t lead me to tomorrow!
Your scent reminds me of a place I used to go
The kisses placed upon my neck show signs of… no return!
The bed we fucked in smells the same but now the stench is fading
The taste of you inside my mouth remains but still I’m hearing
There’s no love, everybody’s crying
There’s no truth, everyone’s misguiding
And now the end is here!
There’s no more pills to swallow!
The bitter taste I feel won’t lead me to tomorrow!
Cries for anger! Lies for power!
Fighting for nothing is what you were born for
Cries for anger! Lies for power!
Fighting for nothing is what you were born for
Yeah!...
Cries for anger! Lies for power!

No, I'm not ready to let you go
No, you need to hear this all you know
These are our times, never forget
No looking back, no more regrets
One thing we've learned from our mistakes
The harder the heart, the harder it breaks
Now you can never be trusted
You're not the person I once could rely
You've gone and burnt all your bridges
Do I have to sit and watch til nothing remains
No, I'm not ready to let you go

No looking back, no more regrets

I don't wanna try and feel the pain you're going through
'Til the death you've seen this through
Cold sweats, hallucinations
I wanna scream to show the hell I'm going through
The addiction's taken you
Can you see me through bloodshot eyes (bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight for what is right or let it die?
Now I'm choking on force-fed lies
Do I fight or let it die?
I will fight, one more fight
Don't break down in front of me
I will fight, win the fight?
I am not the enemy
I will try one last time
Are you listening to me?
I will fight, the last fight
I am not your enemy
Everyone is sick of caring
No silver lining on the cloud that covers you
Let it pour and soak you through
No hope, just desperation
So sit and wait for death and pray it takes you soon
The addiction's taken you
Can you see me through bloodshot eyes (bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight for what is right or let it die?
Now I'm choking on force-fed lies
Do I fight or let it die?

Don't break down in front of me

Are you listening to me?
I will fight, the last fight
I am not your enemy
Can you fell me through bloodshot eyes (bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight another night or let it die?
Now I'm choking on every lie
Do I fight or let it die?
I will fight, one more fight
Don't break down in front of me
I will fight, win the fight?
I am not the enemy
I will try one last time

Your stare it rips a hole into my life
Am I supposed to leave this all behind?

Your scent is poison when I breathe you in
It's there with every single breath I take
If this is it then don't resuscitate
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine
It's on my skin
Your scent is poison when I breathe you in
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time (for the very last time)
Don't you speak
You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak
I guarantee I won't be losing sleep
'Cause you're the one that made this end complete
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine

Truth hurts and I'm in pain
Truth hurts like a bed of nails
Letting denial eat me up inside
The truth hurts, and it bleeds me dry
No more lies, no more games
Is it too late to make a change?
If hope is gone then what's the point
Just pass my knife and it cuts my throat
A downward spiral takes control
Another chance to sell my soul
There's no one here that can save me now
I'm coming up just to come back down

I pull my heart from the end
You always took it and broke it over me
You say that I didn't care
How could my dream turn to despair?
Turn to despair
There is temporary redemption
Your demise is my creation
Let me talk into the next one
Talking symbols
We need some hope and recollection
Maybe then there'll be less tension
Take the one and burn the clothes off
Proceed with caution
I pull my heart from the end
You always took it and broke it over me
You say that I didn't care
How could my dream turn to despair?
Push it, go
Time to release the crease in the beast
The blood shed and killing when will it cease
Clenching our fist at the snap of our wrist
Time to get up and get down with the shh
Too much sorrow, no tomorrow
Too much sorrow, no tomorrow
Too much sorrow, no tomorrow
Too much sorrow, no tomorrow

But everywhere I go I feel you
Can you feel me?
Why can't I just forget you
I wanna shred my skin to love you
Can you hear me?
Now I'm giving up
I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste
Of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste
Of your venom
How dare you play the victim?
This tortured lies
They see right through you
Oh, right through you
But still you keep me captive
And make me feel like I deserve you
But I...
Hate you!
Hate you!
Now I'm giving up
I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste
Of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste
Of your venom
I feel asphyxiated
It's more then I can take
But nothing ever changes in the end
No more I'm suffocating
You'll gonna lost your grip
But nothing ever changes in the end
Here we go again
But I...
Hate you!
Hate you!
Now I'm giving up
I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste
Of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste
Of your venom
Giving up, never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste
Of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste
Of your venom</field>

2, 3, 4!
Helpless
My eyes are bleeding from the fear that's inside,
You sealed your demise when you took what was mine,
Don't try to stop me from avenging this world,
No voice to be heard
Waking The Demon,
Where'd ya run to?
Walking in shadows,
Watch the blood flow,
There's not much longer, so don't try to fight,
Your bodie's weakening, walk to the light,
Those painful times, so alone, so ashamed,
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain
(Pushing!)
Caution, there's just no limits to the boundaries you push
I warned you but still you just fuck with my mind
There's no escape from this rage that I feel,
Nothing is real,
Waking The Demon,
Where'd ya run to?
Walking in shadows,
Watch the blood flow,
There's not much longer, so don't try to fight,
Your bodie's weakening, walk to the light,
Those painful times, so alone, so ashamed,
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain
Breath for me,
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me,Possession taking over [X2]
Nooooo!
Tread!
Breath for me,
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me, Possession taking over [X2]
Waking The Demon!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again</field>

You're only alive when you torture the weak

Don't be afraid
No remorse, no restraint
These scars won't heal
Now you're the victim I'm making you feel

I need you to know what you've done can you hear?
Can you hear me roar?
Don't suffer in your silence

I'm not to blame if your world turns to black
As your eyes start to blister
There's just no hope for a final embrace
So here we are
I'm in your head
I'M In Your Heart
You were told to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal (Your Betrayal)
I was told to stay away
Those two words I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal (Your Betrayal)
Is it my turn to die?
My heart is pounding I say goodbye
So now I dance in the flames
I love you crying and screaming my name
You said that we'd be forever
How could you kill me and lie to my face
Now that we can't be together
There's just no hope for a final embrace

Can't wait to return the favor

Too many time I've seen it, rip a hole into our friendship

You've gotta sit, back, and, hold tight

There's Forces working in our heads

I need a map to find my way out all the time
There's Curses Lurking in our heads
But we don't want to find them
We need to come back down and face what we've become

We've become

The more I think
The more I wish I would stop, and hit rewind
What I would give to have or take back then,
When no-one really cares
I remember when we all used to
Kick back, and take days off school

So many times I'd smile
Many times I've cried,
But never did we try
Never did we try

There's Forces working in our heads
But we don't understand them
I need a map to find my way out all the time
There's Curses Lurking in our heads
But we don't want to find them
We need to come back down and face what we've become

Its haunting me I'm so alone
I just want to find my way back home
I'm so alone

There's Forces working in our heads

I need a map to find my way out all the time

You were at ease on your knees in his apartment
You said his name as I came in your direction
Now I can choose what to do with both of you

I loved you
(I hate you)
You hurt me
(I love you)
I loved you
You hurt me bad, go

Your words bury me of what I used to be
I can't erase all those things I've seen
Your heart smothers me and now it's hard to breathe
I can't erase all my memories

I take a step to the left, now you see me
Tears start to pour as you crawl in his apartment
You screamed his name as I came in your direction
Fists start to fly, say goodbye there's no excuses

I loved you
(I hate you)
You hurt me
(I love you)
I loved you
You hurt me bad, go

Your words bury me of what I used to be
I can't erase all those things I've seen
Your heart smothers me and now it's hard to breathe
I can't erase all my memories

Ohh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh

Get up, hey, there's no excuses
Hey, hey, there's no excuses, hey

I loved you
(I hate you)
You hurt me
(I love you)
I loved you
You hurt me bad, go

Your words bury me of what I used to be
I can't erase all those things I've seen
Your heart smothers me and now it's hard to breathe
I can't erase all my memories

Do I cut the ties, or do I hold on tight

But it's my life, I'm takin' back what's mine
It's our time to rise above
It's my life, I'm takin' back what's mine
It's our time!

Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it?s over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it?s over

I am what I am, so I spit you out
Can you justify how I
Time has come for me to realize
All the things I loved I now despise

But it's my life, I'm taking back what's mine
It's our time to rise above
It's my life, I'm taking back what's mine

Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it's over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it's over now

I know you're faking, you try to get me back
I know you're faking it

Feel it's over
Feel it's over

How we doing everyone?}

But it's my life, I'm taking back what's mine
It's our time to rise above

            <field name="lyrics">Ten years ago
I got a call that nearly killed me
Repeat yourself, my hands are shaking

When I was told my friend was gone
I felt so guilty
A thousand questions left unanswered

(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll serenade before I do
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)

On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?

Ten years ago
I stood beside the wood that held you
I must sit down, my legs are shaking

We let you go
With gifts of plectrums for your journey
And melodies to help you on your way

(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll serenade before I do
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)


On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?

I'll bleed if you want me to
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll bleed if you want me to!

On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening (I know you're listening)
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go (ten years today!?)
Where did you go (ten years today!?)
Where did you go
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Once more, I'll say goodbye to you
Things happen, but we don't really know why
If it's supposed to be like this
Why do most of us ignore the chance to miss?

Oh yeah

Torn apart at the seams and my dreams turn to tears
I'm not feeling this situation
Run away, try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like
Me, me, yeah, yeah
All these things I hate revolve around
Me, me, yeah, yeah
Just back off before I snap

Once more you tell those lies to me
Why can't you just be straight up with honesty?
When you say those things in my ear
Why do you always tell me what you wanna hear?

Oh yeah

Wear your heart on your sleeve, make things hard to believe
I'm not feeling this situation
Run away, try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like
Me, me, yeah, yeah
All these things I hate revolve around
Me, me, yeah, yeah
Just back off before I snap, and you'll see
Me, me, me
All these things I hate revolve around
Me, me, yeah, yeah
Just back off before I snap

Torn apart at the seams are my dreams to the tears
I'm not feeling this situation
Run away, try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like me

It's the best place to be when you're
Me, me, yeah, yeah
All these things I hate revolve around

I feel it's only just begun
And I'm frustrated
I can't believe you're not the one

My ears are bleeding
Her voice resides inside my head
And now I'm choking
(release this noose around my neck)

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they're done

These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me?
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words, to you

The clock is ticking
My heart is bursting through my chest
And now I'm crying
(these tears are pouring off my face)

The chair is creaking
Her voice resides inside my head
And now it's over
(you put this noose around my neck)

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they're done

These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me?
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words, to you

Heaven, where is my angel?
I need her now (holding me)
Heaven, where is my angel
I need her now
Holding me
Tonight

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they're done

These are my final words to you

Your face is alive and bright
But you can't see how weak you are
Cause I could end it tonight

It's the feeling you get when you think
That someone behind is watching you
Well I can tell you know that someone is me
And I'm about to make it right

Why do you take it all, why do I beg for more
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all, why do I beg for more
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor

I creep up from behind
Touch your neck, move down your spine
You take a look and breathe so sharp
Just a matter of time

Don't scream I ask of you
But then you let one out so know its time to go
I come down on you like a ton of bricks
All over so its time to go

Why do you take it all, why do I beg for more
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all, why do I beg for more
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor

Hit the floor

Why do you take it all, why do I beg for more
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all, why do I beg for more
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor

Take this from me, I don't wanna hurt you
Take this from me, I don't wanna hurt you</field>

To keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending

Hard times we always saw
There's nothing left of you no more
Fear has no place, no place
Cover her face

Holding on to you
To keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending
This is our last goodbye (goodbye)

This is our time tonight

I check out everything
This is our time to lose control
What do you want from me
You line them up we'll put them down
This is so frustrating
To watch you sleezing all around
Yet you keep on smiling

What can I do to make you see?
You're guilty
What can I do to make you feel?
You're wanted
What can I do to make you see?
You're guilty
I'm suffocating under words of sorrow

Her skin reflects behind the blur
I'm intoxicated
Where am I from why am I here
(Your so predictable)
Fingers running through my hair?
But its all just fiction
She steps out from her underwear?
So beautiful

What can I do to make you see?
You're guilty
What can I do to make you feel?
You're wanted
What can I do to make you see?
You're guilty
I'm suffocating under words of sorrow

Go!

(There's bodies lying on the floor)
But I keep on staring?
(My world is over, close the door)

Her skin reflects behind the blur
I'm intoxicated
Where am I from? Why am I here?
(You're so predictable)
Fingers running through my hair
I'm a new addiction
She steps out from her underwear
(So beautiful)

What can I do to make you see?
You're guilty
What can I do to make you feel?

What can I do to make you see?

There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things bet-ter?

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home

The moments died, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going on

Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home

This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end I'm hoping
My world is over one more time

Let's go!

Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me (tears don't fall)
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come (conscience calls)

Better!

What'd you use to hurt me?
Something you should know
Cannot take no more!
Time to settle scores!
Feel the rage that fuels me!
I will not give up!

Hypocrisy from jealousy [Repeat x2]

Words you spit are harmless to me
Your spite, your greed, your envy
Watch you scream now hold on to me!
Your smile, you're triggering me!

Why do you stoop so low!?
Am I the last to know!?

Why do you stoop so low!?
Am I the last to know!?

Where's your big mouth now!?
Hope you're fucking proud!
Do you like your bruises!?
Now you make no sound!
Was your lesson learned!?
Now the tables turn!
What were your intentions?!
So come on down now break!

Hypocrisy from jealousy [Repeat x2]

Watch you scream now hold on to me!
Your smile, you're triggering me!

Just close your eyes
And say goodbye
Here in your pause
Go on and on and on

I live my life in misery
I sacrificed this world to hold you
No breath left inside of me
Shattered glass keeps falling

Say
Say goodnight
Just sleep tight
Say goodnight

Flowers laid out for you
So many colors leave me blind
Seeing your face reflect from a babies eyes

I live my life in misery
I sacrificed this world to hold you
No breath left inside of me
Shattered glass keeps falling

Say
Say goodnight
Just sleep tight
Say goodnight

So here I am
You're inside of me
So here I am
Our worlds may suffer
So here I am
You're inside of me
So here I am
Our worlds may suffer

Here I am with you
I'm there 'til the end
Memories are told and
So farewell my friend
Farewell my friend!

Here I am with you

God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

Fuck this battlefield
The bullets shatter round me
Bodies falling
Voices calling for me
Limbs are flying
Men are crying
Such a hurtful sight
The call is made
It's one for all
Take no prisoners

Take it out, take it out, take it out, take it out
Take it out on me, take it out on me
Take it out on me, take it out on me
Vent your frustration on me

I feel so much destruction in everything that you do
Anger is creeping in me watch i don't explode on you
My rage it comes so quickly one spark and will ignite
Self-harming mutilation cuts deep but the pain feels so right

The world is on your shoulders
The weight it's crushing me
Now we're all getting older
Take it out, take it out, take it out, take it out
Take it out on me, take it out on me
Take it out on me, take it out on me
Vent your frustration on me

This fire burns inside
Turning things inside
There's no where left to hide
This fire burns inside
This fire burns inside
This rage can't be denied

The world is on your shoulders
The weight it's crushing me

Take it out, take it out, take it out, take it out
Take it out on me, take it out on me
Take it out on me, take it out on me

Walking in shadows,
Watch the blood flow
There's not much longer so don't try and fight,
Your body's weakening so walk to the light
All those painful times so alone so ashamed,
I'm not coming back there's nothing to gain

Caution, there's just no limits to the boundaries you push,
I've warned you but still you just fuck with my mind
There's no escape from this rage that I feel,
Nothing is real

Waking the Demon,

There's not much longer so don't try and fight,
Your body's weakening so walk to the light

Stay with me,

Drain your blood

I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me
Start begging for your mercy

Please forgive me (please forgive me)

The smell of fear's around you.
Do you want to scream
Let it out cause no one can hear you

I wanna leave you, it's easy to see

We get so complicated (complicated)

So rip my pictures from your wall
Tear them down, and burn them all
Light the fire and walk away
There's nothing left to say, so
Take the ashes from the floor
Bury them to just make sure
That nothing more is left of me
Just bittersweet memories

I wanna run and escape from your prison,
But when I leave I feel something is missing.
I'm not afraid that's easy to tell,
This can't be heaven,
It feels like I'm in hell.
You're like a drug that I can't stop taking,
I want more and I can't stop craving.
I still want you it's easy to see,
But guess what honey?
You're not that good for me.

We can't blame this world forever (This world forever)

The end will never come
There's still a mountain left to climb
But we will overcome the hurdles placed inside our minds
(So close, but still so far)
Each day will bring us a brand new stars
(What are we fighting for)
We cannot live like this no more
'Cause in the thick of darkened days, we know

We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out, or are we breaking down
We can't blame this world forever (This world forever)

Just need some clarity, can't seem to open up these eyes
For what your sympathy it took me time to realize
(This is not what I want)
Or how I thought this life would be
(This is not what we wanted)
So take this shit away from me
'Cause in the thick of darkened days, we know

We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out, or are we breaking down
We can't blame this world forever (This world forever)

So are we breaking out, or are we breaking down
I guess what's done is done
But we will overcome

Whoa-oh she hits the stage
Whoa-oh she makes me crave
So come and get my money (whoa)

I can feel your fever, taking over
Can you see your fever, taking over me

Got a dirty feeling, that you're the remedy

Whoa come on!

So I'm looking for a spark
I've got a body to re-ignite
Don't worry you won't get burned
So don't, don't put up a fight

Push hard to breaking point
And I'm ready to overload
No limits and no regrets
It's time to sell my soul

Whoa-oh you're all I want
Whoa-oh you're all I need
So come and take my money (whoa-oh-oh-oh)

I can feel your fever, taking over
Can you see your fever, taking over me
I can feel your fever, taking over
Got a dirty feeling, that you're the remedy
That you're the remedy

Come here you naughty girl you're such a tease
You look so beautiful down on your knees
Keep on those high heel shoes rip off all your clothes
You smell so fucking good it makes me lose control!

Losing control! (You're all I want)
Selling my soul! (You're all I need)
Losing control! (You're all I want)
I can't let you go!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Don't break down in front of me

I will fight, the last fight
I am not your enemy

Everyone is sick of caring
No silver lining on the cloud that covers you
Let it pour and soak you through

No hope, just desperation
So sit and wait for death
And pray it takes you soon

You played me for a fool and used me from the start

Fuck you (fuck you), I just want to know the truth,
But the words from your heart they just cloud,
All the negativity, forces me down into (silence)
But still I can pray,
I wanna know, I wanna know

If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside

Now I fucking hate you, with all of my heart
Just disappear, and never will I fear for my life
I just want to be alone,
And never, no never, will I be unhappy alone,
I wanna know, I wanna know

If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you re only
Pretty on the outside

You're so pretty on the outside
You're so pretty on the outside

So you wanna play games with my head
But you make me fall apart, and wish that I was dead
Can't believe I fell for such a blackened heart
You played me for a fool and just used me from the start

I just wanna know the truth (but the words from your mouth)
All your negativity (you keep forcing me down)
Into silence I can dream (into silence I can dream)
Into silence I can dream

If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty? (pretty!)
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty? (pretty!)
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside

Whoa, you're so pretty on the outside
Whoa, (you're so pretty on the outside)
You're so pretty on the outside!</field>

My blood is boiling inside of my veins
An evil feeling attacks (attacks)
My body shaking there's no turning back

So take your eyes off the trigger
I'm not to blame if your world turns to black
As your eyes start to blister
There's just no hope for our final embrace
So here we are, I'm in your head
I'm in your heart!

You were told to to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!

I was told to stay away
Those two words I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!

Is it my turn to die?
My heart is pounding as I say goodbye
So now I dance in the flames
I love you crying and screaming my name

You said that we'd be forever
How could you kill me and lie to my face
Now that we can't be together
There's just no hope for our final embrace
So here we are, I'm in your head
I'm in your heart!

You were told to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!

I was told to stay away
Those two words I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!

Go!

So here we are (so here we are, I'm in your head
(I'm in your head)
I'm in your heart!

You were told to to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!

I was told to stay away

Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!

You like to scream use words as a weapon
Well go ahead take your best shot woman
I wanna leave you, it's easy to see
But guess what honey it's not that easy

We get so complicated (complicated)
This finger's for our memories

So rip my pictures from your wall
Tear them down, and burn them all
Light the fire and walk away
There's nothing left to say, so
Take the ashes from the floor
Bury them to just make sure
That nothing more is left of me
Just bittersweet memories

I wanna run and escape from your prison,
But when I leave I feel something is missing.
I'm not afraid that's easy to tell,
This can't be heaven,
It feels like I'm in hell.
You're like a drug that I can't stop taking,
I want more and I can't stop craving.
I still want you it's easy to see,
But guess what honey?
You're not that good for me.

'Cause if you want to survive
You'll have to take a look inside.

Kill your enemies
My brother is dead around me
The wounds are hurting
Death is creeping for me

Smoke is lighting, hearts are pounding
Chaos soon ignites
The carnage made is one for all
Will I meet my maker?

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die

God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

Scream from the ?

Fuck these battlefields
The bullets stand around me
Bodies falling voices calling for me

Limbs are flying, men are crying
Such a hurtful sight
The carnage made is one for all
See no prisoners

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time

Oh, she steals the show

You could say she got it all

Never had a woman, never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things, doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin-and-bones
But you give all you got, weighin' in at nineteen stone

You're a whole lotta woman

Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're whole lotta woman,

Oh honey, you can do, do it to me all night long
Only one can turn, only one can turn me on
All through the night-time
Right around the clock ouh
To my surprise, Rosie never stops

You're a whole lotta woman

Unsure of your fate, uncertainty waits your struggle within

Time ??? left as you waste or hope disappears
So ??? now nothing is left, death is hunting the weak
Now break these chains with broken bones, become the enemy
The ??? sight, now you're ??? show no empathy
Unsure of you fate, uncertainty waits your struggle within

Here's to chaos tonight

So here we are
Weapons in arms
Army of noise has come to destroy
We will not fall
Brothers in arms
We will deploy our army

Yeah
Embrace the noise let it rip through your brain
A legion of snakes that are shedding their skin (shedding their skin)
A new aggression is starting to breed
There's no holding back
Are you ready to bleed
Scream out, eyes wide
A venomous mainline infects you inside
So feel the sound as it pounds in your chest
Eardrums exploding bodies possessed

We're laying down our souls
Lay them down to rest

Don't try to heal me when I'm broken
I need to hurt for me to feel, feel anything
Don't try to fix me when I'm broken
I need to hurt for me to feel, feel anything

I need a darker place to go and find myself
I don't want to hate or live with my regrets
I have to show I'm strong and I'll survive
I need to break this silence, better mark my words

Don't hold me back, don't try to pass it by

Don't try to heal me when I'm broken

Oh my God is this really the end

I just can't tell what is real anymore

I see ???
Is this twisted and crazed
Or a brilliant disguise

Pissed off ??? out of stuff to say
??? turns into misery
I'm your pariah, take it out on me
I ??? no reality
I suck up all your vanity
I'm your pariah, take it out on me

I cling to you like a moth to a flame
I was a piece of a puzzle you played in your own game
(I play your game)
??? by the look in your eye
???
Now I'm holding on tight, fighting hard just to survive

Is this sick and depraved
I see ???
Is this twisted and crazed
Or a brilliant disguise

Pissed off ??? out of stuff to say
??? turns into misery
I'm your pariah, take it out on me
I ??? no reality
I suck up all your vanity
I'm your pariah, take it out on me

You know it's what I hate
So come and take it out on me

Is this sick and depraved
I see ???
Is this twisted and crazed
Or a brilliant disguise

Pissed off ??? out of stuff to say
??? turns into misery
I'm your pariah, take it out on me
I ??? no reality
I suck up all your vanity
I'm your pariah, take it out on me</field>

This time we must be sure
No going back, no bow to take, can't even hesitate
We've nothing left to lose
There's no one here but fools
A rush of blood
A bitter taste this world has sealed our fate

No one can stop us now, we're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
Can stop us now, we're taking back control

Now we're playing God
Playing God, playing God
No one will stop us if we're playing God

Thrown out, cast aside
Rejection won't subside
Don't turn the cheek, don't walk away, it's time to decimate
Let's make them hurt and pray
Their turn to run away
Tonight we fight
We make a stand and dance on shallow graves

No one can stop us now, we're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
Can stop us now, we're taking back control

Now we're playing God
Playing God, playing God
No one will stop us now we're playing God
Nothing can stop us if we're playing God

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for? Oh

Now hear our noise, hear us coming so loud and so clear
This is our call to arms, and confrontation is near

No one can stop us now, we're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
Stop us now, we're taking back control

Now we're playing God
Playing God, playing God
No one will stop us now we're playing God
Nothing can stop us 'cause we're playing God

We're playing God</field>

Can't touch the flames (flames)
This is reality, an infamous game
I taste the blood (blood)
Can't seem to cave (cave)
The deed is done, but the debt is unpaid

Everyday it seems I'm running from the reaper
Kicking and screaming and going down swinging
Without my soul you're a gun without a trigger
Fate is unfolding, who made you the king of the dead

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

Raising hell!

You got a choice, you digress off your master
No restraints, no remorse are you hearing this
You wanna test me I know, I'll destroy you
Save your breath, nothing's left here I come at you

Everyday seems like I'm running with the reaper
Kicking and screaming, the demons are singing
Disarray as the grave is getting deeper
Weakness is showing, I'll make you a slave for the dead (for the dead)
Slave for the dead

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

Raising hell!

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall

This is a war that can never be won

I'll fight forever as the heavens fall

How dare you play the victim
These tortured eyes, they see right through you
Right through you
But still you keep my captive
And make me feel like I deserve you
But I hate you, hate you

Now I'm giving up, I'm never looking back

I feel asphyxiated
It's more than I can take
But nothing ever changes in the end
No more I'm suffocating
You've gone and lost your grip
But nothing ever changes in the end

Here we go again
Hate you, hate you

Now I'm giving up, I'm never looking back

Giving up, never looking back

No one's fall but your own

what i would give to have a day back then when no one really cares
i remember when we all used to kick back take days off school
so many times i've smiled so many times i've cried but never did we try
never did we try

they keep me locked up in this cage
can't they see it's why my brain says rage?
sanitarium
leave me be
sanitarium
just leave me alone
build my fear of what's out there
and cannot breathe the open air
whisper things into my brain
assuring me that i'm insane
they think our heads are in their hands
but violent use brings violent plans
keep him tied
it makes him well
he's getting better
can't you tell?
no more can they keep us in
listen
damn it
we will win
they see it right
they see it well
but they think this saves us from our hell
sanitarium
leave me be
sanitarium
just leave me alone
sanitarium
just leave me alone
fear of living on
natives getting restless now
mutiny in the air
got some death to do
mirror stares back hard
kill
it's such a friendly word
seems the only way
for reaching out again.</field>

i watch you sleeping
the warmth i feel beside me is slowly fading
would she hear me
if i call her name?
would she hold me
if she knew my shame?
there's always something different going wrong
the path i walk is in the wrong direction
there's always someone fucking hanging on
can anybody help me make things better?
your tears don't fall
they crash around me
her conscious calls
too guilty to come home
your tears don't fall
they crash around me
her conscious calls
too guilty to come home
the moments died
i hear no screaming
the visions left inside me are slowly fading
would she hear me
if i call her name?
would she hold me
if she knew my shame?
there's always something different going wrong
the path i walk is in the wrong direction
there's always someone fucking hanging on
can anybody help me make it better?
your tears don't fall
they crash around me
her conscious calls

your tears don't fall
they crash around me
her conscious calls

your tears don't fall

your tears don't fall

her conscious calls
too guilty
your tears don't fall
they crash around me
her conscious calls
too guilty to come home
your tears don't fall
they crash around me

too guilty to come home
your tears don't fall.</field>

i wanna leave you it's easy to see

this finger's for our memories
so rip my pictures from your wall
tear them down and burn them all
light the fire
walk away
there's nothing left to say so
take the ashes from the floor
bury them to just make sure
that nothing more is left of me
just bittersweet memories
i wanna run 'n' escape from your prison
but when i leave i feel something is missing
i'm not afraid that's easy to tell
this can't be heaven it feels like i'm in hell
you're like a drug that i can't stop taking
i want more and i can't stop craving

i've craved the feel of your caress
no chance to hold you or hurt you again
i've gone way too far this time
too far this time
i craved the sound of your distress
i loved to take out my failures on you
i'm not the old forgiving kind
i feel like i'm dead to the world
i feel like i'm dead to the world
i'm dead to you and you're dead to me
seems like the gods are punishing me
shackled in chains i just can't break free
hands round my throats
tighten the grip
bound by my sins
so my wings have been clipped
i'm paying the price
i'm doing the time
serving my sentence for doing the crime
so show me the heavens or drag me to hell
this story is over
i'll bid you farewell
i'll bid you farewell
now drag me to hell</field>

too many issues on my mind
this is straight from the heart
you need to take a look inside
you wanna push me away
you wanna sacrifice what we made
i will not beg you to stay
and it hurts me to say,]
you're not right
you're dead inside!
living your life on the edge of a knife
living your life on the edge of a knife
you don't know you're alive. why don't you try and make things right?
'cause if you want to survive
you'll have to take a look inside. poison - it runs through your veins
you wanna sacrifice what we made
hatred is all that remains
and it hurts me to say
hey! you're dead inside!
you never knew you were fucking alive
hey! you're dead inside!
you're too weak
you will never survive
poison - it runs through your veins
you wanna sacrifice what we made
hatred is all that remains
and it hurts me to say,</field>

you still couldn't recognise
that your problem lies within
in a vicious circle
can you tell me why
why you've thrown it all away
cos it makes no sense to me
why you wouldn't listen
i know it hurts
i tried to help to ease your pain
i know these words
they won't mean anything
i hope it hurts
you've only got yourself to blame
and i can't take this anymore
i'm over it
so over it
watching you decline
what were you expecting
i can't save you from yourself
when you don't want saving
it's on your head
don't point the finger point the blame
cos the warning signs were clear
you just wouldn't listen
i know it hurts
i tried to help to ease your pain
i know these words
they won't mean anything
i hope it hurts
you've only got yourself to blame
and i can't take this anymore
i'm over it
so over it
breathe in
breathe out
i feel it coming round again
breathe in
breathe out
don't wanna ride your carousel
breathe in
breathe out
don't know how much more i can take
breathe in
breathe out
just stop cos i'm about to break
i know it hurts
i tried to help to ease your pain
i know these words
they won't mean anything
i hope it hurts
you've only got yourself to blame
and i can't take this anymore
i know it hurts
i tried to help to ease your pain
i know these words

you've only got yourself to blame

you had to try and make a fool of me and leave a bitter taste
i tried to compromise with open arms but we're disconnected

if this is it then don't resuscitate

you think i'm hurting but i'm not that weak
i guarantee i won't be losing sleep

when there's nothing else
left to destroy
it's a useless ploy
your eyes will see
the dawn of the day
and the writing
on the wall
those words that stare
into your soul
and to yourself
you will befall
it's domination pushed into living hell
domination a now blacked heart
is reaching out divinity
body suspended by chains over razors
and nails it's a penalty
each razor a vice and each nail
marks the demise of you life. grim construction grows
has life played a trick
sealed you in brick by brick
till your end forcing you to bend
your eyes will see
the dawn of the day
and the writing
on the wall
those words that stare
into your soul
and to yourself
you will befall
it's domination pushed into living hell
domination a now blacked heart
is reaching out divinity
body suspended by chains over razors
and nails it's a penalty
each razor a vice and each nail
marks the demise of you life. grim construction grows
has life played a trick
sealed you in brick by brick
till your end forcing you to bend</field>

need some time for recollection

you always took it and broke it over me
you say that i didn't care
how could my dream turn to despair?
turn to despair
there is temporary redemption
your demise is my creation
let me talk into the next one
talking symbols
we need some hope and recollection
maybe then there'll be less tension
take the one and burn the clothes off
proceed with caution
i pull my heart from the end
you always took it and broke it over me
you say that i didn't care
how could my dream turn to despair?
push it
go
time to release the crease in the beast
the blood shed and killing when will it cease
clenching our fist at the snap of our wrist
time to get up and get down with the shh
too much sorrow
no tomorrow
too much sorrow
no tomorrow
too much sorrow
no tomorrow
too much sorrow
no tomorrow
turn to despair

a colour fade out
looks like
a new transition
it's starting up
and shaking your ground
turning your head to see a day calling
does it feel like a head to lean on?
a snapshot from where you were born
i'm looking for your hand in the rough
you're caught in the wire
well i'll lift you up
leading on the action
caught on a cell phone's rays
bleeding on the sofa
staring at the wayside
he's coming and she knows it
even if she knows why
footsteps in the hallway
girl
you haven't got time
you gotta get out
far far away
you gotta get out
come away
darkness in the bedroom
maybe she's resting up
maybe she was out late
just came back from the club
i can't hear her breathing
something doesn't seem right
healer in the hallway
we're leaving on a set time
we gotta get out
come far away
we gotta get out
go far away</field>

tell you I need you

I set you apart
Tell me your secrets
and ask me your questions
Oh let's go back
to the start
Running in circles
coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said
it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start
I was just guessing
at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science
science and progress
Do not speak as loud
as my heart
So tell me you love me
come back and haunt me
Oh, when I rush to the start
Running in circles
chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy.
No one ever said
it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start.

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
"Now the old king is dead!
Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain

When you love someone but it goes to waste

Lights will guide you home

When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms
'Cause you get lighter
The more it gets dark
I'm going to give you my heart
And I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you
'Cause you're a sky
You're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
It such a heavenly view</field>

Symphony
(So high, so high)
That we shoot across the sky
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
And said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Soaring on symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
I-Oh-I-Oh
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

(Woo-oo-oo-woo)
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Soaring on symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
I-Oh-I-Oh
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

You are, you are
Confusion that never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know
Singing
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I
A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease?
Singing
You are, you are
You are, you are
And nothing else compares
Oh! no, nothing else compares

Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
When you get a head
A head full of dreams
Into life I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams!

A goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled
In perfect purple
So how come things move on
How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go?
But when I'm cold, cold
oh when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me an everglow
Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
And we swore on that night we'd
Be friends till we die
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you I know
But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
I know you're always with me
and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow
What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah I live for this feeling, this everglow
So if you love someone
You should let them know
The light that you give me will everglow</field>

Searching for the water hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick on your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, it's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up it's saying
We're gonna get it get it together right now
Gonna to get it get it together somehow
Gonna to get it get it together and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're gonna get it get it together I know
Gonna to get it get it together and flow
Gonna to get it get it together and go
Up and up and up
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
I can see the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love just need love
When the going is rough saying
We're gonna get it get it together right now
Gonna to get it get it together somehow
Gonna to get it get it together and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're gonna get it get it together I know
Gonna to get it get it together and flow
Gonna to get it get it together and go
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift
We're gonna get it get it together right now

And get to keep on dancing all life long
My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong
Now you could run and just say they're right
No I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait they're wrong

Someone special
You've got bright in your brains
And lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see
Someone special
You've got fire in your eyes
And when you realize you'll go further
Than we've ever gone
Just turn it on
I pay my intuition
I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient
It felt I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k
But I'm trying to turn K's to M's, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby
Like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself
But honestly, it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent until we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it
Feel my heart racing
Success I taste it
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve
Yeah you could be
Someone special
You've got fire in your eyes
I see heaven inside
You'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see
Someone special
You've got bright in your brains
You can break through those chains
You'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on
In you I see
Someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on
And you can't go wrong</field>

When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls

Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up
All that noise and
all that sound

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
A sign that I couldn't read
Or the light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ah when you see it, then you'll understand
All those signs I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent
And birds go flying at the speed of sound

Until monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart
As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still i'll raise the flag

Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up will it be alright
Feels like there's something broken inside
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
Got a tattoo and the pain's alright
Just want a way of keeping you inside
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colours and I'm dying of thirst
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts</field>

Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love
And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following them up
Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I could fly with you
Fly on</field>

are monkeys in cages
that don't have a number
to fight one another
Try to recover
Climb up the ladder
look up and you see birds
blind as each other
how long can we suffer?
We're as blind as each other
On the cloud that you're sitting
there's one born every minute
so much to discover
I've become a believer
Sisters and brothers
who fight one another
will mourn and deceive us
will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us
How soon is now? yeah
how long is never?
I'm nothing but normal
with something together
Come on and stick together
On the cloud that you're sitting
there's one born every minute
so much to discover

Get's colder day by day, I miss her

Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle
And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Get's colder day by day, I miss you
I hear people singin'

Saying it's true
It's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
When you get a head
A head full of dreams
Into life I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams!
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When got me open handed
When you got me lost for words
I sing ooh

Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History has some to know
We were moving at the speed of flight
Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight
Just an alien
We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says
Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line
Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again
Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E
T
's are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
For a lifetime
Just an alien
Moving target
Target movement
A patch, a corner
Of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again</field>

I'm going to put it six feet underground
He said I'm going to buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls
Oh I'm going to buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm going to buy this place and see it burn
Do back the things it did to you in return
Ah, ah, ah
He said Oh I'm going to buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh and I'm going to buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
And honey
All the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on
He said I'm going to buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside my baby watch the orange glow
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why
So I'm going to buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm going to buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
And honey
All the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on, as you mean to go on
So meet me by the bridge, meet me by the lane
When am I going to see that pretty face again
Meet me on the road, meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head</field>

Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless
Living this way I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies

I haven't slept
I think I do, but
I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try
My heart stays still
It never moves
Just won't be left
And so my mouth waters to be fed
And you're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
Always in my, always in my head
This I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen out from the rest</field>

Named every star
Shared every bruise and
Showed every scar
Hope has its proof
Your hand in mine, singing
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"
And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and its weight"
Here I just wanna stay
Amazing day
Amazing day
We sat on a roof
Named every star and
You showed me a place
Where you can be who you are
And the view
The whole Milky Way
In your eyes
I drifted away
And in your arms
I just wanna sway
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
And I asked "Can the birds
In poetry chime?"
"Can there be breaks
In the chaos sometimes?"
Oh, thanks God
Must've heard when I prayed
Because now I always
Want to feel this way
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day</field>

If I, if I'd only waited

Come here, oh my star is fading

And I swear, I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole
But time is on your side, it's on your side, now
Not pushing you down, and all around
It's no cause for concern
Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath
And time is on your side, it's on your side, now
Not pushing you down, and all around
No it's no cause for concern
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose
Oh, you came along and she cut me loose
Oh, you came along and you cut me loose
Oh, you came along and you cut me loose</field>

In you go, into some crowded room
And animals that climb
And they're climbing over you until you see
Off you go, off you go
Animal I am
And I'm looking for an answer just like you
But I should know which way to turn
An animal that runs
And I ran away from you
Because I'm scared
Now off you go, off you go
If you're gonna go, go now
But if you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
So if you're gonna go, go now
Animal you are
Disposable, defenseless,
Yes and
Watch your mouth,
Boys, watch your mouth
An animal that runs
And I made all my excuses to you
And I missed my chance
By a stone's throw
If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
But if you're gonna go, go now
Now crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal
I crumble

Crumble and fall like an animal
Yes I crumble

Gonna' be someone ----x2
This is a story of them against us, win or lose
Forcin your feet into someone elses shoes
Everybody gots something to say
That we outta live that way what we doin's not okay
In this world everybodys got a chip on
Both sides of the neck got no respect
Wait up a sec
Ou ever feel like the pressurs to much to take
To much weigh
Ladies and gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now please shout back
We not the only ones feeling so trapped in a dream of somebody else
In fact, they got there head full of some overblown scheme
Oportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they wanna do is push you to be that
And all you wanna do is scream back
Gonna' be somebody
For anybody tellin me I cant
Gonna' be someone
For anyone who told me I had no chance
Gonna' be somebody
Im tellin' you the time has come like that
Gonna' be someone
And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done
We dont sleep to dream, we sleep to build stamina
Energy to do our thing, get your camera
Cuz this ride is about to begin
Sit down and buckle it in
Let me say it again
In this world everybodys got a chip on
Both sides of the neck got no respect
Wait up a sec
When I was young they said the odds of making it were slim to none
Ladies and fuck it
I'm tired of them sayin the dream you have doesn't exist
Tellin' you your worthless sayin' you should quit
Basically telling you that you'll never be shit
Really there pissed cuz they'll never achieve some opportunity
They missed back when they were sixteen
And all they wanna do is push you to be that
And all you wanna do is scream back
Did god think you're crazy mumbling to yourself in the basement all day
AA in to yourself
My pops didn't diggin' with shovelin it to myself
My boys use to get it they dugg it because they felt
My undertakin took me I was making in my stealth a wealth of rhymes of
Crazy I would talkin' to myself
Then they went into the mental rolodex see I'm bout heart like my brain in my chest
And I took em into school where subjects were getting felt
Books under my seat notebook layin on my desk
My teachers like mr
jacko yes with all that knowledge you ain't tryin to go college
Be a lawyer or a doctor get a whole lot of dollas
Rather degrade woman and glorify violence
Well work that works for me might not work for you
No homework I got work to do
Gonna' be somebody
For anybody tellin me I cant
Gonna' be someone
For anyone who told me I had no chance
Gonna' be somebody
Im tellin' you the time has come like that
Gonna' be someone
And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done</field>

I said I don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean,
as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
of being the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do
'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice,
And remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice)
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do
'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one

Studying the lights
The dreaming of escaping
Will keep you up at night
But someone had put the flares up
And got me in rays
So I guess I better stay
"uh uh, no come on! " you say
It's a fool's gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start 'what if
I won't see you again'
Around here you never want to sleep all night
So start falling in love, start the riot and
Come on rage with me
We don't need words
And we'll be birds
Got to make our own key
Only got this moment
you and me
Guilty of nothing
But geography
Come on and raise it
Come on raise this noise
For the million people
Who got no one voice
Come on, it's not over!
If you mean it say loud
Come on all for love
Out from the underground
Away with me
We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds
Flying free
Holding on in the mystery
Fearless together you said
"we'll go Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
through this together"
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
When you fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel

Well being just there with the gypsy talking to my friend
But you’ll never get with it if you don’t get respect
Oh well you’ll never get with it if you just want respect
But sometimes the money’s gonna run out
And you’ll be standing on the corner with a belly full of doubt
Sometimes somebodys gonna bring you down
And you’ll be standing on your own with a bucket for a crown
Well me and the boys were standing thinking we were hip
I don’t wanna be the captain of a sinking ship
Well me and the boys in a town where the Mormon go
Listening to a session by Noel Gallagher
I was listening to a session by Noel Gallagher
They said sometimes your money’s gonna run out
And you’ll be standing on a corner with a belly full of doubt
Oh someday somebody’s gonna bring you down
And you’ll be standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown
Oh you’ll be standing on a corner

We go wandering 'neath the arches
Where the witches are and they say
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean
Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay
God is in the houses
And God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden
But I don't know what he said
For my heart it wasn't open
Not open

So we'll soar

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me
In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing
We'll be glowing
We'll be glowing
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot,
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark
In the dark</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Christmas night, another fight
Tears we've cried, a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford street
Trying to right a wrong
"Just walk away" those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
A group of candles on there flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
And I'm up here holding on to all those chandeleers of hope
And like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you, darling
And I always will
But when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Ohh Christmas lights keep shining on
OOhh
Oh Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on</field>

Every morning a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture
still, treat each guest honorably
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight
The dark thought, the shame, the malice
meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whatever comes
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond</field>

You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop before you begin
Never give in
Never give in
Ohhh, Ohhh

Nothing matters

And in full flight
Defeat darkness
Breaking daylight

I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain
So they sent the doctor, for examining my brain
Said he's not too clear
Oh when the world,
when the world just seems, a little bit too cruel
Gonna leave it better
Make one better
So tell that princess
Tell that princess right down the train
Tell that princess

Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball
And a slowly burning tide
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck I heard her call
And she said
When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still you never hit the mark
Even in your rain and shadows
Still we're never going to part

Like a lion you ran
A goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled
In perfect purple
So how come things move on
How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go?
But when I'm cold, cold
oh when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me an everglow
Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
And we swore on that night we'd
Be friends till we die
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you I know
But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
I know you're always with me
and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow
What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah I live for this feeling, this everglow
So if you love someone
You should let them know
The light that you give me will everglow</field>

As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sweep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of sand, pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in.
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield

Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Now we're stopping the world,
stopping it's spin
but come on don't give up don't say we give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh, didn't we have fun?
I know it's over
Before she says
'Know someone else has taken your place'
'I know it's over'
Icarus says to the sun
The Sword sinks in
Lightning strikes
You're two forces, two forces collide
And fight til it's over
Fight til it's done
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Now we're stopping the world
Stopping it in its tracks but
Nothing's too broken to find our way back
So before it's over
Before you run
Didn't we have fun?
Just you and me
Cause you and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be
We were always meant to always meant to
You and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be
But then
Maybe we could again</field>

Georgia, Georgia
A song for you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Georgia, oh Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind, on my mind, on my mind
I've got Georgia on my mind</field>

Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you try to hold
Try to hold me near
Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptier than anybody knows
Maybe I'm on the ropes
Or I'm not even here?
Yeaah
Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point in trying to raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear
Oh, maybe I'm a ghost
A spectre on a rollercoaster
A thorn without a rose
Something people fear
Yeaah
And every time I find I'm off the walls
It's all becoming clear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point in saying 'Rescue me! '
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
And every time I find I'm off the walls
It's all becoming clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear</field>

He heard you could see your future

The ripples and the rhymes
And he asked, will I see heaven in mine?
That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh, they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?
Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-I
Son
Don't ask
Neither how full or empty
Is your glass
Cling
To the mast
Spend your whole life living
In the past
Going nowhere fast
So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And we chimed, stars in heaven align
Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-I
Son
Don't ask
Neither how full or empty
Is your glass
Cling
To the mast
Spend your whole life living

Going nowhere fast
And what I'll be drinking when we're done?

Though our troubles seem like mountains
There's gold in them hills

So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start
Every now and then life says
Where do you think you're going so fast
We're apt to think it cruel but sometimes
It's a case of cruel to be kind
And if we'd get up off our knees
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees
And we'd see the new sun rising
Over the hills on the horizon
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose faith
Give the world a chance to say...
A word or two, my friend
There's no telling how the day might end
And we'll never know until we see
That there's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills

Coming home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Coz I'm coming home again
Coming Home again
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I love most she had so much soul
She said excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me be
But uh my name is Wendy (windy) and yo, I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tore em off
And make them straighten up they hat coz she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers coz they always leave
She said it feel like you walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on tv and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye, keep makin that platinum and gold for me
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Coz I'm coming home again
Coming Home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Oohh
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
Every interview I'm representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now I'm talkin about Chi-town
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Coz I'm coming home again
Coming Home again
Baby do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oohh
Now I'm coming home again
Coming home again
Baby do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oohh
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

            <field name="lyrics">Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
'Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?'
It's so cold it's so cold
It's so cold it's so cold
Written up in marker on a factory sign
'I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine'
It's so cold it's so cold
It's so cold it's so cold
See the arrow they shot, trying to tear us apart
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go
Of you- ooh ooh
Cos you do
You use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven
On every street every car every surface a name
Tonight the streets are ours
And we're writing and saying
Don't let em take control
No we won't let em take control
Yes I feel a little bit nervous
Yes I feel nervous and I cannot relax
How come they're out to get us
How come they're out when they don't know the facts
So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas I'll go making my mark
Armed with a spraycan soul
I'll be armed with a spraycan soul
And you ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
Cos you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh
Yeah it's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
Then it hurts like heaven
And it hurts like heaven
Oh oh oh-oh
And it hurts like heaven
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh</field>

You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
And said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Soaring on symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

Got me feeling drunk and high

They just see it from different views
And threading the needle
Fixing my flame

My head is bloody, but I'm bound
Beyond this place of rough and tears
Who's fought the horrors of the shade
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid
It matters not how straight the gate
How charged with punishment's the scroll
I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul
I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul

And when I heard you call to
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach to
Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do
I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you
I'm gonna come on in
My eyes are closed
I can feel it there
The sun's so close
I'm gonna come on out
And burn the sky
A star arose in my own cage
I'm stuck in line
And in a cage
Just a single star
I sing for
Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do
I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
And I did not know what to do

Just want a way of keeping you inside

How your garden grows
I just want to fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks it to the bone
Maybe I just want to fly
I want to live I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breath
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever
Maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows
I just want to fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks it to the bone
Maybe I will never be
All the things that I want to be
But now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever</field>

For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I past by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
On the day we met, oh I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I paid a cost, on the lost highway
Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway</field>

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come

Aha, I gotcha, uh
With the same sword they knight you
They gon' good night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus, see success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified
Media meddles, niggaz sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you're ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you have to be Bobby now
And the question is
"Is to have had and lost, better than not having at all? "
Because I'm

Lift me up

Locust wind

How I wish I'd spoken up

Reign of love by the church we're waiting
Reign of love on my knees go praying
How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried on a reign of love</field>

No colour or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall could fall on me
The parting of the sea
But you mean more mean more to me
Than any colour I can see
All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
But nothing is as down or as up as us
You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try
All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
Don't you wanna see it come soon?
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given on your own silver spoon
Don't you want to see it come down?
There for throwing your arms around
And say, "You're not a moment too soon"
'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Yeah I feel low
Oh no
Oh
'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Yeah I feel low
Oh no

Just look how good Cassius become
Mohammed, Mahatma and Nelson
Not scared to be strong
Now you could run and just say they're right
No, I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait they're wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long
My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong
Now you could run and just say they're right
No I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait they're wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long
Yeah you could be
Someone special
You've got bright in your brains
And lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see
Someone special
You've got fire in your eyes
And when you realize you'll go further
Than we've ever gone
Just turn it on
I pay my intuition
I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient
It felt I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k
But I'm trying to turn K's to M's, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby
Like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself
But honestly, it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent until we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it
Feel my heart racing
Success I taste it
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve
Yeah you could be
Someone special
You've got fire in your eyes
I see heaven inside
You'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see
Someone special
You've got bright in your brains
You can break through those chains
You'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on
In you I see
Someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on
And you can't go wrong</field>

Who knows when we'll be coming home at last
And I heard it on the radio that
One day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a tv show that
Somewhere up above and in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to mars
Past the satellites and stars, maybe moving us to mars
We won't see the earth again
And these seconds just remain unchanged
8 To 9, 9 to 10
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again, you and me
We are meeting for the first time
Can't you see: 7, 6, 5, 4, 3
We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to mars
Past the satellites and stars
Maybe moving us to mars</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
And I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me,
But I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.
Sometimes I feel that the chance is surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,
So I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.
So what? I feel fine,
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,
So I'll do, I'll try to stop moving,
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
And I've got to get going so much that I wanted to do,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.
And this could be my last chance,
This may be my only chance,
Yeah this could be my last chance,
No more keeping my feet on the ground.
Sometimes I feel that the chance is surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,
And I move,
And I wake up,
Smiling.
So what? I feel fine,
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,
So I'll do, well it's time to stop moving.
And this could be my last chance,
This may be my only chance,
Yeah this could be my last chance,
No more keeping my feet on the ground.
There's nothing to keep me,
Nothing to keep me.</field>

Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love
And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following them up
Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I could fly with you
Fly on</field>

You say to me it's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only your other things that you feel
And the things from which you can't escape
Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others, oh no

There we stand about to fly
Peeking down over land
Parachute behind
What was that moment for which we live?
Without a parachute about to dive
I find myself convincing
Blindly falling faster
How easy
Know the place I'm leaving
And the rest just is gone
Oh the adoration
But how much strength does it take
For exploration
For split decision
Or are you stronger to remain
I find myself convincing
Blindly falling faster
How easy
Know the place I'm leaving
And the rest is just gone
It crept up on me
Ignored all my pleas
Begging to leave
No justice to name me
Fell out of the sky
Cease it to be
Without a reply
Gravity fails me
And when I awoke
I knew what was real
Hope to convince you
Lies they all torture me
Opened the door
Knew what was me
I finally realized
Parachute over me</field>

The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night
The stormy night
She closed her eyes

Time just floated away
We can watch it and stay
And we can listen
Oh rainy day come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
And oh but I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
Then there was rain
I spent the night with the queen of Spain
My lonely little heart well it broke again
Time so vicious
The deeper that the knife goes in
The more you win
You end up with less than where you begin
The deeper that the knife goes in
Oh rainy day come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
We're separated now
And oh but I love it when you come over to the house

And the flames went hgher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh but the fire was wild
I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire</field>

I'll see you soon,
In a telescope lens,
And when all you want is friends,
I'll see you soon.
So they came for you,
They came snapping at your heels,
They come snapping at your heels,

            <field name="lyrics">Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending
and all good things, they say, never last
Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last
I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last
All good things that say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past</field>

How long before you decide?

If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb?
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up
All that noise and
all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
A sign that I couldn't read
Or the light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ah when you see it, then you'll understand
All those signs I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ah when you see it, then you'll understand</field>

From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back
The first line on the first page
To the end of the last page

It doesn't matter who you are
Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
And if you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance'll ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one</field>

Cold, cold water what you say?
When it's such, it's such a perfect day
Such a perfect day

I can't wait until the morning
Wouldn't want to change a thing

Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away?

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Life goes on
It gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
I know the sun's set to rise
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel

Where I was going wrong

I can only blame myself
You can only blame me
And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea
You put me on a line and hung me out to dry
And darling, that's when I decide to go to see
You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
And made me realize
What I could not see
And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook the world
And then it took,
Took it back from me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea
And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
The streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Oh what good is it to live with nothing left to give
Forget, but not forgive
Not loving all you see
All the streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
You belong with me,
Not swallowed in the sea
You belong with me

The sun sets in your eyes
I'm in love again
Come on once or twice
Wanna be your air?
Come on now, all I see
Wanna ride along
Follow all our dreams
Kaleidoscopes that fall into the sun
Gonna lay the blame on me, not anyone
Gonna write a song
Sing it to the sun
Don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone
Oh, sweet Marianne
You're the only one I've ever loved
And I swear it on
Swear it on the moon and stars above
I wanna understand
And I wanna be your love
I wanna be your man
Swear it on the moon and stars
I will full moon
Just a part of me
Gonna write a song and see how a woman feel
Come on get it on right into the sun
Gonna ride along and fly, gonna let it on
Oh, sweet Marianne
You're the only one I've ever loved
And I swear it on
Swear it on the moon and stars above
Oh, in my head
You're the only one I've ever loved
I wanna be your man
You're the only one I've ever loved
Oh, don't you love me?
Oh, don't you love me?
Don't you love me?
Oh, don't you love me?
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh, ah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I've been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don't know what to do
Oh brother I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh I wanna talk to you
You could take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung or do
Something that's never been done
Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle,
you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how do you feel
Well I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me
So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung or do
Something that's never been done, do
Something that's never been done
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored
And nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk

I'm marching through the cold
I went digging for gold
I went down with my brother
A bucket and a shovel
And a book about the colour of coal
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold
There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying: ''What use the metal if the metal don't shine?''
She said: ''Bring me back a diamong (ring)
'cause I really want one.''
Now I been digging so long that I never see the sun
I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley

Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out
And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh
And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
That was the hardest part, oh.
oh...
I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh, and I
Oh, and I
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about...
Everything I know is wrong
And everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

With your hormones bouncing up and down.
Sometimes you're happy sometimes you're sad
It'ss a weird nine months that you had have
There is shit going down that you can't disguise
When you boobs gone up ten times in size,
Your cups gone up from an A to D,
It's bad for you but it's fun for me.
Now just because a little rumpy pump,
Now you're walking round with a great big bump
You might think a bit of French and you should have said non
Or at least you would have made me put a condom on
I think you might find that it's really fun
I know it's no use unless you make it bun
It's something to learn yeah it really is,
Now you know what that sticky stuff is
I'll be there with you baby through the thin and the thick
I'm gonna clean up all the poo and the sick
I'll be there to make you happy and keep everything clean
I'll change the nappies through the washing machine
'Cause I ain't no baddy, I ain't no baddy,
I ain't no baddy, I am your baby's daddy.
Oh!
Who!
Sometimes you think "what a fool I am
Why did I marry this awful man?"
Now a baby's part of my family plan
Can it kick me well yes it can
My name's Ken and I've got fleas
Do you like being a daddy?
Yeah, definetly.
Well I have to warn you although its fun
There are times when you wish you had been a nun
I'll be there with you baby through the thin and the thick
I'm gonna clean up all the poo and the sick
I'll be there to make you happy and I'll bring in the bread
I'll be the nanny, you can go out instead
I know that you'll be grumpy, that's what everyone says
And you're not going to hump me for 43 days
If you don't want more babies and you cannot disguise it,
Then I'll take my cock and vasectimize it
'Cause I ain't no baddy, I ain't no baddy,
Sometimes I make you saddy
I ain't no baddy
I ain't no baddy I ain't no baddy I am your baby's daddy
(beat box)
Mother!
Mother!
I ain't no baddy I ain't no baddy
I ain't no baddy I am you're baby's daddy
Ho!
Break it down now,
She told me to crawl this way, bawl this way
She told me to crawl this way, bawl this way
She told me to crawl this way, bawl this way
She told me to crawl this way, bawl this way</field>

Oh let's go back
to the start
Running in circles
coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said
it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start
I was just guessing
at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science
science and progress
Do not speak as loud
as my heart
So tell me you love me
come back and haunt me
Oh, when I rush to the start
Running in circles
chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy.
No one ever said
it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start.

What is this feeling that I can't explain
And why am I never gonna sleep again
What is this thing I've never seen before
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Hide and sob, and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun
X is Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
365 Degrees
All of the surface and the underneath
Searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

Hide and sob, and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

Can't see the calm until the storm
Can't tell your right side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're riding on</field>

Start again I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away
The birds they sang, all a choir
Start again, a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey
The sky is blue
Dream of light til it's true
Then taking back the punch I threw
My arms turn wings
Oh, those clumsy things
Send me up to the wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds
Might have to go, where they don't know my name
Float all over the world just to see her again
And I won't, show or fear any pain
Even though all my armour might rust in the rain
A simple plot
But I know one day
Good things are coming our way
A simple plot
But I know one day
Good things are coming our way

            <field name="lyrics">Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick on your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, it's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up it's saying
We're gonna get it get it together right now
Gonna to get it get it together somehow
Gonna to get it get it together and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're gonna get it get it together I know
Gonna to get it get it together and flow
Gonna to get it get it together and go
Up and up and up
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
I can see the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love just need love
When the going is rough saying
We're gonna get it get it together right now
Gonna to get it get it together somehow
Gonna to get it get it together and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're gonna get it get it together I know
Gonna to get it get it together and flow
Gonna to get it get it together and go
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift
We're gonna get it get it together right now
Gonna to get it get it together somehow
Gonna to get it get it together and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're gonna get it get it together I know
Gonna to get it get it together and flow
Gonna to get it get it together and go
Up and up and up
We're gonna get it get it together right now
Gonna to get it get it together somehow
Gonna to get it get it together and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're gonna get it get it together I know
Gonna to get it get it together and flow
Gonna to get it get it together and go
Up and up
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain
When you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up</field>

Lift off this blindfold let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart she left a hole
The tightrope that I'm walking
Just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in
And sing
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Like a river to a raindrop I lost a friend
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go
And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
And lift off
Before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us
And see roses in the rain saying
Slow it down
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world</field>

From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low
If you love me, won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross held aloft
Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And if you love me, won't you let me know?
I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below.
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?
I took my love down to violet hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
Said if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know</field>

Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

"Now the old king is dead!
Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain

It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes
The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened
It's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes
Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?
And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes
Oh

Oh!

Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel your heartbeat next to mine

It's the way I'm feeling now

I lost the only thing I ever loved

Umbrellas in the clear blue sky
I saw you swimming in that sea of white
Ohhh
And wedding bells ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving, baby I stay still
I always loved you and I always will
Ohhh
I loved you and I see it still
I always loved you and I always will

Time that I take
See over in arms I'll raise
I'll race in to find you
I'll race in to find you
Time stands
I open your eyes to my world
I see you come out of it all
Unharmed and unscathed
And shouting, oh
Come on in
In houses I live in
And changes you're making
To the state of affairs
Calling, "Where is my boy? "
I have seen you so often
I cry, "Where is my boy? "
Oh, have you all forgotten?
And in some kind of dream
Have I seen you before
Oh, have I seen you before?
Oh, where is my boy?
So come all the way
Changing your number
Changing the house where you live
Change your lines
Have I seen you before?
In some kind of a dream?
In a place you've forgotten
A place I've forgotten
So where is my boy?
When I kneel in your arms
I flew awry
Where is my boy?
Have I seen you before?
In some kind of a dream?
Have I seen you before?
In some kind of a dream?
In my hands you'll fall
Open in as it seems
Have I seen you before?
Oh baby, your arms and your legs are shattered
Where is my boy?
Where is my boy?
I said, "Where is my boy? "
Have you seen me before?
When I look in your eyes
Tell me, "He had to go"
Said "I seen you before
In some kind of dream"
Seems I've seen you before
In some kind of a dream
I say, "Where is the boy? "
Have I seen you before?
Yeah, I saw you before
In some kind of a dream
I say, "Where was my head?
When I needed it most? "
Oh, I stayed here before
Yes, I stay in the place I know</field>

Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
As she stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild
When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face
On the second day I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free? "
On the second day he came with a single red rose
Said: "Will you give me your loss and your sorrow? "
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
He said, "If I show you the roses will you follow? "
On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
As I kissed her goodbye, I said, "All beauty must die"
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth</field>

Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it, you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state

See it breaking on your horizon

Put my hands up
To the sky, I'm gonna fly
Wherever you are
I'll find that treasure
So I reach for it
Wherever you are
I'll find that treasure
So I reach for it
Wherever you are
I'll find that treasure
So I reach for it
And I know, and I know, and I know
Know what I got
So I reach for it
X marks the spot
So put my hands up
To the sky, feeling life
I got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up
To the sky, feeling inside
Wherever you are
I'll find that treasure
Put my hands up
To the sky, feeling alright
I got a rocket
Eyes on the prize
Put my hands up
To the sky, I'm gonna fly
Wherever you are
I'll find that treasure</field>

I came along
I wrote a song for you

Oh what a thing to've done
And it was all yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know?
You know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know
For you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry
It's true, look how they shine for you

Now my back's on the line,
My back's on the ropes
When it started, we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in the daylight
There we were dying of frustration
Singing, "lord lead me not into temptation"
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone
If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only god knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
So, up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go
Dizzily screaming, "let the windows down"
As I crawl to the ground
If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only god knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness</field>

One life for yourself and one for your rest
You drift through the years and life seems strange,
Till one dream appears and love is its name.
And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone.
You only live twice or so it seems,
One life for yourself and one for your dreams
This dream is for you, so pay the price.
Make one dream come true, you only live twice.
And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone.
This dream is for you, so pay the price.
Make one dream come true, you only live twice.</field>

Took me away from sight and the place I know.
All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch i threw.
It was a strange reaction
for someone like you to remain on side
And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide.
I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know.
Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw.
It was a strange reaction
for someone like you to remain so sure
And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl</field>

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs
That voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
"Fools" said I, "you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
And the words that it was forming
And the sign said
"The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sound of silence</field>

I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you can rise again
So don't give up
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight
Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time?
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through
I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you will rise again
I won't give up
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight
Don't let it take your soul
Look at me, take control
When knowing to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for
Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight
I'll be your reason to fight
Give you a reason to fight</field>

You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss, will I run?
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on, with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing, another time
You'll never know how your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss, will I run?
Into the abyss, will I run?

(oh, shit)
O-WA-A-A-A(x2)
O-O(x3)
Drowning deep in my sea of loathing, Broken your servant I kneel
(will you give it to me?)
It seems what's left of my Human side is slowly changing in me
(will you give it to me?)
Looking at my own reflection, When suddenly it changes, Violently it changes
Oh, no
There is no turning back now, you've woken up the demon in me.
**Chorus**
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Open up your hate and let it flow into me.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You mamma get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You Fucka get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Maddness is the gift that has been given to me.
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising, don't try to deny what you feel.
(will you give it to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died and is decaying in me.
(will you give it to me?)
It seems you're having some trouble, in dealing with these changes, living with these changes.
Oh, no
The world is a scary place now that you've woken up the demon in me.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Open up your hate and let it flow into me.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You mamma get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You Fucka get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Maddness is the gift that has been given to me.
And when I dream,
And when I dream,
And when I dream,
AND WHEN I DREAM!
No mommy don't do it again, don't do it again, I'll be a good boy
I'll be a good boy, I promise
No mommy don't hit me, OW, why did you have to hit me like that mommy?
Don't do it you're hurting me O-HOW
Why do you have to be such a bitch.
Why don't you why don't you fuck off and die!
Why can't you just fuck off and die!
Why can't you just leave here and die!
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch.
FUCK YOU!!!
I don't need this shit!
You stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore.
Would you like to see how it feels mommy?
Here it comes get ready to DIE!
O-WA-A-A-A
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Open up your hate and let it flow into me.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You mamma get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You Fucka get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Maddness has now come over me!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
You turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard their call as you walked away
A voice of calm but within the silence
And though it seemed an eternity
You waited, hoping it would call out again
With the shadow beckoning
Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for a reckoning
From when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid, don't turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind, then
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
Sickening, weakening
Don't let another zombie pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes a bit of dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
Don't ignore
Listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light</field>

The powers have called me away
Another time
To carry the colors again
My motivation
An oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor
Of coming back home again
No explanation
Will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation
And now my unfortunate friend
You will discover
A war you're unable to win
I'll have you know
That I've become
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side
A terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war
Another reason
Another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered
Now, for me to light
My dedication
To all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders
With not a regret
My declaration
Embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder
Of how it began
No hesitation
When I am commanding to strike
You need to know
That you're in for the fight of your life
You will be shown
How I've become
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible

Well, are you ready now
For the revolution
For too long your power has been taken away
It's been taken away
Does your heart feel heavy now
Savor the solution
Take those mental shackles off and throw them away
You've got to get them out of your mind
Don't you let their vision leave you blind
Moving steady now
It's a revelation
For so long your focus has been taken away
Now you're breaking away
They may think they know you, but
Here's an education
No, they can't control you
Once you've broken away
They're done patrolling your mind
When they're searching for you, they will find
A force they aren't ready for
They aren't ready for you to be strong
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon
That's enough already now
You don't want to take it
All your reservations have been taken away
They've been taken away
So you think you're ready now
For the revolution
Yeah, they can't control you
Once you've broken away
You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you they will find
A force they aren't ready for
They aren't ready for you to be strong
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
They aren't ready for you to turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon
(Are you ready)
When they stand before us they will find
A cause they aren't ready for
They aren't ready for you us to be strong
They aren't ready for you us to prove them wrong
They aren't ready for you
Let me know you're ready to be turned
into someone people who cannot be preyed upon
We cannot be preyed upon

Feel the energy build in your soul 'cause it's time
Oh, in the calm before the storm

Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die

Raw emotion, pure devotion
They will testify
And our memory will endure for all time
Never hiding, no dividing

Show no mercy, let the world see
We're invincible
Show them nothing is beyond our control

See the fear bleeding right through their eyes

Secure a legacy that will never die

Feel it, take no prisoners now
Take it, there it is standing in front of us
Hear it, our deliverance now
Own it, give 'em an image of us that will
Last for all time

What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away
To fall upon the night
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, begging the question
Why
For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
On a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing
[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night
This self discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away
To feast upon the night
The source of my Felicity
Dark maiden taking hold of my hand
Lead me away from hibernation
Strong and unafraid
Never a question why
For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
I'm about to take it away
There can be no better way of knowing

No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile
With every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away completely
I tried hide from the unholy sound of it
Another day gone, another night's dawn
Dark forces pull me underground
They never went away completely
How can I feel this empty?
I will not recover this time
This loneliness is killing me
Will I ever know peace of mind again?
I don't believe it, I can't achieve it
I think it all is just another sign
It never went away completely
Terror is coursing in me
(Terror inside of me - keeps a diligent watch on eveything...)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a feeble hold of my belief - just waiting for a moment when I...)
And feel you die
In asylum, I live a lie
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For asylum, relive a lie
To let go
Now it's dragging me into your grave
Your asylum, forget the lie
Overcome by the feeling that
I won't get to join you in time
And the loneliness is killing me
Death's images are all around again
They're right behind me
They're gonna find me
Judgment from the immortal sin
That had enveloped me completely
I know I'll never know a peaceful night again
Afraid they'll hear me, they don't fear me
Punishment from the immoral crime
The debt was never paid completely
Terror is coursing in me
(Terror inside of me - keeps a diligent watch on eveything...)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a feeble hold of my belief - just waiting for a moment when I...)
And feel you die
In asylum, I live a lie
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For asylum, relive a lie
To let go
Now it's dragging me into your grave
Your asylum, forget the lie
Overcome by the feeling that
I won't get to join you in time
And the loneliness is killing me
In the end there will be no suffering (more suffering)
In the end you will find out everything (not anything)
In the end you may question your belief (what belief?)
In the end you will realize finally how you were deceived
This has gone on too long, no more demonic dreams
Destroyer come tonight because the memory is killing me
In asylum, I live a lie
I let go now it's dragging me into your grave
For asylum, relive the lie
Overcome by the feeling that
I won't get to join you in time (not a chance)
This world is not fulfilling me
Don't need to live an asylum, I live a lie
Don't want to live an asylum, I live a lie
Don't need to live an asylum, I live a lie</field>

Death approaches on this night

We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight
I can feel the calling again
The primal need is filling me
Changes are about to begin
And now my blood is boiling
I can see the fear in your eyes
But you can't bring yourself to scream
Time to shed the mortal disguise
For the beast is coming to life
Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night

We will be completed right before your eyes

And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight
We begin the hunt tonight
Til the power courses the creatures take flight
When the kill is close and I will be satisfied
For the smell of fear tonight
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied
You're mine
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight
For the animal's soul is mine
And the world around will never hear your cries
An unholy crime
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight.

The time will come when all of us say goodbye
Feel that aching in your heart
Leaving you broken inside
But we're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind
So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can
Take the ones you love
And hold them close because there is little time
And don't let it break your heart
I know it feels hopeless sometimes
But they're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind
So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment
To keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered
Cannot survive
So now go do the best things in life
Bring the fight to this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Shine your light on this world while you can
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment
To keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered
Cannot survive
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment
To keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered
Cannot survive</field>

So, are you breathing (now, now)
Are you breathing
So, are you breathing..
Now!
Wake up, are you alive, will you listen to me
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die (Say!)
Wake up, are you alive, will you listen to me
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die (Say!)
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing, you're making me known
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing
So..
What's up I wonder why do you listen to me
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die (Say!)
What's up I wonder why do you listen to me
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die (Say!)
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing, you're making me known
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing
So!
Can't you imagine how good going through this will make you feel
I promise, no one will ever know
There will be no chance of you getting caught
They never loved you anyway, so come on
Be a man, and do what you are compelled to do
Save me god! *echo*
I can hear the voice, but I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright
I can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
And make everything alright!
I can hear the voice, but I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright
I can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
And make everything alright!
Are you breathing now, do the wicked see you
You still breathing you're making me known
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing
So, are you breathing
So, do you breath..
Now, now!
So, are you breathing
So, do you breath now!.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Another dream that will never come true
Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add on to your pain and suffering
Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you completely
All the cries you're beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening
Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away
Another nightmare about to come true
Will manifest tomorrow
Another love that I've taken from you
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering
Another taste of the evil I breed
Will level you completely
Bring to life everything that you fear
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening
Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away
Return to me x3
Turn to me
Leave me no one
Turn to me
Return to me x2
Turn to me
Cast aside
Return to me x3
Turn to me
Leave me no one
Return to me x3
You've made me turn away
Living just isnt hard enough
Burn me alive inside
Living my life's not hard enough
They take everything from you
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away.</field>

Turn it on again
Stare and try to find some meaning
Let the day begin
But you feel that urge in your mind
You stumble in, still holding in
You move like an electric zombie
Barely noticing as your life keeps passing you by
Oh, I still can remember a time when it wasn't like this
Before the world became enslaved
Can we all go back to the time when we were not like this
Can we even be saved?
In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time
So it's 3am
Turn it on again
You never seen the stuff completely
Keep checking in
On the friends that you've left behind
Always jumping in
Any argument
Seems everybody here knows everything
You know you'll never win but you're certainly losing your mind
Oh, I still can remember a time when it wasn't like this
Before the world became enslaved
Can we all go back to the time when we were not like this
Can we even be saved?
In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time
In another time will we still be blind?
Because there's so much more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again

God damn maybe I am a little terrified
You know I really don't know what to believe

There's nothing to fear

Now I can barely even stand the sight of you
We keep pretending there's nothing wrong
Playing parts in the tragic comedy
Soon we'll be singing a different song
When we both face our harsh reality
Yeah, we'll draw battle lines
Fortify our defenses once again
Yeah, we'll look for any sign
We'll meet each other's eyes once again
They all will hear our battle cry

It keeps repeating and it's making me realize
We're just not able to survive

And we won't make it out alive
I'm used to feeling you're stalking me
I lie awake for the next explosion
With every word always haunting me
I'm never able to let my guard down
I feel the tension begin to rise
I'm tired of living the sick déjà vu again
If we're able to compromise
There's no hope of me getting through again
Yeah, we'll draw battle lines
Fortify our defenses once again
Yeah, we'll scream the same old lines
We'll meet each other's eyes and that is when

They're moving into the street
Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
They're burning into the night
Too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in
Oh Superman where are you now
Everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, men of power
Are losing control by the hour
This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is the land of confusion

Oh when the sun shining
And all the stars were bright all through the night
And the wake up this madness as I held you tight
So long ago
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep
Too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in

As a little child,
she was taken

Devon lies beyond this portal
take the word of one immortal
Give your soul to me
For eternity
release your life

End your grief with me
there's another way
release your life
take your place inside the fire with her

Now and forever
you're just another lost soul about to be mine again
see her, you'll never free her
you must surrender it all
Would you like to meet again

As she begins to turn cold and run out of time
you will shiver
till you deliver
you will remember it all

Still see you everywhere
You're still in every room
Filled you with every move
I can't go on without erasing you from my heart
Tired of feeling this pain
Seems you're the only ghost
I just can't chase away
Ooh, you still inhabit every thought
I prayed that you'd be gone

What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?
Too many hours spent in darkness questioning
"How and why"?
I can't remember many moments in the light
This retribution has defiled me to no end
An execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why?
I was a boy who had to live his own way
I never fit into the model they had designed
I chose a path less taken
I stood with others who had often felt the same
We got stares from passersby
Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away
And when three young boys died
They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie!
No hope in sight
I sit here terrified! (Terrified!, Terrified!)
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? (Bring it to light!, Bring it to light!)
Won't anybody open up their eyes? (Open your eyes!, Open your eyes!)
Before the three of us have lost our lives!
Why was everybody so damn afraid?
They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime
And to justify their own faith
We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time
The three of us were attacked and disgraced
For many hours we were questioned and someone lied
One of us couldn't take it
His simple manner was manipulated in time
Fear made him lie
Now I sit here terrified! (Terrified!, Terrified!)
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? (Bring it to light!, Bring it to light!)
Won't anybody open up their eyes? (Open your eyes!, Open your eyes!)
Before the three of us have lost our lives!
Now I am terrified! (Terrified!, Terrified!, Terrified!)
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? (Bring it to light!, Bring it to light!)
Won't anybody open up their eyes? (Open your eyes!, Open your eyes!)
Before the three of us have lose our lives!
And why? (Tell me why!, Tell me why)
Can't anybody see through their disguise? (Through their disguise!, Through their disguise)
Believe we didn't take their lives! (Taken their lives!, Taken their lives!)
And now the three of us have lost our lives
I often wonder why I sit and wait to die
What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?
Too many hours spent in darkness questioning
"How and why"?
I can't remember many moments in the light
This retribution has defiled me to no end
And execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why?</field>

Reflecting the pain that has taken you
I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame
From what's ailing you
I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you can rise again
So don't give up
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight
Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time?
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through
I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you will rise again
I won't give up
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight
Don't let it take your soul
Look at me, take control
When knowing to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for
Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight
I'll be your reason to fight
Give you a reason to fight</field>

Rip away her disguise and you will realize

has cast a shadow on our world
Our devotion to our appetites
betrayed us all
An apocalyptic plight
More destruction will unfold
Mother Earth will show her darker side
and take her toll
It's just another way to die
There can be no other reason why
You know we should of seen it coming
Consequences we cannot deny will be
revealed in time
Glaciers melt as we pollute the sky
A sign of devastation coming
We don't need another way to die
Can we repent in time?
The time bomb is ticking
and no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?
Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die
Can we repent in time?
Greed and hunger led to our demise
A path I can't believe we followed
Black agenda's rooted in a lie
Will we repent in time?
Species fall before our very eyes
A world that they cannot survive in
left them with another way to die
Are we dead inside?
The time bomb is ticking
and no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?
Still, we ravage the world that we love

Well, are you ready now
For the revolution
For too long your power has been taken away
It's been taken away
Does your heart feel heavy now
Savor the solution
Take those mental shackles off and throw them away
You've got to get them out of your mind
Don't you let their vision leave you blind
Moving steady now
It's a revelation
For so long your focus has been taken away
Now you're breaking away
They may think they know you, but
Here's an education
No, they can't control you
Once you've broken away
They're done patrolling your mind
When they're searching for you, they will find
A force they aren't ready for
They aren't ready for you to be strong
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon
That's enough already now
You don't want to take it
All your reservations have been taken away
They've been taken away
So you think you're ready now
For the revolution
Yeah, they can't control you
Once you've broken away
You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you they will find
A force they aren't ready for
They aren't ready for you to be strong
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
They aren't ready for you to turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon
(Are you ready)
When they stand before us they will find
A cause they aren't ready for
They aren't ready for you us to be strong
They aren't ready for you us to prove them wrong
They aren't ready for you
Let me know you're ready to be turned
into someone people who cannot be preyed upon
We cannot be preyed upon

No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile
With every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away completely
I tried hide from the unholy sound of it
Another day gone, another night's dawn
Dark forces pull me underground
They never went away completely
How can I feel this empty?
I will not recover this time
This loneliness is killing me
Will I ever know peace of mind again?
I don't believe it, I can't achieve it
I think it all is just another sign
It never went away completely
Terror is coursing in me
(Terror inside of me - keeps a diligent watch on eveything...)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a feeble hold of my belief - just waiting for a moment when I...)
And feel you die
In asylum, I live a lie
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For asylum, relive a lie
To let go
Now it's dragging me into your grave
Your asylum, forget the lie
Overcome by the feeling that
I won't get to join you in time
And the loneliness is killing me
Death's images are all around again
They're right behind me
They're gonna find me
Judgment from the immortal sin
That had enveloped me completely
I know I'll never know a peaceful night again
Afraid they'll hear me, they don't fear me
Punishment from the immoral crime
The debt was never paid completely
Terror is coursing in me
(Terror inside of me - keeps a diligent watch on eveything...)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a feeble hold of my belief - just waiting for a moment when I...)
And feel you die
In asylum, I live a lie
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For asylum, relive a lie
To let go
Now it's dragging me into your grave
Your asylum, forget the lie
Overcome by the feeling that
I won't get to join you in time
And the loneliness is killing me
In the end there will be no suffering (more suffering)
In the end you will find out everything (not anything)
In the end you may question your belief (what belief?)
In the end you will realize finally how you were deceived
This has gone on too long, no more demonic dreams
Destroyer come tonight because the memory is killing me
In asylum, I live a lie
I let go now it's dragging me into your grave
For asylum, relive the lie
Overcome by the feeling that
I won't get to join you in time (not a chance)
This world is not fulfilling me
Don't need to live an asylum, I live a lie
Don't want to live an asylum, I live a lie
Don't need to live an asylum, I live a lie</field>

Boy you lost when you made me the enemy

My will - something I killed off
Givin' off a lid about you to another like me
Punk - you're gonna get yourself knocked out
Nightmares runnin' through my mind
Walk the path that warped my brain
Never left me quite the same
All the memories of my pain
Broken down inside remain
So empty inside me
So empty
Hey you, look into my face, can't you see my grin
Yeah, feel it just about kick it
My innocence feeding your arrogance
I guess you gave no thought to your madness
Who you tryin' to fool now
Who you tryin' to get the live in the insanity anew now
Animosity burrows into me
Waitin' for a minute then Im makin' you the enemy
Walk the path that warped my brain
Never left me quite the same
All the memories of my pain
Broken down inside remain
So empty inside me
So empty
Rage in my veins
I cannot remain
Thinking how you let me down
[someone help me]
Hold in my pain
I cannot remain
Why don't you just let me drown?
Ooh, what you gonna do now, what you gonna do when the rhythm comes kickin' you?
Kinda makin' me bleed into nightmares running through my mind
Breathe, like a disease, gotta get you off of me
Thoughts of you rotting me
Animosity burrows into me
Boy you lost when you made me the enemy!
[I'm left here, so empty, life's made me, so violent]
[I'm left here, so empty, life's made me, so violent]
Ooh, like I never knew, distrust that grew every single time that I think of you
Rape my mind to make me blind
You thought that I'd forget it boy
Hit you with the blindside
No stoppin' me watch me droppin' it
Off of me another nightmare rockin' it
Animosity burrows into me
Boy you lost now I made you the enemy
Walk the path that warped my brain
Never left me quite the same
All the memories of my pain
Broken down inside remain
So empty inside me

For I cannot let this go
It's the lie that I live
Everything that I give
Shut the fuck up!
Please tell me that I have grown
For I have bruises left to show
And I fall in between everything
Let me see
Come on get up
Let me see your bruises
'Cause I will never let you know
'Cause I will never let you go
Please leave me alone
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Come on get up
Let me see your bruises</field>

You know that help will come too late
How many more are there?
How many more can there be?
And you hear a freaky sound
And all the spooky scary scenes all around
And they are coming after you
But you don't know what to do
This can't be happening
Then you start to scream
Is this getting hairy?
Is it spooky scary?
Love me pretty
Love me pretty
Am I human?
And you feel you are insane
Because this can't be happening
What are you to believe?
Or are your eyes just deceiving?
Run but you can't hide
Carbomb come alive
And it's coming after you
But you don't know what to do
Am I am I am I?
Am I human?
And in the midst it ignites
What is said like dynamite
And all the pieces scatter
And that chilling laughter
And it seems like halloween
And all the spooky scary seen
Flying all around around around
Grab you
Turn you upside down
Am I human?
Could this be happening?</field>

(When the vision paints my mind)

REPEAT
HIT IT!
HA HA
HA HA
HA HA
Criminal, this suffering
It makes me think like a
Criminal, the suffering
When we're alone
Criminal, this suffering
It makes me feel like a
Criminal, the suffering
When we're alone
Typical, enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To bury my vision
The hunger coming over me
As I learn to hide the agony
To make a final remedy
To close the door, once and for all
In a world that I dont want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
(it seems the whole experience is)
Terrible and crippling
The pain is much more then
Physical beyond belief
When we're alone
Typical, enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To make this decision
Despair has fallen over me
No way to hide the agony
Embracing my calamity
To save myself once and for all
In a world that I dont want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfuckker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter now
Now that you wanna know
Now you wanna name
Now you wanna place
Now you wanna time
Now you want it all
Now that you wanna know
Now you wanna name
Now you wanna place
Now you wanna time
Now you want it all, now
In a world that I dont want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't say that it isn't so
I'm on a path that you'll never comprehend
Set me free from all of this
I need you to quicken my end</field>

I could bear to turn away,
Now that it's come to this,
Is there nothing left to say?
I've never known before,
Such exquisite suffering,
As I watched you walk away,
I gave into panicking,
I can't believe that,
This is really happening,
Am I really lost again?
Desperation drives me insane,
I will focus all the pain,
Right into your heart,
Till it makes you blind,
Till the faces of your former world,
Have fallen from your sight,
Till you're mine,
Until the voice of doubt no longer,
Dominates your mind,
I'm crucified,
Cold and unwhole again,
Crying out and questioning,
Will I ever love again?
What's the point of anything?
It takes a toll again,
This is where the fun begins,
Visions haunt me through the night,
Now I'm dying for your sins,
I can't believe that,
If you look me in the face,
You can say there's nothing left,
How the silence drives me insane,
I will focus all my pain,
Right into your heart,
Till it makes you blind,
Till the faces of your former world,
Have fallen from your sight,
Till you're mine,
Until the voice of doubt no longer,
Dominates your mind,
I'm crucified,
I cannot feel anything,
Anger I've been harboring,
You've nailed me to the cross,
Upon it will remain,
I can't feel anything,
Rage inside is festering,
You've nailed me to the cross,
Upon it will remain,
I will focus all my pain,
Right into your heart,
Till it makes you blind,
Till the faces of your former world,
Have fallen from your sight,
Till you're mine,
Until the voice of doubt no longer,
Dominates your mind,
I'm crucified,
Till it makes you blind,
Till the faces of your former world,
Have fallen from your sight,
Till you're mine,
Until the voice of doubt no longer,
Dominates your mind,
I'm crucified.

Now I just don't know

Another animal
Sent to devour what-

I don't know!
And it's all been a lie
And I'll never come to know why
A world to discover
You're leaving me now
It's all been a lie
I don't ever want to know why
You've mastered the art of
Deceiving me now.

A mortal enemy
Has been revealed to me
How come I wasn't able to see
Another vampire
Getting their fix from
sucking up my life (OW!)
An evil entity
Had taken hold of me
Ripped out my heart and started to feed
I still remember when
I thought that all you were
Eating was my pride
(Chorus)
I don't know!
And it's all been a lie
And I'll never come to know why
A world to discover
You're leaving me now
It's all been a lie

You've mastered the art of
Deceiving me now.

Hard and silent but softly breaking
No beloved to comfort me
Ooh, dead philosophy
If I offer you my soul
Will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one

Left behind
Feel the determination built into my mind
You're never gonna find me
I'll wipe the world away
Your face it will remind me
Just how much I have to leave

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing, Broken your servant I kneel
(will you give it to me?)
It seems what's left of my Human side is slowly changing in me
(will you give it to me?)
Looking at my own reflection, When suddenly it changes, Violently it changes
Oh, no
There is no turning back now, you've woken up the demon in me.

Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Open up your hate and let it flow into me.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You mamma get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You Fucka get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Maddness is the gift that has been given to me.
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising, don't try to deny what you feel.
(will you give it to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died and is decaying in me.
(will you give it to me?)
It seems you're having some trouble, in dealing with these changes, living with these changes.
Oh, no
The world is a scary place now that you've woken up the demon in me.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Open up your hate and let it flow into me.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You mamma get up, come on get down with the sickness!
You Fucka get up, come on get down with the sickness!
Maddness is the gift that has been given to me.
And when I dream,
And when I dream,
And when I dream,
AND WHEN I DREAM!
No mommy don't do it again, don't do it again, I'll be a good boy
I'll be a good boy, I promise
No mommy don't hit me, OW, why did you have to hit me like that mommy?
Don't do it you're hurting me O-HOW
Why do you have to be such a bitch.
Why don't you why don't you fuck off and die!
Why can't you just fuck off and die!
Why can't you just leave here and die!
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch.

Don't wanna give us a place, are you afraid?
Well, fear this, cause I'm a breaking through the walls of your nightmare
Wake up, time to die!

Better get ready for another surprise and it
May leave a mark because I'm a coming in fast

And now and then your just my friend someone I could talk to
And it's killing me, it's just killing me
And I, I feel so empty inside
'Cause I'm a freak in your eyes
I feel so empty inside
And it's killing me
I look outside and realize how much I'm different
You'll never see inside of me, inside just who I am
And now and then you're just my friend,
Someone I could talk to
And it's killing me, it's just killing me
And I, I feel so empty inside
'Cause I'm a freak in your eyes
I feel so empty inside
And it's killing me
I'm outside and looking in
I look into your eyes and see that you are perfect
Except for me, except for me
And I, I feel so empty inside
'Cause I'm a freak in your eyes
I feel so empty inside
I feel so
I feel so
I, I feel so empty inside
I feel so empty inside
I feel so empty inside
I feel so empty inside</field>

            <field name="lyrics">We don't want them, we want everything
And we've stolen in this suffering
And we've told them, to want everything
But use caution in what you believe
And the haunted, deny everything
Controlling in this suffering
They were broken
And lost everything
They're so much easier to lead
Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing left inside
When you're old and tired
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
Is bad enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
When every moment is bad enough
Without warning, we take everything
Undaunted in this suffering
And our forces, surround everything
Make it impossible to save
Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing left inside
When you're old and tired
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
It's bad enough
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
Then every moment is bad enough
Haven't they suffered enough now!?
Haven't we suffered enough now!?
Haven't they suffered enough!?
The damage more than they can bear!
Haven't they suffered enough now!?
Haven't we suffered enough now!?
Haven't they suffered enough!?
The damage more than I can bear!
Did they even have a reason why?
Countless sons and daughters left to die
Can you even comprehend the pain!?
Tell me
When you're old and tired
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
It's bad enough
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
Then every moment is bad enough</field>

Just was has become of her
Shattered doll, desperate
Oh so innocent
And delicate
But to damm obdurate
And obstinate to let go
Broken down
Hurt again
It never ends
Frightened and
Trembling
Did she fall again?
An accident?
Her eyes encircled in black again
I cant believe that she's still with him
(chorus)
For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
Your facade can't disguise
The fact that you're in misery.
Look inside
See what has become of her
Hiding within again
Can she pick herself up again?
It's just too difficult and arduous to let go
Homicide
Flashes through her mind again
No more pain take control
If he raises his hand again
She'll find the freedom in killing him
The world will see that she's had enough
(chorus)
For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
Your facade can't disguise
The fact that you're in misery.
For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
From the look in your eyes
I know you bleed internally

For how long you deny?
How long until you walk away?
Your facade can't disguise
The fact that you're in misery.

Broken down
Hurt again

Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things aren't what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he is gone</field>

Reject
Are you no one
Fear you nothing
You know I'll bet you think
You have a good reason to be living
In the limelight of the fortunate ones
You're too weakened by the poison
That they feed you in the living lie
They don't believe you
Call to no one
Trust in nothing
Little impotent one
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be innocent, you know
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to let them hypnotize me
Punk ass, are you listening
Can you hear me or are you deaf and dumb to my language
Do the real words seem to hurt you
Well put em' up motherfucker
Gonna feel it
When I stamp it on your forehead
So you will never forget
That you're a reject
And you're no one
And you're nothing
Little impotent one

And let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Your mind is racing
I don't understand why you don't like me
Why don't you like me?
Am I so diffrent from you
Now does it scare you that I'm able to discern
What to love and what to burn
I'll add your fuel to the fire now
Stand back, brother take your hand back
Leave it and I might crack
More than a smile or two you see
You don't judge what you don't understand
You can't deny what has been given to me
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be innocent, you know

Chorus: To be purified in fire
Anesthetic for the pain
as the final words erupt from your mouth
who will remember your name (repeat all)
walking a line that the world has drawn
fighting for balance alone in the dark
will you carry the burden the world has grown
will you destroy everything...in your sight
you alone can give this one more try
you alone will bury me tonight
To be purified in fire
Anesthetic for the pain
as the final words erupt from your mouth
who will remember you now
who will remember your name

I'm over it
You see I'm falling in the vast abyss
Clouded by memories of the past
At last, I see
I hear it fading
I can't speak it
or else you will dig my grave
We fear them finding
Always winding
Take my hand now
Be alive
You see I cannot be forsaken
Because I'm not the only one
We walk amongst you
Feeding, raping
Must we hide from everyone
I'm over it
Why can't we be together
Erase it
Sleeping so long
Taking off the mask
At last, I see
I hear it fading
I can't speak it
or else you will dig my grave
We fear them finding
Always winding
Take my hand now
Be alive
You see I cannot be forsaken
Because I'm not the only one
We walk amongst you
Feeding, raping
Must we hide from everyone
You see I cannot be forsaken
Because I'm not the only one
We walk amongst you
Feeding, raping
Must we hide from everyone
Everyone

I wanna get psycho,
Run you little bitch!
I want your power glowing, juicy flowing, red hot
Meaning of Life
It's not enough to have a little taste,
I want the whole damn thing
Now can you dig it.
Need to get Psycho,
Wanna hear you say it
Say you want it, Need it
Don't wanna wait until we finish the show
It's not enough, you hunger for more
You're one twisted little fuck
and now you wanna get psycho with me.

Give in, Give in, Decide.
Give in, Give in, Decide.
Give in.

Now can you dig it
Need to get psycho
Wanna hear you scream
Tell me to take you, scare you, fuck you.
After we finish the show
It's not enough, You listening Whore?
You're one twisted little fuck
And now you wanna get psycho with me.
**Chorus 2**
I can feel your blood,
Pumpin' through my veins,
Spillin' on my soul,
and now the hunger is getting bigger,
Come a little closer now, Pretentious Whore
and pull my trigger,
Free the violence that is building in me
I see no end of the ride, Murder, Suicide, is how I've beenfeeling lately.
Come a little closer now pretentious whore,
I'm reeling with the feeling that I can't ignore,
(repeat above x3)
and the need to get Psycho is not a question to me.

Another sacrifice

Turn away again

A land of darkness from which I cannot return

Dishonored by your world

I'm haunted by your world
(Never will I be welcomed
Amongst the heartless monsters you surround yourself with
Feeding off the pain and misfortune of others
A maniacal unit of sub-human parasites
Warped into a feeding frenzy with the smell of fresh blood
Open your eyes and see the creatures for what they are
A swirling mess of hatred and envy
Don't be naive enough to think you're unaffected
The conversion has already begun...)
You're frightened, so am I
A world of demons wait
Watching the movements and filling my heart with hate
You're burning, so will I

Running from all that you've feared in your life
Soul of the night, will a son mislead paint a horror upon you
Marking the moment, displaying in my
Ghost of a life!
That I can't condone the way you left me out in the open
To leave me to die!
So how can I, forget the way you lead me through the path into Heaven
To leave me behind!

Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, too chilling more than I can tell
Burning, now I bring you Hell!
Ahh, Ahhh
Oh, burning, now I bring you Hell
Free me tonight, as the animal, caged, be a terror upon you
Caught in the moment, engaging in my
Bloodlust tonight, now I can't control my venom's flow
Get back from me demon, or be exorcised!
[Chorus:]
Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, too chilling more than I can tell
Burning, now I bring you Hell!
All my emotion and all my integrety
All that you've taken from me
All my emotion and all my integrety
All that you've taken from me
Now I can stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, too chilling more than I can tell
Soul of the night, I know

Save me, from wreaking my vengeance

            <field name="lyrics">Listen, everyone
The time will come when all of us say goodbye
Feel that aching in your heart
Leaving you broken inside
But we're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind
So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can
Take the ones you love
And hold them close because there is little time
And don't let it break your heart
I know it feels hopeless sometimes
But they're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind
So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment
To keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered
Cannot survive
So now go do the best things in life
Bring the fight to this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Shine your light on this world while you can
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment
To keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered
Cannot survive
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment
To keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered
Cannot survive</field>

And never again will I be reminded
We're living within the world of the jaded
They kill my inspiration
It's my obligation
To never again, allow this to happen
Where do I begin?
The choices are endless
Denying the sin
My art, my redemption
I carry the torch of my fathers before me
The thing I treasure the most in life cannot be taken away
There will never be a reason why I will surrender to your remorse
To change myself, I'd rather die
Lonely, we'll not understand
I will make the greatest sacrifice
You can't predict where the outcome lies
You'll never take me alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
Danger, then, cannot be considered
I rage again, dispelling my anger
Where do I begin?
The choices are endless
My art, my redemption, my only salvation
I carry the gift that I have been blessed with
My soul is adrift the oceans of madness
Rehearing the rift that you have created
I end on the whole numbers, give me your arms now
The thing I treasure the most in life cannot be taken away
There will never be a reason why I will surrender to your remorse
To change myself, I'd rather die
Lonely, we'll not understand
I will make the greatest sacrifice
You can't predict where the outcome lies
You'll never take me alive
I'm no slave
Are you feeling brave?
Or have you gone out of your mind?
No more games
It won't feel the same
If I hold my anger inside
There's no meaning
My soul is bleeding
I've had enough of your kind
One sugestion, use your discretion,
Before you label me blind.
The thing I treasure the most in life cannot be taken away
There will never be a reason why I will surrender to your remorse
To change myself, I'd rather die
Lonely, we'll not understand
I will make the greatest sacrifice
You can't predict where the outcome lies
You'll never take me alive

We won't be denied
Feed the fire that is raging inside
This is go time, this is show time
We will fight 'til their wills are broken
This is game time, an insane time
Let the madness fly
Show them strength that just can't be defied
Find the power to devour
Let the beast inside now be woken
In this world only the strong will survive
Hear the roar and you will know you're alive
Feel the energy build in your soul 'cause it's time
Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized
Raw emotion, pure devotion
They will testify
And our memory will endure for all time
Never hiding, no dividing
Let them witness us move as one now
Show no mercy, let the world see
We're invincible
Show them nothing is beyond our control
Take it higher, our desire
Will determine what we've become now
Are you ready for the test of your life?
See the fear bleeding right through their eyes
Feel the energy build in your soul 'cause it's time
Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized
Feel it, take no prisoners now
Take it, there it is standing in front of us
Hear it, our deliverance now
Own it, give 'em an image of us that will
Last for all time
Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation

Stare and try to find some meaning

You stumble in, still holding in
You move like an electric zombie
Barely noticing as your life keeps passing you by
Oh, I still can remember a time when it wasn't like this
Before the world became enslaved
Can we all go back to the time when we were not like this
Can we even be saved?
In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time
So it's 3am
Turn it on again
You never seen the stuff completely
Keep checking in
On the friends that you've left behind
Always jumping in
Any argument
Seems everybody here knows everything
You know you'll never win but you're certainly losing your mind
Oh, I still can remember a time when it wasn't like this
Before the world became enslaved
Can we all go back to the time when we were not like this
Can we even be saved?
In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life

Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time
In another time will we still be blind?
Because there's so much more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time

The powers have called me away
Another time
To carry the colors again
My motivation
An oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor
Of coming back home again
No explanation
Will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation
And now my unfortunate friend
You will discover
A war you're unable to win
I'll have you know
That I've become
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side
A terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war
Another reason
Another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered
Now, for me to light
My dedication
To all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders
With not a regret
My declaration
Embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder
Of how it began
No hesitation
When I am commanding to strike
You need to know
That you're in for the fight of your life
You will be shown
How I've become
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side
A terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

I shake my head in disbelief
The killer walks again
Freed by evil men
And their dark charade
This can't be happening
A mother's selfish pride
Her child's homicide
Can she be to blame?
The suited vulture's circling
A father's cruelty
A murdered family
Is the world insane?
The defender's ready to
Embrace their lies
And their devious smiles
Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You've been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally
Who is innocent?
No one is innocent
Who is innocent?
Presumed innocent
Justice fails again
In the masquerade
A battered woman trembling
Her lover drunk again
When will the torture end
In the web of shame?
Is death the only way?
A child victimized
The crime politicized
For the councilor's gain
The rabid media congregates
His tortured memories
The pervert's fantasies
Is the world insane?
A parasitic devastation seen
On your Tv screen
Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You've been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally
False defender, burn forever
False defender, burn forever
Cold and spineless, have you no soul?
Wicked-minded, out of control
And guided by their hunger
They will find new ways to betray us
Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You've been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally
Who is innocent?
Is it relevant in the world today?
I shake my head in disbelief
Presumed innocent
Justice fails again
In the masquerade
Has the whole world become insane?</field>

They're burning into the night
Too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round

To make it a place worth living in
Oh Superman where are you now
Everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, men of power
Are losing control by the hour
This is the time, this is the place

And the wake up this madness as I held you tight
So long ago
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep
Too many men, too many people
Making too many problems

Pressed to the wall far too many times

Awaken the monster too many times

In a place where innocents play
I was mourning as the headlines shouted his name
They didn't waste any time
I was disgusted when the madman's image
appeared at the top of the screen
Some were barely alive
Too many didn't survive
Still they kept repeating headlines shouting the name
Do they not realize
The future demons with the hope
of becoming the one at the top of the screen?
They've thrown morality away
With such depravity, I must say
You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters
a reason to take your life
The pictures drove me insane
Can't get them out of my brain
You made certain they were right at the top of the page
You disrespected the dead
When the only name was of the one
who committed the murder at the top of the page
The madman watching with glee
As the herd of innocents flee
They saw it all unfold right on the face of the screen
Perhaps they could be the one
Who'd become famous for the acts of terror
reflected on the face of the screen?
You've thrown morality away
With such depravity, I must say
You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters
a reason to take your life
And I call you a pimp, as you whore the insane
The damage you caused you cannot rectify
You've inspired new legions of monsters
determined to take more life
Take a look around
Listen to the sound
Feel it to the ground
Fear has come in a wave
Just another gathering of helpless innocents
forced into the grave
Listen to me now
Are you with me now
Can you tell me how these vultures still glorify them
Lets defy them
You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters
a reason to take your life
And I call you a pimp, as you whore the insane
The damage you caused you cannot rectify
You've inspired new legions of monsters

Has just fallen behind
All the hate in your heart
Will be leaving you blind
So bold Motherfucker
Don’t you limit your mind this time
Chorus
Waiting for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye
Still awaiting I,
“Out of Zion shall come forth the law
And the world of the lord of Jerusalem
Nation shall not raise sword against nation
And they shall not learn war anymore
For the mouth the lord hath spoken”

Rockin to the dawn
Lovin til the morning then I'm gone
I'm gone
I took the city bout one A.M
Loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again
Loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Living after midnight
Rockin to the dawn
Lovin til the morning, then I'm gone
I'm gone
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel
Loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal
Loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
Living after midnight
Rockin to the dawn
Lovin til the morning, then I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
Her body's coming
All night long
The air's electric, sparking power
Loaded, loaded
She’s getting hotter by the hour
Loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
Living after midnight
Rockin to the dawn
Lovin til the morning, then I'm gone
I'm gone
Living after midnight
Rockin to the dawn
Lovin til the morning, then I'm gone
I'm gone
Then I'm gone

Midlife crisis
Suck ingenuity
Down through the family tree
You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you (you're only you)
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleedin' enough for two
It's a midlife crisis
It's a midlife crisis...
What an inheritance
The salt and the Kleenex
Morbid self attention
Bending my pinky back
A little discipline
A donor by habit
A little discipline
Rent an opinion
Sense of security
Holding blunt instrument
I'm a perfectionist
And perfect is a skinned knee
You're perfect, yes, it's true

Too many of our children
Have died in the never
Ending fight of territory
Are we born to violence?
Can we stop in time?
They say you will want
To remain on your side
You'll be starting a war
Now if you cross that line
Turn arround or face my reprisal
For I have determined
That this is mine
Been hurting for a long time
Feeling my heart torn
Open from the lack of humanity
Insanity on both sides
Reaping the path
That guarantees our own extinction
Hate added to the stockpile
Filling the world
With enemies, a constant battle
In the face of violence,
They omit their pride
They say you will want
To remain on your side
You'll be starting a war

Letting go till there was nothing in the way,
Fuck the feeling then, I cave in again,
Sweet surrender to the angel I deny,
When you came to life I was terrified,
I knew that nothing else would ever feel the same,
Doubt came over me; what kind of father would I be?
Another time I could stand up and be a man,
To change a face in my life,
Your future and mine,
Time to do what is right,
A new beginning,
The world around me died,
When I saw that heartbeat,
I knew it wasn't a sin,
Can someone tell me why,
This has happened to me?
Why was it only in death,
Would you redeem my child?
No serenity within agony,
Every day brings on,
A hundred ways to fight,
Constant scrutiny,
I can feel you judging me,
Resurrecting every demon that's inside,
The priest was horrified,
You struggled, still alive,
That one desire was,
The dream I sought for yours,
Grief crippled me, the reaper cheated me,
Left me early for the path I'd come to adore,
To change a face in my life,
Your future and mine,
Time to do what is right,
A new beginning,
The world around me died,
When I saw that heartbeat,
I knew it wasn't a sin,
Can someone tell me why,
This has happened to me?
Why was it only in death,
Would you redeem my child?
My child,
The world around me died,
When I saw that heartbeat,
I knew it wasn't a sin,
Can someone tell me why,
This has happened to me?
Why was it only in death,
Would you redeem my child?
I pray you will redeem my child.

They have a frightening desire for genocide
They wouldn't stop til what was left of my family died
Hell-bent on taking over the world
You couldn't hide in the shout of conformity
We can't forget how we were devastated by the beast
And now we pleaded with the captors for release
We were hunted for no reason at all
One of the darkest times in our history
All that I have left inside is
A soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again
In a brave society
Didn't end up killing me
Scream with me, never again
Not again
A generation that was persecuted endlessly
Exterminated by the Nazi war machine
We will remember, let the story be told
To realize how we lost our humanity
You dare to tell me that there never was a Holocaust
You think that history will leave the memory lost
Another Hitler using fear to control
You're gonna fail this time for the world to see
All that I have left inside is
A soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again
In a brave society
Didn't end up killing me
Scream with me, never again
Not again
All that I have left inside is
A soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again
In a brave society
Didn't end up killing me
Scream with me, never again
For the countless souls who died
Their voices fill this night
Sing with me, never again
They aren't lost, you see
The truth will live in me
Believe me, never again</field>

Welcome to your nightmare
Say good-bye to every thing
All your past obscenities

Echoing Cries, in the time that it began
Hear me now
Feel my plea
There is no more time for apologizes
Never let emotions
Take hold of me
Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side?
Death is an old friend of mine
You can't escape your judgment
I hear them calling out your name
Do not beg for mercy now
You never showed any to them
Embrace your finally punishment
There's not a soul to hear you scream
I have to thank you for letting out the animal in me
Hear me now
Feel my plea
There is no more time for apologizes
Never let emotions
Take hold of me
Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side?
Death is an old friend of mine
The blood became alive
When I was trapped inside
And I can feel the dark passenger coming
My mothers blood and mine
Uniquely intertwined
Help me father put your memory from my mind
My hunger to destroy
When I was just a boy
It pulled me deeper into some thing that I now enjoy
The ritual begins
Evil will meet its end
In your destruction I will finally feel whole again
There is no more time for apologizes
Never let emotions
Take hold of me
Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side?
Death is an old friend of mine
I have become your nightmare

I must stand and wait in line
I may never know for certain
When will be my time
How was I considered evil?
Vengeance taken in this life
Someone granted me reprieval
Decades spent in strife
Led to nothing
Repeat it in my mind
Led to nothing
If only I was born another time
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How have I been so determined malign?
There's the closing of the curtain
In the play that was my life
Countless chapters left unopened
Tragedies inside
I was fighting for a reason
Holy blessed homicide
Seems I have committed treason
All I've sacrificed
Led to nothing
Repeat it in my mind
Led to nothing
If only I was born another time
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How I have been so determined malign?
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How I have been so determined malign?
Fate is so unkind
Now I should have known
Blind leading the blind
Reaping what I've sown
If it all amounts to nothing
Why, then, am I standing in this line?
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How I have been so determined malign?
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How I have been so determined malign?

Will I find a way to keep it together?
Am I strong enough to last through the weather in the hurricane of my life
Can it be a conscious decision?
That I look for ways to alter my vision?
Am I speeding towards another collision in the alleyways of my life
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen in (2x)
Please believe me
Tha my eyes deceive me
Don't stand me up
Just leave me
I have fallen again
This is the end
Pain redefined
Shaking, burning up with the fever
In the realm of pain, I am the deceiver
Now I lie to myself, so I can believe her
As she disassembles my life
I cannot dispel the illusion
All my hopes and dreams are drowned by confusion
Can I find a way to make a solution that will reconfigure my life?
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen in (2x)
Please believe me
That my ears deceive me
Don't stand me up
Just leave me
I have fallen again
This is the end
Pain redefined
And I know that stillness shatters
We have all been frightened by the
The sound of footsteps on the pavement of our lives
I stand and fight
I'm not afraid to die
Elochai, bury me tonight
Please believe
Tha the world deceives me
Don't stand me up
Just leave me
I have fallen again
This is the end
Pain redefined</field>

You'll be telling again in no time
You just don't realize they'll come back
And be fucking up your life
In trouble again, I just don't understand
This whole pattern that keeps repeating
You know you'll do it again
And admit you can step into the light

Branded like an animal
I can still feel them burning my mind
I do believe that you made your message clear
I think I am losing my mind
I think I am losing my mind
Deprivating, isolating all that I feel
Leaving me with images I know are not real
Are those words of condemnation that I hear
I think I am losing my mind
I think I am losing my mind
Come inside now, I implore
Do you think you can restore
The crucial pieces missing from my brain
What seems to be the matter dear
Why do you cry and shake with fear
I´ve only had the best dub insane.
Please let me out
Please let me out
Please let me
(Chorus )
I don't know how much I can take
The secret thoughts inside me wake
I've lost what was within me
Oh sweet insanity (2x)
Now I try again to find
The thing that was my mind
Behold the undersigned
Who said I've lost my mind
I Try again to find
The thing that was my mind
Behold the undersigned
Cause then i´ve lost my mind
I've lost my mind

Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add on to your pain and suffering
Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you completely
All the cries you're beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening
Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away
Another nightmare about to come true
Will manifest tomorrow
Another love that I've taken from you
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering
Another taste of the evil I breed
Will level you completely
Bring to life everything that you fear
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening
Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away
Return to me x3
Turn to me
Leave me no one
Turn to me
Return to me x2
Turn to me
Cast aside
Return to me x3
Turn to me
Leave me no one
Return to me x3
You've made me turn away
Living just isnt hard enough
Burn me alive inside
Living my life's not hard enough
They take everything from you
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away.</field>

Nowhere to go this time, revenge will be mine again
Say goodbye my friend

We must start asking why
Don't you know the war is far from over now
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now
As our brothers die defending no one
The war is far from over now
Liberation, a moral charade
For the cause is a part of your sacred lie
Damnation a moment away in all the world's eyes
It's the doom of us all
We give in to control for the sake of your sacred lie
Complications abound
You'll get used to the sound of alarms in your lie
Don't you know the war is far from over now

Give us a moment of peace in our lifetime [x7]

The betrayal that you conspired in
All that devotion thrown away

This insanity has divided
Left me with nothing left to destroy
I'm becoming so paranoid
Everyone is so paranoid
In a moment you will see my other side
When I'm confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyl into Hyde
Chorus:
Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed
On the lies
He demands your sacrifice
I can barely control this feeling
Look at the murder in my eyes
I was never good at concealing
Violent thoughts have come to life
Horror will have a deeper meaning
You are the reason this began
Even now I can hear you screaming
There's only one thing left to destroy
And I'll no longer be paranoid
No more reason to be annoyed
In a moment you will see my other side
When I'm confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyl into Hyde
Chorus:
Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed
On the lies
He demands your sacrifice.

What a rude awakening
Angel of death has come and ripped you from my life
I can't stand the devastation
Relentless agony
Hope that I get to see you on the other side
Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone it just isn't right
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore
What faith I had is broken
And I question everything
As those shards of doubt begin to penetrate my heart
With every waking hour
Within everything I see
The shadows of your loss are tearing my apart
Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone it just isn't right
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore
We're sorry, this mailbox is full and can't take messages
My world is shattered and disarrayed
I'm beaten down, drained emotionally
They say in time the pain goes away
But in my soul it will forever stay
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore

Always hoping that something will spark

To an open sore
On the parasite
Countless hunts have fallen
Hard to number
Damnation’s whore
Is looking for a victim tonight
With an angry soul
And a wicked design
Your will cannot endure
And your heart is torn away
I was gonna be the moment
You were alone and
You seemed hot as the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be alright
I had given up control and
I didn’t focus hard enough to see
The warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
Damn what I’m becoming
One of them now
Just an opened door
On an endless night
Dark desire burning
In my blood now
How can I be sure?
I don’t know if I’ll be able to fight
With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
If my heart is torn away
I was gonna be the moment
You were alone and
You seemed hot as the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be alright
I had given up control and
I didn’t focus hard enough to see
The warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
Now that I’ve been torn apart
Will there be an end to this?
Will there finally be release?
Will I finally rest in peace?
I’m determined to believe
My prayers will be received
With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
As my heart is torn away
I was gonna be the moment
You were alone and
You seemed hot as the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be alright
I had given up control and
I didn’t focus hard enough to see
The warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
The warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
You are personified
Your heart is serpentine.

That’s enough of all your taunting
Seems I can’t remove you from my mind
Don’t you know sometimes I wish
They’d kill me for wanting you
I will sit alone in silence
Gather around the meaning I can’t find
Will you be defeated when
They kill me for wanting you
I can’t believe that my sanity lies
In abandoning you
I can’t recall a more helpless time
Perpetrated by you
Sickened
From wanting you
Frightened of finding the truth
Don’t say anymore
Now my mind isn’t changing
This reckoning’s long overdue
Alabaster walls surround me
In the prison of my own design
Will I win my freedom
If they kill me for wanting you
Maybe arms of hell will hound me
Just as long as I remain confined
I will be completed when they kill me
For wanting you
I can’t believe that my sanity lies
In abandoning you
I can’t recall a more helpless time
Perpetrated by you
Sickened
From wanting you
Frightened of finding the truth
Don’t say anymore
Now my mind isn’t changing
This reckoning’s long overdue
So I have determined
That I am undone
Will I bury another problem
In the graveyard you allow me to find
So I have determined that I am no one
Will I finally cling to something
That has never been tied to a single memory of you
Sickened
From wanting you
Frightened of finding the truth
Don’t say anymore
Now my mind isn’t changing

It doesn't have any soul

Give it to me
Give it to me
You like that?
I'm still surrounded by the "new sound"
I've had enough and I'm ready to go
I strangle hope throughout the world now
The new obsession will fade in time
I fear reminder of the past now
All convoluted hardly ready to go
Their whines and moans will never last now
I think you've given us a few this time
Come on
Can't you just leave it alone?
It doesn't have any soul
Just find a thing of your own
And stop pretending to know
As the countless numbers hunger for world wide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like that?
As it's blown apart, hundreds throw away
Makes me question just what I believe
Brothers throw apart, mindless drones enslaved
Makes me search for an answer
I don't want to know
It's like a plague from below
Killing all that I know
One hundred voices the same
Drench their sorrow with fame
As the countless numbers hunger for world wide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
As the countless numbers hunger for world wide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like that?
Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it</field>

You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss, will I run?
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on, with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing, another time
You'll never know how your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done

Listen closely now and you can hear mine as well
I was addicted to breaking my heart
I coudn't get enough of feeling it torn apart
So conflicted, in feeling the pain
I say I've had enough but still want it all again
I won't deny
I tried to hide it
But it was killing me inside
And now I
Feel un-whole
So if you're able to survive
And still you find yourself alone
You will begin to realize
That you are stronger on your, stronger on your own
I've created my own personal hell
Come inside with me and you can be mine as well
This affliction will blacken your heart
I keep believing as it's tearing my soul apart
Self-destruction is the name of the game
I say I've had enough but still want it all again
I won't deny
I tried to hide it
But now it's killing me inside
And now I
Feel so cold
So if you're able to survive
And still you find yourself alone
You will begin to realize
That you are stronger on your own
And when you're able to decide
Then you don't want this anymore
You'll be the one to turn the tide
For you are stronger on your, stronger on your
Stronger on your own
Leave it alone
Bury it, bury it
Leave it alone
Bury the dead
Leave it alone
Bury it, bury it
Leave it alone
Bury the dead
Leave it alone
Bury it, bury it
Leave it alone
Bury the dead
So if you're able to survive
And still you find yourself alone

Run if you intend to survive

Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight
I can feel the calling again
The primal need is filling me
Changes are about to begin
And now my blood is boiling
I can see the fear in your eyes
But you can't bring yourself to scream
Time to shed the mortal disguise
For the beast is coming to life
Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight
We begin the hunt tonight
Til the power courses the creatures take flight
When the kill is close and I will be satisfied
For the smell of fear tonight
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied
You're mine
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight
For the animal's soul is mine
And the world around will never hear your cries
An unholy crime
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight.

But now it's sickening me
Because the world keeps burning
And they keep turning the page
They love the drama
So pardon me if I don't give a
God damn bit about anything you're telling me
It's just a matter of fact
All of the best ones lie
And you're never gonna get me to see your side
I'm telling you all the best ones lie
And there's nothing you can say that will change my mind
So how about you don't even try
God damn maybe I am a little terrified
You know I really don't know what to believe
We watch the world die while they keep telling us
There's nothing to fear
So now it's crippling me
Because the world keeps turning
And all people do is complain
They love the drama
Reality is they don't care a
God damn bit about anything you're telling me
It's just as simple as that
All of the best ones lie
And you're never gonna get me to see your side
I'm telling you all the best ones lie
And there's nothing you can say that will change my mind

No!

I'm telling you all the best ones lie

Remember now, all of the best ones lie

Yeah!

You're coming into your own tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight
The burden you bear can cripple you
A ravenous cancer, eating your soul
Lost within a world beyond your control
So tonight, let there be a reckoning
Let this moment empower you to no end
Let the doubts within you, start to descend
Take the path that the weak ones demonize
Look around and begin to realize

To feel the Brutality!
Devastation, Obliteration
Are all in a part of Eccasorbation
There's no explaining my situation,
Now why does this shit keep happening to me?
I've held on too long just to let it go now,
Will my inner strength get me through it some how
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!
Too dark for forgiveness, I
Can't seem to do anything right
When I try to rebuild I see my humble shelter
Just fall to the ground again
Object to the evil, I
No point to let anyone try
Take heed my friend lest you be torn assunder
Like all that's become of me
Descimation, Decintagration
All being apart of imagination,
There's no explaining my situation

Darlin' you can trust me completely
If you even try to look the other way
I think that I could kill this time
It doesn't really seem I'm getting through to you
Though I see you weeping so sweetly
I think that you might have to take another taste
A little bit of hell this time
Lie to me
Lie to me
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me
You always wanted people to remember you
To leave your little mark on society
Don't you know your wish is comin true today
Another victim dies tonight
Lie to me
Lie to me
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me
Is she really telling lies again
Doesn't she realize she's in danger
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me
The little bitch she went and she told a lie
And now she will never tell another lie
The little bitch she went and she told a lie
NEVER FUCKING LIE TO ME!.</field>

Barely even remember when
There was nothing left to hide and,
She had found a way inside,then
I was forced to walk alone
Living in an empty home
All I wanted was to hide,and
Try to numb the ache inside
And I'm still afraid of the light
And a thousand voices share their laughter at my demise
(CHORUS)
Now if I am to survive
The Infection must die
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive
The Infection must die
Nothing left but a broken man
Terrified of everything
Nothing left of his foolish pride,his
Fond memories slowly die,then
As he wakes again alone
Still a prisoner in his home
Ready to allow the dart to
Penetrate his broken heart
And I'm still afraid of the light
And a thousand voices share their laughter at his demise
(CHORUS)
Now if I am to survive
The Infection must die
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive
The Infection must die
(SOLO)
Now if I am to survive
The Infection must die
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive
The Infection must die
This is where I draw the line
This infection must die
Give me release from this demon of mine
The infection must die.

            <field name="lyrics">Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
You turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard their call as you walked away
A voice of calm but within the silence
And though it seemed an eternity
You waited, hoping it would call out again
With the shadow beckoning
Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for a reckoning
From when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid, don't turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind, then
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
Sickening, weakening
Don't let another zombie pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes a bit of dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
Don't ignore
Listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light</field>

What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away
To fall upon the night
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, begging the question
Why
For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
On a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing
[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night
This self discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away
To feast upon the night
The source of my Felicity
Dark maiden taking hold of my hand
Lead me away from hibernation
Strong and unafraid
Never a question why
For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
I'm about to take it away
There can be no better way of knowing
[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night

Give in to the night
[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night

Give into the Night

            <field name="lyrics">Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs
That voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
"Fools" said I, "you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
And the words that it was forming
And the sign said
"The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sound of silence</field>

taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
as their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness for all I've seen
their degradation I cannot forget
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgment falls upon you at first light
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment, of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
As the violent urges?
the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their role
stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
for the apocalypse must be televised
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgment falls upon you at first light
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment, of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
When you die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
When all the world is slain
When you die, you'll know why
You'll die, and know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die, you'll know why
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one

As you dig into me
And from your smile now
It seems as if you liked it
You'd better cherish this moment
As you dig into me
You'll never get another chance at this.
I won't stand another minute
Of your questioning me
You hear me, bitch, now
The interrogations over
I can't handle the feeling
Of your pestering me
How would you like
To make my favorite fist?
Now you can't reneg
I love to see you beg, I
Dream this moment as you run away
You will know me, separate me, from
What I believe/will leave this moment
In brutality
You're the one who kept on pushing
'Til I made you bleed.
It seems your pride has been stolen
Since you stood up to me
I'll tell you now you know I think I
Really like it
So learn a lesson from someone
Who will never repeat
The many tragic mistakes of his past.
I hope you savor this moment
As you're still on your feet
So keep it quiet now
I think you're gonna like it
Words have no consequences when
They're spoken to me,
But you be careful when you're writing cheques.
Don't you question how
I stand above you, now I
Dream this moment as you run away
You will know me, separate me, from
What I believe/will leave this moment
In brutality
You're the one who kept on pushing
'Til I made you bleed.
Now you know the answer
Save yourself from danger
I cannot forget
how all of this began, I
know you know the answers
Save yourself from danger
Beaten by a stranger
Blood still on his hands, I
Dream this moment as you run away
You will know me, separate me, from
What I believe/will leave this moment
In brutality
You're the one who kept on pushing
'Til I made you bleed.</field>

I develop a new way to hate you
It slowly beckons a love inside
Now I can barely even stand the sight of you
We keep pretending there's nothing wrong
Playing parts in the tragic comedy
Soon we'll be singing a different song
When we both face our harsh reality
Yeah, we'll draw battle lines
Fortify our defenses once again
Yeah, we'll look for any sign
We'll meet each other's eyes once again
They all will hear our battle cry
(This venom)
It keeps repeating and it's making me realize
We're just not able to survive
(This venom)
This venom's killing us
And we won't make it out alive
I'm used to feeling you're stalking me
I lie awake for the next explosion
With every word always haunting me
I'm never able to let my guard down
I feel the tension begin to rise
I'm tired of living the sick déjà vu again
If we're able to compromise
There's no hope of me getting through again
Yeah, we'll draw battle lines
Fortify our defenses once again
Yeah, we'll scream the same old lines
We'll meet each other's eyes and that is when

Still I'm broken
Now I am torn, thought it was over this time
And we know there's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away
..
a price to pay, didn't think it would thrill you
To witness the fallen ones shattered and ashamed
No I'm not the only one with a need to fulfill you
The one willing to risk it all
Still uncertain

Remove the sickness

I look for a new place to hide
When tearing my color away
I swallow my pride but never forget what I want
I’m starting to long for a time
Repairing the war in my mind
Two worlds are warring in me
Both sides are losing
Patience has died
None of the mortal remain
Drowns my convictions, regions divide
Two worlds are warring in me
Killing us now
Show me the light
Two worlds collide whenever I step to the front
I look for a new place to hide
When tearing my color away
I swallow my pride but never forget what I want
I’m starting to long for a time
Repairing the war in my mind
Give me a sign
Tell me when it’s time
Show me the light
Tell me when this is fucking over

That we're over all the violence
Are we done with this? Put it all to rest
Turn the screams now into silence
Will you be a man? Can you make a stand?
Will you own up or deny it all?
All the time we lost, was it worth the cost
Of breaking a family in two?
Destroyed all we knew
A tyrant, so defiant
Lonely as your heart is sinking
Consequences, no defenses
If only you had been thinking
You can buy it, for a moment
Why did both of us have to
Believe that we were right?
Tyrant!
Can I clear my mind? Leave it all behind
Start to pick up all the pieces
Can I hide the scars? Just like prison bars
That have always seemed to confine me
Will we save it all? Even from the fall
Is there time left for revival
Can I be convinced that some hope exists?
With these wounds cut so deep in my soul
Can we become whole?
A tyrant, so defiant
Lonely as your heart is sinking
Consequences, no defenses
If only you had been thinking
You can buy it, for a moment
Why did both of us have to
Believe that we were right?
Tyrant!
There's so many things that I wanted to say
But the love turned to hate
we kept pushing away
And the words that came out turned it into a mess
And it's like pulling teeth
cause you'll never confess
Now the damage is done
The hurt and the pain when nobody has won
Have we forgot
it's your blood inside of my veins
That feeds my heart
A tyrant, so defiant
Lonely as your heart is sinking
Consequences, no defenses
If only you had been thinking
You can buy it, for a moment
Why did both of us have to
Believe that we were right?

Still see you everywhere
You're still in every room
Filled you with every move
I can't go on without erasing you from my heart
Tired of feeling this pain
Seems you're the only ghost
I just can't chase away
Ooh, you still inhabit every thought
I prayed that you'd be gone

            <field name="lyrics">When I first saw you never imagined
You would be one that I would love
Simply it happened I did not choose anything
It was one of the hazards of life that you do not choose
Too bad that all is not as easy as it looks
It is not a bed of roses
You tell me not away from you and I do not take away me
Even you loving others still love you
If you are happy I'd be happy
Never think twice to help me
Why I ajuderei without hesitating
You're the first and the last person that I think every day
I know I will not be able to wait for you a lifetime
Why do I know you want me to be happy
I can not express myself with words
For me to express myself I will need all the world's music
I never thought I fall in love with that Garato arriving atrasda every day
If I choose to podesse who in love for sure you choose
When I'm around you I do not know what to say, do or how to act
I would never ask you to choose between him and me
For I know that hurt you very
You did nothing wrong, so do not blame yourself
Her eyes, her mouth, her cheeks, her nose, her hair
It is not of this world, why in this world there is nothing perfect
But you're perfect, so how perfect
something could exist in this troubled world
Does it if we had met before might have been different?
As I can not have her as my wife will
be happy without your best friend
Do not fall in love at first sight, that feeling came gradually
But when he arrived there was an explosion
of feelings that I did not know what to think
I will love you all my life but I do not know if I can wait for you
In a full dark world you were my light esperença for a better world
For your home I had a desire to improve
I love you and always love you but do not know if I can wait for you my love
I'm already happy just because I met you
Do not blame yourself, for what my heart did, why you did nothing
If I podesse repair all the mistakes I made with you
I do not atone for any of them that we are human and make mistakes
Through a screen
For only messages
I fell in love with you
It is 1 meter or 100, 000 km but will always be near you
I never do anything to get away from you and hope you will not do
I would never ask you to choose between him and me because I know you would
choose him
But even with knowing that I will continue loving you why I have no choice
I do not know if I will be able to love someone like that again even knowing
We are still in our youth
Always be here for you pro whatever comes
I love you but do not know how to tell you this
You expect the rest of my life knowing that I can not give anything
Yet I wait you why I love and will always love you you no matter what happens
I will never forget you, never forget your hug
You're the strongest person I know but think it is not strong
But is the person but strong and wonderful this world
Do not make me wait too long my love

How do you sleep
When you live with your lies
Out of your mouth
Up from your mind
That kind of thinking
Starts a chain reaction
You are a time bomb ticking away
You need to release
What you're feeling inside
Let out the beast
That you're trying to hide
Step right up and be a part of the action
Get your game face on
Because it's time to play
You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up
How do you live without playing the game
Sit on the side and expect to keep sane
Step right up and be a part of the action
Come get a piece of it before it's too late
Take a look around
You can't deny what you see
Were living in a violent society
Well my brother let me show you a better way
Now get your game face on because it's time to play
You're pushing and fighting your way you're ripping it up
So tell me what am I supposed to be
Another gdamn drone
Tell me what am I supposed to be
Should I leave it on the inside
Should I get ready to play
You're pushing and fighting your way

Wake up, are you alive, will you listen to me
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die (Say!)
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing, you're making me known
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing
So..
What's up I wonder why do you listen to me
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die (Say!)
What's up I wonder why do you listen to me
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die (Say!)
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing, you're making me known
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing
So!
Can't you imagine how good going through this will make you feel
I promise, no one will ever know
There will be no chance of you getting caught
They never loved you anyway, so come on
Be a man, and do what you are compelled to do
Save me god! *echo*
I can hear the voice, but I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright
I can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
And make everything alright!
I can hear the voice, but I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright
I can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
And make everything alright!
Are you breathing now, do the wicked see you
You still breathing you're making me known
Are you breathing no, do the wicked see you
You still breathing
So, are you breathing
So, do you breath..
Now, now!
So, are you breathing
So, do you breath now!.</field>

Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Your mind won't ever, never let you say what you want
You howl and wail like a banshee
Still your mind wont ever let you say
Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Your mind won't ever, never let you say what you want
My little tired devotee
Your mind don't even let you feel
Quivering now, shivering now, withering
Your mind won't let you say that you're
Wondering now, pondering now, hungering
Won't let you say that you're
Questioning, wavering, weakening
You mind won't let you say that you're
Hearkening, listening, heeding me now
Won't let you say that you want
Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Your mind won't ever, never let you have what you want
I feel your hunger to taste me
Still your mind won't ever let you say
Your kind is just the type that should use me
But your mind won't seem to let you have
The opportunity to abuse me, abuse me
Your mind won't even let you feel
Quivering now, shivering now, withering
Your mind won't let you say that you're
Wondering now, pondering now, hungering
Won't let you say that you're
Questioning, wavering, weakening
You mind won't let you say that you're
Hearkening, listening, heeding me now
Won't let you say that you want...me

Savor the addiction, savor the affliction, no
The addiction, savor the affliction, savor me
Savor the addiction, savor the affliction
Savor the addiction, savor the affliction
Savor me, savor her mind
Your mind won't let you say that you want me, get it (3x)
Because your mind won't let you say that you want me, you want me

I can't be told to compromise this
They'll never doubt the body lying at my feet
A most formidable reminder
They will speak my name for eternity
I have no need of any guidance
I am a weapon, powerful beyond belief
Seen through the warrior's eyes, I
Never need to question, how to defeat you
Come on bring it

I can feel the strength that will
Ensure my victory this time.

            <field name="lyrics">I didn't mean to give my soul away
To have the life I thought that everybody wants
And I need to let you know I was wrong
It's a sham
They stole my heart and took control away
And when I lost the life that everybody wants
Will you'd think they'd help you out
But they don't give a damn
They lift you up
(You might feel it, but don't believe it)
You take your turn
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
They light that spark
(You can't fight it)
Then sit back and watch you burn
They lift you up
(You might feel it, but don't believe it)
Give you your task
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
When your world goes dark
(You can't hide it)
They'll just smile and watch you burn
You can't believe a single word they say
You tried to have the life that everybody wants
Pretty soon you'll figure out that you don't
It's a scam
You're torn apart, and then you're thrown away
And you become the one that everybody talks
By then there's no way out
It's all part of the plan
They lift you up
(You might feel it, but don't believe it)
You take your turn
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
They light that spark
(You can't fight it)
Then sit back and watch you burn
They lift you up
(You might feel it, but don't believe it)
Give you your task
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
When your world goes dark

            <field name="lyrics">[Intro Verse]
I hear the voices echoing around me
Angered eyes that don't even know who I am
Looking to kill again
(They will kill again)
As the unknown enemies surround me
Wicked laughter resonates inside my head
And I am filled with dread
(And adrenaline)
What do I do?
Why do I deserve this?
So were different
Why do I deserve to die now?
Give me a reason why?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then it all goes a blur
Let instinct take flight
Find my hands on his throat
Yet hear myself say
[Chours]
Tell me now
Who taught you how to hate?
Because it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way, you become
Dead to everyone
[Verse 2]
A father's pride
My son walking beside me
I look around and marvel at the children play
In perfect disarray
(So innocent)
No judgment, pure exhilaration
Not to wipe the colours are only in our minds
Nothing realigned
(All different)
There's always one who plants an evil seed and
creatures here to pull you to the other side
Into a world of lies
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Everything is a chore when you lost your light
In a still beat your what made you this way
[Chours]
Tell me now
Who taught you how to hate?
Because it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way you become
Dead to everyone
(You're not anyone)
Ohh Oohh
[Bridge]
Lost all innocence
Invented an arrogance
You burn
All your life
(No telling you)
No deliverance
Consumed by the best events of hate
Don't deny
Deep in your heart does it remain do think
you can bring it back to life again?
Is it still in your soul?
(No saving you)
Where's the deviant?
You're only a remnant
What has made you this way?
Lay before the disdain
[Outro]
Tell me now who taught you how to hate
because it isn't your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When live this way you become
(You become)
Tell me now who taught you how to hate
because it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way you become
(You become)
You become
Dead to everyone

'Till the day you arrived
Certainly, I felt alive
Strength I had lost was revived
I'm mending inside
And we both know why
Cause You're Mine
I knew I could be whole if
You were Mine
I'll vanquish any foe because
You're Mine
Been betrayed too many times
Didn't think I would ever recover
That it'd haunt me for the rest of my life
Then you opened up my eyes
And you helped me rediscover
With what you resurrected
A man who had died
Your power regave me new life
Made me reborn and refined
Rebuilt from inside and we both know why
Cause You're Mine
I knew I could be whole if
You were Mine
I'll vanquish any foe because
You're Mine
I never thought I would ever escape
At times I wanted to die
Feared that it all was just a little too late
Thought that I wouldn't survive
I let you in and let go of the hate
My heart recovered, now I
Owe you a debt that I can never repay
I still believe
Cause You're Mine
I'm burning inside and we both know why
Cause You're Mine
I knew I could be whole if
You were Mine
I'll vanquish any foe because

Yeah, bringing you another disturbing creation
from the mind of one sick animal who can't tell the difference

I've been waiting my whole life for just one, Hauck!
And all I needed was just one, Hauck!
How can you say that you don't give a, Hauck!
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All I wanted was just one, Hauck!
One tiny little innocent, Hauck!
And when I feel like I'm shit out of, Luck!
I find my stupified, coming back again

Why, do you like playing around with
My, narrow scope of reality
I, can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
And why, do you like playing around with
My, narrow scope of reality
I, can feel it all start slipping away

See but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it

It's all the same you see
Live with it but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it

I get stupified

I find myself stupified, coming back again
All the people in the high rise, Hauck!
And all the people in the projects, Hauck!
And all la hente in the bario, Hauck!
I find myself stupified, coming back again

Why, do you like playing around with
My, narrow scope of reality
I, can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why, do you like playing around with
My, narrow scope of reality
I, can feel it all start slipping away

See but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it
I get stupified
It's all the same you see
Live with it but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it
I get stupified
I get stupified

Tifached [Hebrew for "be afraid"]
Tifached

And don't deny me
No baby now, don't deny me
And darlin' don't be afraid

Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify
Look in my face, stare in my soul

Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify

No, no
Are you breathing
So, are you breathing
No

Wake up, are you alive
Will you listen to me
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die
When you listen to me
Let the living die, Let the living die

Wake up, are you alive

Are you breathing, no?
Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?
You're making me known
Are you breathing, no?
Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?

What's up? I wonder why?
Do you listen to me?
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die

Let the living die, let the living die

[Chorus]

Can't you imagine how good going through this will make you feel?
I promise, no one will ever know
There will be no chance of you getting caught
They never loved you anyway
So come on, be a man

[Repeat: x10]
And do what you are compelled to do save me God, God 

I can hear the voice But I don't want to listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright
I can feel the subliminal need To be one with the voice
And make everything alright
I can hear the voice But I don't want to listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright
I can feel the subliminal need To be one with the voice
And make everything alright

[Chorus]

So, are you breathing?

Ah, shit
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken your servant I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection
When suddenly it changes
Violently it changes (oh no)
There is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
You mother get up come on get down with the sickness
You fucker get up come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift, that has been given to me

I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes
Living with these changes (oh no)
The world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
You mother get up come on get down with the sickness
You fucker get up come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift, that has been given to me

(And when I dream)
(And when I dream), (and when I dream)
No mommy, don't do it again
Don't do it again
I'll be a good boy
I'll be a good boy, I promise
No mommy don't hit me
Why did you have to hit me like that, mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me
Why did you have to be such a bitch

Why don't you
Why don't you just fuck off and die
Why can't you just fuck off and die
Why can't you just leave here and die
Never stick your hand in my face again bitch
Fuck you
I don't need this shit
You stupid sadistic abusive fucking whore
How would you like to see how it feels mommy
Here it comes, get ready to die

Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness

A little somethin' for your earhole, get up
Baring a part of my soul again, get up
Disturbed in the house, were droppin' plates

You said it couldn't be done
Told me that it's the kind of battle
That just couldn't be won, you know
You're too sick, too hard, too fucked in the head
You'll never make it, no, not in this lifetime
Well guess again my friend
Don't act surprised
We got the bass drum kick
That will blow out your eyes ha,
'Cause when you hear this shit
You'll get to steppin'
Gonna fight the war
And use my music as a weapon

You know I'm talkin' bout (recognition)
You know I'm talkin' bout (vindication)

Another goddamn slap in the face
Don't wanna give us a place
Are you afraid?

Well fear this,
'Cause I'm breakin' through the walls of your nightmare
Wake up time to die
The way your livin' there is no compromising it
Better get ready for
Another surprise in it may leave a mark
Because I'm coming fast
Plantin' thoughts in your mind
And droppin' plates on your ass

Well here I come
I'm droppin' plates on your ass bitch
You never mind and you don't need this
Said here I come
I'm droppin' plates on your ass bitch
You never mind and you don't need

Well on your mark, here we go again, hey ya, ya
Well never mind 'cause you're not a number one, oh ya, ya
You're too hard and from the other side, hey ya, ya
I think it's time to bring it home again
Right to me

Break through the walls of your nightmare

Reject
Are you no one
Feel you nothing
You know I'll bet you think
You have a good reason to be living
In the limelight of the fortunate ones

You're too weakened by the poison
That they feed you in the living lie
They don't believe you
Call to no one
Trust in nothing
Little impotent one

I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be innocent, you know
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to let them hypnotize me

Punk ass, are you listening
Can you hear me or are you deaf and dumb to my language
Do the real words seem to hurt you
Well put em' up motherfucker
You'll feel it
When I stamp it on your forehead
So you will never forget
That you're a reject
And you're a no one
And you're nothing
Little impotent one

I don't want to be
I don't want to be

I don't want to let them hypnotize me

Fear awaken
Go with it now
And let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Your mind is racing

I don't understand why you don't like me
Why don't you like me?
Am I so different from you
Now does it scare you that I'm able to discern
What to love and what to burn
I'll add your fuel to the fire now
Stand back, brother take your hand back
Leave it and I might crack
More than a smile or two you see
You don't judge what you don't understand
You can't deny what has been given to me

I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be innocent, you know
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to let them hypnotize me
I don't want to let them hypnotize me

Fear awaken
Go with it now
And let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Go with it now
Go with it now
Your fear awaken
Go with it now
And let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Your mind is racing
Erasing now!

Hey reject
Are you no one
Feel you nothing

To leave your little mark on society

It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?

How do you sleep
When you live with your lies
Out of your mouth
Up from your mind
That kind of thinking starts a chain reaction
You are a time bomb ticking away
You need to release

What your feeling inside
Let out the beast
That your trying to hide
Step right up and be a part of the action
Go get your game face on because it's time to play

You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up

Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?

Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?

How do you live
Without playing the game
Sit on the side
And expect to keep sane
Step right up and be part of the action
Come get a piece of it before it's too late
Take a look around
You can't deny what you see
We're living in a violent society
Well my brother let me show you a better way
Get your game face on because it's time to play

You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up

Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?

Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?

So tell me what am I suppose to be
Another goddamn drone
Tell me what am I suppose to be
Should I leave it on the inside?
Tell me what am I suppose to be
Another goddamn drone
Tell me what am I suppose to be
Should I get ready to play?
You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up

Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?

Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant

Wake up are you alive
Will you listen to me
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die

Say, wake up are you alive
Will you listen to me
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die

Say, are you breathing now
Do the wicked see you
You still breathing
You're making me known
Are you breathing now

So, what's up
I wonder why do you listen to me
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, your gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die, say

Say, so, what's up
I wonder why do you listen to me
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now

You're making me known
Are you breathing now
Do the wicked see you

So

Can't you imagine how good going through this will make you feel?
I promise, no one will ever know
There will be no chance of you getting caught
They never loved you anyway
So come on, be a man
And do what you are compelled to do

Save Me God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God

I can hear the voice but I don't want to listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be all right
I can feel the subliminal need to be one
With the voice and make everything go
I can hear the voice but I don't want to listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be all right
I can feel the subliminal need to be one with
The voice and make everything all right

Are you breathing now
Do the wicked see you
You still breathing
You're making me known

Are you breathing now
Do the wicked see you
You still breathing
So
Are you breathin', no?
So
Are you breathin', now, now
So
Are you breathin'

Still your mind won't ever let you say

Ah, shit

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken your servant I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection
When suddenly it changes
Violently it changes (oh no)
There is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

[Chorus]
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
You mother get up come on get down with the sickness
You fucker get up come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift, that has been given to me

I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes
Living with these changes (oh no)
The world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

[Chorus]

(And when I dream)
(And when I dream)
(And when I dream)
(And when I dream)

No mommy, don't do it again
Don't do it again
I'll be a good boy
I'll be a good boy, I promise
No mommy don't hit me
Why did you have to hit me like that, mommy?

Don't do it, you're hurting me
Why did you have to be such a bitch
Why don't you,
Why don't you just leave here and die
Why don't you just leave leave and die
Why can't you just leave here and die
Never stick your hand in my face again bitch
Fuck you
I don't need this shit
You stupid sadistic abusive fucking whore
How would you like to see how it feels mommy
Here it comes, get ready to die

Is she not right? Is she insane?
Will she now run for her life now that she lied to me?
Is she not right? Is she insane?

You always wanted people to remember you
To leave your little mark on society
Don't you know your wish is coming true today
Another victim dies tonight

Doesn't she realize she's in danger
Eyow

Is she not right? Is she insane?
Will she now run for her life now that she lied to me?
Is she not right? Is she insane?
Will she now run for her life now that she lied to me?

The little bitch, she went and told a lie
And now she will never tell another a lie
The little bitch she went and she told a lie
Never fucking lie to me!</field>

Wanting, letting go, of what never could be again
Lost and alone
Imprisoned now inside your mind
With the way you tried
To destroy me again
You were waiting and living for no one
With the way you tried
To completely refuse all your life

Feed on nothing
You'll never live up to me

Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
I've stricken you
Feed on your nothing
And you'll never live up to me

There isn't a thing that I can do
Watching the whole thing just wash away
Making me long
Making you strong

Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me

Had enough
Although I see you're not running
Still are the thoughts running through your mind
Dead to love
The path that you are now taking
Show me the reason to make you mine

I will devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you

It seems to ease my mind

Meaning to my life

Run, to where the smallest ray of light will never find you
Run, to where you will not need to shield your eyes
Run, away from all the soulless, heartless fiends who hound you
Run, away and let your memories go blind, as I devour you

Take all the pain away

Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add on to your pain and suffering
Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you completely
All the cries you're beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

Another nightmare about to come true
Will manifest tomorrow
Another love that I've taken from you
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering
Another taste of the evil I breed
Will level you completely
Bring to life everything that you fear
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way i pray

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

Return to me
Leave me no one
Turn to me
Return to me
Cast aside

You've made me turn away

Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away</field>

Now bold motherfucker
Don't you limit your mind
Can't you see that the pace
Has just fallen behind?
All the hate in your heart
Will be leaving you blind
So bold motherfucker
Don't you limit your mind
This time

Waiting, for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye
Still awaiting, I

"Out of Zion shall come forth a law
And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem
Nation shall not raise sword against nation
And they shall not learn war anymore
For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken"

Waiting, for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye
How long will we be waiting,
For your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye?

Still awaiting, I

Still awaiting, I</field>

Living inside a nightmare from which
I just cannot awaken
Stand on the edge of your life
Just give me another moment
From which I will never awaken

Stand on the brink of my own demise
Fallen again for another
Mistress of burden
To idolize
Hoping that one of them will decide
To let me in

To stand on the edge of the knife
Cutting through the nightmare from which
I just cannot awaken
Stand on the edge of the night
Living inside a moment
From which I will never awaken

Stand on the brink of my own demise
Fallen again for another
Mistress of burden
To idolize
Hoping that one of them will decide
To let me in

Look at what you've done to me
You've become my enemy
Poisoning the world for me
Take away my everything
Weakened as I am

Stand on the brink of my own demise
Fallen again for another
Mistress of burden
To idolize
Hoping that one of them will decide
To let me in</field>

Take these chains away

Violent upheaval
Cities drenched in flame
Wickedness we know we can contain

Take these chains away
Free my hands from bondage
Can't explain a way
Avarice will kill you in time

How the willing murder now
See what we are becoming
An onyx veil that filters out the light
I'll savor this anger
My hate makes me stronger

Free my hands from bondage
Take these chains away
Running from destruction
Avarice will kill you in time</field>

Well then I can't allow this to become another
One of those times when I'm left in the cold, dead
There's no compromise
Just another tie
I know I need to sever

Guarding yourself from the love of another
Left you with nothing tonight
Why does it sound like the devil is laughing
Leaving me haunted tonight
You did decide

Ever haunted by the trappings of this life
Sweet redemption just in front of me
Well now it seems once again that I've lost another
One of the one's that have broke through the wall, damned
Fate won't compromise
I have sold my soul
And now the devil's laughing
You did decide

You were bold and strong
And ready to begin your life
All for nothing
You were sacrificed
You begin alone
And so it will be when you die
All for nothing
Will you be remembered
You did decide

Guarding yourself from the love of another
Left you with nothing tonight
So now you know why the devil is laughing
He left you with nothing tonight

Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger has gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is the land of confusion?

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Oh, Superman, where are you now?
When every thing's gone wrong somehow?
Men of steel, these men of power
I'm losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go around
Tell me why this is the land of confusion

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
When the sun was shining
And all the stars were bright all through the night
In the wake up this madness, as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is the land of confusion?

Now, this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for

This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to</field>

Why, then, am I standing in this line?

(Malevolent criminal eye)
(Motivation paints my mind)
(Cross the invisible line)
(And you'll be paid in kind)

Get it!

Criminal
The suffering
It makes me think like a
Criminal
The suffering
When we're alone
Criminal
The suffering
It makes me feel like a
Criminal
The suffering
When we're alone

Typical enough for me
And burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To bury my vision

A hunger coming over me
As I learn to hide the agony
To make a final remedy
To close the door once and for all

[Chorus]
In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I can not go
When the wound in me refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

(It seems the whole experience is)
Terrible and crippling
The pain is much more then
Physical beyond belief
When we're alone

Typical enough for me
And I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To make this decision

Despair is falling over me
No way to hide the agony
Embracing my calamity
To save myself once and for all

[Chorus]

Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter

Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter now

Now that you wanna know
Now you wanna name
Now you wanna place
Now you wanna time
Now you want it all

Now that you wanna know
Now you wanna name
Now you wanna place
Now you wanna time
Now you want it all
Now

[Chorus]

Don't say that it isn't so
I'm on a path that you'll never comprehend
Set me free from all of this
I need you to quicken my end</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Marked for demolition, I'm
Just a time bomb ticking inside
No hope for the hopeless,
I can see the pieces all laid out in front of me

No point even asking why
Couldn't help even if you tried
Step aside or you might just be the next contestant
To feel the Brutality!

Devastation, Obliteration
Are all to the point of Exacerbation
There's no explaining my situation now,
Why does this shit keep happening to me?

I've held on too long just to let it go now,
Will my inner strength get me through it some how
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!

Too dark for forgiveness, I
Can't seem to do anything right
When I try to rebuild I see my humble shelter
Just fall to the ground again

Object to the evil eye
No point to let anyone try
Take heed my friend lest you be torn asunder
Like all that's become of me

Decimation, Disintegration
Now beyond the point of imagination,
There's no explaining my situation now
Why does this shit keep happening to me?

I've held on too long just to let it go now,
Will my inner strength get me through it some how
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!

I've held on too long just to let it go now,
Will my inner strength get me through it some how
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!

I've held on too long just to let it go now, (Will my inner strength)
Will my inner strength get me through it some how (Defying the curse)
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!</field>

So let the war begin
You're far from innocent
Hell I just don't know where it will end
You are the one to blame
You made a habit of
Fucking up my life.

Another fallacy
Is laid in front of me
Now I just don't know
What to believe
Another animal
Sent to devour what
Evers left inside

I know now!
It's all been a lie
And I'll never come to know why
I learn to discover
You're leaving me now
It's all been a lie
I don't ever want to know why
You've mastered the art of
Deceiving me now.

A mortal enemy
Has been revealed in me
How come I wasn't able to see
Another vampire
Getting their fix from
Sucking up my life
An evil entity
Had taken hold of me
Ripped out my heart and started to feed
I still remember when
I thought that all you were
Eating was my blood

I know now!
It's all been a lie
And I'll never come to know why
I learn to discover
You're leaving me now
It's all been a lie
I don't ever want to know why
You've mastered the art of
Deceiving me now.

Little puppet don't die
Little puppet you're suffering
Don't let me die
Little toy don't die

I know now!
It's all been a lie
And I'll never come to know why
I learn to discover
You're leaving me now
It's all been a lie

I am a little more provocative then you might be,

(We've chosen to want everything)

We don't want men, who want everything
We've stolen in this suffering
And we told them to want everything
But use caution in what you believe
And we're haunted, deny everything
Controlling in this suffering
And they're broken, and lost everything
It's so much easier to leave

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Feeling nothing left inside

When your own have died
And there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
It's had enough
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

We are don't want men, we take everything
I'm taunted in this suffering
And our forces surround everything
Make it impossible to see

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Feeling nothing left inside

When your own have died
And there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
It's had enough
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

Haven't we suffered enough now, haven't we suffered enough now
Haven't we suffered enough damage's then I can bear
Haven't we suffered enough now, haven't we suffered enough now
Haven't we suffered enough damage's then I can bear

Did they even tell the reason why
Countless sons and daughters sent to die
Can you even comprehend the pain

When your own have died
And there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
It's had enough
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

When you're out of time
In this lullaby (In this lullaby)
When your soul is frozen
It's had enough (It's had enough)
When your heart is broken
A thousand times (A thousand times)
Will that be only?
Is that enough?</field>

Feeding off the pain and misfortune of others
A maniacal breed of sub-human parasites
Thrown into a feeding frenzy at the smell of fresh blood
Open your eyes and see the creatures for what they are
A swirling mess of hatred and envy
Don't be naive enough to think you're unaffected
The conversion has already begun

You're frightened, so am I
A world of demons wait
Watching the movements and filling my heart with hate
You're burning, so am I
When I awaken, discover how I have been ravaged by your

Another reason
Another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered
Now, for me to light
My dedication
To all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders
With not a regret
A declaration
Embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder
Of how we began
No hesitation
When I am commanding the strike
You need to know
That you're in for the fight of your life

You will be shown

Won't go to Heaven
She's just another lost soul, about to be mine again
Leave her
We will receive her
It is beyond your control
Will you ever meet again.

Devon
One of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole.
As a little child,
She was taken
And then forsaken
You will remember it all
Let it blow your mind again.

Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal

Give your soul to me
For eternity
Release your life
To begin another time with her
End your grief with me
There's another way
Release your life
Take your place inside the fire with her

Sever
Now and forever
You're just another lost soul about to be mine again
See her, you'll never free her
You must surrender it all
In your life to meet again

Fire
All you desire
As she begins to turn cold and run out of time
You will shiver
Till you deliver
You will remember it all
Let it blow your mind again

Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal
Give your soul to me
For eternity
Release your life
To begin another time with her
End your grief with me
There's another way
Release your life
Take your place inside the fire with her.

Give your soul to me
For eternity
Release your life
To begin another time with her
End your grief with me
There's another way
Release your life
Take your place inside the fire with her

Branded like an animal
I can still feel the burn in my mind
I do believe that you've made your message clear

Deprivating, isolating all that I feel
Leaving me with images I know are not real
Are those words of condemnation that I hear

Come inside now, I implore
Do you think you can restore
The crucial pieces missing from my brain
What seems to be the matter dear
Why do you cry and shake with fear
I've only had the best dub me insane
Please let me out
Please let me out
Please let me

The secret thoughts inside me wake
I've lost what was within me
Oh sweet insanity

Don't know how much I can take
The secret thoughts inside me wake
I've lost what was within me
Oh sweet insanity

Now I try again to find
The thing that was my mind
Behold the other side
That said I've lost my mind

Now I try again to find
The thing that was my mind
Behold the other side
That said I've lost my mind

I've lost my mind! [Repeats]</field>

Unwilling to risk it all

You fucker get up come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift, that has been given to me

I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel

It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me

Why can't you just leave here and die
Never stick your hand in my face again bitch

Why

For saving me from all they've taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
I'm about to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing

In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life?
Give into the night

This self-discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
This serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away
To piece from the sight
So much felicity
Downgrade and taking hold of my head
Leading me away from hibernation
Strong and I'm unafraid
Never a question why

            <field name="lyrics">The indulgence of our lives
Has cast a shadow on our world
Our devotion to our appetites
Betrayed us all

An apocalyptic plight
More destruction will unfold
Mother Earth will show her darker side
And take her toll

It's just another way to die

There can be no other reason why
You know we should have seen it coming.
Consequences we cannot deny
Will be revealed in time

Glaciers melt as we pollute the sky
A sign of devastation coming
We don't need another way to die
Will we repent in time?

The time bomb is ticking
And no one is listening.
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?

Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die

It's just another way to die
Ooh can we repent in time?

Greed and hunger led to our demise
A path I can't believe we followed
Black agendas rooted in a lie
Ooh can we repent in time?

Species fall before our very eyes
A world they cannot survive in
Left them with another way to die
Are we dead inside?

The time bomb is ticking
And no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?

Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die

Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die

Ooh can we repent in time?
It's just another way to die
Ooh can we repent in time?

It's just another way to die

Can we repent in time?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile
With every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away completely

I try to appellate a holy sound of it
Another day gone
Another night's drawn
Dark forces pull me underground
And never went away completely

How can I feel this empty
I will not recover this time
This loneliness is killing me

Will I ever know peace of mind again
I don't believe it
I can't achieve it
I think I know it's just another sign that
Never went away completely

Terror is coursing in me
Can you find a moment
Where I have to be
And feel you die
In asylum (I live a lie)
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For asylum (Relive a lie)
To let go
Now it's dragging me into your grave
Your asylum (Forget the lie)
Overcome and the feeling that I won't get to join you in time
But the loneliness is killing me, yeah!

Death's images are all around again
They're right behind me
They're gonna find me
Judge me for my mortal sin
That have enveloped me completely

I know I'll never know a peaceful night again
Afraid they'll hear me
They don't fear me
Punishment for me of a moral crime
The debt was never paid completely

Terror is coursing in me
Can you find a moment
Where I have to be
And feel you die
In asylum (I live a lie)
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For asylum (Relive a lie)
To let go
Now it's dragging me into your grave
Your asylum (Forget the lie)
Overcome and the feeling that I won't get to join you in time
But the loneliness is killing me

In the end there will be no suffering (More suffering)
In the end we will find out everything (Not everything)
In the end you may question your belief (What belief?)
In the end you will realize someday
How you were deceived
This has gone on too long (too long)
No more demonic race
Destroyer come to light
Because the memory is killing me

In asylum (I live a lie)
I let go now it's dragging me into your grave
For asylum (We live a lie)
Overcome and the feeling that I won't get to join you time (without you)
This world is not fulfilling me

Don't make me live in asylum
I live alive
Don't want to live in asylum
I live a lie
Don't make me live in asylum
I am a lie</field>

I could bear to turn away
Now that it's come to this
Is there nothing left to say?
I've never known before
Such exquisite suffering
As I watched you walk away
I gave in to panicking

I can't believe that
This is really happening
Have I really lost again?
Desperation drives me insane
I will focus all the pain
Right into your heart

Till it makes you blind
Till the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
Till you're mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified

Cold and un-whole again
Crying out and questioning
Will I ever love again?
What's the point of anything?
It takes a toll again
This is where the "fun" begins
Visions haunt me through the night
Now I'm dying for your sins

I can't believe that
If you looked me in the face
You could say there's nothing left
How the silence drives me insane
I will focus all my pain
Right into your heart

Till it makes you blind
Till the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
Till you're mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified

I cannot feel anything, anger I've been harboring
You've nailed me to the cross, upon it will remain
I can't feel anything, rage inside is festering
You've nailed me to the cross, upon it will remain

I will focus all my pain
Right into your heart

Till it makes you blind
Till the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
Till you're mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified

Till the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
Till you're mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified</field>

The killer walks again
Freed by evil men
And their dark charade
This can't be happening

A mother's selfish pride
Her child's homicide
Can she be to blame?
The suited vulture's circling

A father's cruelty
A murdered family
Is the world insane?
They're defender's ready to
Embrace their lies
And their devious smiles

Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You've been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

Who is innocent?
No one is innocent?
Who is innocent?

Presumed innocence
Justice fails again
In the masquerade
A battered woman trembling

Her lover drunk again
When will the torture end
In the web of shame?
Is death the only way?

A child victimized
The crime politicized
For the councilor's gain
The rabid media congregates

His tortured memories
The pervert's fantasies
Is the world insane?
A parasitic devastation seen
On your T-V screen

Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You've been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

False defender, burn forever
False defender, burn forever
Cold and spineless, have you no soul?
Wicked-minded, out of control
And guided by their hunger
They will find new ways to betray us

Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology

You've been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

Who is innocent?
Is it relevant in the world today?
I shake my head in disbelief
Presumed innocent
Justice fails again
In the masquerade
Has the whole world become insane?</field>

Letting go till there was nothing in the way
Fuck the feeling then, I cave in again
Sweet surrender to the angel I deny
When you came to life I was terrified
I knew that nothing else would ever feel the same
Doubt came over me, what kind of father would I be?
Another time I could stand up and be a man
To change a face in my life
(To change a face in my life)
Your future and mine
(Your future and mine)
Time to do what is right
(what is right)
A new beginning

The world around me died
When I saw that heartbeat
I knew it wasn't a sin
Can someone tell me why
This has happened to me?
Why was it only in death
Would you redeem my child?

No serenity within agony
Every day brings on
A hundred ways to fight
Constant scrutiny
I can feel you judging me
Resurrecting every demon that's inside
The priest was horrified
You struggled for the life
That one desire was the dream I sought for yours
Creeps cripple me, the reaper kidded me
Left me early for the path I'd come to adore
To change a face in my life
Your future and mine
Time to do what is right
(what is right)
A new beginning

The world around me died
When I saw that heartbeat
I knew it wasn't a sin
Can someone tell me why
This has happened to me?
Why was it only in death

My child,
The world around me died
When I saw that heartbeat
I knew it wasn't a sin
Can someone tell me why

They have a frightening desire for genocide
They wouldn't stop til what what was left of my family died
Hell-bent on taking over the world
You couldn't hide in the shout of conformity
We can't forget how we were devastated by the beast
And now we pleaded with the captors for release
We were hunted for no reason at all
One of the darkest times in our history

All that I have left inside
Is a soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again, oh
In a brave society
Didn't end up killing me
Scream with me, never again
Not again

A generation that was persecuted endlessly
Exterminated by the Nazi war machine
We will remember, let the story be told
To realize how we lost our humanity
You dare to tell me that there never was a Holocaust
You think that history will leave the memory lost
Another Hitler using fear to control
You're gonna fail this time for the world to see

All that I have left inside
Is a soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again, oh
In a brave society
Didn't end up, killing me
Scream with me, never again
Not again

All that I have left inside
Is a soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again, oh
In a brave society
Didn't end up killing me
Scream with me, never again, oh

For the countless souls who died
Their voices fill this night
Sing with me, never again
They aren't lost, you see
The truth will live in me
Believe me, never again</field>

Left me with nothing left to destroy

I'm becoming so paranoid
Everyone is so paranoid
In a moment you will see my other side
When I'm confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyll into Hyde

Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed
On the lies
He demands your sacrifice

I can barely control this feeling
Look at the murder in my eyes
I was never good at concealing
Violent thoughts have come to life
Horror will have a deeper meaning
You are the reason this began
Even now I can hear you screaming
There's only one thing left to destroy

And I'll no longer be paranoid
No more reason to be annoyed
In a moment you will see my other side
When I'm confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyll into Hyde

Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed

No pale reflection anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed

Come on, bring it, you don't see it

Beat down, till the victory is mine
Stand up and show me some pride
And now, are you ready?

I'm one with the warrior inside
My dominance can't be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield tonight
As I look upon you, through
The warrior's eyes now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory this time

I can't be told the compromises
From every toppled body lying at my feet
They know for minimal reminder
They will speak my name for eternity
I have no need of any guidance
I am a weapon powerful beyond belief
Seen through the warrior's eyes
I never need to question how to defeat you

You can't hide now
I am the warrior
So decide now
How they'll remember you
Do not hide now
Act like a warrior
Show your pride now
Solidify your place in time

I'm one with the warrior inside
My dominance can't be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield tonight
As I look upon you through
The warrior's eyes now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory this time

I'm one with the warrior inside
The evidence can't be denied
The entire world will stare
Into this battlefield tonight
As I stand before you with
The warrior's heart now
I can feel the strength that will
Ensure my victory this time</field>

What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?
Too many hours spent in darkness questioning
"How and why"?

I can't remember many moments in the light
This retribution has defiled me to no end
An execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why!

I was a boy who had to live his own way
I never fit into the model they had designed
I chose a path less taken
I stood with others who had often felt the same

We got stares from passersby
Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away
And when the three young boys died
They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie!

No hope in sight

I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!

Why was everybody so damn afraid?
They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime
And to justify their own faith
We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time

The three of us were attacked and disgraced
For many hours we were questioned and someone lied
One of us couldn't take it
His simple manner was manipulated in kind
Fear made him lie

I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!

Now I am terrified
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives

And why?
Can't anybody see through their disguise?
Only believe we didn't take their lives
And now the three of us have lost our lives

I often wonder why I sit and wait to die
What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?
Too many hours spent in darkness questioning
"How and why"?

I can't remember many moments in the light
This retribution has defiled me to no end

Far too many times
I've seen my dreams becoming violent
Every time that I see you
No matter how you try to define it
I have been broken too many times
Too much emotion too long confined has
Weakened the wall that protects you

Ease your mind, this moment will pass if you just
Leave it alone, leave it alone every time
My dysfunction is on your mind
When you find that you're at odds with your desire
Just leave it alone, leave it alone every time
My destruction is on your mind
Before you find that you have
Tested my resolve one too many times

I am a stranger, you know I've been
Pressed to the wall far too many times
Stop your behavior or you will find
My murderous nature surround you
Others have wandered over the line that
Awaken the monster too many times
Leave it unspoken and you will find an
End to the violence if you can

Ease your mind, this moment will pass if you just
Leave it alone, leave it alone every time

Just leave it alone, leave it alone every time

I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

Living after midnight
Rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' til the morning, then I'm gone
I'm gone

Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel
Loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal
Loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

Living after midnight
Rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' til the morning, then I'm gone
I'm gone

I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
Her body's coming
All night long

The air's electric, sparking power
Loaded, loaded
She's getting hotter by the hour
Loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

Living after midnight
Rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' til the morning, then I'm gone
I'm gone

Rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' til the morning, then I'm gone

Been watching for a long time, seeing the world join forces to the edge of calamity
How many of the wars have started over mankind's area we call religion?
Too many of our children have died in the never ending fight for territory

Are we born to violence?
Can we stop in time?
They say you will want to remain on your side
You'll be starting a war now if you cross that line
Turn around or face my reprisal for I have determined that this is mine

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Been hurting for a long time feeling my heart torn open from the lack of humanity
Insanity on both sides reaping the path that guarantees our own extinction
Hate added to the stockpile filling the world with enemies, a constant battle

In the face of violence, they omit their pride
They say you will want to remain on your side
You'll be starting a war now if you cross that line
Turn around or face my reprisal for I have determined that this is mine

Oh
Oh

You will want to remain on your side
You'll be starting a war now if you cross that line
Turn around and face my reprisal for I have determined that this is mine

We will not be broken this time
We will force the whole world to testify
Stand your ground or face our reprisal for we have determined that this is</field>
