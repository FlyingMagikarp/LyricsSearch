And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam In full glory reflected now shines in the stream 'Tis the star-spangled banner, oh long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a country should leave us no more Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave Oh, thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved home and the war's desolation Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation Then conquer we must when our cause it is just And this be our motto, "In God is our trust" And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave</field> &lt;br /&gt;

That's all that's going through my mind, the tape of you, the tape of you and her, the tape that brought me to tears, the tape that ruined my life, my world. I miss your smile and your touch, my love for you obviously didn't seem much, when I'm alone the hours go slow, but when I'm with you the time just goes. That's all that's going through my mind, the tape of you, the tape of you and her, the tape that brought me to tears, the tape that ruined my life, my world. I'm hurt, but I've learnt, I'm distraught, but I've been taught, on how, your love, is going to kill me slowly inside, ooohhh!

&lt;br /&gt;To see my family. &lt;br /&gt;Please Father let me go, &lt;br /&gt;As my mother sleeps. &lt;br /&gt;I don't know about days gone, &lt;br /&gt;But round here nobody lives twice. &lt;br /&gt;When your gone, your gone, without no bye, &lt;br /&gt;Because only a judge can give you life. &lt;br /&gt;This is my advice, &lt;br /&gt;Trust me, I nearly lost my life. &lt;br /&gt;3 weeks after I got this rhyme, &lt;br /&gt;It seems like I had too much wine. &lt;br /&gt;Which that I I didn't get one, &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was going to the ? booked for a set, &lt;br /&gt;Even though I didn't have a set one. &lt;br /&gt;Skream hit the decks, I was like check one. &lt;br /&gt;Put on a show, but it weren't my best one. &lt;br /&gt;Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination, &lt;br /&gt;Then I was off to the next one, &lt;br /&gt;20 minutes later I was on the M1, &lt;br /&gt;Tired. &lt;br /&gt;But I kept on going, &lt;br /&gt;Fell asleep without even knowing. &lt;br /&gt;No motion in my face, &lt;br /&gt;No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going. &lt;br /&gt;Woke up, &lt;br /&gt;Lorry, &lt;br /&gt;Flash, &lt;br /&gt;Panic, &lt;br /&gt;Break, &lt;br /&gt;Skid, &lt;br /&gt;Crash, &lt;br /&gt;Skidded, &lt;br /&gt;More, &lt;br /&gt;Bang, &lt;br /&gt;Smash, &lt;br /&gt;Out, &lt;br /&gt;Cold, &lt;br /&gt;Ribs, &lt;br /&gt;Cracked, &lt;br /&gt;Ouch. &lt;br /&gt;I was in so much pain, &lt;br /&gt;Crawled out of a Megan that now looked like a Mini, &lt;br /&gt;When I was still on the first lane. &lt;br /&gt;Baffled, didn't even know my name. &lt;br /&gt;Fainted, too much shock in my brain. &lt;br /&gt;Surrounded by paramedics and feds, &lt;br /&gt;Trying to get up but fainted again. &lt;br /&gt;I just want you to take a second, hear me out. &lt;br /&gt;Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out. &lt;br /&gt;I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared, &lt;br /&gt;Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go, &lt;br /&gt;To see my family, &lt;br /&gt;And keep it inside, &lt;br /&gt;Dry eyes, while my brother weeps. &lt;br /&gt;Save my soul, &lt;br /&gt;Please Father let me go. &lt;br /&gt;Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps. &lt;br /&gt;Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open, &lt;br /&gt;I can hear voices and my phone ringing. &lt;br /&gt;Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning, &lt;br /&gt;One of the worst situations I've been in. &lt;br /&gt;I can hear all of the angels singing. &lt;br /&gt;But when it stopped humming, &lt;br /&gt;My brain turned on, stared running. &lt;br /&gt;Still in pain, but it started numbing, &lt;br /&gt;the stone cold comeback I made was stunning. &lt;br /&gt;I still tried to do a few shows cuz I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming. &lt;br /&gt;But I was left with a permanent problem, &lt;br /&gt;Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside). &lt;br /&gt;Ever so cunning, &lt;br /&gt;6 weeks later, jogging and running. &lt;br /&gt;I used the first air kit like a drum set, &lt;br /&gt;Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming. &lt;br /&gt;Trust me, when it comes to mistakes, &lt;br /&gt;You can't afford to let one in. &lt;br /&gt;Never done dream for a while, &lt;br /&gt;The black plan was blocked, &lt;br /&gt;So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing. &lt;br /&gt;They say tomorrow never dies, &lt;br /&gt;But he forgot to tell you 'you can'. &lt;br /&gt;You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang, &lt;br /&gt;But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam. &lt;br /&gt;You can try beg for another, &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show, &lt;br /&gt;Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother', &lt;br /&gt;Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner. &lt;br /&gt;I just want you to take a second, hear me out. &lt;br /&gt;Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out. &lt;br /&gt;I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared. &lt;br /&gt;Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go, &lt;br /&gt;To see my family. &lt;br /&gt;And

kids bare wheels plus racists full of &lt;br /&gt;hatred in your own plant , &lt;br /&gt;3 jobs in a day , &lt;br /&gt;rest in life in you working but you were never stressed free &lt;br /&gt;just locked in a cage slaving , they said they were &lt;br /&gt;gold in the pavements but you came and saw the road to &lt;br /&gt;amazement , broke your heart but still you were prone &lt;br /&gt;to last and your sorrow was over fast &lt;br /&gt;I hope your listening right , &lt;br /&gt;I still think of you every Sunday no &lt;br /&gt;one can top your chicken and rice, &lt;br /&gt;even through the darkness times &lt;br /&gt;you held us all up cause your vision was &lt;br /&gt;bright I knew your strength was your wisdom inside , &lt;br /&gt;you never let anyone see your heartache &lt;br /&gt;you just got on with it , &lt;br /&gt;anyone tells me that they knew you said &lt;br /&gt;you were beautiful and your words you would stand &lt;br /&gt;strong with it &lt;br /&gt;Cause they were like warmth on a winter &lt;br /&gt;night but I was just too young to go on with it and &lt;br /&gt;there something's I could try to do but it's an &lt;br /&gt;impossible task for me to even try and say

know I never want to be alone ohh &lt;br /&gt;I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and &lt;br /&gt;will you think of me up there, can I say goodbye to you? &lt;br /&gt;and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face &lt;br /&gt;or feel the chill of your warm embrace. &lt;br /&gt;Can I say goodbye to you ohh &lt;br /&gt;I think you phoney I was younger with the knowledge of &lt;br /&gt;things that I know now I would be by your side when you &lt;br /&gt;needed me instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out' &lt;br /&gt;standing in a road with the gangs that I know now , &lt;br /&gt;everyone's missing you loads , Jessica's grown up , &lt;br /&gt;warren Lauren and Alex are fine and imp living with &lt;br /&gt;hope , it's been a while since I've seen V and the &lt;br

/&gt;never been funny , in my heart the only one that dissed &lt;br /&gt;me was Sonia she took all our inheritance money , left &lt;br /&gt;the rest of us to pick up the pieces &lt;br /&gt;i never forgive &lt;br /&gt;the way she betrayed us , there ent a big enough reason &lt;br /&gt;before I sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing , &lt;br /&gt;but I guess that everyone's different or should I say &lt;br /&gt;no one's perfect she had happiness in front of her but &lt;br /&gt;chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing  &lt;br /&gt;Since you &lt;br /&gt;gone the foundations crumbled so building it back up is &lt;br /&gt;my next step I got all the bricks and the cement but &lt;br /&gt;it's hard when it's done I don't know what to expect, &lt;br /&gt;so give me the strength that I need to perform this &lt;br /&gt;task make it right I must do and I ask cause I trust &lt;br /&gt;you it goes way beyond a song when I say I love you. &lt;br /&gt;And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign I &lt;br /&gt;hope this pain will heal in time &lt;br /&gt;you know I never want to be alone ohh &lt;br /&gt;I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and &lt;br /&gt;will you think of me up there, can I say goodbye to you? &lt;br /&gt;And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face &lt;br /&gt;or feel the chill of your warm embrace. &lt;br /&gt;Can I say goodbye to you? &lt;br /&gt;It's just for now so I should hush I'll never get &lt;br /&gt;enough I'll see you when I see you but I miss you &lt;br /&gt;ohh how I miss you, It's just for now so I should hush &lt;br /&gt;I'll never get enough I'll see you when I see you but I &lt;br /&gt;miss you ohh how I miss you. &lt;br /&gt;there ain't enough words to describe how sorry I am for &lt;br /&gt;the pain that I caused sorry for when I stuck up my &lt;br /&gt;own blood we were young he said I was rape and he broad &lt;br /&gt;and for the day police came to the door , I'm sorry for &lt;br /&gt;being such a bad youth stealing from your purse and &lt;br /&gt;making you mourn , I never been able to say this &lt;br /&gt;before cause I've was so inconsiderate you love me &lt;br /&gt;unconditionally and I took advantage of it like a idiot &lt;br /&gt;not seeing the pure soul that I was living with I &lt;br /&gt;really hope that you can forgive me , you going away &lt;br /&gt;was a punishment but I won't let go I'm holding you &lt;br /&gt;with me but I still fight the emotions within me &lt;br /&gt;You see the stars as the cold wind greets the air and &lt;br /&gt;will you think of me up there can I say goodbye to you? &lt;br /&gt;And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face &lt;br /&gt;feel the chill of your warm embrace &lt;br /&gt;Can I say goodbye to you? &lt;br /&gt;I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and &lt;br /&gt;will you think of me up there? &lt;br /&gt;Can I say goodbye to you? &lt;br /&gt;And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face or &lt;br /&gt;feel

/&gt;Because plagiarism is sin &lt;br /&gt;Watch how I sit on the rhythm &lt;br /&gt;Prisoner with a vision &lt;br /&gt;Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism &lt;br /&gt;Thought you knew but you didn't &lt;br /&gt;So perk your ears up and listen &lt;br /&gt;Studio is a system &lt;br /&gt;And you could say that I'm driven &lt;br /&gt;And now it's on to the next saga &lt;br /&gt;We drink the best lager &lt;br /&gt;I never tried to win you &lt;br /&gt;Over like your stepfather &lt;br /&gt;I do my own thing now, and get respect after &lt;br /&gt;And I'm avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter &lt;br /&gt;For four years I never had a place to stay &lt;br /&gt;But it's safe to say that it kept me &lt;br /&gt;Grounded like a paperweight &lt;br /&gt;At 16 years old I moved out of my home &lt;br /&gt;I was Macey Gray I tried to say goodbye and &lt;br /&gt;I choked &lt;br /&gt;And we've been sleeping at the subway station &lt;br /&gt;Sleeping with a movie star &lt;br /&gt;And adding to the population &lt;br /&gt;Not my imagination, I don't want to relax &lt;br /&gt;But would it hurt your reputation &lt;br /&gt;If I put it on wax? &lt;br /&gt;So take it back now &lt;br /&gt;C'mon and take it back love &lt;br /&gt;C'mon and take it back for us &lt;br /&gt;Don't you fade into the back love &lt;br /&gt;Ooh &lt;br /&gt;Take it back with the rhythm and blues &lt;br /&gt;And my back pack I'll be singing the news &lt;br /&gt;Trying to act like Jack Black when &lt;br /&gt;I'm running the school &lt;br /&gt;I'll make a beat with my feet &lt;br /&gt;By just hitting a loop &lt;br /&gt;Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes &lt;br /&gt;And keeping the truth through the vocal booth &lt;br /&gt;Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit &lt;br /&gt;They try and take aim like Beckham &lt;br /&gt;When he goes to shoot &lt;br /&gt;But then again that's what they're supposed to do &lt;br /&gt;And I'm supposed to be calm &lt;br /&gt;I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm &lt;br /&gt;Whispering everything that happens is from now on &lt;br /&gt;I'll be willing to start again at the end of the song &lt;br /&gt;Still they claim that I handled it wrong &lt;br /&gt;But then I never had an enemy, except for Nme &lt;br /&gt;But I'll be selling twice as many copies as &lt;br /&gt;The magazines will ever be &lt;br /&gt;With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees &lt;br /&gt;And healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree &lt;br /&gt;Singing for the masses &lt;br /&gt;Rubber dinghy rapids &lt;br /&gt;Keep this rapping a habit &lt;br /&gt;And keep on passioning magic &lt;br /&gt;I'm battling with respect &lt;br /&gt;I don't know if I'll have it &lt;br /&gt;This songs from the heart &lt;br /&gt;Grabbing the plaque &lt;br /&gt;I'll take it back now &lt;br /&gt;C'mon and take it back love &lt;br /&gt;C'mon and take it back for us &lt;br /&gt;Don't you fade into the back love &lt;br /&gt;Ooh &lt;br /&gt;Take it back now &lt;br /&gt;I don't ever want to be perfect &lt;br /&gt;Cause I'm a singer that you &lt;br /&gt;Never want to see shirtless &lt;br /&gt;I accept the fact that &lt;br /&gt;Someone has to win worst-dressed &lt;br /&gt;Taking my first steps into the scene &lt;br /&gt;Giving me focus &lt;br /&gt;Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton &lt;br /&gt;Considering a name change &lt;br /&gt;Thinking it was hopeless &lt;br /&gt;Rhyming over recordings &lt;br /&gt;Avoiding tradition &lt;br /&gt;Cause every day some lyrics &lt;br /&gt;And a melody can be written &lt;br /&gt;Now absence can make your heart ache &lt;br /&gt;But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly &lt;br /&gt;I need to let my liver be &lt;br /&gt;And I say it again &lt;br /&gt;Living life on the edge &lt;br /&gt;With a closed hand full of friends &lt;br /&gt;Is good advice from a man &lt;br /&gt;Who took his life on the road with me &lt;br /&gt;And I hope to see him blowing up globally &lt;br /&gt;Cause that's how it's supposed to be &lt;br /&gt;Screaming out vocally &lt;br /&gt;Might seem totally impossible &lt;br /&gt;Achieving life's dreams &lt;br /&gt;But, but I just write schemes &lt;br /&gt;I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans &lt;br /&gt;Madison Square Garden is where I might be &lt;br /&gt;But more likely &lt;br /&gt;You'll find me in the back &lt;br /&gt;Room of a dive bar with my mates &lt;br /&gt;Having a pint with Mcdaid &lt;br /&gt;Discussing records we made &lt;br /&gt;And every single second knowing &lt;br /&gt;That we'll never betray &lt;br /&gt;The way we were raised &lt;br /&gt;Remembering our background &lt;br /&gt;Sat down &lt;br /&gt;That's how we put it out &lt;br /&gt;It's time to take it back now &lt;br /&gt;C'mon and take it back love &lt;br /&gt;C'mon and take it back for us &lt;br /&gt;Don't you fade into the back love &lt;br /&gt;Ooh &lt;br /&gt;C'mon and take it back love &lt;br /&gt;C'mon and take it back for us &lt;br /&gt;Don't you fade into the

backtrack &lt;br /&gt;So casually &lt;br /&gt;You're practically my family &lt;br /&gt;If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be &lt;br /&gt;But tragically our love just lost the will to live

miss you this much &lt;br /&gt;And at the time we'd just go, so sue me &lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm not the man that you need &lt;br /&gt;Ever since you went to uni &lt;br /&gt;I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack &lt;br /&gt;Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad &lt;br /&gt;But when I broke the industry &lt;br /&gt;That's when I broke your heart &lt;br /&gt;I was supposed to chart and celebrate &lt;br /&gt;But good things are over fast &lt;br /&gt;I know it's hard to deal with and see this &lt;br /&gt;I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features &lt;br /&gt;Then I turn the music off &lt;br /&gt;And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus &lt;br /&gt;I never really want to believe this &lt;br /&gt;Got advice from my dad and he &lt;br /&gt;Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need &lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm unaware of it &lt;br /&gt;Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with &lt;br /&gt;I don't love you baby &lt;br

didn't exist &lt;br /&gt;In 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid &lt;br /&gt;I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink &lt;br /&gt;And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and its &lt;br /&gt;Just hiding my misguiding thoughts &lt;br /&gt;That I'm trying to kill &lt;br /&gt;And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27 &lt;br /&gt;I'll die from a thrill &lt;br /&gt;Go down in history as just a wasted talent &lt;br /&gt;Can I face the challenge &lt;br /&gt;Or did I make a mistake erasing &lt;br /&gt;It's only therapy &lt;br /&gt;My thoughts just get ahead of me &lt;br

be there by now &lt;br /&gt;And maybe I can let myself down oh &lt;br /&gt;And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground &lt;br /&gt;Keep looking around to make sure I'm not he only one to

the same to me &lt;br /&gt;Would you make me a cup of tea &lt;br /&gt;To open my eyes in the right way &lt;br /&gt;And I know you love Shrek &lt;br /&gt;'Cause we've watched it twelve times &lt;br

you hate the smell of smoke &lt;br /&gt;You always tryna get me to stop &lt;br /&gt;But you drink as much as me &lt;br /&gt;And I get drunk a lot &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I'll take you to the beach &lt;br /&gt;And walk along the sand And I'll &lt;br /&gt;Make you a heart pendant &lt;br /&gt;With a pebble held in my hand &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I'll carve it like a necklace &lt;br /&gt;So the heart falls where your chest is &lt;br /&gt;And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be &lt;br /&gt;And rests peacefully &lt;br /&gt;So you just need to breathe &lt;br /&gt;To feel my heart against yours now &lt;br /&gt;Against yours now &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or maybe I'm

Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine "'Cause real will recognize real" is what my father says And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close. Five o'clock with lights off Interview with a vampire Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying 'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game It's time to wage war Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes, Be wide awake just like your snorting lines Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by [Chorus] I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be, The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... The times I'm living in lately. I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out Deliver the raps how I flow I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die. Never die. Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze, Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do, Driven young gentlemen I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true! I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got, I keep my pupils engaged, Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.
