Promise me the moon and the stars in the sky 
Or bring me roses just to show me you love me 
That ain't gonna win this heart of mine 
All the diamonds you can buy won't impress me 
Pretty words ain't gonna prove your love 
I need more than just tokens of affection 
I'm not asking for too much now baby 
I don't need no fancy cars 
Just need something from the heart, , , whoa 
I need real emotion 
Feel, gotta feel it inside 
Give me that real emotion 
'Coz I need some 
Need to feel some tonight 
Give me a love that's genuine 
Real emotion, real emotion 
Show me something that my heart can believe in 
Imitation love don't mean a thing 
Baby it's gonna be the real thing or nothing 
Show me what's it gonna be now baby 
I'm not asking much from you 
Just a love that's deep and true, , , whoa 
I need real emotion 
Feel, gotta feel it inside 
Give me that real emotion 
'Coz I need some 
Need to feel some tonight 
Give me a love that's genuine 
Real emotion, real emotion 
Not a cheap imitation of love 
I need something that's real 
I can feel in my heart baby 
I've been waiting so long 
For a love, for a love, for a love that's strong 
I don't need no fancy cars 
Just need something from the heart, , , whoa.</field>

The faith of a child 
By a part of my heart 
I was reckless and wild 
I am recovering 
The hope that I lost 
The part of my soul 
That paid the cost 
Little by little, day by day 
One step at a time 
Shake off the devil, oh 
Take back my peace of mind 
I am recovering 
Anxiety addict 
A broken perfectionist 
Somewhat erratic 
I am recovering 
A constant regretter 
Hold it against her 
At least till forever 
Little by little, day by day 
One step at a time 
Shake off the devil, oh 
Take back my peace of mind 
Hold me 
As I fall apart, baby 
Hold me 
Here in the dark 
Cause the old me 
Run just as far as I could from my heart 
Well, I'm going back to the start 
Little by little, day by day 
One step at a time 
Shake off the devil, oh 
Take back my piece of mind 
Tell him I love him, yeah 
Take back my piece of mind</field>

Wear your party dress 
Maybe I was just an innocent 
But I confess 
I never even knew the song 
The orchestra was playing 
See the cuties in their party clothes 
Oh it's getting warm 
Off the shoulder cut into the hip 
Like a uniform 
Did you think I'd want to tow the line 
Well now the line is broken 
(Chorus) 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
You said you're such a pretty thing 
You could make a mark 
I'll teach you all the steps you'll need 
Guide you through the dark 
Suddenly I tought I knew the song 
The orchestra was playing 
(Repeat Chorus) 
See how they follow 
You say jump 
They jump 
You say turn 
They turn 
Look back in sorrow 
I won't be there.</field>

Put you in the dark 
I was cold and lonely 
Doubt, it can close you in 
Build the walls within 
I let fear control me 
I let go, didn't know 
Where the answer would be 
Right in front of you 
Right in front of me 
We were looking for it somehow 
Somewhere we couldn't see 
But the love was always there 
It's been around us everywhere 
I had to fall to finally see 
That you were right in front of me 
Ummm 
Faith, it can lift you up 
And if you got enough 
To reach a new beginning 
Love, can withstand strong 
In the final hour 
We'll find the joy in living 
Don't let go 
Cause that I know 
Pretty soon you will see 
Right in front of you 
Right in front of me 
We were looking for it somehow 
Somewhere we couldn't see 
But the love was always there 
It's been around us everywhere 
I had to fall to finally see 
That you were right in front of me 
You are my tomorrow 
There's safety in your arms 
Where you'll go I'll follow 
'Cause you're the world where I belong 
Right in front of you 
In front of me 
Somehow we couldn't see 
Right in front of you 
I had to fall to finally see 
Right in front of you 
Right in front of me 
We were looking for it somehow 
Somewhere we couldn't see 
But the love was always there 
Surrounding us everywhere 
I had to fall to finally see 
Right in front of you 
Right in front of me 
We were looking for it somehow 
Somewhere we couldn't see 
But the love was always there 
Surrounding us everywhere 
I had to fall to finally see 
That you were right in front of me 
I finally see.. 
yeah 
I had to fall to finally see</field>

What if you were meant to be the one 
I could hide a million years and try to believe 
That any time the girl in mind will come and rescue me 
'Cause you're the fire, you're the one 
But you'll never see the sun 
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one 
And I could call it many names 
But it's myself I need to blame 
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one 
In the end you've got a friend for lifetime 
Truly there to truly care for you 
I know you cry a million tears so I want you to know 
That a pretty face can take you places, you don't wanna go 
'Cause you're the fire, you're the one 
But you'll never see the sun 
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one 
And I could call it many names 
But it's myself I need to blame 
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one 
So in the end it all depends on whether you'll find 
A warm embrace when I replace the one you had in mind... 
'Cause you're the fire, you're the one 
But you will never see the sun 
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one 
And I could call it many names 
But it's myself I need to blame 
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one

I had a rag doll 
Only doll I've ever owned 
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll 
But only now my love has grown 
And it gets stronger, in every way 
And it gets deeper, let me say 
And it gets higher, day by day 
And do I love you my oh my 
Yeh river deep mountain high 
If I lost you would I cry 
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby 
When you were a young boy 
Did you have a puppy 
That always followed you around 
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy 
No I'll never let you down 
Cause it grows stronger, like a river flows 
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows 
And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows 
And do I love you my oh my 
Yeh river deep, mountain high 
If I lost you would I cry 
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby 
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring 
And I love you baby just like Tina loves to sing 
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet 
And I love you baby, river deep mountain high 
Oh yeah you've gotta believe me 
River Deep, Mountain High 
Do I love you my oh my, oh baby 
River deep, mountain high 
If I lost you would I cry 
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby.</field>

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark 
Finally I can see you crystal clear 
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare 
See how I leave with every piece of you 
Don't underestimate the things that I will do 
There's a fire starting in my heart 
Reaching a fever pitch 
And it's bringing me out the dark 
The scars of your love remind me of us 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
The scars of your love they leave me breathless 
I can't help feeling 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it 
To the beat 
Baby I have no story to be told 
But I've heard one of you 
And I'm gonna make your head burn 
Think of me in the depths of your despair 
Making a home down there 
As mine sure won't be shared 
The scars of your love remind me of us 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
The scars of your love they leave me breathless 
I can't help feeling 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it 
To the beat 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it 
With the beating 
Throw your soul through every open door 
Count your blessings to find what you look for 
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold 
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow 
We could've had it all 
We could've had it all 
It all, it all it all, 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it 
To the beat 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it

Right here with you is where I'll stay 
Everything in this world 
Every voice in the night 
Every little thing of beauty 
Comes shining thru in your eyes 
And all that is you becomes part of me too 
'Cause all you do seduces me 
And if I should die tomorrow 
I'd go down with a smile on my face 
I thank God I've ever known you

Don't wanna fight it'd be in vain 
So in vain 
I can run but I can't hide 
It's because I'm livin' in the shadow of love 
To me you are the only one that I dream of 
Cause I'm livin' in the shadow of love 
Your love surrounds me it's everywhere 
It is my shelter,it is my air 
A moon eclipsing a burning sun 
Making shade just for me 
For you i'd wait forever babee 
And a day 
To be there if your love 
Should come 
My way 
I can run but I can't hide 
It's because I'm livin' in the shadow of love 
To me you are the only one that I dream of 
Cause I'm livin' in the shadow of love 
Too many nights too many days 
I've hidden from the sun 
And though i've tried to breakaway 
Your hold on me's just too strong 
I'm livin' in the shadow of love 
I can run but I can't hide 
It's because I'm livin' in the shadow of love 
To me you are the only one that I dream of 
Cause I'm livin' in the shadow of love 
To me you are the only one 
I dream of 
Cause I'm livin' in the shadow of love 
The shadow of love 
The shadow of love 
I can run but I can't hide 
It's because I'm livin' in the shadow of love 
To me you are the only one that I dream of 
Cause I'm livin' in the shadow of love

Well you're not alone 
As you race through this life what you 
Keep to yourself 
Can turn you to stone

Come on and give a little bit 
Try to forgive a little bit

But they can't point me to the light 
He can't be that hard to find 
After all we're so bright 
I don't know if tomorrow has a day 
I don't know if the rays will shine my way 
All I know is that I'm standing in a place where 
My future looks like the skies of L.A., skies of L.A. 
Skies of L.A. 
I don't know if my body can take much more 
We're in the land of the richest riches 
But my mind seems so poor 
Everyone has a finger 
But they can't point me to the light 
It shouldn't be that hard to find 
After all we're so bright 
I see so many visions 
But everyone seems out of sight 
This is total neglection 
Skies of L.A. 
My future looks like the skies of L.A.

I don't believe your love if you don't wanna go, no 
That's not the way it is when somebody loves somebody 
Eh, eh, eh, eh 
When somebody loves somebody 
Wait, I'm hearing every word that you say 
You wonder if he made a mistake 
It's written all over your face 
You know it's too late 
We've already fallen in love 
Tell me, it is asking too much 
For you to stick it out when it's tough 
Is it ever enough? 
When somebody loves somebody 
That's the way it's supposed to be 
'Cause she knows nobody else 
Would put up with your games, oh 
I don't believe your love if you don't wanna go, no 
That's not the way it is when somebody loves somebody 
Eh, eh, eh, eh 
When somebody loves somebody 
Some people live their lives 
Never believing in love 
I don't want that for us 
When somebody loves somebody 
That's the way it's supposed to be 
'Cause she knows nobody else 
Would put up with your games, oh 
I don't believe your love if you don't wanna go, no 
That's not the way it is when somebody loves somebody 
I don't believe your love if you don't wanna go, no 
That's not the way it is when somebody loves somebody 
Eh, eh, eh, eh (somebody, somebody) 
Eh, eh, eh, eh (somebody, somebody) 
Eh, eh, eh, eh (somebody, somebody) 
Yeah

Disney - Somewhere Out There 
 
Somewhere out there, 
Beneath the pale moonlight, 
Someone's thinking of me, 
And loving me tonight. 
Somewhere out there, 
Someone's saying a prayer, 
That we'll find one another, 
In that big somewhere out there. 
And even though I know how very far apart we are, 
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star, 
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby, 
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky! 
Somewhere out there, 
If love can see us through, 
Then we'll be together, 
Somewhere out there, 
Out where dreams, 
Come true...</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Forgive me for the things 
That I never said to you 
Forgive me for not knowing 
The right words to say, to prove 
That I will always be 
Devoted to you and me 
And if you can't feel that in my love 
Then I'm sorry for not giving you enough 
But I'm not sorry for my love 
I'm not sorry for my touch 
The way I made your hands 
Tremble and my heart rush 
I would do it all again 
Wouldn't take back a thing, no 
'Cause with you I've lived 
A thousand lives in one 
And I could never be 
I could never be 
Sorry for love 
Well, maybe there've been times 
That I let you down 
Looking back on all those moments 
I know that I should have found 
The best of me for you 
And now I will promise to 
And if you don't see that in my eyes 
Then I'll be 
Sorry for the rest of my life 
But I'm not sorry for my love 
I'm not sorry for my touch 
The way I made your hands 
Tremble and my heart rush 
I would do it all again 
Wouldn't take back a thing, no 
Cause with you I've lived 
A thousand lives in one 
But I could never be 
I could never be 
Sorry for love 
And we all make mistakes 
No matter how hard we try 
But hearts can only break 
When sorry comes all around 
Ooh, when sorry comes around 
I'm not sorry... 
For my love 
For my touch 
I would do it all again 
I wouldn't take back a thing 
Because with you I've lived 
A thousand lives into one 
But I could never be 
I could never be 
I could never be 
I could never be</field>

You can stay in my arms now 
And I know I can make you believe

I walk but you can run through fire 
I search for reasons and baby you inspire 
But I, I know somebody hurt you 
And I know you really need a friend 
Well you can take my hand 
Gonna stand by your side now 
Lemme kiss all your tears away 
You can stay in my arms now 
And I know I can make you believe 
Again 
When you feel like you can't go on 
Don't you know you'll never walk alone 
You live in me 
Gonna stand by your side now 
Lemme kiss all your tears away 
You can stay in my arms now 
And I know I can make you believe

I'm gonna stand (oawww) 
Stand by your side (oooooo) 
Kiss all your tears (I wanna stand) 
Away tonight (I wanna stand by your side) 
I'm gonna stand (gonna look in your eyes) 
Stand by your side

No getting down on your knees 
Trying to get what ya need 
It's a good situation

I thought the truth would set you free 
Surprise surprise 
It isn't all as it seems 
But who knew you'd wake up from your dreams 
If I told you myself 
Could've saved you the hell 
Now look who's sorry 
God I'm so sorry 
It was never the right time 
I guess it's do or die 
Just when you think you've got me figured out 
Just when you think you know me well 
Baby you've barely even broke the ice 
My river runs wide and you're not in sight 
But you're closer than you were tonight 
I'm a chamaleon 
And every spots hiding my scars 
But I will survive 
Cause I'll only let you in 
When I can be sure of who you are 
You can call it a game 
But it's me playing safe 
God that's so sorry 
I'm just sorry 
What can I say 
It's hard trying to stay alive 
Just when you think you've got me figured out 
Just when you think you know me well 
Baby you've barely even broke the ice 
My river runs wide and you're not in sight 
But you're closer than you were tonight 
And It's in your eyes 
That it's all or nothing 
What I can't disguise 
Is that you're on to something 
if I let myself go 
Will you still want me 
Will I be enough 
The fear of that haunts me 
Cause what if you walk away 
Just when you think you've got me figured out 
Just when you think you know me well 
Baby you've barely even broke the ice 
My river runs wide and you're not not in sight 
But you're closer than you were tonight

Don't know much about your world but 
Don't want to be alone tonight 
On this planet they call earth 
You don't know about my past and 
I don't have the future figured out 
And maybe this is going too fast 
And maybe it's not meant to last 
But what do you say to taking chances? 
What do you say to jumping off the edge 
And never knowing if there's solid ground below 
Or a hand to hold 
Or hell to pay 
What do you say 
What do you say 
I just wanna start again 
Maybe you could show me how to try 
Maybe you could take me in 
Somewhere underneath your skin 
What do you say to taking chances 
What do you say to jumping off the edge 
And never knowing if there's solid ground below 
Or a hand to hold 
Or hell to pay 
What do you say 
What do you say 
And I've had my heart beaten down 
But I always come back for more, yeah 
There's nothing like love to pull you up 
When you're lying down on the floor there 
So talk to me, talk to me like lovers do 
Yeah walk with me, walk with me like lovers do 
Like lovers do 
What do you say to taking chances 
What do you say to jumping off the edge 
And never knowing if there's solid ground below

Tell him that the sun and moon 
Rise in his eyes 
Reach out to him 
And whisper 
Tender words so soft and sweet 
Hold him close to feel his heart beat 
Love will be the gift you give yourself 
 
Touch him 
With the gentleness you feel inside 
Your love can't be denied 
The truth will set you free 
You'll have what's mean to be 
All in time you'll see 
 
I love him 
Of that much I can be sure 
I don't think I could endure 
If I let him walk away 
When I have so much to say 
I'll 
Love is light that surely glows 
In the hearts of those who know 
It's a steady flame that grows 
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show 
Tonight love will assume its place 
This memory time cannot erase 
Blind faith will lead love where it has to go 
Never let him go.</field>

then baby you've got it rough 
So if your brain gets so confused 
And your TV is blowing a fuse 
Come on over, you've got nothing to lose 
That's just the woman in me 
That's just the woman in me 
That's just the woman in me 
Working on you 
Cause I need, I need a man to love 
Cause I need, I need a man to love 
Respect me, protect me, rule over, drool over 
Run away to ivory towers, buy me a bunch of flowers and love That's the woman in me baby

            <field name="lyrics">Chestnuts roasting on an open fire 
Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir 
And folks dressed up like Eskimos 
Everybody knows 
A turkey and some mistletoe 
Help to make the season bright 
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight 
They know that Santa's on his way 
He's loaded lots of toys 
And goodies on his sleigh 
And every mother's child is gonna spy 
To see if reindeer really know 
How to fly 
And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
To kids from one to ninety two 
Although it's been said 
Many times many ways 
Merry Christmas to you 
And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
To kids from one to ninety two 
Although it's been said 
Many times many ways 
Merry Christmas to you 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas.</field>

Paint my soul to be with you 
I'll sketch your lips in shaded tones 
Draw your mouth to my own 
I'll draw your arms around my waist 
Then all doubt I shall erase 
I'll paint the rain that softly lands on your wind-blown hair 
I'll trace a hand to wipe out your tears 
A look to calm your fears 
A silhouette of dark and light 
While we hold each other oh so tight 
I'll paint a sun to warm your heart 
Swearing that we'll never part 
That's the colour of my love 
I'll paint the truth 
Show how I feel 
Try to make you completely real 
I'll use a brush so light and fine 
To draw you close and make you mine 
I'll paint a sun to warm your heart 
Swearing that we'll never part 
That's the colour of my love 
I'll draw the years all passing by 
So much to learn so much to try 
And with this ring our lives will start 
Swearing that we'll never part 
I offer what you cannot buy.</field>

I'm different now, these days 
Now the greatest reward 
Is the light in your eyes 
The sound of your voice 
And the touch of your hand 
You made me who I am 
You trusted me to grow 
I gave my heart to show 
There's nothing else I cherish more 
I stand by you for sure 
Now the greatest reward 
Is the love that I can give 
I'm here for you now 
For as long as I live 
You made me who I am 
So suddenly, it's clear to me 
Things change 
Our future lies in here and now 
We made it through somehow 
Now the greatest reward

I'm here for you now 
For as long as I live 
You made me who I am.</field>

Don't let me be the last

Don't you keep it to yourself for my protection

Don't let me be the last 
Like you're never gonna let me go 
Baby, all I ask 
Don't let me be the last to know 
You know how all friends will talk 
A secret's hard to keep 
But this girl she says you're seeing 
Sure sounds a lot like me 
Still it's not for me to say 
If what I heard was true 
And I won't let myself believe a word 
Till I hear it from you

It's the season to be jolly 
And be thankful for all that we have

Put up in the anticipation

'Til it's time for Christmas day 
Oh and God bless us everyone 
The good and the bad 
The happy; the sad 
Oh and God bless us everyone 
Here's to family and friends 
It's good to be here again 
On the streets there's children laughing 
People smile as they are passing 
Christmas time is here, our waiting is done 
Wishing it could last forever 
Not just twelve days in December 
Through the year let's try to remember 
That special way 
That everyone feels 
It's the magic of Christmas day 
Oh and God bless us everyone 
The good and the bad 
The happy; the sad 
Oh and God bless us everyone 
Here's to family and friends 
It's good to be here again 
So fill your heart with love and joy 
And through the eyes of girls and boys 
Share their wonder, live through their joy 
It's easy to do, just open your heart 
The spirit will come to you 
Oh and God bless us everyone 
The good and the bad 
The happy; the sad 
Oh and God bless us everyone

Of lovers sleeping tight 
Are rolling like thunder now 
As I look in your eyes 
I hold on to your body 
And feel each move you make 
Your voice is warm and tender 
A love that I could not forsake 
'Cause I am your lady 
And you are my man 
Whenever you reach for me 
I'll do all that I can 
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms 
When the world outside's too 
Much to take 
That all ends when I'm with you 
Even though there may be times 
It seems I'm far away 
Never wonder where I am 
'Cause I am always by your side 
'Cause I am your lady 
And you are my man 
Whenever you reach for me 
I'll do all that I can 
We're heading for something 
Somewhere I've never been 
Sometimes I am frightened 
But I'm ready to learn 
Of the power of love 
The sound of your heart beating 
Made it clear 
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on 
Is light years away 
'Cause I am your lady 
And you are my man 
Whenever you reach for me 
I`m going do all that I can 
We're heading for something 
Somewhere I've never been 
Sometimes I am frightened 
But I'm ready to learn

To stand apart from all the rest

Your mind will take you far 
The rest is just pure heart

They bring the gift of hope and inspiration

The courage to embrace your fear 
No matter where you are 
To reach for your own star 
To realaise the power of the dream(2x)</field>

Round the corner now 
Outside the dawn is breaking

one more hour burns 
so scared of his return 
that i can't sleep tonight 
in this hospital light 
what you call a tragedy 
is just another day to me 
for my heart beats with fear 
as his footsteps draw near 
the life i meant to lead 
won't slip away from me 
cuz this time is the last time 
i know that my eyes have seen too much 
this nightmare is not fair 
and i've had enough 
you break me, and as i bleed 
you just say you're sorry 
you call this love 
but this time your lies 
are not enough 
this time 
there's nothing left of this 
your whispered words and empty threats 
rip away the seams of what i though this would be 
the last thread has come undone 
to reveal what i've become 
another victim of a poison love 
i've been afraid for years 
but that won't keep me here 
cuz this time is the last time 
i know that my eyes have seen too much 
this nightmare is not fair 
and i've had enough 
you break me 
to just say you're sorry 
you call this love 
but this time your lies 
are not enough 
this time 
what remains a mystery 
you can not have the best of me 
so i'm taking back 
all you took from me 
cuz this time is the last time 
i know that my eyes have seen too much 
this nightmare is not fair 
and i've had enough 
you break me 
to just say you're sorry 
you call this love 
but this time your lies 
are not enough 
this time

Need me, like you did before 
Touch me once again 
And remember when 
There was no one that you wanted more 
Don't go, you know you'll break my heart 
She won't, love you like I will 
I'm the one who'll stay 
When she walks away 
And you know I'll be standing here still 
I'll be waiting for you 
Here inside my heart 
I'm the one who wants to love you more 
Can't you see I can give you 
Everything you need 
Let me be the one to love you more 
See me, as if you never knew 
Hold me, so you can't let go 
Just believe in me 
I will make you see 
All the things that your heart needs to know 
I'll be waiting for you 
Here inside my heart 
I'm the one who wants to love you more 
Can't you see I can give you 
Everything you need 
Let me be the one to love you more 
And some way, all the love that we had can be saved 
Whatever it takes, we'll find a way 
Believe in me 
I will make you see 
All the things that your heart needs to know 
I'll be waiting for you 
Here inside my heart 
I'm the one who wants to love you more 
Can't you see I can give you

            <field name="lyrics">I woke up this morning baby 
The blues was pouring out of me 
Cent fois ces mots je les ai dits 
Ces mots que d'autres avaient écrits 
De toute ma voix, de toute mon âme 
With all the soul that I can 
Le blues comme on me l'a appris 
I woke up this morning baby 
Mais ce matin-là j'ai compris 
La peine aux longs champs de coton 
J'imaginais de mon cocon 
Les coups, le sang, les temps boueux 
J'avais mal en fermant les yeux 
His baby's far away 
J'ai des pardons, j'ai des prières 
Mais l'blues c'est pas des phrases en l'air 
I woke up this morning baby 
Mais ce matin t'as vraiment froid 
Tu comprends du fond de ta poitrine 
Tous les blues sont écrits pour toi 
Oh oh 
{musique} 
Oh I feel the blues in me 
Nobody knows how I really feel 
Nobody knows nobody cares 
Les mots te brûlent un par un comme s'ils 
Comme s'ils t'appartiennent enfin 
Ces blues étaient les tiens 
De toute ma voix, toute mon âme 
With all the soul that I can 
Le blues qu'on n'm'a jamais appris 
I woke up this morning 
The blues was pouring out of me 
Nobody knows (x2) 
Nobody cares 
Nobody, nobody.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">All the girl could want was a little attention 
From a man who's strong and not to mention 
Kiss and caressing her all night long 
But all that boy wants is to hit and run off 
He and his friends-they sit and they laugh 
Going around talking 'bout the girls they used in the past 
What goes around, comes around, go go! 
U gotta get what's comin' to u 
For all the bad, bad things u do to your 
Lady, treat her like a lady 
U'll make a good girl crazy 
If u don't treat her like a lady 
Lady, treat her like a lady 
U'll make a good girl crazy 
If u don't treat her like a lady 
What goes around, comes around, go go! 
She stopped going to church, she don't wanna go to school 
She left with anger when he took her for a fool 
Even though her friends tell her to just keep cool 
Didn't tell her from the start just what he had planned 
Right in her face with another woman 
Now she's in jail for attacking her man 
U gotta get what's comin' to u 
For all the bad, bad things u do to your 
Lady, treat her like a lady 
U'll make a good girl crazy 
If u don't treat her like a lady 
Lady, treat her like a lady 
U'll make a good girl crazy 
If u don't treat her like a lady 
What goes around, comes around, go go! 
Treat her like a lady 
Oh baby! 
Treat her like a lady, baby 
Treat her like a lady, baby 
Treat her like a lady, ohhhhh 
Treat her like a lady! 
What goes around, comes around, go go! 
What goes around, comes around, go go! 
Somebody, somebody blocked the hit and ran, yes 
Tell it to her straight, she can take the truth 
Don't lead her on and on and leave her confused 
Anyone would rather be alone than be used 
Don't sit and think you'll hurt her feelings 
She only wants to know just what the deal is.</field>

I see him clearly caressing my hair 
I believe that this trip would worth the detour

Like a big gift from life 
To wake myself up someday close from him 
A love for me 
Like a sun after the rain 
To warm me up someday close from him 
J'ecris mon histoire au tournant de sa main 
Je me retrouve au tournant de son coeur 
Et peut-etre bien qu'un jour au tournant du chemin 
Je trouverai au tournant du bonheur 
I'm writting my story at the turning of his hand 
I find myself at the edge of his heart

I'll find at the turning some happiness

But it's only just begun 
Your whole life is there right 
Right in front of you 
Life's a story that is all twisted and turned 
All that matters is the lessons we learn 
'Cause we're all unfinished songs waiting for 
The best part to come along (hey, hey) 
And we're all pictures that's drawn 
We can be anything we want (hey, hey) 
Now is your time it's your life 
No one's living it but you 
In your hands is your chance 
To live the life you choose 
Life's like music there's so much still unsung 
Make it magic there's so much still to come 
'Cause we're all unfinished songs waiting for 
The best part to come along (hey, hey) 
And we're all pictures that's drawn 
We can be anything we want (hey, hey) 
You can write a song and write the story 
Living all of this life in all its glory 
Take the time to make the time to make each moment count 
It's your life, it's your call 
Grab the chance, have it all 
'Cause we're all unfinished songs waiting for 
The best part to come along (hey, hey) 
And we're all pictures that's drawn 
We can be anything we want (hey, hey) 
'Cause we're all unfinished songs waiting for

We stick together we're never apart 
Everybody knows who we are 
Because we are one we do it in unison 
We come together and stronger we are 
Just when the world can tear us apart 
We go on as one we do it in unison 
Gleam of an eye, flash of a smile 
Never too shy playin' ever so wild 
Here we are I', relying on no one else 
But you and I we've come so far 
No on else could ever steal away what we 
Confide who wants to know? 
Rockin' as one there's no time to stop 
I know what we've got we do it in unison

You're letting this die 
Without the blink of an eye 
You say that you need time 
I say you'll be fine 
If you would only see

You became imprisoned 
Can I reopen the door 
You say it doesn't matter 
Then tell me what does 
And why that isn't what 
You've been thinking of 
You say it's never easy 
Then tell me what was 
Is it never worth the pain 
Could you believe it was 
When life keeps living 
That's what life keeps giving 
To us 
Once we were one mind 
Drifting in one time 
And ever true 
We were friends 
But something is gone from my 
Picture of this life 
If we could only see 
Like we did before 
We became imprisoned 
Can I reopen the door 
You say it doesn't matter 
Then tell me what does 
And why that isn't what

You say it's never easy 
Then tell me what was 
Is it never worth the pain

The hope has vanished from your eyes 
You were my faith and one truth 
There's every reason to get through

            <field name="lyrics">Seven days has gone so fast 
I really thought the pain would pass 
It's been nearly an hour 
Since I thought of you 
But you're not answering the phone 
I'd settle for a busy tone 
At least by that I'd know that you're okay 
A guy like you ain't meant to go away, no 
Now you're gone 
There's nothing else I want 
Now that it's over 
There's nothing else I want 
What have I done 
Looks like I was wrong 
Is everything really meant to change 
I guess we're like water and a flame 
Water and a flame 
I'm tired of this empty house 
I need a drink to get me out 
A couple more 'til I forget your name 
I saw a guy that looked like you 
I did not know quite what to do 
It took a power of will to break my stare 
I realized what I wanted wasn't there 
Now you're gone 
There's nothing else I want 
Now that it's over 
There's nothing else I want 
What have I done 
Looks like I was wrong 
Is everything really meant to change 
I guess we're like water and a flame 
Water and a flame 
And if you see me coming 
Look away, look away 
And if your mind is made up 
Look away, I will look away 
And, if you're worried about me 
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am 
Now you're gone 
There's nothing else I want 
Now that it's over 
There's nothing else I want 
What have I done 
Looks like I was wrong

Trying to find a way to get through to you 
Oh you don't know how hard I try 
And I try and I try 
What do I gotta do 
Do I gotta get water from the moon 
Is that what I gotta do 
To make you love me 
Make you love me 
Do I gotta turn the sand into the sea 
Is that what you want from me 
I've done everything that I can do 
But get water from the moon 
I've reached high up in the sky 
Tryin' to steal the stars 
Oh to win your heart 
But even that's not enough 
And I've searched every book I know 
Just to find the words 
Oh to touch your world and get some love out of you 
I've already given all I can give 
And I don't know what's left to try 
And I try and I try 
What do I gotta do 
Do I gotta get water from the moon, , , 
Love me, how do I make you love me 
How do I make you see that I'm going out of my mind

When I fall in love, 
it will be forever, 
or I'll never fall in love. 
In a restless world, 
like this is 
love is ended before its begun 
and too many moonlight kisses 
seem to cool in the warmth of the sun. 
 
(Celine Dion) 
When I give my heart 
it will be completely 
or I'll never give my heart (oo let me give my heart) 
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too 
(I feel that way too) 
is when I'll fall in love 
(I'll fall in love) 
(both) 
with you 
 
(both) 
When I fall in love, 
it will be forever 
or I'll never fall in love 
(oo I'll never never fall in love) 
in a restless world like this is 
love is ended before its begun 
and too many moonlight kisses 
seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

Keeping me warm night and day 
Miles and miles of empty space in between us 
A telephone can't take the place of your smile 
But you know I wont be traveling for ever 
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do 
When I need you 
Just close my eyes and I'm with you 
And all that I so want to give you babe 
It's only a heartbeat away 
It's not easy when the road is your driver 
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear 
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime 
It's cold out but hold out and do like I do 
Oh I need you 
When I need love 
I hold out my hands and I touch love

You're everything, I never knew 
I always wanted, baby 
I've been warned, so many times

Can't run - can't hide - can't say no 
When the wrong one loves you right

When the wrong one loves you right 
Getting tired, of hearing that 
You're dangerous, but they won't stop 
Until I leave, they won't believe 
That being with you won't break my heart 
So worried 'bout, the road ahead 
They can't see that, you're my best friend 
They're never gonna take me away from you 
There's nothing they can do 
I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it

When the wrong one loves you right 
How can I walk away 
When the feeling's so strong 
I know you're where I belong 
They say I let my heart 
Make up my mind 
That's why I'll never say goodbye 
I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it

            <field name="lyrics">So much to believe in 
We were lost in time 
Everything I needed 
I feel into your eyes 
Always thought of keepin 
Your heart next to mine 
But now that seems so far away 
Don't know how love could leave 
Without a trace 
Where do silent hearts go? 
Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Candle in the water, drifting helplessly 
Hiding from the thunder 
Come and rescue me 
Driven by hunger 
Of the endless dream 
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold 
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know 
Where do silent hearts go? 
Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Then one touch overcomes the silence 
Love still survives 
Two hearts needing one another 
Give me wings to fly 
Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
I've got someone to give my heart to 
Feel it getting stronger and stronger 
And stronger 
Hearts are made to last 
Till the end of time</field>

            <field name="lyrics">If ever a boy stood on the moon 
All the heavens would call them angels 'round 
Stop the tears from troubled sky's....from 
Falling...falling...falling. 
If ever the river could whisper your name, 
Would the choices you made still be the same? 
Like a flower that dies from angry rain, 
Why do we hurt ourselves? 
Where is the love that lets the sunlight in to start again? 
The love that sees no color lines? 
Life begins with love, 
So spread your wings and fly, 
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered, 
A thousand dreams that we can still believe. 
If ever a boy stood on the moon, 
Carrying all of his treasures from the stars 
To a rainbow which leads to where we are. 
Together we'd chase the sun. 
Where is the love that lifts my brother's voice to the skies? 
The love that answers a mother's cry? 
Life begins with love, 
So spread your wings and fly, 
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered. 
A thousand dreams that we can still believe. 
A boy stood on the moon 
The ancient souls can still discover 
A thousand dreams that we can still believe 
That we can still believe 
We can still believe.</field>

For my love, my life, my being 
So secure and so damn sure my 
Heart would surely die without you 
I tried to swallow my pride 
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside 
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go 
Tell me 
Why 
Why when I looked in your eyes 
I felt the trust start to die 
why oh why 
When I still love you 
It's so hard to say goodbye 
How can you tell me it was nothing 
Cause you took away everything I dreamed in 
Just a night and I held you so tight 
When you know you were sleeping in my bed 
I tried to swallow my pride 
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside 
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go 
Tell me 
Why 
Why when I looked in your eyes 
I felt my heart start to cry 
why oh why 
When I saw you with the other girl 
why oh why, 
Why when I looked in your eyes 
Cause I felt the trust start to die 
Why oh why 
When I still love you 
It's so hard to say goodbye 
Solo: 
Should I quietly leave through the door 
Or maybe pretend the way things were once before 
When I met you 
I'll never forget you, so 
Why 
Why when I looked in your eyes 
I felt my heart start to cry 
My o my 
When I saw you with the other girl 
Ooh why, 
Why did you have to lie 
Cause I felt the trust start to die 
Why o why 
When I still love you</field>

I long 4 u 2 talk 2 me like u did 
That night in the restaurant 
U spoke of love so openly 
And again and again u promised me

But now u're gone 
With this voice 
I thee call 
Sometimes I catch myself 
Calling your name 
When u're not there at all 
Please tell me what I did wrong 
Why must I hear your voice inside my head 
All day and all night long 
It's not fair 
(Bridge) (Ad-lib) 
With these arms 
I held u 
When u told me u were dying 
I had less courage it's true 
And u wrote every day 
Writing 'bout the things 
That we could do 
When your pain went away 
But all that went away was u 
With this tear 
I thee want 
I long 4 u 2 talk 2 me like u did

That we're soaring 
That we're floating up so high 
'cause you and i were meant to fly 
Sailng like a bird 
High on the wings of love 
Take me higher than 
All the stars above 
I'm burnin',yearnin',gently turnin' round and round 
I'm always rising up 
I never want to come back down 
You and i were meant to fly

She kept the motor clean, 
Was the best damn woman that I ever seen, 
She had sightless eyes, 
Telling me no lies, 
Knockin' me out with those American thighs, 
Taking more than her share, 
Had me fighting for air, 
She told me to come, but I was already there, 
Cause the walls started shaking, 
The earth was quaking, 
My mind was aching, 
And we were makin' it, 
and you... 
Shook me all night long, 
Yeah you, shook me all night long. 
Walking double time on the seduction line, 
She was one of a kind, 
She's just mine all mine, 
Wanted no applause, 
It's just another cause, 
Made a meal out of me, and come back for more, 
Had to cool me down, 
To take another round, 
Back in the ring to take another swing, 
But the walls start shaking, 
Earth was quaking, 
My mind was aching, 
And we were making it, 
and you... 
Shook me all night long, 
Yeah you, shook me all night long, 
Knockin' me out, yeah you 
Shook me all night long, 
You really shook me, yeah you, 
Shook me all night long, 
Yeah, you shook me 
Well you shook me... 
You, shook me all night long 
Yeah you,Shook me all night long, 
You really got me, and you 
Shook me all night long 
You really got me, and you 
Shook me all night long 
Yeah you shook me, 
Yeah you shook me,

There's a secret that I wanna whisper in your ear 
I've waited so long, too long 
But I can't deny it anymore it's just too strong 
It's a special kind of feelin' 
Something to believe in, Oh yeah 
So lay back, and let it flow 
Then just open up your heart and let your feelings go 
I said "Hey man, Yo man" 
Well it's really not that difficult to understand 
That it's me that you've been seein' 
Baby when you're dreamin', at night 
So let your walls come down 
And you'll feel my emotion 
I will shelter you 
From a tear or an ocean 
Whenever your hope is gone 
I'll give you strength to carry on 
In the darkness of the night 
I will be your light 
I'll give you something to hold on to 
When you can't find your way 
Like a fire burning bright 
I will be your light 
So relax, we'll take it slow 
I wouldn't think you'd really have a better place to go 
I said "Hey man, Yo Man" 
Why don't you move a little closer here and take my hand 
Are you feelin' what I'm feelin' 
I know I must be dreamin', oh yeah 
But sometimes life can come 
To build a wall in between us 
Don't let it get you down 
Whoever said love was an easy thing 
Whenever your hope is gone 
I'll give you strength to carry on 
In the darkness of the night 
I will be your light 
I'll give you something to hold on to 
When you can't find your way 
Like a fire burning bright 
I will be your light 
I will be your light 
Whenever you need a friend 
Just come over to me baby 
Baby Baby Baby 
So let your walls come down 
And you'll feel my emotion 
I will shelter you 
From a tear or an ocean 
Whenever your hope is gone 
I'll give your strength to carry on 
In the darkness of the night 
I will be your light 
I'll give you something to hold on to 
When you can't find your way 
Like a fire burning bright 
I will be your light 
Whenever your hope is gone 
I'll give your strength to carry on 
In the darkness of the night 
I will be your light 
Light, shining bright, baby 
I'll be the one who holds you, baby 
I'll be the one who loves you, baby 
Be the one who holds you, loves you,.</field>

Ziggy, I call him Ziggy 
I'm so hot for him 
He's not at all like all the rest 
But he's held out and he's the best 
Even if I know 
He would never go with me 
Ziggy, they call him Ziggy 
I'm so hot for him 
And when I saw him that first day 
I went and gave myself away 
Oh so indiscreet 
Oh but he was sweet to me 
Four a.m 
he's here by my side 
Talking, laughing and making friends 
Making fun of me too 
He can do whatever he wants 
I don't mind, but he pretends 
Not to see what I go through 
Ziggy, my crazy Ziggy 
I get weak for him 
He lives a life that I can't share 
I don't know why but I know where 
Oh it breaks my heart 
Knowing I'm not part of him 
Why won't he try anything new? 
I would be his very best 
And his first, in many ways 
Oh if I were one of his boys 
Thin and languid and self-possessed 
So in demand nowadays - oh 
Ziggy, my crazy Ziggy 
I get weak for him 
He lives a life that I can't share 
I don't know why but I know where 
Oh it breaks my heart 
Knowing I'm not part of him

            <field name="lyrics">I learned the truth at seventeen That love was meant for beauty queens And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles Who married young and then retired The valentines I never knew The Friday night charades of youth Were spent on one more beautiful At seventeen I learned the truth And those of us with ravaged faces Lacking in the social graces Desperately remained at home Inventing lovers on the phone Who called to say "Come dance with me" And murmured vague obscenities It isn't all it seems at seventeen A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs Whose name I never could pronounce Said, "Pity, please, the ones who serve They only get what they deserve. The rich relationed hometown queen Marries into what she needs With a guarantee of company And haven for the elderly" So remember those who win the game Lose the love they sought to gain In debentures of quality And dubious integrity The small town eyes will gape at you In dull surprise when payment due Exceeds accounts received at seventeen To those of us who knew the pain Of valentines that never came And those whose names were never called When choosing sides for basketball It was long ago and far away The world was younger than today When dreams were all they gave for free To ugly ducking girls like me We all play the game and when we dare We cheat ourselves at solitaire Inventing lovers on the phone Repenting other lives unknown That call and say, "Come dance with me" And murmur vague obscenities At ugly girls like me at seventeen</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Waking up alone In a room that still reminds me My heart has got to learn to forget Starting on my own With every breath I'm getting stronger This is not the time for regret Cause I don't need to hang on to heartbreak When there's so much of life left to live Love is on the way On wings of angels I know its true, I feel it coming through Love is on the way Time is turning the pages I don't know when But love will find me again I am not afraid Of the mystery of tomorrow I have found the faith deep within There's a promise I have made There's a dream I'm gonna follow There's another chance to begin And it's coming as sure as the heavens I can feel it right here in my heart Love is on the way On wings of angels I know its true, I feel it coming through Love is on the way Time is turning the pages I don't know when But love will find me again (Oh I know, I know down deep down in my heart I know that) Love is on the way On wings of angels I know its true, I feel it coming through Love is on the way Time is turning the pages I don't know when But love will find me again I don't know when But love will find me again</field>

O night when Christ was born O night divine! O night, o night divine! And in His Name, all oppression shall cease Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we Let all within us praise his holy name Christ is the Lord! Their name forever praise we Noel, Noel O night, o night Divine Noel, Noel O night, o night Divine Noel, Noel O night, o holy Divine</field>

Like a daydream When the feeling is so deep between the man and the woman When it's the truth when you feel it more And the crave hits deeper</field>

You keep pushing me aside 
And I can't break through 
There's no talking to you 
It's so sad that you're leaving 
It takes time to believe it 
But after all is said and done 
You're gonna be the lonely one 
Do you believe in life after love? 
I can feel something inside me say 
I really don't think you're strong enough 
Do you believe in life after love? 
I can feel something inside me say 
I really don't think you're strong enough 
What am I supposed to do 
Sit around and wait for you 
Well I can't do that 
And there's no turning back 
I need time to move on 
I need a love to feel strong 
'Cause I've got time to think it through 
And maybe I'm too good for you 
Do you believe in life after love? 
I can feel something inside me say 
I really don't think you're strong enough 
Do you believe in life after love? 
I can feel something inside me say 
I really don't think you're strong enough 
Well I know that I'll get through this

I don't need you anymore 
No I don't need you anymore

Strong enough and I quit crying 
Long enough now I'm strong enough 
To know you gotta go 
Chorus 2: 
There's no more to say 
So save your breath and walk away 
No matter what I hear you say 
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go 
So you feel misunderstood 
Baby have I got news for you 
On being used, I could write the book 
But you don't wanna hear about it 
'Cause I've been losing sleep 
And you've been going cheap 
And she ain't worth half of me it's true 
I'm telling you, that

Come hell or waters high 
You'll never see me cry 
This is our last goodbye, it's true 
I'm telling you, now

Friday night and the lights are low 
Looking out for a place to go 
Where they play the right music 
Getting in the swing 
You come to look for a King 
Anybody could be that guy 
Night is young and the music's high 
With a bit of rock music 
Everything is fine 
You're in the mood for a dance 
And when you get the chance 
You are the Dancing Queen 
Young and sweet, only seventeen 
Dancing Queen 
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah! 
You can dance 
You can jive 
Having the time of your life 
See that girl 
Watch that scene 
Diggin' the Dancing Queen 
You're a teaser, you turn them on 
Leave them burning and then you're gone 
Looking out for another, anyone will do 
You're in the mood for a dance 
And when you get the chance 
You are the Dancing Queen 
Young and sweet, only seventeen

Love's like a knife it can cut deep inside 
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes 
I didn't really mean to hurt you 
I didn't wanna see you go 
I know I made you cry, but baby..

And you'd love me, love me, like you used to do

My world was shattered, I was torn apart 
Like someone took a knife 
and drove it deep in my heart 
You walked out that door 
I swear that I didn't care 
But I lost everything darlin then and there 
Too strong to tell you I was sorry 
Too proud to tell you I was wrong 
I know I was blind, but darlin...

I guess it must be fate 
We've tried it on our own 
But deep inside we've known 
We'd be back to set things straight 
I still remember when 
Your kiss was so brand new 
Every memory repeats 
Every step I take retreats 
Every journey always brings me back to you 
After all the stops and starts 
We keep coming back to these two hearts 
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall 
And after all that we've been through 
It all comes down to me and you 
I guess it's meant to be 
Forever you and me 
After all 
When love is truly right 
This time it's truly right 
It lives from year to year 
It changes as it grows 
And oh the way it grows 
But it never disappears 
After all the stops and starts 
We keep coming back to these two hearts 
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall 
And after all that we've been through 
It all comes down to me and you 
I guess it's meant to be 
Forever you and me 
After all 
Always just beyond my touch 
Though I needed you so much 
After all what else is living for 
After all the stops and starts 
We keep coming back to these two hearts 
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall 
And after all that we've been through 
It all comes down to me and you 
I guess it's meant to be

And I'm watching the late show 
In my flat, all alone 
How I hate to spend the evening on my own 
Autumn winds 
Blowing outside the window 
As I look around the room 
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom 
There's not a soul out there 
No one to hear my prayer 
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight 
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away 
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight 
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day 
Movie stars 
Find the end of the rainbow 
With a fortune to win 
It's so different from the world I'm living in 
Tired of TV 
I open the window 
And I gaze into the night 
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight 
There's not a soul out there 
No one to hear my prayer 
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight 
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away 
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight 
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day 
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight 
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight 
There's not a soul out there

I remember, long ago, another starry night like this 
In the firelight, Fernando 
You were humming to yourself 
And softly strumming your guitar 
I could hear the distant drums 
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar 
They were closer now, Fernando 
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally 
I was so afraid, Fernando 
We were young and full of life 
And none of us prepared to die 
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns 
And cannons almost made me cry 
There was something in the air that night 
The stars were bright, Fernando 
They were shining there for you and me 
For liberty, Fernando 
Though we never thought that we could lose 
There's no regret 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
Now we're old and grey, Fernando 
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand 
Can you hear the drums, Fernando? 
Do you still recall the frightful night 
We crossed the Rio Grande? 
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were 
To fight for freedom in this land 
There was something in the air that night 
The stars were bright, Fernando 
They were shining there for you and me 
For liberty, Fernando 
Though I never thought that we could lose 
There's no regret 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
There was something in the air that night 
The stars were bright, Fernando 
They were shining there for you and me 
For liberty, Fernando 
Though I never thought that we could lose 
There's no regret 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
Yes, if I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando</field>

I have run through the fields 
Only to be with you 
Only to be with you 
I have run, I have crawled 
I have scaled these city walls 
These city walls 
Only to be with you 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
I have kissed honey lips 
Felt the healing fingertips 
It burned like fire 
This burning desire 
I have spoken with the tongue of angels 
I have held the hand of the devil 
It was warm in the night 
I was cold as a stone 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
I believe in the Kingdom Come 
Then all the colours will bleed into one 
Bleed into one 
But yes I'm still running 
You broke the bonds 
And you loosed the chains 
Carried the cross and 
All my shame 
All my shame 
You know I believe it 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I've been calling your name 
Got that lonely feeling again 
Calling out your name 
Do you hear me? Do you want me? 
Baby it's all or nothing now 
I don't wanna run and I can't walk out 
You're breaking my heart if you leave me now 
Don't wanna wait for ever 
Who do you think you're fooling 
Who do you think you're fooling 
Baby it's all or nothing, 
Baby it's all or nothing now 
I've been trying to get to your heart 
But I'm chasing shadows 
We keep falling further apart 
So near and you're so far 
Do you care now? Do you know how? 
Sometimes when you touch me 
I just can't help myself 
Desire makes me weak 
Do you care now? 
Do you know how?</field>

Just a small town dude with a big city attitude 
Honey are ya lookin' for some trouble tonight 
Alright 
You think you're so bad, drive the women folk wild 
Shoot 'em all dowm with the flash of your pearly smile 
Honey but you met your match tonight 
Oh that's right 
You think you'll knock me off my feet 
Till I'm flat on the floor 
Till my heart is crying indian and I'm beggin' for more 
So come on baby, come on baby 
Come on baby show me what that loaded gun is for 
CHORUS 
If you can give it, I can take it 
Cause if this heart is gonna break 
It's gonna take a lot to break it 
I know tonight 
Somebody's gonna win the fight 
So if you're so tough 
Come on and prove it 
Your heart is down for the count 
And you know you're gonna lose it 
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames 
Just like Jesse James 
You're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide 
Well you ain't so strong 
Won't be long till your hands are tied 
Tonight I'm gonna take you in dead or alive 
That's right 
You break the laws of love in the name of desire 
Take ten steps back, cause I'm ready baby aim and fire 
baby there's no way you're gonna run tonight 
Ooh that's right 
Well you've had your way with love 
But it's the end of the day 
Now a team of wild horses couldn't drag your heart away 
So Come on baby, come on baby 
Come on baby you know there ain't nothing left to say 
CHORUS 
You think you'll knock me off my feet 
Till I'm flat on the floor 
Till my heart is crying indian and I'm beggin for more 
So come on baby, come on baby 
Come on baby, Come on 
CHORUS 
Im gonna shoot ya down Jesse James</field>

Barely holding on 
But there's just something so strong 
Somewhere inside me

And I've been pushed way past the point of breaking 
But I can take it 
I'll be back 
Back on my feet 
This is far from over 
You haven't seen the last of me 
You haven't seen the last of me

I won't stay around 
But I'm gonna stand my ground 
You're not gonna stop me

You don't know who I am 
Don't count me out so fast

You haven't seen the last of me 
There will be no fade out 
This is not the end 
I'm down now 
But I'll be standing tall again 
Times are hard but 
I was built tough 
I'm gonna show you all what I'm made of 
I've been brought down to my knees 
And I've been pushed way past the point of breaking 
But I can take it 
I'll be back 
Back on my feet 
This is far from over 
I am far from over 
You haven't seen the last of me 
No no 
I'm not going nowhere 
I'm staying right here 
Oh no 
You won't see me begging 
I'm not taking my bow

You would always win the fight

Bang bang, that awful sound 
Bang bang, my baby shot me down 
Seasons came and changed the time 
I grew up, I called you mine 
You would always laugh and say 
Remember when we used to play 
Bang bang, I shot you down 
Bang bang, you hit the ground 
Bang bang, that awful sound 
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down 
Music played and people sang 
Just for me the church bells rang 
After echoes from a gun 
We both vowed that we'd be one 
Now you're gone I don't know why 
Sometimes I cry 
You didn't say goodbye 
You didn't take the time to lie 
Bang bang, you shot me down 
Bang bang, I hit the ground 
Bang bang, that awful sound 
Bang bang, my baby shot me down</field>

Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts 
I'm young, I know 
but even so 
I know a thing or two 
Ooo honey, I learned from you 
I really learned a lot 
I really learned a lot 
Love is like a stove 
It burns you when it's hot 
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts 
Some fools rave, of happiness 
Of blissfulness, togetherness 
Oh, some fools, 
They fool themselves, I guess 
They're not fooling me 
And I know it isn't true 
God, I know it isn't true 
Love is just a lie and it's 
Made to make you blue 
Love hurts, (ooooo) love hurts

I cannot tell you of my love 
Here is my story 
I'll sing a love song 
Sing it for you alone 
Though you're a thousand miles away 
Love's feeling so strong 
Come to me, baby 
Don't keep me waiting 
Another night without you here 
And I'll go crazy 
There is no other, there is no other 
No other love can take your place 
Or match the beauty of your face 
I'll keep on singing till the day 
I carry you away 
With my love song, with my love song 
Dov'è l'amore 
Dov'è l'amore 
Where are you now, my love? 
I need you here to hold me 
Whispered so sweetly 
Feel my heart beating 
I need to hold you in my arms 
I want you near me 
Come to me baby 
Don't keep me waiting 
Another night without you here 
And I'll go crazy 
There is no other, there is no other 
No other love can take your place 
Or match the beauty of your face

Sunny thank you for the facts from A to Z 
Somehow I was torn like a wind blown sail 
Then our love was borned when you held my hand

Or what was said to make you cry 
I hope that you can see 
You are the greatest thing to me and when 
I don't wanna waste another day without telling you 
Baby, you're great and I can see written on your face 
something you can make 
Cause when I'm with you I, I fall apart 
To hear your permanently broken heart 
Baby, you're the greatest to me 
No, no matter what, what, what 
I don't know why you hurt inside 
Or what was said to make you cry 
I hope that you can see 
You are the greatest thing to me and when 
You feel like you're not enough 
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up 
I hope that you can see 
You are the greatest, greatest thing to me 
When all your thoughts are dark 
And insecure 
I'll build a light cause baby, I'm sure 
Loving you makes me better right 
Take on your shadows 
And make sure that you will shine 
Cause when I'm with you I, I fall apart 
To hear your permanently broken heart 
Baby, you're the greatest to me 
No, no matter what, what, what 
I don't know why you hurt inside 
Or what was said to make you cry 
I hope that you can see 
You are the greatest thing to me and when 
You feel like you're not enough 
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up 
I hope that you can see 
You are the greatest, greatest thing to me 
The the greatest thing, greatest thing, greatest thing to me 
C'mon and pick myself so nobody else will listen me 
The the greatest thing, greatest thing, greatest thing to me 
C'mon and pick myself so nobody else will listen me 
Cause when I'm with you I, I fall apart 
To hear your permanently broken heart 
Baby, you're the greatest to me

            <field name="lyrics">Beneath the white fire of the moon 
Love's wings are broken all too soon 
We never learn 
Hurt together, hurt alone 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone? 
We turn the wheel and break the chain 
Put steel to steel and laugh at pain 
We're dreamers in castles made of sand 
The road to Eden's overgrown 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone? 
Look at the headlines: 
"Big crowd at the crazy house 
Long queue for the joker's shoes 
Ten rounds in the ring with love" 
Do you lose and win, or win and lose? 
Sweet rain like mercy in the night 
(Lay me down, wash away the sorrow) 
Caress my soul and set it right 
(Lay me down, show me your tomorrow) 
Summer tears, winter and the moment's flown 
Dont' you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone? 
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone 
Get the picture? 
"No room for the innocent 
Peak season in lonely town 
Knocked out of the ring by love" 
Are you down and up, or up and down? 
I ask the river for a sign 
(In a dream, we go on together) 
How long is love supposed to shine? 
(In a dream, diamonds are forever) 
But you and I, we're hurt together, hurt alone 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone? 
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone 
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected) 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone? 
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected) 
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone 
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected) 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone? 
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected) 
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone (fade)</field>

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end 
Look at me now, will I ever learn? 
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control 
There's a fire within my soul 
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring 
One more look and I forget everything 
Woah-oh oh-oh 
Mamma mia, here I go again 
My my, how can I resist you? 
Mamma mia, does it show again? 
My my, just how much I've missed you 
Yes, I've been brokenhearted 
Blue since the day we parted 
Why, why did I ever let you go? 
Mamma mia, now I really know 
My my, I could never let you go 
I've been angry and sad about things that you do 
I can't count all the times 
That I've told you we're through 
And when you go, when you slam the door 
I think you know that you won't be away too long 
You know that I'm not that strong 
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring 
One more look and I forget everything 
Woah-oh oh-oh 
Mamma mia, here I go again 
My my, how can I resist you? 
Mamma mia, does it show again? 
My my, just how much I've missed you 
Yes, I've been brokenhearted 
Blue since the day we parted 
Why, why did I ever let you go? 
Mamma mia, even if I say 
Bye bye, leave me now or never 
Mamma mia, it's a game we play 
Bye bye doesn't mean forever 
Mamma mia, here I go again 
My my, how can I resist you? 
Mamma mia, does it show again? 
My my, just how much I've missed you 
Yes, I've been brokenhearted

they seem so hard to find 
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind 
Whatever happened to our love 
I wish I understood 
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good 
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me 
SOS 
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me 
SOS 
When you're gone 
How can I even try to go on 
When you're gone 
Though I try how can I carry on 
You seemed so far away though you were standing near 
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear 
I really tried to make it out 
I wish I understood 
What happened to our love, it used to be so good 
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me

Watching the ships roll in,

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay, 
Watching the tide roll away, ouh, 
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay, 
Wasting time. 
I left my home in Georgia, 
Headed for the Frisco bay 
I have nothing to live for, 
Look like nothings gonna come my way, 
So I'm just go sit on the dock of the bay 
Watching the tide roll away, 
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay, 
Wasting time 
Look like nothings gonna change, 
Everything still remain the same, 
I can't do what ten people tell me to do, 
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes, 
Sittin' here resting my bones, 
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yes, 
Two thousand miles I roam 
Just to make this dock my home 
Now I'm just go sit at the dock of the bay 
Watching the tide roll away, ooh

So your heart's gotta go there

For the broken hearted, battle scarred

And this is a song for the lonely 
When your dreams won't come true 
Can you hear this prayer 
Cause someone's there for you 
Well love don't need a reason 
She can pick you up or leave you bleeding 
I've seen a strong man cry 
I know the reason why 
We all forgive 
We all forget 
And just keep believing 
This is a song for the lonely

Too many dead ends

Do I pack my bags or dare switch 
Just sold my car, I sold it for junk 
I can't pay my rent so I take the bus 
It's the first time 
I been in such a cold place 
Where the temperature is 88 
[Chorus:] 
88 degrees 
Lord it's so hot, so damn hot 
Trying to make a deal 
But somehow I'm stopped 
Cause the pace is so heavy 
Maybe it cause the weather 
Yeah, yeah 
I'm set in the mood for you 
You remember the time 
You remember the time 
Yes, I'm the deal for a whole lot of dough 
I'm hoping success turns ten years to gold 
Finally I'm happening and I set in the press 
You ask me what it's like to be famous 
[Chorus] 
Remember the time 
Cause when in your face 
You could start to get angry 
Is it me or just this place 
One thing is for sure 
You got to work so hard 
Sure feels this ain't no place 
For broken hearts 
Just ask me tomorrow if you love you

Stuck in L.A., ain't go no friends

He'd always win, 
Till his mom would break it up 
And call him in 
He was tough he was hard 
But he was kind 
and he was love, cause guys like him 
Were hard to find 
Ride, I like to ride again some day 
I think I still know how to play

As the ceiling flew away. 
When we called out for another drink, 
The waiter brought a tray. 
And so it was that later, 
As the miller told his tale, 
That her face at first just ghostly, 
Turned a whiter shade of pale. 
She said there is no reason, 
And the truth is plain to see 
That I wandered through my playing cards, 
And would not let her be 
One of sixteen vestal virgins 
Who were leaving for the coast. 
And although my eyes were open, 
They might just as well have been closed. 
And so it was later, 
As the miller told his tale,

Every step I take retreats 
Every journey always brings me back to you

Two angels who've been rescued from the fall 
And after all that we've been through

Forever you and me 
After all 
When love is truly right 
This time it's truly right 
It lives from year to year 
It changes as it grows 
And oh the way it grows 
But it never disappears

Is it just for the moment we live? 
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie? 
Are we meant to take more than we give or are we meant to be kind? 
And if only fools are kind, Alfie, 
then I guess it's wise to be cruel. 
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie, 
what will you lend on an old golden rule? 
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie, 
I know there's something much more, 
something even non-believers can believe in. 
I believe in love, Alfie. 
Without true love we just exist, Alfie. 
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie. 
When you walk let your heart lead the way 
and you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie.</field>

I must stand 
Even when I'm running 
And it feels

I need to awaken from 
I believe 
When it hurts 
We must keep trying

And I need 
Like a river needs the rain 
There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave 
I just wanna breathe again 
Like a summer day I need to feel the heat again 
I only wanna keep the stone from rolling 
I only wanna learn to feel the rain 
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling 
I only wanna learn to freeze the flame 
I know i'll be alive again 
I wanna be alive again 
Here's the night 
Where's the stars 
'coz I need some guiding 
And it cuts 
Like a knife 
As I watch you walk away 
There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave 
I just wanna to live again 
Like a stormy rain I need to feel the heat again 
 
I only wanna keep the stone from rolling 
I only wanna learn to feel the rain 
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling 
I only wanna learn to freeze the flame 
I know i'll be alive again 
I wanna be alive again 
I wanna be alive again 
Coz I did my best 
Baby who'd have guessed 
That i've failed the test 
'coz when love ain't best 
And it's laid to rest 
It can leave a mess 
I only wanna keep the stone from rolling 
I only wanna learn to feel the rain 
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling 
I only wanna learn to freeze the flame 
I know i'll be alive again 
I wanna be alive again</field>

A heart has a mind of it's own 
Sometimes 
I can tell myself 
That I'm better off being alone 
Sometimes 
But this time 
I can't hide from the thought of it 
It's around every corner I turn 
Right there in lights 
In black and white 
Staring at me 
CHORUS: 
It's all because of you 
That I feel this way 
All because of you 
That my heart wants to break 
If every other love can be forgotten 
It's all because of you 
All because of you 
Tonight 
I can't feel any magic inside 
Tonight 
'Cause I can't reach out for the stars 
Lookin' up at the moon on my own 
No signs of life, no nothing's right 
Since you've been gone 
Chorus 
All because of you 
I can't sleep at night 
Oh no I can't sleep at night 
And there ain't no rest 
Living second best 
Without your love 
You don't know what it's like 
To feel this way 
All because of you 
That my heart wants to break 
If every other love can be forgotten 
It's all because of you.</field>

oh honey, all i ever need is you. 
Winters come and they go, 
and we watch the melting snow. 
sure as summer follows spring 
all the things you do. 
give me a reaon to build my world around you. 
Some men follow rainbows i am told. 
some men search for silver some for gold. 
i have found my treasure in your soul honey 
all i ever need is you. 
without love i'd never find a way, 
through ups and downs of every single day. 
i won't sleep at night until you say my honey, 
all i ever need is you.

Gotta put a ball

All those angels running 
Picking up the pieces 
Putting back together hearts 
Broke long ago 
I know a good thing when I see it 
And it's a bad thing to let go 
There will always be lovers 
With borders of their own 
And you may charge across 
In a golden chariot 
But you will never be at home 
'Cause I had dreams 
Like distant thunder 
I had hope like a prayer unheard 
This nothing less than perfect 
In a less than perfect world

It's a bad thing.</field>

Have left me with nothing

I was down, I was beat and I was crying

Avoiding tomorrows

You didn't take the time to lie

That lies a moldering 
Behind the door of every house, 
In every street, in every town 
The stage is set for playing 
The stage is set for playing 
And I call crime and punch your mime 
Sweet romance, a rich will dance 
Characters are playing 
Behind the door of every house, 
In every street, in every town 
The people are a waiting 
The people are a waiting 
To bare and die, the years go by 
The wedding spree the cruelty 
And still they go on mating 
And to the one the only one 
Remember when the need of man 
Is greater again 
The prayers take off ascending 
All filled of love to the one above 
Asking for asking for asking for asking for 
A happy ending a happy ending a happy ending.</field>

After one whole quart of brandy 
Like a daisy I awake 
With no Bromo Seltzer handy, 
I don't even shake. 
[Cher] 
Men are not a new sensation; 
I've done pretty well, I think. 
But this half-pint imitation 
Put me on the blink 
I'm wild again 
Beguiled again 
A simpering, whimpering child again 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I 
[Rod Stewart] 
Listen, baby 
I couldn't sleep 
And wouldn't sleep 
Until I could sleep where I shouldn't sleep 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart but what of it? 
My mistake I agree. 
[Rod Stewart] 
Oh she's such a laugh, and I love it 
Although the laugh's on me. 
[Cher] 
Oohh I'll sing to him 
Bring springs to him 
And worship the trousers that cling to him 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I 
Oh you're so cute 
Oh she's kept enough, she's slept enough 
And yet, where it counts she's adapt enough 
[Cher] Aha 
[Both] 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I 
[Cher] 
When he talks he is seeking 
Words to get off his chest. 
[Rod Stewart] 
Horizontally speaking 
She's at her very best. 
[Both] 
Oh we've seen a lot 
I mean a lot 
And now we're like sweet seventeen a lot 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I 
Oh, we're vexed again 
Perplexed again 
Thank God we can't be over-sexed again 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I</field>

Before they call him a man? 
How many seas must a white dove save 
Before she can sleep in the sand? 
How many times must a cannon-ball fly 
Before they're forever banned? 
The answer my friend 
Is blowin' in the wind 
The answer is blowin' in the wind 
How many years must a mountain exist 
Before it is washed to the sea? 
How many years can some people exist 
Before they're allowed to be free 
How many times can a man turn his head 
And pretend that he just doesn't see? 
The answer my friend 
Is blowin' in the wind 
The answer is blowin' in the wind 
How many times can a man look up 
Before he can see the sky? 
And how many years must one man have 
Before he can hear people cry? 
How many deaths will it take 'til he knows 
That too many people have died? 
The answer my friend

The answer is blowin' in the wind

Heart to heart 
Body to body, body to body 
Heart to heart 
Looking in your eyes tonight 
I can see everything I need 
Holding your heart close to me 
Feeling you, breathing you 
We melt together, two become as one 
Night is burning hotter than the sun 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
I could drown in your eyes 
Die in your arms 
Live for this moments I don't know where I end 
Not sure where you start 
When we're body to body, heart to heart 
Body to body, heart to hear 
Body to body, body to body 
Heart to heart 
Breathing every breath with you 
Next to you is where I need to be 
Part of every part of you 
Feeling you feeling me 
We melt together in a tender kiss 
No night has ever been a night like this 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
I could drown in your eyes 
Die in your arms 
Just a thing to be kept and caged 
(And sometimes) 
Ooh, you take it all 
Like the sea takes the land from under my feet 
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all 
Like the sea takes the land from under my feet 
Every dream that we ever ride 
Just a place for our souls to hide 
Every fear what we ever chase 
Just the fear of the truth we face 
(And sometimes) 
Ooh, you take it all 
Like the sea takes the land from under my feet 
(And sometimes) 
Ooh, you take it all 
Like the sea takes the land from under my feet</field>

he's found his prey at last 
In one moment of weakness 
the chase is over so fast 
He celebrates his kill, 
no mercy in his eyes 
When you're born with the hunger 
the hunger never dies 
Midnight is on the prowl 
and I hear it call my name 
Danger lurks in the shadows 
but it's all part of a game 
Until I quench this thirst 
I will not close these eyes 
When you're born with the hunger 
The hunger - never dies 
You and I, we're the same 
we both carry this flame 
to the depths of our souls 
Once this fever awakes 
we can never escape 
It's beyond our control 
We're both born with the hunger - born with the hunger 
Temptation bites your lip 
One kiss ignites the fire 
So begins the seduction 
as we succumb to desire 
Your body aches for more 
Why are you so surprised 
When you're born with the hunger 
The hunger never dies 
When you're born with the hunger 
The hunger - it never dies 
it never dies 
When you're born with the hunger 
It never dies 
When you're born with the hunger 
Ooh it - never dies 
He celebrates the kill 
You're born with the hunger 
It never dies</field>

Living on the love of another man's woman 
That's loving on borrowed time 
My old love's broken pieces 
And I ain't met the new 
You're here in the middle 
Hanging on until I do 
Cause I'm a train that stops 
At every station down the line 
You're a fool so desperate 
That you'll ride on borrowed time

Boys go and shine up your shoes 
Girls run and powder your nose

Thinkin’ your’re cool

You know you can’t spend a dollar 
If you ain’t got a dime 
You can’t hook a fish

You won’t catch the bus 
If you’re not there on time

And sharpen your hooks 
Then all you need is money 
And a mouth full of honey 
And if you play your cards right 
After dancin’ all night 
You won’t have to walk home alone 
You won’t have to walk home alone 
Boys you can hang loose 
And slip up real cool 
But if that lady has a love noose 
She might never let you go 
And if you think that 
Maybe you’re too young 
And you just can not cope 
Then grab a razor sharp 
Pair of cutting shears 
And cut a hole right in the rope 
Snip a hole right in the rope

You won’t catch the bus 
If you’re not there on time 
Well if you wake up tomorrow morning 
You can’t remember what you did 
Just ring up some of your friends 
And they’ll tell you just how low you slid 
Oh don’t be ashamed of anything you hear 
After all you can’t be blame 
When you’re drinking so much beer 
Hey don’t you worry 
That what you did just wasn’t right 
Just remember brothers and sisters 
After every day’s another night 
Just remember brothers and sisters 
After every day’s another night

Wouldn't let me off his merry-go-round 
I followed him around in traveling shows 
Along the main county lines 
Watching him drinking his mind away 
Not ever knowing my name at time 
Each night when the show closed down 
He used to tell me of his dreams 
He was wearing new French suits 
While I mended my torn jeans 
Chorus 
Then one night in Santa Fe 
The horses stop going around 
There he was my poor rich man 
Lying on the Mexico ground 
All the sad music of his life 
Is still spinning in my mind 
The carousel starts up again 
And I found my place in life

I got some reasons to explain 
About the way I was today 
The whistle moans and I'm alone 
My Cheryl's going home 
Santa Rose Special's down the line 
I'm running desperately behind 
There's only one thing on my mind 
The rain and tears are in my eyes 
The things I have to say won't be known

In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow

There is no way you can deny it 
I can see that you're oh-so sad, so quiet 
Chiquitita, tell me the truth 
I'm a shoulder you can cry on 
Your best friend 
I'm the one you must rely on 
You were always sure of yourself 
Now, I see you've broken a feather 
(How it hurts to see you cry 
and how it hurts to see you sad) 
I hope we can patch it up together 
Chiquitita, you and I know 
How the heartaches come 
And they go and the scars they're leaving 
You'll be dancing once again, and the pain will end 
You will have no time for grieving 
Chiquitita, you and I cry 
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you 
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before 
Sing a new song, Chiquitita 
Try once more, like you did before 
Sing a new song, Chiquitita 
So the walls came tumbling down 
And your love's a blown-out candle 
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle 
Chiquitita, tell me the truth 
There is no way you can deny it 
I see that you're oh-so sad, so quiet 
Chiquitita, you and I know 
How the heartaches come 
And they go and the scars they're leaving 
You'll be dancing once again, and the pain will end 
You will have no time for grieving

Its Christmas, baby please come home, 
Christmas, 
The snow's coming down, 
I'm watching it fall, 
lots of people around, 
baby please come home. 
Christmas, 
The church bells in town 
are ringing of snow, 
what a happy sound, 
baby please come home. 
(chorus) 
They're singing deck the hall, 
but its not like christmas at all, 
coz i remember when you were here 
and all the fun we had last year 
Christmas, 
Pretty lights on the trees 
I'm Watching them shine, 
you should be here with me, 
baby please come home, 
baby please come home, 
baby please come home, 
baby please come home. 
(repeat chorus) 
If there was a way, 
I'd hold back each tear, 
but its Christmas day, 
baby please come home. 
(repeat chorus) 
If there was a way, 
I'd hold back each tear, 
but its Christmas day, 
baby please come home. 
(repeat chorus) 
If there was a way, 
I'd hold back each tear, 
but its Christmas day, 
baby please come home. 
OH baby please come home 
baby please

baby please come home 
pretty lights on the trees 
I'm watching them shine, 
you should be here with me 
baby please come home,

I knew it surely when I saw my blood 
I cried with my wet eyes

I said "I love you" dying in the mud

Some guy is gonna knock at our front door 
Honey he's gonna try and tell you in a nice way 
That Mrs., you're not Mrs 
anymore. 
Just one more time I wish that you could see you 
Just one more time I wish that you were near 
Just one more time I wish that you could hear me 
But bitterness won't make me reappear 
I love you, my God how I love you 
I see you all around me 
It's time now it's time to say boodnight 
But this time my love, 
I won't have to get up and fight 
I love you</field>

I'll keep still if you decide to leave 
I'll try and see that you have all you need

Yes I'll be as true as true can be 
If you'll come and stay with me 
Live a life no others have ever known 
But I know you think that I'm hardly grown 
Oh thank God at last and finally 
I can see you're gonna stay with me 
I can see you're gonna stay with me.</field>

When night has left the sky 
Before the dew is dry 
But it's not like it used to be 
I'm leaving you this warning 
You're gonna live to see the day 
You long for me 
Come to your window 
It ain't too late to come 
Into your side again 
Don't make me believe you 
Before you let me have 
A chance to try again 
Or I'll be gone before 
You ever know you're losing me 
I know I've made mistakes 
That bought you sorrow 
But baby, keep in mind 
You're not right all the time 
Don't let me go away 
To face a new tomorrow 
Back where you bought me from 
When I was glad to come 
[Chorus:] 
Come to your window 
Look down and see the teardrops 
In my desperate eyes 
Look how I need you 
I got to find a way to make you realize 
That you are casting out 
The deepest love you'll ever know 
Please don't close your ears 
To what I'm saying 
Before I ride away into the early day 
I spent the lonesome evening hours praying 
That you will change your mind 
And try me one more time 
Come to your window 
Before our love comes crashing 
Into pieces on the ground 
Don't let it happen 
I promise you this time 
I'll never let you down 
Give me a cause to come 
To your lonesome arms again

Are you really with me

Well, I've waited for this moment for so long

No, it's not a dream

There'll be somebody new by my side 
Somebody who is sure he is mine

When you see the smile on his face 
Just remember baby 
Could've been you, could've been you 
When he's standing there in your place 
I hate to say it baby 
Could've been you, could've been you 
Guess I should have been cool 
Maybe I was too kind 
When loving me was easy 
You were hard to find 
And when I cried over you babe 
How the teardrops burned 
Oh baby, baby now the tables turned 
So if those tears start falling 
When you see us walking by 
I hope you won't forget who said goodbye 
Chorus 
Should've been you 
But you threw it all away 
Oh could've been you 
Standing here today 
Could've been you baby 
So if those tears start falling 
When you see us walking by 
I hope you won't forget who said goodbye 
You said goodbye

Now All That I can tell you is good luck baby 
Im sorry that it couldnt be me,

Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah!

Over the hill, there's an army of fools 
Waiting for their hearts to be broken 
How do I know 
If I'm gonna explode 
When I come out in the open 
'Cause even lovers can turn into enemies 
I don't wanna be a casualty

            <field name="lyrics">The fortune queen of New Orleans 
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine 
On the back seat were scratches 
From the marks of men her fortune she had won 
Couldn't see through the tinted glass 
She said, "Home James" and he hit the gas 
I followed her to some darkened room 
She took my money, she said, "I'll be with you soon" 
CHORUS: 
Dark lady laughed and danced 
And lit the candles one by one 
Danced to her gypsy music 
Till her brew was done 
Dark lady played black magic 
Till the clock struck on the twelve 
She told me more about me 
Than I knew myself 
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three 
And mumbled some words 
That were so strange to me 
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack 
My eyes saw red but the card 
Still stayed black 
She said the man you love is secretly true 
To someone else who is very close to you 
My advice is that you leave this place 
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face 
Chorus 
So I ran home and crawled in my bed 
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said 
Then I remembered her strange perfume 
And how I smelled it once in my own room 
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man 
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand 
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor 
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore

I don't know who you are 
But you're a real dead ringer for love 
You're a real dead ringer for love

You been hanging around this joint 
You been trying to look away 
But now you finally got the point 
I don't have to know your name 
And I won't tell you what to do

OOOO You got the kind of legs 
That do more tan walk 
I don't have to listen 
To your whimpering talk 
Listen you got the kind of eyes 
That do more than see 
You gotta lot of nerve 
Coming on to me 
You got the kind of lips 
That do more than drink 
You got the kind of mind 
That does less than think 
But since I'm feeling kinda lonely 
And my defenses are low 
Why don't we give it shot 
And get ready to go 
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction 
And I want to tell my Daddy that I'll be missing in action 
Ever since I can remember 
I've been hanging around this joint 
My Daddy never noticed it 
Now he finally got the point 
You got me beggin' on my knees

When I compare 'em next to you 
I don't know who you are 
Or what you do 
Or where you go 
When you're not around 
I don't know anything about you baby 
But you're everything I'm dreaming of 
I don't know who you are 
But you're a real dead ringer for love 
You're a real dead ringer for love</field>

You gotta break an egg 
If you wanna be in show biz 
Then you gotta break a leg 
Babe you're heading on a journey 
I hate to see you make 
'cause the only food they sell there 
Is called Disaster Cake 
You won't plan or deserve it 
When life sneaks behind your back 
It'll grab you by the short hairs 
And gently tie you up to the rack 
If you think you can outrun it 
That'll be your first mistake 
'cause the recipe you're making 
Is for Disaster Cake 
Read my lips 
Babe the crack that you hear is thunder 
You don't know but you're goin' under 
Read my lips 
Babe that flash that you see is lightnin' 
I had been up ahead 
It's frightenin' 
Yeah your're young and you're cool 
Here to break every rule 
- You're a fool 
Now you won't listen or believe me 
When I tell you what's ahead 
I'm a dinosaur in your mind 
I've never even seen "The Dead" 
But child read my lips and tremble 
'cause your world's about to break 
And the crumbs they're sellin' after 
Are from Disaster Cake 
Read my lips 
Girl you're heading for a disaster 
You run fast - you need to run faster 
Read my lips 
'cause you're an accident waiting to happen 
Yeah you're young and you're cool 
But hell's full of young fools 
Rest in peace 
Yeah I know you're tired of listenin' 
And you wish I'd just go away 
If I do you'll be alone here 
And then you'll beg my ass to stay 
Babe, life's a paradox for certain 
Like tryin' to fuck through an earthquake 
Simpler task than eating 
An entire Disaster Cake 
Read my lips 
Girl you're heading for a disaster 
You run fast - you need to run faster 
Read my lips 
Babe that glash that you see is lightnin' 
I have been up ahead 
It's frightenin' 
Yeah you're young and you're cool 
But hell's full of young fools 
Rest in peace</field>

Do you ever want to know 
If all dreams go on endlessly 
Or do they just run down somehow 
Gradually become the custody 
Or that melancholy jaded by the time 
And darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind 
CHORUS: 
Do I ever cross your mind 
When you're lonely 
Or does that only happen to me 
Darling don'tcha ever wonder 
What became of all the time 
And darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind

From the very start 
And it's my own fault

But you just do what you gotta do 
My wild sweet love 
If it should mean I never 
Kiss your sweet lips again 
Hey there's no mind 
Chase that dapple dream of yours 
Come on back and see me 
When you can, oh 
Now I know it makes you sad 
Makes you feel so bad 
They don't treat you like they should 
They got ways to make you feel no good 
Though they've got no way to know 
Well I've had my eyes wide open 
From the very start 
And that's the part of you 
They'll never get to see 
But it's the part you showed to me</field>

People passing me by 
They just look me up and down 
But they don't look me in the eye 
I'm just another stranger 
In my own home town 
Looking for an angel 
But heaven can't be found 
I say hey, are you lonely tonight? 
Hey, hey, hey I'm gonna make it through 
But that don't make it right 
Does anybody really fall in love anymore? 
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody? 
Does anybody really ever open that door? 
I know, I know you've got to love somebody 
I know, I know I've got to find somebody to love 
There's a sad face in the mirror 
And I'm sad to say it's mine 
Like a ghost up in the attic 
Only love can set him free 
I've been running around in circles 
On this roller coaster ride 
There's a lonely world around me 
I get sucked in by the tide 
I say hey, love ain't no crime 
So why is everybody so afraid to cross that line? 
Does anybody really fall in love anymore? 
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody? 
Does anybody really ever open that door? 
I know, I know you've got to love somebody 
I know, I know I've got to find somebody to love 
Hey, hey, hey I'll be all right 
'Cause I know that someone somewhere's 
Gonna say these words tonight 
Does anybody really fall in love anymore? 
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody? 
Does anybody really ever open that door?

To the cafe on the corner 
I catch a movie in the afternoon 
I spend an hour 
Doing nothing that important 
But nothing's what I'm in the mood to do 
This peaceful image 
Of a seen almost forgotten 
Just touched the surface 
Of my conscious mind 
Of things I used to do 
Before I knew you 
So don't come around here tonite 
But that doesn't mean forever 
I trust you to spare us a fight 
And humour my endeavour 
There was something about you to me 
How easier love used to be 
Well I just need to know 
That I'm all right 
If you don't come around tonite 
And so I wander 
Through the workings of the city 
Where every stranger has discovered me 
With my desire, my isolation 
Somehow I have to make the two agree 
And then you vanish 
All my thoughts and independance 
When you put your hands on me 
And I feel these things you do 
That I've grown used to 
So don't come around here tonite 
But that doesn't mean forever 
I trust you to spare us a fight 
And humour my endeavour 
There was something about you to me 
How easier love used to be 
Well I just need to know 
That I'm all right 
If you don't come around tonite 
You say I'm the one 
You've been searching for 
But for myself I would rather be more 
Then someone who only aspires 
To forfeit your every desire 
And nights I've been mad, you are few 
Now, all I am asking of you, is 
So don't come around here tonite 
But that doesn't mean forever 
I trust you to spare us a fight 
And humour my endeavour 
There was something about you to me 
How easier love used to be 
Well I just need to know

I cannot tell you of my love 
Here is my story 
I'll sing a love song 
Sing it for you alone 
Though you're a thousand miles away 
Love's feeling so strong 
Come to me, baby 
Don't keep me waiting 
Another night without you here 
And I'll go crazy 
There is no other, there is no other 
No other love can take your place 
Or match the beauty of your face 
I'll keep on singing till the day 
I carry you away 
With my love song, with my love song 
Dov'è l'amore 
Dov'è l'amore 
Where are you now, my love? 
I need you here to hold me 
Whispered so sweetly 
Feel my heart beating 
I need to hold you in my arms 
I want you near me 
Come to me baby 
Don't keep me waiting 
Another night without you here 
And I'll go crazy 
There is no other, there is no other 
No other love can take your place 
Or match the beauty of your face 
I'll keep on singing till the day 
I carry you away 
Non c'è nessuno

You might wake up some morning 
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind 
And if you're quick enough to rise 
You'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow 
Out on the new horizon 
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings 
And if the sleep has left your ears 
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow 
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you 
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of 
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder 
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love 
You might have heard my footsteps 
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind 
I might have even called your name 
As I ran searching after something to believe in 
You might have seen me runnin' 
Through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behind 
If you remember something there 
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathing 
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you 
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of 
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder 
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love 
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder 
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love 
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder 
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love.</field>

We're not ready to give up until we're crawling 
Don't make it easy on ourselves 
Climbing risk it all if you ain't living you're surviving 
Tell me why you dip you're toes when you could dive in 
Don't be scared to hurt yourself 
Take your heart back off the shelf 
Love covers you up in a landslide 
Love pulls you under like a riptide 
Loves when you crash trying to handglide 
Loves when you're running and there's no light 
Love is a song when you've got no defense 
Love is a rock we throw ourselves against 
Love is the healing of a broken heart 
The story behind all of my favorite scars 
All of my favorite scars 
I love my favorite scars 
High wire don't look down because below you is a raging fire 
But love is waiting for you on the other side 
We're not easy on ourselves 
So take your heart back off the shelf 
Love covers you up in a landslide 
Love pulls you under like a riptide 
Loves when you crash trying to handglide 
Loves when you're running and there's no light 
Love is a song when you've got no defense 
Love is a rock we throw ourselves against 
Love is the healing of a broken heart 
The story behind all of my favorite scars 
All of my favorite scars 
I love my favorite scars 
All of my favorite scars

            <field name="lyrics">Can you hear the drums, Fernando? 
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this 
In the firelight, Fernando 
You were humming to yourself 
And softly strumming your guitar 
I could hear the distant drums 
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar 
They were closer now, Fernando 
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally 
I was so afraid, Fernando 
We were young and full of life 
And none of us prepared to die 
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns 
And cannons almost made me cry 
There was something in the air that night 
The stars were bright, Fernando 
They were shining there for you and me 
For liberty, Fernando 
Though we never thought that we could lose 
There's no regret 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
Now we're old and grey, Fernando 
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand 
Can you hear the drums, Fernando? 
Do you still recall the frightful night 
We crossed the Rio Grande? 
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were 
To fight for freedom in this land 
There was something in the air that night 
The stars were bright, Fernando 
They were shining there for you and me 
For liberty, Fernando 
Though I never thought that we could lose 
There's no regret 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
There was something in the air that night 
The stars were bright, Fernando 
They were shining there for you and me 
For liberty, Fernando 
Though I never thought that we could lose 
There's no regret 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
Yes, if I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Just yesterday morning 
They let me know you were gone 
Susan the plans they made 
Put an end to you 
I walked out this morning 
And I wrote this song 
I just can't remember 
Who to send it to 
CHORUS: 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
I've seen sunny days 
That I thought would never end 
I've seen lonely times 
When I could not find a friend 
But I always thought that I'd see you again 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand 
You've just got to see me through another day 
My body's aching and my time is at hand 
And I won't make it any other way 
Chorus 
Been walking my mind to an easy time 
My back turned towards the sun 
Lord knows when the cold wind blows 
It'll turn you head around 
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line 
To talk about things to come 
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Here comes hot Nancy she's steppin' right on time 
There go the street lights bringin on the night 
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight 
All through the shadows they come and they go 
Only one thing in common 
They got the fire down below 
Here comes the rich man in his long black limousine 
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green 
Here comes the lawyer, banker and the cop 
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop 
When it all gets too heavy 
That's when they come and go 
Only one thing in common 
They got the fire down below 
It happens out in Vegas happens in Moline 
On the blue blood streets of Boston 
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens 
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight 
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right 
And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine 
And he's walking the streets for Nancy 
And he'll find her everytime 
When the street light flicker bringing on the night 
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight 
All through the midnight 
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go 
Only one thing in common 
They got the fire down below.</field>

I heard someone say 
Must be a whisper in the wind 
'Cause you're too far away 
But in my restless sleep 
I could swear I saw you next to me 
Saying oh, I'm coming home 
You'll never spend another night alone 
CHORUS: 
Remember when love was innocent 
There was never a better time 
But you know those fires of Eden 
Still burn in this heart of mine 
The morning's uncertain 
It's a nervous day 
And I look for a reason 
Why I should feel this way 
I hear a voice run before 
Drifting through my open door 
Saying it's alright 
We're going to light those flames tonight 
Chorus 
Remember when love was freedom 
We knew we were two of a kind 
But you know those fires of Eden 
Still burn in this heart of mine 
And don't you wonder 
How we drifted so far 
When we belong to each other 
Oh we were miles apart 
And there's a place 
That was meant for the two of us 
And when you touch the embers 
You feel my love 
As strong as it ever was 
Chorus 
Remember when love was freedom 
We knew we were two of a kind 
But you know those fires of Eden 
Still burn in this heart of mine.</field>

Must I grovel at your feet 
I'm the boy who fought your battles 
And I'm the man who won your wars 
Is it over? 
Have you used me? 
I'm no value anymore 
I'm your mothers, 
Wives, and daughters 
I'm your fathers, husbands, sons 
I'm the life's blood of this country 
I'm the hopeful precious ones 
Am I nothing, 
Am I no one 
Once a fabric, 
Now a rag 
We treat people like they're nothing 
We're not fit to fly, 
Fit to fly 
No, no, no - no, no, no 
We're not fit to fly- 
Fit to fly a flag (no, no, no) 
Join the Army 
See the world 
The Marine Corps 
Join the Navy 
We're not fit to fly - 
Fit to fly the flag</field>

A-gettin' so much resistance from behind.

Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs

And I'm watching the late show 
In my flat, all alone 
How I hate to spend the evening on my own 
Autumn winds 
Blowing outside the window 
As I look around the room 
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom 
There's not a soul out there 
No one to hear my prayer 
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight 
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away 
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight 
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day 
Movie stars 
Find the end of the rainbow 
With a fortune to win 
It's so different from the world I'm living in 
Tired of TV 
I open the window 
And I gaze into the night 
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight 
There's not a soul out there 
No one to hear my prayer 
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight 
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away

Turn around and make the same mistake 
Chorus 
'Cause it's been hard enough gettin' over you 
You kept me holdin' on till the end 
Oh, it's been hard enough gettin' over you 
I don't think that I could say goodbye 
I don't think I could say goodbye 
I know that I can't say goodbye again.</field>

So on we go, his welfare is my concern 
No burden is he to bare, we'll get there 
For I know he would not encumber me 
He ain't heavy, he's my brother 
If I'm laden at all, I'm laden with sadness 
That everyone's heart isn't filled with gladness 
Of love for one another 
It's a long, long road from which there is no return 
While we're on our way to there, why not share 
And the load, it doesn't weigh me down at all 
He's my brother, he's my brother.</field>

When the evening has begun

The boy who walks beside the man 
I pray that I will always have the world 
That I have found 
The husband and the son 
That I built my life around 
CHORUS: 
He'll never know of that night long ago 
He'll never know it's locked in my mind 
No he'll never know 
From the feelings I show 
He'll never know 
His son is only mine 
Sometimes I lie awake at night 
Watching darkest turn to light 
Thinking back on all the things 
I said to him today 
Wondering if I might had a careless word to say 
When the morning's almost here 
He reaches out to draw me near 
Silently I search his face for the love 
I hope to see and once again 
I'm sure that all his love belongs to me

            <field name="lyrics">Beneath the white fire of the moon 
Love's wings are broken all too soon 
We never learn 
Hurt together, hurt alone 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone? 
We turn the wheel and break the chain 
Put steel to steel and laugh at pain 
We're dreamers in castles made of sand 
The road to Eden's overgrown 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone? 
Look at the headlines: 
"Big crowd at the crazy house 
Long queue for the joker's shoes 
Ten rounds in the ring with love" 
Do you lose and win, or win and lose? 
Sweet rain like mercy in the night 
(Lay me down, wash away the sorrow) 
Caress my soul and set it right 
(Lay me down, show me your tomorrow) 
Summer tears, winter and the moment's flown 
Dont' you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone? 
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone 
Get the picture? 
"No room for the innocent 
Peak season in lonely town 
Knocked out of the ring by love" 
Are you down and up, or up and down? 
I ask the river for a sign 
(In a dream, we go on together) 
How long is love supposed to shine? 
(In a dream, diamonds are forever) 
But you and I, we're hurt together, hurt alone 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone? 
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone 
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected) 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone? 
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected) 
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone 
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected) 
Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone? 
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected) 
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone (fade)</field>

How can you stop the sun from shining?

How can you mend this broken man? 
How can a loser ever win? 
Please help me mend my broken heart 
And let me live again 
I can still feel the breeze 
That rustles through the trees 
And misty memories do days gone by 
We could never see tomorrow 
No one said a word about the sorrow 
And how can you mend a broken heart? 
How can you stop the rain from falling down?

No more wishing on a star

Baby how could I know you'd come rushing down from Heaven

Now I don't have to sleep to dream 
You're a dream to me 
There's a cure for bleeding heart 
Think you showed me where to start 
Everytime I lose my grip 
You keep me hangin' on 
You remind that I'm strong 
So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself 
Oh, I never felt nothing better

Rain keeps coming down 
I just thought I'd try to call you 
Before you got too far outta town 
And I hope that you get this message 
That I'm leaving for you 
Cause I'd hate that you left 
Without hearing the words that I needed you to 
And I hope you find it what you're looking for 
I hope is everything 
You dreamed your life could be 
And so much more 
And I hope you're happy wherever you are 
I wanted you to know that 
And nothing's gonna change that 
I hope you find it 
Am I supposed to hang around and wait forever? 
The last words that I said 
But that was nothing 
But a broken heart talking, darlin' 
You know it wasn't what I meant 
Call me up, let me know that you got this message 
That I'm leaving for you 
Cause I'd hate that you left 
Without hearing the words that I needed you to 
And I hope you find it what you're looking for 
I hope is everything 
You dreamed your life could be 
And so much more 
And I hope you're happy wherever you are 
I wanted you to know that 
And nothing's gonna change that 
I hope you find it 
Whatever it is out there 
I bet that you were missing here 
Well I hope you find it what you're looking for 
I hope is everything 
You dreamed your life could be 
And so much more 
And I hope you're happy wherever you are 
I wanted you to know that 
And nothing's gonna change that 
I hope you find it 
I hope you find it</field>

By pretending I am something else

Don't get caught up 
In a power of a win

Watch me elevate your expectations 
Oh why is this happening 
You'll be furthering your education 
I think it all out 
I know what to say 
To get you on my side

Chilled lonely wine 
Then he walked in with some woman 
Who's place was once mine 
And she wore his ring on her finger 
And the band began a song 
I'd heard before 
CHORUS: 
I saw a man and he danced with his wife 
How I wished he was dancing with me 
'Cause I remember before 
When we danced on this floor 
His eyes were only on me 
Where did I go wrong 
They were playin' our song 
While I was cryin' all night long 
I kept watchin' as they dance so divine 
I kept hopin' kept on lookin' 
But I couldn't catch his eye 
Oh, then he got up and he saw me 
But he just walked right on by 
And danced with her 
Chorus 
Where did I go wrong 
They were playin' our song 
While I was cryin' all night long 
Two weeks later 
I heard a knock on my door 
He's back 
Just like all those good time before 
Ah, then he kissed me 
And he told me 
I left her 'cause I love you, 
So much more than I knew

I saw a man and he danced with his wife.</field>

Then all the colours will bleed into one 
Bleed into one

You broke the bonds 
And you loosed the chains 
Carried the cross and

She said she would always stay. 
But I was cruel, 
I treated her like a fool, 
I threw it all away. 
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand, 
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day. 
I must have been mad, 
I never knew what I had, 
Until I threw it all away. 
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round, 
Love and only love, it can't be denied. 
No matter what you think about it 
You just won't be able to do without it. 
Take a tip from one who's tried. 
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love, 
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray, 
For one thing that's certain, 
You will surely be a-hurtin', 
If you throw it all away.</field>

And there's an honesty in every word 
There's a dancer that feels her own beat 
And there's a daughter who loves 
There's a sinner in my bones 
And there's a joker in my head 
There are secrets in my soul 
And there are sorries that I have never said 
But there's a time to dance 
Time to laugh, time to cry 
Time to go, time to grieve 
Time to come 
Oh, I still got time to cope 
Time to hope, time to play 
Time to grow 
But for now I gotta walk alone 
I gotta walk alone 
There's a tight rope that I've been walking 
There's a daisy in my hair 
There's a heartbreak that has taught me 
Of what is raging 
And there's only love and fear 
There's a sadness in my confessions 
There's a hyena howling at the moon 
And there's a gypsy in me that keeps on roaming 
And there's a an anger as I get closer to the truth 
But there's a time to dance 
Time to laugh, time to cry 
Time to go, time to grieve 
Time to come 
Oh, I still got time to cope 
Time to hope, time to play 
Time to grow 
But for now I gotta walk alone 
I gotta walk alone 
I gotta walk alone 
I've got to walk alone 
But for now I gotta walk alone 
Oh, I hear the thunder but I won't back down 
A soldier marches through the wrong side of town 
I'm gonna love you until I bleed 
And that's the story of me 
I gotta walk alone 
If they say time is everything 
But there's a time to dance 
Time to laugh, time to cry 
Time to go, time to grieve 
Time to come 
Oh, I still got time to cope 
Time to hope, time to play 
Time to grow

Come to me, get it, come, come 
Walk on guilded splinters 
Come to me, get it, come, come

Drink poison in my chalice

But one thing will always be true 
I'll never stop loving you 
Fall from your grace 
You'll never be replaced

But it just ain't no use 
I thought I could shake you loose 
I'm still torn up inside 
In time even memories fade away

I have past aside my foolish pride 
Going down for the very last time 
Cause I have searched this earth

Learning what it's all about 
He was kinda akward, I was filling out 
But I don't think that I would have played around 
If I knew then what I know now 
Too many years, too many chairs 
Too many other things, too many men 
Time and again I had to test my wings 
No time for love, strings or wedding rings 
A pretty young girl from Baltimore 
Got herself a real good man 
Once he was a cowboy who wanted Lady Gran 
And I know that I would have made that now 
If I knew then what I know now 
Once he was a cowboy who wanted Lady Gran

Flying home to Mobile 
Camping in your cornfield for a while 
Seems he just backed into a square meal 
And he's in for the night 
See that fine yellow moon a rising 
Through the frost along the window pane 
All of your shooting stars 
Are in the wrong direction 
Well I love you darling

But it would be nothing 
Nothing without a woman or a girl 
You see man made the cars 
To take us over the road 
Man made the train 
To carry the heavy load 
Man made the electric lights 
To take us out of the dark 
Man made the boat for the water 
Like Noah made the ark 
This is a man's man's, man's world 
But it would be nothing 
Nothing without a woman or a girl 
Man thinks of little baby girls And the baby boys 
Man make them happy 'Cause man makes them toys 
And after man make everything, everything he can 
You know that man makes money to buy from other man 
This is a man's world 
But it would be nothing, nothing 
Not one little thing 
Without a woman or a girl 
He's lost in the wilderness 
He's lost in the bitterness 
He's lost, lost and ......</field>

It's not unusual to have fun with anyone 
When I see you hanging about with anyone 
It's not unusual to see me cry 
I wanna die 
It's not unusual to go out at anytime 
When I see you out and about it's such a crime 
If you should ever want to be love by anyone 
It's not unusual it happens every day 
No matter what you say 
You'll find it's happens all the time 
Love will never do whatcha you want it to 
Why can't this crazy love be mine 
It's not unusual to be mad at anyone 
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone 
But if I ever find that you have changed at anytime 
It's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you.</field>

I'll still have you Sonny boy

Let them go on and forsake me 
You're gonna pull me straight through

You're sent from heaven 
And I know your worst 
You've made a heaven for me 
Right here on earth 
I'm coming yes I'm coming 
I'm sorry that I made you wait 
Yes I'm coming, good God I'm coming 
I hope and pray it's not too late 
Can't you hear my mammy 
My little mam, my little mammy 
I walk a million miles for one of your smiles 
My mam, my my mam my little mammy 
Weep no more, weep no more my lady 
Sing that song again for me 
Sing a song that low just as though 
You had me you had me right there on your knee 
A million baby kisses I'm gonna deliver 
As many that you sing that's what I deliver 
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby 
With a Dixie melody 
Friends may forsake me 
Let them forsake me 
I'll still have you Sonny boy.</field>

Riding away on the horses that run through my life 
You think I'm trying just to watch your game, 
But Julie you're messin' with a naked flame, 
I?m a dangerous rain that'll wash all your lies away, 
Well I now know Julie you're the shape of sin, 
But I can strut like Bowie when the line gets thin, 
So cool it Julie or I'm gonna do you in 
Julie, Julie 
Why do you taunt me?

You're a liar, bitch 
Well you think that you're flying the strings of a kite 
But Julie I hope that you're not far off night 
'Cause I'm flyin' higher and I'm the one holdin' the light 
He's all that I got and he's all that I want 
So Julie for the last time enough is enough 
Take it from me you'll meet no meaner woman, no

Just a small town dude with a big city attitude 
Honey are ya lookin' for some trouble tonight 
Alright 
You think you're so bad, drive the women folk wild 
Shoot 'em all dowm with the flash of your pearly smile 
Honey but you met your match tonight 
Oh that's right 
You think you'll knock me off my feet 
Till I'm flat on the floor 
Till my heart is crying indian and I'm beggin' for more 
So come on baby, come on baby 
Come on baby show me what that loaded gun is for 
CHORUS 
If you can give it, I can take it 
Cause if this heart is gonna break 
It's gonna take a lot to break it 
I know tonight 
Somebody's gonna win the fight 
So if you're so tough 
Come on and prove it 
Your heart is down for the count 
And you know you're gonna lose it 
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames 
Just like Jesse James 
You're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide 
Well you ain't so strong 
Won't be long till your hands are tied 
Tonight I'm gonna take you in dead or alive 
That's right 
You break the laws of love in the name of desire 
Take ten steps back, cause I'm ready baby aim and fire 
baby there's no way you're gonna run tonight 
Ooh that's right 
Well you've had your way with love 
But it's the end of the day 
Now a team of wild horses couldn't drag your heart away 
So Come on baby, come on baby 
Come on baby you know there ain't nothing left to say 
CHORUS 
You think you'll knock me off my feet 
Till I'm flat on the floor 
Till my heart is crying indian and I'm beggin for more 
So come on baby, come on baby 
Come on baby, Come on

Im gonna shoot ya down Jesse James</field>

I could change this bad luck

Oh, I can't make mistakes now 
Oh, I've got to read your signs 
I've gotta sing those magic lines 
You've got to hear 
I know I've given you every reason 
In this whole round world to fear me now 
But my love's a raging river 
And you've wrapped it in your hand 
Oh darlin'

To leave it with me, breathe it with me 
Get beneath it with me now sweet daddy

Hiding in the daylight shadows 
Until it's time to say goodbye 
Wishing it would be all right 
Living with a loneliness 
From kiss to kiss 
Don't ask me now what is right or wrong 
'Cos I've been wondering since you came along 
We were weak and love was strong 
Now there's nothing we can do 
So I'll meet you at the same ole place 
I know it's worth it when I see your face 
Someday we'll just disappear without a trace 
Baby, that's the truth 
I keep hoping we'll find a way 
(Kiss to kiss) 
I keep wondering who's gonna pay 
(Kiss to kiss) 
I keep waiting for Judgement Day 
Some people's lives 
Just get in the way 
And that's the truth

Nine hundred miles to Rome

My piece of mind at home 
This infatuatio is driving me insane 
To make my reservation 
On the next L.A 
plane 
Make me high, make me sane 
Get me aboard that L.A 
plane 
Iâ€™m tired of the pouring rain 
Get me safe, get me warm 
Get me a Southern California morning 
Where I was born, boy Iâ€™m coming 
Iâ€™m coming home to you 
He look so fine in Europe 
On all the posters and the brochures 
I thought they promised something more 
Than what was mine and yours 
Well I was looking for excitement 
On every boat and train 
But all I saw were unfamiliar faces in the rain 
Get me high, get me sane 
Get me aboard that L.A 
plane 
Iâ€™m tired of this pouring rain 
Iâ€™m tired of just passing through 
Get me safe, get me warm 
Get me a Southern California morning 
Where I was born, babe Iâ€™m coming 
Iâ€™m coming home to you 
And now nothing look better in my mind 
Than your warm and loving face 
And all these miles have taught me 
That your loved canâ€™t be replaced 
Get me high, get me sane 
Get me aboard that L.A

Get me safe, get me warm

She ain't satisfied without some pain 
Friday night is goin' up inside her...again 
Well crack the whip 
'Cause that bitch is just insane

Hangin' upside down 
She's pretty tied up

She's pretty tied up

I can't tell you she's the right one 
Oh no,oh no,oh no 
Once there was this rock n' roll band rollin' on the streets 
Time went by and it became a joke 
We just needed more and more fulfilling- Uh-huh 
Time went by and it all went up in smoke 
But check it out 
She's pretty tied up 
Hangin' upside down 
She's pretty tied up 
An you can ride her 
She's pretty tied up 
Hangin' upside down 
Ohh I can't tell you she's the 
right one 
Oh no,oh no,oh no 
Once you made that money it costs more now 
It might cost a lot more than you'd think 
I just found a million dollars 
That someone forgot 
It's days like this that push me o'er the brinks 
Cool and stressing

Unable to make amends

There's just not enough of? 
Chorus x 2 
We need some understandin' 
We need a little more love 
Some love and understandin' 
Enough stars to light the sky at night 
Enough sun to make the whole world bright 
Enough hearts to find some love inside 
We got more than enough 
But there's one thing 
There's just not enough of?

With no shoes upon my feet 
Share with you the last bite 
Of bread I had to eat 
I'd would swim out to save you 
In your sea of broken dreams 
When all your hopes are sinking 
Let me show you what love means 
Love can build a bridge 
Between your heart and mine 
Love can build a bridge 
Don't you think it's time? 
Don't you think it's time? 
I would whisper love so loudly 
Every heart could understand 
That love and only love 
Can join the tribes of man 
I would give my heart's desire 
So that you might see 
The first step is to realize 
That it all begins with you and me 
Love can build a bridge 
Between your heart and mine 
Love can build a bridge 
Don't you think it's time? 
Don't you think it's time? 
When we stand together 
It's our finest hour 
We can do anything, anything 
Anything, anything 
Keep believing in the power 
Love can build a bridge 
Between your heart and mine 
Love can build a bridge 
Don't you think it's time? 
Don't you think it's time? 
Love can build a bridge 
Between your heart and mine 
Love can build a bridge 
Don't you think it's time? 
Don't you think it's time? 
Don't you think it's time?.</field>

And it ever punishes or strokes our pride. 
Never stop to think how much we lose, 
when we pick and chose in out solitude. 
Sothing comes up, Something goes down, 
Suddenly you feel your being pushed around, 
and just becuse you think your losin hold, 
you try to take control, the stories very old. 
But if we ever get our minds made up 
All we gotta do is love enough, 
won't be long before it comes to you 
given love enough, you'll see it through 
All you gotta do is love enough 
Someone wants in, someone wants out 
but doesnt anybody see beyond the clouds, 
cause man you've hardly learned to speak your name 
before your in this game 
but baby all the same 
But if we ever get our minds made up 
All we gotta do is love enough, 
won't be long before it comes to you 
given love enough, you'll pull it through 
All you gotta do is love enough 
All you really gotta do is love enough 
wont be long before it comes to you 
given love enough, you'll see it through 
All you gotta do is love enough.</field>

Any heart not tough 
Or strong enough 
Take a lot of pain

Love is like a cloud

Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts 
I'm young, I know

I know a thing or two 
Ooo honey, I learned from you 
I really learned a lot 
I really learned a lot 
Love is like a stove 
It burns you when it's hot 
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts 
Some fools rave, of happiness 
Of blissfulness, togetherness 
Oh, some fools, 
They fool themselves, I guess 
They're not fooling me 
And I know it isn't true 
God, I know it isn't true 
Love is just a lie and it's 
Made to make you blue 
Love hurts, (ooooo) love hurts

All around the world we sing 
Like a penny in a spin 
Always looking for the way 
To get out, to get in 
CHORUS: 
Love is the groove in which we move 
Love is the groove in which we move 
Love is the groove in which we move 
In the alleys o Monsay 
In the streets of Katmandu 
On the high roads of Peru 
People meet and touch and go 
But the wind of change will blow 
And another dance will start 
And I'll finally get the point 
Like an arrow to my heart 
Chorus 
Look back where's the sea 
Who brought this mystery? 
Deep in another world 
Someone is listening 
And they as with night 
And we keep asking why 
Look back there's the key 
Deep in another life 
On this ship in which we sail 
Everything is possible 
Keep on turning like a star 
Till you get to where you are 
If I promise not to laugh 
Will you promise not to cry? 
Will you promise not to let this life 
Slip by?

To dry her eyes broken inside 
Open your eyes 
And look outside find the reasons why 
You've been rejected 
And now you can't find, what you left behind 
Be strong, be strong now 
Too many, too many problems 
Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs 
Her feelings she hides 
Her dreams she can't find 
She's losing her mind 
She's fallen behind 
She can't find her place

She's fallen from grace

Living young and foolish lives

Cher 
 
Everybody needs a little tenderness 
Everybody needs a release 
From the cell they lock themselves in 
Love's the only peace 
Everybody needs 
Everybody Cries 
Everybody Bleeds 
Everybody Dies 
Everybody Dreams 
Everybody Wakes 
Everybody makes mistakes 
Love one another 
Sisters and brothers 
Love one another 
Love one another 
Father and mother 
Love one another 
It's easier to walk away when you've 
Got a wounded pride 
When two people stand together 
That's how they heal inside 
Try to understand 
Open up your heart 
A fist is just a hand 
It can come apart 
Let go of the past, let go of the fight 
Forgiving fills the world with light 
Love one another 
Sisters and brothers 
Love one another 
Love one another 
Father and mother 
Love one another 
We were given a world so beautiful 
A deep ocean, a blue-blue sky 
I know we can make it a better place 
If only you and I 
Love one another 
Sisters and brothers 
Love one another 
Love one another 
Father and mother

Every morning I would wake up 
And I'd tie the sun around a cup 
And I felt your love higher than the sky 
No one in this world but you and I 
Had tasted love so sweet 
You held me in your arms 
Softer than in the rain 
Mi amore my love never dies 
Mi amore look into my eyes 
We had a love so high 
I could never walk away 
A love so high 
I could reach out and touch the sky 
Tell me why 
I said a little prayer for you and I 
A love so high 
Now I wake up in the middle of the night 
Your face in front of my 
Like a candle burning brighter than the flame 
And I see everything inside your eyes 
Your smile your touch your alibis 
And I wish that you could be with me all night 
Mi amore I wish that I could fly 
Mi amore look into my eyes 
Tell me why 
I can't see you anymore 
Time's ticking away 
I still want you everyday.</field>

I need you so, more than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do 
There's nothing I can do about it 
Loving may be all you can give 
But honey I can't live without it 
Oh how I cry, oh how I die 
If you got tired and said goodbye 
More than I chose 
More than you'll ever know

Oh how I cry, oh how I die 
If you got tired and said goodbye

Sweet comic Valentine 
You make me smile 
With my heart 
Your looks 
Are laughable 
Unphotographable 
Yet 
You're my favourite 
Work of art 
Is your figure 
Less than greek 
Is your mouth 
A little weak 
When you open it 
To speak 
Are you smart? 
(Yeah) 
Don't change 
A hair for me 
Not 
If you care for me 
Stay 
Little Valentine

Each day

Playing in a rock-n-roll band 
I was living in L.A., in a Hollywood way 
Then I met him and he loved me, 
We got married 
Chorus: 
Now he's too far gone to hold me 
Too far gone, he doesn't wanna know me 
Too far gone, and he doesn't really know 
No he'll never get to know his son 
Now I know that I'm a stubborn woman 
But I knew he was a passionate man 
Though our feelings were intense 
Our problems were immense 
But we tried hard and we held on 
But we let it go 
Chorus 
It's hard to cut it loose 
But only one man holds the key 
To what I did to many men 
Was finally done to me 
Now I'm tryin' not to fall to pieces 
But I think about him every day 
When I lay down by his side, 
Tears of love would fill my eyes 
Ooh I loved him and he loved me 
But we let it go 
Too far gone 
Too far gone 
And he doesn't really know 
God, he'll never get to know his son, his son</field>

Needles and pins 
Because of all my pride 
The tears I gotta hide 
Hey I thought I was smart 
I'd won his heart 
I didn't think I'd lose 
But I see she worst to him than me 
Let him go ahead take her love instead 
And one day he will see 
Just how to say please 
Wow and get down on his knees 
That's how it begins 
Hurtin' him hurtin' him 
Why can't I stop and tell myself 
It's wrong so wrong 
Why can't I stand up 
Tell myself to be strong 
Because I saw him today 
I saw his face it was the face I love 
I can't let go, although I know 
He'll make me cry until the day I die 
But people I got to live now 
Wow Lord knows I should forgive now 
That's how they begin 
You'll feel those needles and pins 
Somebody stop'em now 
Stop those needles and pins 
Somebody take'em away now 
Stop those needles and pins

I don't know if even Heaven knows 
I know we had dreams 
That didn't quite come true 
And now I'm not the one 
Little boy, who's keeping you 
(Chorus:) 
I was either standing in your shadow 
Or blocking your light 
Though I kept on trying 
I could not make it right 
For this girl 
There's just not enough love in the world 
I know people hurt you so bad 
They don't know the damage they can do 
And it makes me so sad 
How we knock each other down 
Just like children on a playground 
Even after that ol' sun went down 
(chorus) 
Oh, darling this is still a shady little town 
And sometimes it's so hard to smile 
For the world, for the camera 
And still have something left 
You don't have to prove nothing to nobody 
Just take good care of yourself 
I'm not easy to live with 
I know that it's true 
You're no picnic either, baby 
That's one of the things 
I love about you 
A time will come around 
When we need to settle down 
Got to get off this merry-go-round

There's just not enough love in the world 
For this girl 
There's just not enough love in the world

I saw myself as a concealed attraction 
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action 
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving 
That's how I started the show, one of us had to go

Driven to question 
All the things we've never seen 
We search the horizon 
Looking for a sign 
We've got to take one small step in time 
One step beyond 
All our hopes and our passion 
There is the light of the universe flashin' 
All that it takes is one leap of faith 
One small step, (one small step) 
One small step in time 
Deep in the darkness 
(Deep in the blackness) 
There's a wind that never dies 
(There's a wind that never dies) 
Out in the vastness 
(Out in the vastness) 
There's a road across the sky 
(A road across the sky) 
Out there is the reason

Who was lyin' in the street 
I walked on past her in a hurry 
I didn't want her at my feet 
Am I just numb or overloaded 
Or have I lost all sense of worth 
This lady beggin' for survival 
Doomed by a twist of fate from birth 
i met this woman in San Francisco 
She only had one shoe 
Have we all gone crazy 
How can this happen 
Is there nothin' we can do 
I don't believe that for a fuckin minute 
No system's comin' to her rescue 
While she lay crying 
I felt helpless 
Where are these crack 
That she fell through 
The times we live in have less value 
Than Bob Dole's useless arm 
There are no fires burning brightly 
What's even worse 
There's no alarm 
I met this lady in San Francisco 
She was dyin' at my feet 
People passed her like she was nothin' 
Less than garbage in the street 
The times we live in must have value 
We can't all turn away 
'cos that woman who had nothin' 
Might be me or you 
Some day 
Some day 
Some day 
Some day</field>

(They say) I'm outrageous 
It's the rage 
I'm gonna wear what I will and spend some 
And I will be dress to kill don'tcha know 
And when the lights come up 
I'm ready I'm ready 
To put on a show with class 
And if I clash it's cause I want to 
What a show and I want everyone to know 
They're gonna fly up, get an eyeful 
Everything that's craved from me 
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be outrageous 
Outrageous 
(They say) I'm outrageous 
It's the rage it's the rage 
With my long black hair hanging way down to my 
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies 
Don't tell me what to do don't tell me what to be 
See I don't trust anybody else's traits about make-up and me 
Well in my show I let everything go 
Is what you want is whatcha wanna see from me 
But when the curtain comes down 
And you're on your way back home 
I change into my jeans that are split at the seam 
I grab my funky black jacket and make quite a racket 
You drive like you're an outlaw 
Cause everything that's craved from me 
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be outrageous 
So outrageous 
I'm outrageous honey yes a rage 
It's the rage 
Outrageous, outrageous 
I'm outrageous 
It's the rage it's a rage 
Outrageous, outrageous 
They say I'm outrageous.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You say you want to live some 
Move out into the fast lane 
You say you need excitement 
To make you come alive 
Some place a million miles from 
The shadows that surround you 
I look for your attention 
You're lost out in the future 
Where lovers ask no questions 
And shadows never fall 
Some pilgrim bound for paradise 
No compromise 
Paradise is here 
CHORUS: 
It's time to stop your crying 
The future is this moment 
And not some place out there 
Tonight I need your love 
Don't talk about tomorrow 
Right now I need your loving 
Right now give it to me 
Right now I want your loving 
Right now- now, now, now 
You talk about your new plans 
To move up on the stairway 
Your dream about the high life 
That's waiting for you there 
A world of fame and fortune 
That's just around the corner 
But I don't need no high life 
To make me feel a real man 
And I don't need to reach for 
No castles in the sky 
Just put your arms around me 
Devour me 
'Cos paradise is here 
Chorus 
Tonight I need Your loving 
Paradise is here.</field>

'Cause in this world we are born to fight

You drive me crazy with perfection 
I've worn my pride as my perfection 
Perfectionâ€¦.oh! 
I was taught to be tough 
That the best that you can be ain't enough 
Crack the whip, sacrifice 
But I found out paradise had a price 
I didn't know it then 
But oh I know it now 
You gotta work as hard at love 
To make the love work out 
You know this heart of mine 
Had made some big mistakes 
I guess that when it comes to love 
I just don't know what it takesâ€¦ 
CHORUS: 
All my life I've been driven by perfection 
Pushed it to the limit every day and night 
Whoaâ€¦I've been driven by perfection 
But nothin's perfect when love ain't right 
Nothin's perfect when love ain't right 
Gave it all played my part 
I gave everything I had but my heart 
Worked so hard made a name 
But the loneliness inside stays the same 
When love is here to today 
And then it's gone today 
You got a list of lovers like a resume' 
You gotta take some times 
To make it something real 
I guess that when it comes to love 
I just don't know how to feel 
Chorus repeat 
Oh perfection 
You drive me crazy with perfection 
I've worn my pride as my perfection 
I'm goin' crazy with perfection.</field>

That blows on this came day 
Everybody calls him Pirate 
Dark and handsome in his own way 
And the fire in his eyes 
Lit all the fire inside of me 
And soon you were feeling 
So much more than the wind and waves and sea 
Chorus: 
Pirate I'm not gonna take your soul 
I only want the right to love you 
I know the sea won't let you go 
Pirate, my love will only chain you down 
So just know how much I love you 
And then turn that ship around 
Every time that he'd sail back to me 
We'd fall in love again 
And my face would fill with wonder 
At all the places that he's been 
But I knew his sweetest love song 
Was when he heard the trade winds blow 
And I loved him way too much 
To tell the secret he should know 
Chorus 
Now as I watch in silence 
Another young man goes to sea 
And his silhouette is stirring up 
A painful memory 
And I know his heart is set to sail 
But mine is set to cry 
'Cause I feel as the way I did 
The day is Daddy said goodbye 
I told him

So far away it's not fair 
To be without you like this 
I miss you more than you know 
The nights are long 
The days slow 
Without the warmth of your kiss 
Wish you were back here with me 
Cause out my window 
All I see is 
Rain, rain in the sky 
Everywhere I look my eyes see 
Rain, rain fallin' down 
Crying as it hits the ground 
Rain, rain in my heart 
Every day that we're apart 
Rain, rain 
Falling rain, rain 
Rain, rain 
Only rain, rain 
The sun is strong when you're near 
But when you're gone it disappears 
Behind an ocean of blue 
The telephone's not good enough 
It can't reach out it can't touch me 
The way you do 
Wish you would knock at my door 
Cause only you can stop this pouring 
Rain, rain in the sky 
Everywhere I look my eyes see 
Rain, rain fallin down 
Crying as it hits the ground 
Rain, rain in my heart 
Every day that we're apart 
Rain, rain 
Falling rain, rain 
Rain, rain 
Only rain, rain 
Maybe I'll go outside 
And walk beneath the clouds 
Pretend it's you that's watching over me 
This isn't the only thing that comes 
Between us now 
Baby soon we'll be together 
Oooo

But I don't see you 
You're not near me 
But I need you

If you don't stop the rain</field>

Wish I heard the call when it was the end 
Warnings filled the air but it was too late to pretend

Under the grayest sky 
Since we've been over, it won't stop

I'm drowning no one can help 
It's all around me 
Red from my heart, red like my blood 
Red from my lips when you told me you were done 
Red, now 
All I see is red, now 
Used to be that you were every color of my life 
A rainbow shining through the rain, cutting like a knife 
You were my obsession every night and every day 
So when we fell apart the blue was more than I could take 
We were living in black and white 
Under the grayest sky 
Since we've been over, it won't stop 
All I see is red, red 
All I see is red, red

Rudy you know you heard me crying 
But you paid me no attention 
All alone I was calling your name 
But you left me in suspension 
You know the love that you had taken 
My world was shakin' 
My heart was breaking 
You're not mine 
No you're not mine

If not for me, do it for them 
Save the little children 
Don't make them suffer 
For our sins 
Don't leave them daddyless 
Just cause we can't get it right 
I know we could clean up this mess 
If you could just see them sleeping tonight 
I was such a fool 
To ever let it go this far 
So darling where ever you are, come back 
Save the little children</field>

But a heart must be the one thing 
You were born without 
I've been wastin' my time 
I don't know where I'll sleep tonight 
You say that you can do without me 
Go ahead now try and live without me 
Baby save up all your tears 
You might need them someday 
When the tears start to fall 
I won't wipe them away 
When you cry in the night 
For the love that you need 
Baby save up your tears 
'Cause you'll be cryin' over me 
You got used to my touch 
I got used to not, not feelin' much 
Winter set in your eyes 
Time will melt your castle of ice 
You think that you won't feel the pain now 
But your eyes will be cryin' 
Like the rain now 
Baby save up all your tears 
You might need them someday 
When the tears start to fall 
I won't wipe them away 
When you cry in the night 
For the love that you need 
Baby save up your tears

You don't know it now 
You don't know it now 
You don't know it now

You don't feel it now 
Till the need burns, a knife turns 
Your heart bleeds like mine 
Baby save up all your tears 
You might need them someday 
When the tears start to fall 
I won't wipe them away 
When you cry in the night 
For the love that you need

Can't think a life without you 
It's messing up my mind

Say the word 
And I'll be there right by your side 
To keep our love alive 
Together we will survive 
If you just 
[Chorus 2:] 
Say the word 
No matter where, I'll fight the tide 
Of people who just don't wanna see 
The love of you and me 
My love's infatuation keeps carrying me away 
Do I sense anticipation with everything that you say 
Well I wonder: should I doubt you? 
When you make things so unclear 
Why can't ya say "I love you"? 
That's all I wanna hear 
[Chorus] 
[Chorus 3:] 
Say the word 
And I'll declare time won't divide 
Two people who just wanna be 
In love eternally 
[Our love is free] 
I just know it when I hold you in my arms 
When you show me that you love me when you smile 
If you love me why do you back away? 
Ooh, if it's real let me know when you hold me in your arms 
And I'll show you that I loved you all the while 
Say you love me, and I'll never back away

[Chorus 3]

From the sound of sirens love will survive 
And when your heart is on the run 
When it's chains have come undone (ohh ohh)

Street light so empty the lust and the muse

Your faith is not faithful 
Your grace shows no grace 
Your mercy shows no mercy 
Is there no way out of this place 
ThereæŠ¯ a baby crying 
Softly 
In a dark and 
Dangerous place 
SheæŠ¯ imprisoned by no 
Language 
Fear grips her tiny face 
In gods house she 
Held a hostage 
By a cruel and 
Heartless mob 
ThereæŠ¯ some rule they 
Think godæŠ¯ 
Written 
And it justifies their job 
Sisters of mercy 
Daughters of hell 
They always weave 
Their web of lies 
And wrap you in their 
Wicked spell 
Sisters of mercy 
Masters of pain 
They try to crucify your 
Innocence 
And do it in gods name 
ThereæŠ¯ a baby 
Sobbing softly 
In a crib thatæŠ¯ now 
A cage 
SheæŠ¯ done nothing to 
Deserve this 
But it sanctifies their 
Rage 
They use god like heæŠ¯ a 
Weapon 
Only for a chosen few 
Then hide behind pious 
Faces 
Like the guilty always do 
Sisters of mercy 
Mothers of shame 
A baby only gets to 
Heaven is sheæŠ¯ baptized in his 
Name 
Sisters of Mercy 
Daughter of war 
These chicks administer 
Your penance 
While the devil guards 
Their door 
Your faith is not faithful 
Your grace has no 
Grace 
Your mercy shows no 
Mercy 
Is there no way out of 
This place 
ThereæŠ¯ a baby whoæŠ¯ a 
Warrior 
Sometimes tears run down her face 
As she wonders should 
She fight 
Or simply disappear from 
The race 
If sheæŠ¯ only 
One lesson 
ItæŠ¯ pride comes before 
A fall 
The karma train waits 
For no man 
But god waits for us all 
Sisters of mercy 
Twisters of truth 
I cannot condemn you or 
Forgiver you 
For your sins done in gods 
Youth 
Sisters of mercy 
Daughters of Cain 
I see your wilted 
Powers fading 
Left like rags out 
In the rain 
Sisters of mercy 
Mothers of hell 
Your mercy has no 
Mercy 
Is there no way out of 
This place 
Your grace shows no 
Grace 
Your mercy shows no 
Mercy 
Is there no way out of 
This place 
Is there no way out of 
This place.</field>

I'm in distress-tonight 
Knock knock in the dark-what will I find 
Your eyes-hypnotize-but can they read my mind 
Watch your step now 
We're gettin' closer to the edge 
This is dangerous 
And all the lights are flashing red as I go 
CHORUS: 
Skin deep-to the bone 
Every time I see your face I go 
Skin deep-to the bone 
Tellin' me that I'm in trouble 
Skin deep-to the bone 
Every time I hear your voice I go 
Skin deep-to the bone 
Tellin' me that I'm in trouble 
Too far gone 
Can't hold on-tonight-not tonight

They are still children 
Now their time has come and gone they are grown all to soon It seems children

So your heart's got to go there

This is a song for the lonely 
Can you hear me tonight 
For the broken hearted, battle scared 
I'll be on your side 
And this is a song for the lonely 
When your dreams won't come true 
Can you hear this prayer 
'Cause someone's there for you 
Well don't need a reason 
She can pick you up 
Or leave you bleeding 
I've seen a strong man cry 
I know the reason why 
We all forgive, we all forget 
We just keep believing 
[Chorus] 
So let it find you 
Wherever you go 
I'm right beside you 
You don't have to look no more 
You don't have to look no more, oh no

It's gonna be alright 
It's gonna be alright 
It's gonna be alright 
This is a song 
A song for the lonely 
And that's not you only 
Through the darkest night 
You're gonna see the light 
Love don't need a reason 
Just to leave you bleeding 
Can you hear this prayer 
Someone's there 
This is a song for the lonely 
Can you hear me tonight 
For the broken hearted, battle scared 
I'll be by your side

Sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme 
I got out my life in stages 
With ten thousand people watching 
But we're alone now I'm singing this song 
Singing this song for you 
I know your image of me is what I hope to be 
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see 
There's no one more important to me 
Darling can you please see through me 
Cause we're alone now 
And I'm singing this song for you 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth 
We're only nothing 
You came out in front when I was hiding 
But now I'm so much better 
And if my words can come together 
Listen to the melody 
Cause my love is in there hiding 
I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
I love you for my life you are a friend of mine 
And when my life is over 
Remember when we were together 
We were alone and I was singing this song for you 
Singing this song, singing this song for you.</field>

they seem so hard to find 
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind 
Whatever happened to our love 
I wish I understood 
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good 
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me 
SOS 
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me 
SOS 
When you're gone 
How can I even try to go on 
When you're gone 
Though I try how can I carry on 
You seemed so far away though you were standing near 
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear 
I really tried to make it out 
I wish I understood 
What happened to our love, it used to be so good 
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me 
SOS 
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me 
SOS 
When you're gone 
How can I even try to go on 
When you're gone 
Though I try how can I carry on 
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me

And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me

When you're gone 
How can I even try to go on

Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real 
[Chorus:] 
Stars they come and go 
They come fast 
They come slow 
They go like the last light of the sun 
All in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
Hey, but it gets lonely here 
When there's no one here to share 
You can shake it all away if you will hear my story 
Some people ask for fame like athlete's in a game 
We break our collarbones and come up swinging 
Some of us are downed some of us a crowned 
And some are lost and never found but most have seen it all 
They live there lives in sad cafe's and music halls 
They always come up singing 
Some make it when they're young 
before the world has done its dirty job 
Later on someone will say you've had your day 
And now you must make way 
But they will never know the pain of living 
With a name you'd never own 
Or the many years forgetting 
What you know too well 
That the ones who get the crown 
Have been let down 
Yet try to make amends 
Without defending 
Perhaps pretending 
You never saw the eyes 
Of grown men of twenty-five 
That follow as you walk 
And ask for autographs 
Or kiss you on the cheek 
But you never can believe 
They really love you 
Some make it when they're old 
Perhaps they have a soul 
They're not afraid to bear 
Or perhaps there's nothing there 
[Chorus] 
But most have seen it all 
They live there lives 
In sad cafe's and music halls 
They always come up singing 
Singing 
Singing

Out in the darkness alone 
But the night made me strong 
And I learned to let go 
Time mends a heart 
You turn the page somehow 
Oh, there's no looking back 
The hurt is behind you now 
CHORUS: 
Starting over again 
From the second time around 
Coming back to win 
Starting over again 
Take the first step 
And let it begin 
Starting over, starting over 
Memories haunt you 
Feelings you won't forget 
Learn to live a lesson in love 
Walk away without regrets 
We'll never deny 
Feelings your heart demands 
Ah, find your way out 
Just when you reach the end 
Starting over again 
No one's gonna count you out 
When the heat is on 
Starting over again 
Gotta come back and turn it around 
Starting over 
Take another look inside 
Where you always have a fight 
Never dream of giving up, never 
No looking back

Over an ocean 
And your pain cried out for me 
Across the way 
You here, half dead 
Numb to any emotion 
'Cause you were a prisoner 
And I was a slave 
We both stopped searching for any exceptions 
And rejection always was our bitter pill 
And I have no precious gifts to give you 
I only have our words 
Darling, I love you 
I love you 
Still 
I never thought someone would ever see 
Or make a prisoner of my heart 
But like a warrior dressed in armor 
You carved your name in it right from the start 
You held my soul a hostage 
In your tower on the hill 
All I pray for when I sleep or lie awake 
Is that you love me still 
'Cause my heart cried out for you 
Over an ocean 
And your pain cried out for me 
Across the way 
'Cause we hid, half dead 
Numb to any emotion 
Now you are my prisoner 
And I am your slave 
We both stopped searching for any exceptions 
And rejection had always been our bitter pill 
And I have no precious gifts to give you 
Oh, I only have these words 
Darling, I love you 
I love you 
Still 
Oh, baby I love you 
I love you

Whoa, baby I love you

Sunny thank you for the facts from A to Z 
Somehow I was torn like a wind blown sail 
Then our love was borned when you held my hand

Take it from the boys 
Take it from the boys that you meet

The back door no slack 
Maybe it's the same 
With every man you meet 
You might as well be wise 
And take it from the boys

Well that's how they're all about 
Watch out, you're dealing with a photostat 
When they say they care it's a bonify affair 
Look out, beware of the businessman 
Express American, he'll be gone so fast 
Cause he travels first class 
With his now and powie stash 
And his heart unofficial glass

You gotta take it like a man 
Before you fight for us 
You gotta show me that you can 
They say it's better to love and to lose it all 
I didn't learn how to fly without a heavy fall 
I went from A to Z, blew off reality 
So if my love is a game then you should learn the rules 
You take it on if you're leaving wonder why you lose 
It takes a wiser man to figure out my head 
I've been in love, went to the other side 
I've seen the other side 
I'm not about to fall into another tonight 
So get it right 
Boy, if you want my heart 
You gotta take it like a man 
Before you fight for us 
You gotta show me that you can 
So when the lights go dark 
I wanna know you understand 
That if you want my heart 
You gotta take it like a man 
I've seen and done it all 
I've been misunderstood 
But tell me what could be bad about feeling good 
It's all or nothing now 
'Cause fate don't wait around 
I've been in love, went to the other side 
I've seen the other side 
I'm not about to fall into another tonight 
So get it right 
Boy, if you want my heart 
You gotta take it like a man 
Before you fight for us 
You gotta show me that you can 
So when the lights go dark 
I wanna know you understand 
That if you want my heart 
You gotta take it like a man 
Sometimes it feels 
Like we've got everything to prove 
We make believe 
But we rise again to face the truth 
On and on, on and on we're going 
On and on, on and on it's growing 
On and on, on and on only the real 
Know the deal 
Boy, if you want my heart 
You gotta take it like a man 
Before you fight for us 
You gotta show me that you can 
So when the lights go dark 
I wanna know you understand 
That if you want my heart 
You gotta take it like a man 
How does it feel? We do it better! 
So get the love that's in your heart 
How does it feel? We do it better! 
We do it better!

And the bright lights have faded to blue 
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have 
Loved me and I never knew 
You know I've always been a dreamer 
(spent my life running 'round) 
And it's so hard to change 
(Can't seem to settle down) 
But the dreams I've seen lately 
Keep on turning out and burning out 
And turning out the same 
So put me on a highway 
And show me a sign 
And take it to the limit one more time 
You can spend all your time making money 
You can spend all your love making time 
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow 
Would you still be mine? 
And when you're looking for your freedom 
(Nobody seems to care) 
And you can't find the door 
(Can't find it anywhere) 
When there's nothing to believe in 
Still you're coming back, you're running back 
for more 
So put me on a highway 
And show me a sign 
And take it to the limit one more time 
Take it to the limit 
Take it to the limit 
Take it to the limit one more time</field>

And a page is ripped for a name of life 
Check the back cause the date'll be due 
When they'll throw the book of love at you 
They are broken hearts from A to Z 
Do's and don'ts on bended knees 
Disappointed right to be 
Celebrate a celebrity 
K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
Ah stupid cupid set me free 
Took a look and what'll I see 
This book of love is writing me 
This book of love is writing me 
This book of love is writing me 
This book of love is writing me.</field>

But I heard your note today 
You talk about injustice 
And how we look the other way 
I knew full well your meaning 
But my world just moves too fast 
It's a shame about your future 
It's a crime about your past 
Was there no one who could save you 
From the prison of each breath 
Like Rapunzel in her tower 
Isolation equals death 
Was there no one who could rescue you 
From the prison of your pain 
Am I tougher or just lucky 
Our fate didn't end the same 
But my heart has run on empty 
Since I heard the fuckin' news 
We're a heartless, Godless culture 
We'd walk nowhere in your shoes 
For me it's 6:30 in the morning 
And my moods as black as rain 
I am 30 light years older 
But I understand your pain 
They'll all hate you 
'Cause you left them here 
To struggle on their own 
I'm sorry you saw no choice 
'Til death chilled you to the bone 
But my heart has run on empty 
Since I heard the fuckin' news 
We're a heartless, Godless culture 
We'd walk nowhere in your shoes 
Well the good news if there's any 
Is you ever lived at all 
But our country kills its heroes 
We just raise them for the fall</field>

Never been out this late before 
Please don't think I'm a bore 
But will I see you anymore 
Say have you got a comb that I can use 
I'm sure I look like real bad news 
Like I really been abused 
Don't get me wrong when I ask before 
If I'll see you anymore 
I don't know if I should laugh or cry 
Do you want to kiss me goodbye? 
Or was I just another try 
You're a funny kinda guy 
Don't know what I'll say 
When they ask me why 
Oh I heard a rooster crow 
I think I better go 
Never been out this late before 
I know when I walk outside your door 
I won't see you anymore.</field>

How can I tell her 
I love her? 
Yes 
I would give 
My heart gladly 
But each day 
When she walks 
To the sea 
She looks 
Straight ahead 
Not at me 
Tall and tan

Goes walking 
And when she passes 
I smile

Was the grass on which you laid 
And the bluest blue was in my eyes 
When you said you couldn't stay 
And the biggest lost I ever took 
Was losing what we've begun 
And the greatest song I ever heard 
Was the one we never sung 
Now the reddest red I've always said 
Is the sunset coming down 
Soon the blackest night that kills the light 
Is the only thing around 
And the downest down I ever been 
Is when I knew my race was run 
And the greatest song I ever heard 
Was the one we never sung 
Time will kill the pain they say 
And we'll live to love another day 
If you wanna win you got to play the game 
Now the greatest break came on the day 
We were standing in the rain 
And the hardest hurt I've ever know 
Was when you tried to ease my pain 
And the longest day in history 
Waiting till my crying's done 
And the saddest song I ever heard 
Was the one we finally sung.</field>

You'll met his glaze both barrels blaze 
Staring you down 
Love is the gunman and no mercy has he

You can even saddle up and ride 
But love won't be deny 
You can wear a disguise 
But it isn't fooled by alibis

Bored to tears the band just played the Tango 
You walked in, suddenly I'm in a spin 
There you are just like a hero 
More than cool than Brando and Dienero 
Dressed to kil, Boy, I think you know you'll wil 
Just like a time bomb tickin' away 
No way to stop this runaway train 
(Chours)-You got The Look that makes me weak 
Something in your eyes words can't speak 
And you can cast a spell on me like a bullet to my heart 
You gotta move a certain style, Just The Look of can drive me wild 
You got The Look that's got me hook 
I can't takes my eyes off you 
Verse-(Whats the Story)Whats the story I watch you stealing kisses. 
Broken hearts and tears are so delicous 
(Watch that man)Boy you know your into me 
Oh, whats the use pretending I dont to: tease you taste you turn you on and 
trunt you 
Come to me, Oh, show me no mercy (Oh, show me no mercy) 
I'm flying too close to the sun 
Oh, but it's a beautiful way to burn, oooohhhhh 
(chours) 
(Musicl Break) 
(Touch me, Touch me, Oh, you know you gotta touch me,touch me, Oh yeah!) 
(Musicl Break) 
I'm headed straight into the sun 
And now I'm burnin; up! 
I'm burnin' up 
(Chours) 
No, No, No, tuch me taste me, tell me that u want me, keep me comin' back you 
know you got me 
'Coz you got that look. 
Ooh, and baby it's my world that's shook 
Oh, cast a spell I know you got the Voodo 
No one makes me feel the way that you do 
It's The Look that's got me hooked

Can't takes my eyes off you.</field>

I know it won't say 
We won't say a word 
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday 
Maybe Monday maybe not 
Still I'm gonna meet him one day 
Cause maybe Tuesday will be 
My good news day 
He'll build a little home meant just for 2 
From which I'll never, never run with you 
And so all else above 
I'm waiting for the man I love 
He's gonna look at me and smile

No more his eager call. 
Oh the writing's on the wall. 
Dreams have all gone astray. 
The man that won you 
Has gone off and undone you. 
That great beginning 
Has seen its final inning. 
Don't know what happened. 
It's all a crazy game. 
No more, no more that old time thrill. 
Oh honey, you've been through the mill. 
And never a new love will be the same. 
Good riddance, oh good bye. 
Every trick of his you're on to. 
But fools will be fools and where's he gone to? 
The road gets rougher. 
It's lonelier and it's tougher 
With hope you burn up 
Tomorrow, tomorrow he may turn up. 
There's just no let up 
The live long night at day. 
Ever since this world began 
There ain't nothing sadder than 
A one-man woman pining for the man that got away..</field>

Every good boy needs it, every bad girl breeds it 
No matter what I see I believe, I believe 
It's stronger than anybody any man has ever made 
Chorus x 2 
The power, the power, the power 
If I believe in you and me 
Do we believe that the power's gonna be alright 
In just my mind, yeah, yeah 
In the power, the power of love 
I believe in the power, the power of love baby.</field>

Walk the streets I know the way 
I know the way 
CHORUS: 
Did you wonder how we got to this place? 
And as I watched my world go walking out the door 
I see I won the peace but I have lost the war 
And I know, I know that love is give 
And sometimes take 
Next time I won't make the same mistake 
Break the chains they couldn't hold you anyway 
Pray to God, this too will pass 
Raise your glass to old acquaintances and friends 
Talk to me, cause I can bend, I can bend 
Did you ever think that we turn out this way 
And as I watch my world go walking out the door 
I see I won the peace, but I have lost the war 
And I know, I know that love is give 
And sometimes take 
Next time baby I won't make the same mistake 
Same mistake

About things we've gone through 
Though it's hurting me 
Now it's history 
I've played all my cards 
And that's what you've done, too 
Nothing more to say 
No more ace to play 
The winner takes it all 
The loser's standing small 
Beside the victory 
That's her destiny 
I was in your arms 
Thinking I belonged there 
I figured it made sense 
Building me a fence 
Building me a home 
Thinking I'd be strong there 
But I was a fool 
Playing by the rules 
The gods may throw the dice 
Their minds as cold as ice 
And someone way down here 
Loses someone dear 
The winner takes it all (takes it all) 
The loser has to fall (has to fall) 
It's simple and it's plain (it seems plain) 
Why should I complain? (why complain) 
But tell me, does she kiss 
Like I used to kiss you? 
Does it feel the same 
When she calls your name? 
Somewhere deep inside 
You must know I miss you 
But what can I say? 
Rules must be obeyed 
The judges will decide (they decide) 
The likes of me abide (we abide) 
Spectators of the show (of the show) 
Always staying low (staying low) 
The game is on again (on again) 
A lover or a friend (or a friend) 
A big thing or a small (big or small) 
The winner takes it all (takes it all) 
I don't wanna talk 
If it makes you feel sad 
And I understand 
You've come to shake my hand 
I apologize 
If it makes you feel bad 
Seeing me so tense 
No self-confidence 
But you see, the winner takes it all 
The winner takes it all 
So the winner 
Takes it all 
And the loser 
Has to fall 
Throw a dice 
Cold as ice 
Way down here 
Someone dear 
Takes it all 
Has to fall 
It seems plain 
Why complain</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Read your note this mornin'. 
'Bye-Bye girl', that's all it said. 
Glad I found it first, 
before the kids got out of bed. 
Baked a tray of muffins. 
Hung some wet-wash out to dry. 
By the time the kids got up, 
I could look them in the eye. 
You've gone away, you've gone away. 
How will I get though the day? 
This God-forsaken day. 
Drank some bitter coffee. 
Read your note ten times or more. 
When I'd washed the dishes twice, 
I got down and scrubbed the floor. 
Empty chair at supper. 
Everybodys actin' strange. 
Food just gettin' cold. 
Kids real quiet for a change. 
You've gone away, you've gone away. 
How will I get through the day? 
This God-forsaken day. 
Rain was fallin' hard 
as I walked slowly up the stairs. 
Pushed my tears back down 
as I stood listenin' 
to their prayers. 
There's your empty pillow. 
Your side's flat right to the wall. 
Now's the time for private cryin'. 
Now it hurts me 
most of all. 
You've gone away. 
I turn off the light. 
How will I get through the night? 
This God-forsaken night. 
This long and lonesome, God-forsaken night..</field>

So your heart's gotta go there

For the broken hearted, battle scarred 
I'll be by your side 
And this is a song for the lonely 
When your dreams won't come true 
Can you hear this prayer 
Cause someone's there for you 
Well love don't need a reason 
She can pick you up or leave you bleeding 
I've seen a strong man cry 
I know the reason why 
We all forgive 
We all forget 
And just keep believing 
This is a song for the lonely

You don't have to look no more

There must be someplace you can go 
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama, 
There must be someone you know. 
God knows, you’re lookin’ good enough, 
But you’re so smooth and the world’s so rough. 
You might have somethin’ to loose. 
Oh, no, pretty mama, what you gonna 
Do in those shoes? 
Got those pretty little straps around my ankles 
Got those shiny little chains around my heart. 
I got to have my independence 
I don’t know just where to start. 
Desperation in the singles bars 
An’ all the gilrs in the fancy cars. 
I can’t believe my reviews. 
 
Oh, no, I can’t do that, 
Once I started wearin’ those shoes 
They’re lookin’ at you, leanin’ on you 
Tell you anything you want to hear 
They give you tablets of love 
They’re waiting for you 
Got to score you 
Handy with a shovel and so sincere 
Ooh, they got the kid glove 
 
I just want someone to talk to 
They just wanna get their hands on you 
You get whatever you choose 
Oh, no, I can’t do that, 
Once you started wearin’ those shoes. 
Oh no ! you can do that! 
Once you started wearin’ those shoes

Felt so good to hear your footsteps 
Walk across my bedroom floor 
Chorus: 
I knew that you were coming 
By the thunderstorm last night 
I swear I heard the north wind call your name 
But a clear sky of blue stars 
And the darling man you are 
Makes it feel so good lying here next to you 
This dusty town has needed rain 
Like I've been needing you 
So hold me tight as only you can do 
By the light of just one candle 
I feel your warm hands touching me 
While our shadows move together 
In the sweetest harmony

Seen all the world and how the story will be over 
Through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed 
Now we have found the light that guides us over 
Through the falling rain we travelled far and wide 
And through the blackest darkness 
Stars above shining bright 
Through the sun and winter rain will fall 
All our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call 
We're walking hand in hand in dreams and endless time 
How do we know when we will leave this life behind? 
Stare at life through eyes of mine the hate the fear and the pain 
There's a feeling held deep inside, when life you live is in vain 
Life life you live is in vain 
[REFRÃO] 
Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday 
We close your eyes to see the light of brighter days 
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal 
With the trail of broken hearts flying free 
Once again we walk this lonely road 
There are times that we were wading through the rain and cold 
We're lost in memories of what we left behind 
Relive the dreams, the endless screams of pain inside 
Lives are filled with emptiness 
The fear returns once again 
Searching endlessly you can not 
Drown your mind in the pain 
Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday 
We close your eyes to see the light of brighter days 
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal 
With the trail of broken hearts flying free 
The last temptation will be all that's left for me 
When I see those tears you cried 
When I hear those lies you lied 
When I see your creation falling down on me 
Is this the reason to be? 
Solos:

Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday

Oh the camel back is broken 
By the one extra straw added on 
And a woman can't see reason 
When her last ray of sunshine is gone 
There's a finger on the trigger 
And that locomotive sound 
And I think how much I love you 
And I turn the gun around

You could have stayed outside my heart 
But in you came 
And here you'll stay 
Until it's time for you to go 
Don't ask why of me 
Don't ask how 
Don't ask forever 
Love me, love me now 
This love of mine had no beginning 
It has no end 
I was an oak, now I'm a willow 
I can bend 
And though I'll never in my life 
See you again 
Still, I'll stay 
Until it's time for you to go</field>

Through your troubles times 
I'll be for you what you've been for me

It easy to forget what life's about 
But you know I'm your cure 
So wear that smile we need

And I boarded the plane 
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues 
In the middle of the pouring rain W.C 
Handy - 
won't you look down over me Yeah 
I got a first class ticket 
But I'm as blue as a girl can be 
Then I'm walking in Memphis 
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale 
Walking in Memphis But do I really feel the way I feel 
Saw the ghost of Elvis On Union Avenue 
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland 
Then I watched him walk right through 
Now secured that I did not see him 
He just hovered around his tomb 
But there's a pretty little thing Waiting for the King 
Down in the Jungle Room 
(Chorus) 
They've got catfish on the table 
They've got gospel in the air 
And Reverend Green be glad to see you 
When you haven't got a prayer 
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis 
Now Gabriel plays piano Every Friday at the Hollywood 
And they brought me down to see him 
And they asked me if I would - Do a little number 
And I sang with all my might And he said - 
Tell me are you a Christian child? 
And I said Ma'am I am tonight

What about your loves 
What about your dreams 
What about the change tomorrow brings 
What about the moonlight 
What about the way you sigh 
When it touches you 
On your knees in the teeth of failure 
It's got you gagged and bound 
You say it's killing you but listen now I'm tellin' you 
Your better days are to come 
Set your sights on simple beauty 
Like the way that my eyes shine when I'm around you 
What about your loves 
What about your dreams 
What about the change tomorrow brings 
What about the moonlight 
What about the way you sigh 
When it touches you 
Nobody said it would be easy 
To take the fall and stand 
Just wrap your arms tight around me 
And we'll stumble together, until we learn to dance

What about your dreams 
What about the change tomorrow brings 
What about the moonlight

Here come the stars tumbling around me,

I'd be a fool to go on and o....n. 
No one would care, no one would cry, if I should live or die.

When the money's gone, will you be my friend 
Float a small row boat, till a ship comes in 
When the winter nights, chill us to the soul 
Will you feed the fire, spin the straw to gold 
When the money's gone 
When the money's gone, will you get cold feet 
Will you still be there, if the ends don't meet 
If we're in the red, just forget the green 
Take a bus with me, no more limousines 
When the money's gone 
Will you still want me 
Oh what a fine life, I give to you 
All you ever want 
Will you still be there, will you pull me through 
When the cash don't come 
ohh And if you're mine 
Will you still love me 
Whenever we fall 
When the money's gone 
Chorus 
Oh you will want me baby 
Oh need me baby 
Oh you will love me baby 
When the money's gone(repeat) 
When the money's gone 
No more caviar 
Will you eat fast food in a beat up car 
Live life modestly, lost in lotto dreams 
Will you find your way 
Through it all with me 
Through it all with me 
Will you still love me 
Oh what a fine life I give to you 
All you ever want 
Will you still be there 
Will you pull me through

Oh will you want me baby 
Oh need baby

No crying, no dying, no praying for you to come back. 
When you're out the door 
That don't mean I won't mean I won't breathe no more 
And I will not beg you to stay when you walk, 
When you walk, when you walk away 
Coz I refuse to give you the right 
To cause these eyes to cry at night 
I'm well prepared to live my life without you 
Without you. 
When you walk away 
You wont walk away with my heart 
There will be no tears in the dark 
No cring, no dying, no begging 
When you're out the door 
That don't mean I won't breathe no more 
and I will not beg you to stay 
When you walk, When you walk, when you walk away 
When you walk away 
Just walk away 
Please walk away..</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Yeah I got a reputation 
Never had a single thought of settling down 
As the train gonna left the station 
Never shed a single tear just, said my good-byes. 
But you touched me deep inside 
Now I can’t believe 
I'm the one who's looking back 
As you said good-bye to me. 
Chorus: 
Whenever you’re near, I’m in ecstasy 
Whenever you’re gone, I’m in misery 
Don’tcha know that you bring out the best in me 
Whenever you’re near. 
Yeah ‘cause my share of sorrow 
I walked off on promises and love's passed me by 
But now you’ve turned the tables 
See you make me feel as though it's my turn to die. 
There's a little girl inside 
Who's lost on her way 
Only you can bring me back 
I know you know the words to say. 
Chorus 
I feel your chemistry, boy watcha do to me 
I lose all control 
And when the morning comes, yeah you loved and gone 
Don’tcha know I need it over and over and over and over again. 
Yeah you touched me deep inside 
Now I can’t say no 
Dragged my heart around 
I'm never gonna let you go. 
Whenever you’re near, I’m in ecstasy 
Whenever you're gone, I’m in misery 
Boy you don’t understand whatcha do to me.

Where do you go when you.re too young 
You found a world thatâ€™s just begun 
Whoâ€™s gonna say donâ€™t stay too long, or right from wrong, who leads you on 
Where do you go, I donâ€™t know 
Ask your Mom but right now sheâ€™s mad, the night before she fought your dad 
Sheâ€™s help you out if she had the time, but your Dad is sad and your Motherâ€™s crying 
Where do you go, I donâ€™t know 
So youâ€™re down on your knees and you hope that helps 
You just canâ€™t think of nothinâ€™ else 
How do you pray and what do you say, let me know right away 
God show me the way, where do you go, I donâ€™t know.</field>

We can't go on this way 
Should I go or stay

That one woman could give a man 
So when you gonna recognize and realize 
What we had 
(Now tell me) 
Who you gonna believe, her or me? 
What's it gonna be, Who you gonna believe? 
Before your heart shatters, love is all that matters 
You put me through that lover's game over and over 
Someday someone's gonna put you through the same 
Lover to lover, I hope you don't find out too late 
I hope you never have to feel the pain 
'Cause if you lose the love you took for granted 
That you could never appreciate 
Who you gonna believe, her or me? 
Who's it gonna be, who you gonna believe? 
Before you make up your mind 
You better take some time 
What about me, don't you think I need a man here 
Standing by my side 
And what about you, you need a woman to hold you 
Through those cold and lonely nights 
Oh, what about us, we belong together for ever and ever. 
Oh, I'll be there if you should ever need me 
Oh, I know everything will work out fine, just believe 
Oh, I know cause we've been through this a million times 
Keep on believing well I hope you don't find out too late 
Hope you never have to feel the pain 
Cause if you lose the love you took for granted 
That you could never appreciate, after all this time 
Who you gonna believe, her or me? 
Who's it gonna be, who you gonna believe? 
Who are you fooling 
Well you're not fooling me no 
Who you gonna believe, you can risk it all 
With someone else's world 
Wondering if it's love 
Baby oh baby, you should know by now 
You can believe in me.</field>

Nobody said that it was easy to love

Feels like I'm headed down a dead end street 
But feels not half as strong as destiny 
Darlin wait for me 
Will you wait for me 
My arm was rusty and my vision is weak 
But still I see the path to you 
I know you're praying for a miracle babe 
And I'm sayin' that same prayer too 
The way you look at me 
its so obvious 
I'm the only one

It still wouldn't be enough

I guess I'm meant to stand alone

They're beaten down and battered 
You're so afraid you don't deserve it all 
But you're not the only thing

How can I live without you in my heart 
When I walk out this time 
It'll tear me apart

You see her waitin' 
On the street for her ride 
In an hour she'll be working 
In a tower made of steel in the sky 
She's just a pawn in the struggle 
In a never-ending fight to survive 
Mama had to play someone else's game 
You learn to keep it inside 
CHORUS: 
Working girl, livin' in a man's world 
Working girl, you gotta take a stand girl 
The boss checks out her body 
She's on the phone tellin' his lies 
Run and get the coffee 
And a smile hides the rage in her eyes 
Tonight she's searching for a reason 
As she's walking home alone in the rain 
Mama had to play someone else's game 
Someday she's breakin' the chain 
Chorus 
Nobody knows the dreams 
She dares to dream 
The plans she had made 
Or the times she has prayed inside 
Or what tears at her pride

Hey baby, I get my strength from you 
I only pray that I may bring you 
A brighter day 
That’s why I’m living

But I'm going away 
No, we're not mad, kids 
It's hard to say why 
Your mother and I 
Don't see eye to eye 
 
Say your prayers before you go to bed 
Make sure you get yourself to school on

I know you'll do the things your mother 
asks 
She's gonna need you most to stay in

Keep in mind your mother's gonna need 
Your help a whole lot more than she 
ever did before 
No more fights over little things 
because 
I won't be here to stop them anymore 
I know you don't want this, neither do 
we 
But sometimes things happen 
That we can't foresee 
Now try to be calm, kids 
And don't look so sad 
Just cause I am leaving 
I'll still be your dad 
Just remember I love you 
And though I'm not here 
Just call if you need me 
And I'll always be near

Well, I have to go now 
So kiss me goodbye

So you can let me down again 
Well it doesn't really matter 
What you say or do 
You can tell me that you love me 
But I know it ain't true 
Cause you wouldn't know love 
If it knocked down your door 
You wouldn't know it now 
You never knew it before 
If it landed in your hands 
From the heavens above 
You wouldn't know love 
(You wouldn't know love) 
No you wouldn't know love 
Said you changed 
Said you done me wrong 
But you won't do it anymore 
No darling, I don't have to tell you 
Where I heard that line before 
Baby, you would say anything 
To get back into my heart 
When it comes to loving 
You don't even know where to start 
Did you think that I would believe 
Anything that you said 
Let you come back to me 
Baby, there's just no way 
Baby, I've had enough 
You wouldn't know love.</field>

And you need some loving care 
And nothing, nothing is going right 
Close your eyes and think of me 
And soon I will be there 
To brighten up even your darkest night 
CHORUS: 
You just call out my name 
And you know wherever I am 
I'll come running to see you again 
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there 
You've got a friend 
If the sky above you 
Grows dark and full of clouds 
And that old north wind begins to blow 
Keep you head together 
And call my name out loud 
Soon you'll hear me 
Knocking at you door 
Chorus 
Ain't it good to know 
That you've got a friend 
When people can be so cold 
They'll hurt you, and desert you 
And take your soul if you let them 
################################################### 
Wanting you tha way I do 
I only want to be with you 
And I would go to the ends of the earth 
Cause, darling, to me that's you're worth 
Where you lead, I will follow 
Anywhere that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow where you lead 
If you're out on the road 
Feeling lonely, and so cold 
All you have to do is call my name 
And I'll be there in the next train 
Where you lead, I will follow 
Anywhere that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow where you lead 
I always wanted a real home with flowers on the window sill 
But if you want to live in New York city, honey, you know I will 
I never thought I could get satisfaction from just one man 
But if anyone can keep me happy, you're the one who can 
And where you lead, I will follow 
Anywhere that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow where you lead</field>

But when it came to loving you 
I spend my whole life with you 
Cause you came and took control 
You touched my very soul 
You always showed me that 
Loving you was where it’s at 
You made me so very happy 
I’m so glad you came into my life 
Thank you baby, yeah 
I love you so much you see 
Even in my dreams 
I can hear you

I’m so in love with you 
All I ever wanna do is 
Just thank you baby

They say you can make it 
If you're young and pretty 
Dreams must be tall 
Ain't it a pity 
But they say you can make it 
If you're young and pretty 
So I sit inside my dressing room 
Waiting for the band to play 
And I wonder what is left to loose 
Where is anyone, any way 
Outside a neon, face from exhaustion 
Screaming with promise of what's inside 
But nobody's watching 
I go for the money, my wallet's a liar 
Nothing inside cause the world is on fire 
So I give them that old routine 
No one listens, any way 
When I fight for what it means 
God I wish I had someone here today 
So I give them that old routine 
No one listens, any way 
When I fight for what it means 
God I wish I had someone here today 
Come from the suburbs into the city 
They say you can make it

Come from the sidelines into the city 
They say you can make it

Make believe you’re mine, love

All I ask is one night 
Till the morning sun light 
Won’t you stay here in my arms 
And baby

So consumed in all your doom, ooh

Left the puzzle undone, is that the way it is?

No matter what we say (no matter what we say) 
We're the song inside the tune (yeah, oh yeah) 
Full of beautiful mistakes 
And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go) 
The sun will always shine (sun will always shine) 
But tomorrow we might awake on the other side 
'Cause we are beautiful, no matter what they say 
Yes, words won't bring us down, oh no 
We are beautiful in every single way 
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no

Would you tell me I was wrong 
Would you help me understand 
Are you looking down upon me 
Are you proud of who I am 
There's nothing I wouldn't do to have just one more chance 
To look into your eyes 
And see you looking back 
Ooh I'm sorry for blaming you

You do not owe them 
Your body and your soul 
All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older 
And all the truth in a girl 
is too precious to be stolen from her 
It's just the way it is 
Maybe it's never gonna change 
But I got a mind to show my strength 
And I got a right to speak my mind 
And I'm gonna pay for this 
They're gonna burn me at the stake 
But I got a fire in my veins 
I wasn't made to fall in line 
No, I wasn't made to fall in line, no 
Show some skin, make him want you 
'Cause God forbid you 
Know your own way home 
And ask yourself why it matters 
Who it flatters 
You're more than flesh and bones

            <field name="lyrics">After all you put me through 
You'd think I despise you 
But in the end, I wanna thank you 
'Cause you make me that much stronger 
When I, thought I knew you 
Thinking that you were true 
I guess I, I couldn't trust 
Called your bluff, time is up 
'Cause I've had enough 
You were, there by my side 
Always down for the ride 
But your, joy ride just came down in flames 
'Cause your greed sold me out of shame 
After all of the stealing and cheating 
You probably think that I hold resentment for you 
But, oh no, you're wrong 
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do 
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through 
So I wanna say thank you 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Never saw it coming 
All of your backstabbing 
Just so you could cash in 
On a good thing before I realized your game 
I heard you're going round 
Playing the victim now 
But don't even begin 
Feeling I'm the one to blame 
'Cause you dug your own grave 
After all of the fights and the lies 
Yes you wanted to harm me but that won't work anymore 
No more, oh no, it's over 
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture 
I wouldn't know how to be this way now 
And never back down 
So I wanna say thank you 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
Makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
It makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
How could this man I thought I knew 
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel 
Could only see the good in you 
Pretended not to see the truth 
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself 
Through living in denial 
But in the end you'll see 
You won't stop me 
I am a fighter and I 
I ain't goin' stop 
There is no turning back 
I've had enough 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Thought I would forget 
But I remember 
So I remember 
I'll remember 
Thought I would forget 
But I remember 
So I remember 
I'll remember 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter</field>

            <field name="lyrics">So what am I not supposed to have an opinion 
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman 
Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind 
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled 
When a female fires back 
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act 
So he does what any little boy will do 
Making up a few false rumors or two 
That for sure is not a man to me 
Slanderin' names for popularity 
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy 
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say 
This is for my girls all around the world 
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth 
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard 
So what do we do girls? 
Shout out loud! 
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground 
Lift your hands high and wave them proud 
Take a deep breath and say it loud 
Never can, never will, can't hold us down 
Nobody can hold us down 
Nobody can hold us down 
Nobody can hold us down 
Never can, never will 
So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying 
Are you offended by the message I'm bringing 
Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing 
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing 
If you look back in history 
It's a common double standard of society 
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score 
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore 
I don't understand why it's okay 
The guy can get away with it and the girl gets named 
All my ladies come together and make a change 
Start a new beginning for us everybody sing 
This is for my girls all around the world 
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth 
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard 
What do we do girls? 
Shout out loud! 
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground 
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud 
Take a deep breath and say it loud 
Never can, never will, can't hold us down 
Check it - Here's something I just can't understand 
If the guy have three girls then he's the man 
He can either give us some head, sex her off 
If the girl do the same, then she's a whore 
But the table's about to turn 
I'll bet my fame on it 
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it 
It's aiight though, you can't hold me down 
I got to keep on movin' 
To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack 
Do it right back to him and let that be that 
You need to let him know that his game is whack 
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back 
But you're just a little boy 
Think you're so cute, so coy 
You must talk so big 
To make up for smaller things 
So you're just a little boy 
All you'll do is annoy 
You must talk so big 
To make up for smaller things 
This is for my girls... 
This is for my girls all around the world 
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth 
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard 
So what do we do girls? 
Should out loud! 
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground 
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud 
Take a deep breath and say it loud

For a century of lonely nights 
Waiting for someone to release me 
You're lickin' your lips 
And blowing kisses my way 
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away 
Baby baby baby (baby, baby, baby) 
Ooooh (my body's sayin' let's go)

If you wanna be with me 
Baby there's a price to pay 
I'm a genie in a bottle 
You gotta rub me the right way 
If you wanna be with me 
I can make your wish come true 
You gotta make a big impression 
I gotta like what you do 
I'm a genie in a bottle baby 
You gotta rub me the right way honey 
I'm a genie in a bottle baby 
Come, come, come on and let me out 
The music's banging and the light's down low 
Just one more dance and we're good to go 
Waitin' for someone who needs me 
Hormones racing at the speed of light 
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight 
Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby)

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night 
He really got me working up an appetite 
He had tattoos up and down his arm 
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm 
He's a one-stop shop, makes my panties drop 
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman 
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman 
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah 
He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine 
We drank champagne and we danced all night 
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise 
(a big surprise) 
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline 
He's a one-stop shop, makes my cherry pop

Tight hip huggers, low for sure 
Shake a little somethin' on the floor

Sweatin' till my clothes come off 
Let's get open, cause a commotion 
Still goin', eight in the mornin' 
There's no stoppin', we keep it poppin'

Yo Christina (what?), better hop in here 
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (yeah)

What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Ooh ohh, yeah yeah 
I wanna thank you 
For giving me, time to breathe 
Like a rock you waited so patiently 
While I got it together, oh 
While I figured it out 
I only looked but I never touched 
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us 
Holding hands, making plans 
And it's lucky for me you understand 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever keeps me in your arms 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me 
What I want is what you got 
And what you got, is what I want 
There was a time I was blind, I was so confused 
Run away just to hide it all from you. 
But baby, you knew me better than I knew myself 
They say if you love something let it go 
If it comes back it's yours 
That's how you know 
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure 
And you're ready and willin' 
To give me more than 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free 
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever keeps me in your arms 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me 
Oh baby, oh darling 
Thank you, thank you 
A girl needs 
Somebody sensitive but tough 
Somebody there when the going gets rough 
Every night he'll be giving his love 
(He'll be giving his love) 
To just one girl (to one girl, oh) 
Somebody cool but real tender too 
Somebody, baby, just like you 
Can keep me hanging around 
With the one who always knew... 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free 
Ohh oh, I'm thanking you for being there for me 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever keeps me in your arms is what I neeed, ohh... 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free... 
Always what I need, always what I want 
What I need, what I want, and you've got, yeah yeah 
Oh baby, I thank you, cause you know... 
What you got, is what I need 
What you want, hahaha, what I want 
Ooh, ohh yeah 
Oh baby, oh darling 
I thank you, thank you 
For giving me what I need 
And for what I want 
Ohh...oh yeah yeah 
(Ooh, oh oh)

Maria, don't you hear me calling, Maria? 
Maria, girl you know you were the only one 
How was I supposed to know? 
That it would cost my soul 
Nothin is free', outchea 
I wanna breathe outchea 
And how am I supposed to face this lonely life I've created? 
Is that the price that I'm payin' 
I wanna feel it 
All my life, wouldn't give up 
Was too young too know the difference 
How did I get so low? 
When did I turn so cold 
Inside of my own mind, I believe my own lies 
I'm facing the mirror 
Where, where, where is Maria? 
Why, why, why don't I see her? 
I, I just wanna see her 
Why, why, why don't I see her? 
I, I just need to see ya, Maria 
Now do you hear it in my voice? 
That I'm tryna make a choice 
I don't know which way to go at this crossroads 
You done taped my mouth shut 
Make me feel worthless, used up 
So tired of painting all this makeup 
'Cause it won't hide my deep cuts 
Eyes open but can't see 
Mouth open but can't speak 
I'm facing the mirror 
Where, where, where is Maria? 
Why, why, why don't I see her? 
I, I just wanna see her 
Where, where, where is Maria? 
Oh, I just wanna see ya, Maria 
Oh my lord 
Can you take away this heavy load? 
I can't carry it anymore 
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour? 
Oh my lord 
Can you take away this heavy load? 
I can't carry it anymore 
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour? 
Hear my plea for sympathy 
I just want you here with me 
Hear my plea for sympathy 
I just want you here with me 
Hear my plea for sympathy 
I just want you here with me 
Hear my plea for sympathy 
You keep running away 
Can you hear me callin'? 
My whole world is fallin' 
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya 
Can you hear me callin'? 
My whole world is fallin' 
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya 
Don't keep on runnin' away (you keep on runnin' away) 
Don't run away, don't run away, no 
Don't run away, don't run away, no 
Don't you keep on runnin' from me

Why is my reflection someone I don't know? 
Must I pretend that I'm someone else for all time?

I'll be right here when your world starts to fall 
Young girl, it's alright 
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly 
When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream 
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems 
No one ever wants or bothers to explain 
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means 
Chorus: 
When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within 
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within 
Young girl, don't hide 
You'll never change if you just run away 
Young girl, just hold tight 
Soon you're gonna see your brighter day 
Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed 
It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid 
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold 
When you're lost outside look inside to your soul 
Repeat Chorus 
When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within 
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within 
Yeah... 
Life is a journey 
It can take you anywhere you choose to go 
As long as you're learning 
You'll find all you'll ever need to know (be strong) 
You'll break it (hold on) 
You'll make it (be strong) 
Just don't forsake it because 
(No one can tell you what you can't do) 
No one can stop you, you know that I'm talking to you 
Repeat Chorus 
When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within 
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within

I'll be right here when your world starts to fall

A guy what takes his time, I'll go for any time 
I'm a fast movin' gal who likes them slow 
Got no use for fancy driving, wanna to see a guy arriving in low 
I'd be satisfied, electrified to know a guy what takes his time 
A hurry-up affair, I always give the air 
Wouldn't give any rushing gent a smile 
I would go for any single who would condescend to linger awhile 
What a lullaby would be supplied to have a guy who takes his time, ooh 
A guy what takes his time, I'd go for any time 
A hasty job really spoils a master's touch 
I don't like a big commotion, I'm a demon for slow motion or such 
Why should I deny that I would die to know a guy who takes his time 
There isn't any fun in getting something done 
If you're rushed when you have to make the grade 
I can spot an amateur, appreciate a connesseur in trade 
Who would qualify, no alibi, to be the guy who takes his time 
Ooh, ooh...</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I've been so many places in my life and time 
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme 
I've acted out my life in stages 
With ten thousand people watching 
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you 
I know your image of me is what I hope to be 
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see 
There's no one more important to me 
Darling can't you please see through me 
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, with holdin' nothin' 
You came out in front and I was hiding oh yeah 
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together 
Listen to the melody 'cause my love's in there hiding 
ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah ohh 
I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine 
And when my life is over, remember when we were together, together 
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you 
Oh I, oh I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
I've loved you, I've loved you, loved you for my life, oh, you're a friend of mine 
And when my life is over, remember when we were together baby 
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you, ooh 
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you 
Say, we were alone and I was singin' my song, 
Hey, Singin' my song, singin' my song, singin' my song

            <field name="lyrics">She sits alone, 
In the abandont corner, of her room, (oh her room) 
Lost her life, her lovely past, ooo ooo ooo ooo 
She used to love, feel and have compation, 
But now her life has lead nowhere, nowhere(hold 4 count) 
She feels attached, 
And can't come loose, 
Like strings holding on, 
She can't let go, 
She begs and pleads, 
As she tries to relase, 
And falls to her knees (hold 4 counts) 
Whats holding her back? 
No one has know, 
Maybe her shadow, 
The shadow of doom, 
She is miserable each day, each week 
While tears begin to run down her cheeks 
Hoping for her day to come,(hold 4 counts) 
For her to pry loose, 
The day has not begun.. 
(o when?) 
She feels attached, 
And can't come loose, 
Like strings holding on, 
She can't let go, 
She begs and pleads, 
As she tries to relase, 
And falls to her kneeeees 
(oh oh hold last "oh" 4 counts) 
Stings, strings, 
They hold her back, 
No one has notcied, 
Or cared, 
No one knows, what's she is really like, 
Deep down inside, 
Oh what's there to hide? 
She is nervous, frightened, scared and weak, 
She must peer or peak from that .. 
Corner of the room, 
Open her eyes, and face doom (hold doom 4 counts) 
Maybe she has, maybe she did, 
She woke up one day and saw the light, 
Her love and compasion, had all faded away, 
As she ran through her shadow, and began to 
Beg and plead as she fell to her knees and finally, 
She broke loose</field>

Slowly I'm holding you closely 
You're wrapped in my arms

I tell you my fears, telling you everything 
Telling the truth to you gives me wings 
Free with my words, free as a bird 
I am flying high 
Looking at you, everything new, you are my life 
You bring me hope when I can't breathe 
And you give me love, you're all I need

No need for touch 
No need for answers 'cause I've heard enough 
I've just found a chest some place out of reach 
I enter the darkness and claim my release 
And open my, open my heart 
Sing like a nightingale 
Open my, open my hands 
When no one else understands 
I just close my eyes and count to ten 
Breathe in twice and open them 
Know where to go cause I've been there before 
In my mind it is near 
I escape all I fear 
So by closing my eyes 
I am anywhere but here 
There's no need for anger 
Religion or faith 
One blade of grief 
Will always remain 
It's not on the paper 
Or a story book 
It's a place to reunite with all that was took 
And open my, open my heart 
Sing like a nightingale 
Open my, open my hands 
When no one else understands 
I just close my eyes and count to ten 
Breathe in twice and open them 
Know where to go cause I've been there before 
In my mind it is near 
I escape all I fear 
So by closing my eyes 
I am anywhere but here 
Picture a land where you never have been 
Where life is eternal and evergreen 
The future of happiness and certainty 
You're loved and you're lost there for now and eternity 
I just close my eyes and count to ten 
Breathe in twice and open them 
Know where to go cause I've been there before 
In my mind it is near 
I escape all I fear

            <field name="lyrics">I've been standing where you left me 
Praying that you'd come and get me 
But now I found my second wind 
Now I found my second skin 
Well I know what you were thinking 
You thought you'd watch me fade away 
When you broke me into pieces 
But I gave each piece a name 
One of me is wiser 
One of me is stronger 
One of me is a fighter 
And there's a thousand faces of me 
And we're gonna rise up 
And we're gonna rise up 
For every time you broke me 
Well you're gonna face an army 
Army of me 
Welcome to my revolution 
All your walls are breaking down 
It's time you had a taste of losing 
Time the table's turned around 
I see a glimpse of recognition 
But it's too late ugh it's too late 
And what you thought was your best decision 
Just became your worst mistake 
One of me is wiser 
One of me is stronger 
One of me is a fighter 
And there's a thousand faces of me 
And we're gonna rise up 
And we're gonna rise up 
For every time you broke me 
You're gonna face an army 
Army of me 
So how does it feel 
To know that I beat you 
That I can defeat you 
Oh how does it feel 
'Cause it sure feels sweeter 
It sure feels sweeter to me 
Now that I'm wiser 
Now that I'm stronger 
Now that I'm a fighter 
There's a thousand faces of me 
And I'm gonna rise up 
And I'm gonna rise up 
For every time you broke me 
There's a thousand faces of me 
Yeah I'm gonna rise up 
Yeah I'm gonna rise up 
For every time you broke me 
Now you're gonna face an army 
Army of me</field>

My lonely days are over 
And life is like a song 
Ohh yeah yeah 
At last 
the skies above are blue 
My heart was wrapped up in clover 
The night I looked at you 
I found a dream, that I could speak to 
A dream that I can call my own 
I found a thrill to press my cheek to 
A thrill that I have never known 
Ohh yeah yeah... 
You smile, you smile 
oh And then the spell was cast 
And here we are in heaven 
For you are mine at last</field>

(Donny Hathaway, Leena Horne) 
(Miss Aretha, [The Real Thing] James Brown, Billie Holiday) 
(Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Louis Armstrong) 
(Minnie Riperton, Otis Redding, Etta James) 
Back in the day, they used to say: play that song, get it going and the band played 
And still today, you hear us say: play that song all night long, mr 
DJ 
Though times have changed, it's still the same, we all need a minute to get away 
So let it go and feel the flow, if you got soul, let the world know 
We're gonna set the mood, gonna go back to an old school groove 
Gonna rewind to another time, when the originators, innovators were alive, yeah 
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James, your Lady Day, and Coltrane 
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life the sound and vibe of yesterday 
Open your mind, enjoy the ride, live out tonight and grab that Soul Train 
Take it back, take it, back in the day, back in the day (oh baby) 
Back in the day, back in the day (won't you take me back?) 
Back in the day, back in the day (I'll do it) back in the day, back in the day 
Y'all remember back in the day, Ray Charles, King Cole, Miles Davis 
Yeah, now "Chain Of Fools" and "Respect" was the anthem of a woman, Aretha said 
"What's Going On", "Let's Get It On" such classic songs, don't forget them 
Though times have changed, they still remains my inspiration everyday 
So give it up for the ones who came before, opened up that door 
We're gonna set the mood, gonna go back to an old school groove 
Gonna rewind to another time, when the originators, innovators were alive, yeah 
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James, your Lady Day and Coltrane 
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life the sound and vibe of yesterday 
Open your mind, enjoy the ride, live out tonight and grab that Soul Train

Everyday is so wonderful, and suddenly, it's hard to breathe

I am beautiful in every single way 
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no 
So don't you bring me down today 
To all your friends, you're delirious 
So consumed in all your doom, ooh 
Trying hard to fill the emptiness, the pieces gone 
Left the puzzle undone, is that the way it is? 
You are beautiful, no matter what they say 
Words can't bring you down, oh no 
You are beautiful in every single way 
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no 
So don't you bring me down today 
No matter what we do (no matter what we do) 
No matter what we say (no matter what we say) 
We're the song inside the tune (yeah, oh yeah) 
Full of beautiful mistakes 
And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go) 
The sun will always shine (sun will always shine) 
But tomorrow we might awake on the other side 
'Cause we are beautiful, no matter what they say 
Yes, words won't bring us down, oh no 
We are beautiful in every single way

You stood by me, ignored their words 
You became, my best friend so true, oh yeah 
You believed in me 
When no one else did 
You gave me the strength to 
Move on, my friend 
You will always be 
The one I remember 
To give my thanks to 
For my success 
They just did not understand 
What I was going through 
My situation, they didn't care, no 
You tried to take a stand for me 
When I just could not 
Take it any longer 
You believed in me 
When no one else did 
You gave me the strength to 
Move on, my friend 
You will always be 
The one I remember 
To give my thanks to 
For my success 
I ohh, as I look back 
I can see how childish they were 
And you ohh, you showed me that 
We were so much more than they were 
I hope they can see their mistakes now 
And not do it to another 
But if they don't, I hope that person 
Finds someone like you 
Ohh... 
You believed in me

Yeah ohh, no, ohh yeah, oh

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet 
But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets 
But they're weird an they're wonderful 
Oh, Beannie she's really keen 
She's got electrice [eletric] boots a mohair suit 
You know I read it in a magazine 
Oh! Bennie and the Jets 
Hey kids, plug into the faithless 
Maybe they're blinded 
But Bennie makes them ageless 
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along 
Where we fight our parents out in the streets 
To find who's right and who's wrong</field>

Tough as nails 
Never feel 
Never fail

So damn wrong 
Feel the weight 
Of your hate 
I still bleed 
My heart aches 
As you take 
And you take 
Words cut through my skin 
Tears roll down my chin 
My walls crumble within 
But I'll take it all on 
And get up when I fall 
Till the last curtain call 
But you'll never get the best of me 
No more 
Said you'll never get the best of me 
No more 
Aren't you tired of throwing stones? 
Trying to kick me when I'm down? 
But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't 
Say I'm cold 
Made of ice 
Heart of stone 
Born to fight 
But I cry 
I still cry 
Are you happy? 
You know, 
I'm unhappy 
Alone 
Take your shot 
I'm wide open 
Words cut through my skin 
Tears roll down my chin 
My walls crumble within 
But I'll take it all on 
And get up when 
I fall 
Till the last curtain call 
 
But you'll never get the best of me 
No you won't 
Said you'll never get the best of me

Aren't you tired of throwing stones? 
Trying to kick me when

But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't

Said you'll never get the best of me 
No more 
Aren't you tired of throwing stones? 
Trying to kick me when 
I'm down? 
But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't 
Heartbroken and beaten 
Knocked down and mistreated 
I will rise undefeated 
I will not let you bring me down 
Now the pain is deleted 
And I will never repeat it 
I will rise undefeated 
I will not let you bring me down 
No I won't let you bring me down 
Knocked down and mistreated 
Heartbroken and beaten 
Still I rise undefeated 
Cause you'll never 
Cause you'll never get the best of me 
No you won't 
Said you'll never get the best of me 
No more 
Aren't you tired of throwing stones? 
Trying to kick me when 
I'm down? 
But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't 
Heartbroken and beaten 
Knocked down and mistreated 
I will rise undefeated 
I will not let you bring me down

Everything not quite what it seems to be 
Slipping and falling through the looking glass 
Catching a glimpse at all that lies behind the masks 
You disappear with the dawn 
You only see what you want 
When you are out with the birds of prey 
When you are out with the birds of prey 
They watch and they feed 
They take what they need 
They bite as you bleed 
The birds of prey 
Taking the blue pill only made you cry 
And all that the red pill did was make you forget why 
There is no right, there's no wrong 
You only see what you want 
When you are out with the birds of prey 
They watch and they feed 
They take what they need 
They bite as you bleed 
The birds of prey (4x) 
You disappear with the dawn 
You only see what you want 
There is no right, there's no wrong

            <field name="lyrics">When you talk all I hear is 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah 
(x2) 
Girls like you give girls a bad name 
Trying to get a boy but you sound so lame 
Thinking it's cute to act real dumb 
But the joke's on you, you're stupid hon 
Hold up, hold up, you're making no sense 
You're talking out your ass 
Like a wafflehead, you bobblehead 
Just keep your trap shut like your mamma said 
Why, oh, why pretend? 
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it? 
Why, oh, why pretend? 
If you so smart, why you act brain dead 
When you talk all I hear is 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah 
(x2) 
But wait, like, I don't get it 
He, he, ha I don't care what you looking at 
Body so skinny but your head's so fat 
Talky, talky, talky but you don't say shit 
Got a way with words, you give me nothing, bitch 
Banging on the door, nobody else there 
You're nightmare on Elm Street got everybody scared 
Make me wanna run when you coming around 
Because you're ugly it's a frightening sound 
Why, oh, why pretend? 
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it? 
Why, oh, why pretend? 
If you so smart, why you act brain dead 
When you talk all I hear is 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah... 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah... 
(x2) 
But wait, like, like what like, like what? 
I don't get it, like what, what really? 
Hanging with the girls makes you feel unsure 
So you hang with the boys, makes you feel secure 
Act all caddy cos you hate competition 
Rather like a sheep on your airhead mission 
Laugh in you face but behind your back 
They say "I kinda like her booty but the girl is 
whack" 
You see the boys, the boys they love me 
Think you're a pain in your butt? Know what? You're crazy. 
Why, oh, why pretend? 
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it? 
Why, oh, why pretend? 
If you so smart, why you act brain dead 
When you talk all I hear is 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah... 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah... 
(x2) 
When you talk all I hear is 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah wah 
(x2) 
And the real girls say I never play dumb 
To get what I want 
And always come out the one 
That's on top 
I never play dumb 
To get what I want 
And always come out the one 
That's on top 
I never play dumb 
To get what I want 
And always come out the one 
That's on top

Trapped in your love 
I've opened up, I'm sure I can trust 
My heart and I were buried in dust 
Free me, free us 
You're all I need when I'm holding you tight 
If you walk away I will suffer tonight 
I found a man I can trust 
And boy, I believe in us 
I am terrified to love for the first time 
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains? 
I've finally found my way 
I am bound to you 
I am bound to you 
So much, so young, I've faced on my own 
Walls I built up became my home 
I'm strong and I'm sure there's a fire in us 
Sweet love and so pure 
I catch my breath with just one beating heart 
And I embrace myself, please don't tear this apart 
I found a man I can trust 
And boy, I believe in us 
I am terrified to love for the first time 
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains? 
I've finally found my way 
I am bound to you 
I am bound to you 
Suddenly the moment's here 
I embrace my fears 
All that I have been carrying all these years 
Do I risk it all? Come this far just to fall? 
Fall 
I have entrusted and boy, I believe in us 
I am terrified to love for the first time 
Can you see that I'm bound in chains? 
And finally found my way 
I am bound to you 
I am, ooh I am 
I'm bound to you</field>

The age I adore, the day oh no more 
Breakfast Polo Launch and pools at the shore 
The Chateau for cocktails

            <field name="lyrics">So what am I not supposed to have an opinion 
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman 
Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind 
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled 
When a female fires back 
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act 
So he does what any little boy will do 
Making up a few false rumors or two 
That for sure is not a man to me 
Slanderin' names for popularity 
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy 
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say 
This is for my girls all around the world 
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth 
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard 
So what do we do girls? 
Shout out loud! 
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground 
Lift your hands high and wave them proud 
Take a deep breath and say it loud 
Never can, never will, can't hold us down 
Nobody can hold us down 
Nobody can hold us down 
Nobody can hold us down 
Never can, never will 
So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying 
Are you offended by the message I'm bringing 
Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing 
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing 
If you look back in history 
It's a common double standard of society 
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score 
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore 
I don't understand why it's okay 
The guy can get away with it and the girl gets named 
All my ladies come together and make a change 
Start a new beginning for us everybody sing 
This is for my girls all around the world 
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth 
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard 
What do we do girls? 
Shout out loud! 
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground 
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud 
Take a deep breath and say it loud 
Never can, never will, can't hold us down 
Check it - Here's something I just can't understand 
If the guy have three girls then he's the man 
He can either give us some head, sex her off 
If the girl do the same, then she's a whore 
But the table's about to turn 
I'll bet my fame on it 
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it 
It's aiight though, you can't hold me down 
I got to keep on movin' 
To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack 
Do it right back to him and let that be that 
You need to let him know that his game is whack 
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back 
But you're just a little boy 
Think you're so cute, so coy 
You must talk so big 
To make up for smaller things 
So you're just a little boy 
All you'll do is annoy 
You must talk so big 
To make up for smaller things 
This is for my girls... 
This is for my girls all around the world 
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth 
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard 
So what do we do girls? 
Should out loud! 
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground 
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud 
Take a deep breath and say it loud 
Never can, never will, can't hold us down 
This is for my girls all around the world

He really got me working up an appetite 
He had tattoos up and down his arm

Everyone thinks that I have it all 
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls, these castle walls 
If I should tumble, if I should fall 
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls? 
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls 
[T.I 
- Verso 1] 
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in 
Bet you think I got it made, better look again 
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion 
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy 
With Phantoms e Ferrari's in the driveway 
But you see the pain and the change of the sane man's sanity 
Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece 
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony 
Apparently it's damaging the man you see before you 
On the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages 
His family encounters overshadows his extravagance 
Walk in my lines while I dare you with a stare at you 
While it surelly seem like the King's life ain't glamorous 
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs 
Because the cameras doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles 
Only counts until it falls in the pile 
[Christina Aguilera] 
Everyone thinks that I have it all 
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (these castle walls) 
If I should tumble, if I should fall 
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls? 
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls 
[T.I 
- Verso 2] 
Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished 
If my key is never with it, shit me knowing this 
Why should the verses I have laid 
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised? 
I guess I'm saying that to say that oppotunity 
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away 
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake 
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging Yay 
How could I ever consider myself a great 
If Messiah ain't paied and ?Nique'Nique ain't straight 
Would your favorite song about the whips, money and shit 
Be relevant If you found out the money wasn't real, nope 
So me being the GOAT shouldn't mean 
More to me than see it to a king though 
From a bad ass kid to a man with some dough 
Otherwise I may well have stayed poor 
So while they stay focused on me beefing with Flip, 
Shawty Low, with Gucci or Ludacris 
Or if I'm fucking with a hoe, 
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense 
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict 
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand 
Or slap me in the face, hey, I'm just the man 
If they saying I ain't the best in making hit records 
It's 'cause this is my life, this ain't just rapping 
Didn't think it all it was that deep, did ya dawg 
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls 
Didn't think it all it was that deep, did ya dawg 
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls 
[Christina Aguilera] 
Everyone thinks that I have it all 
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (these castle walls) 
If I should tumble, if I should fall 
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls? 
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls 
Nobody knows I'm all alone 
Living in this castle made of stone 
They say that money is freedom but I feel trapped inside it all 
And while I sit so high up on a throne 
I wonder how I can feel this low 
On top of the world it's beautiful 
But there's no place to fall 
[T.I 
- Verso 3] 
For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again 
My career was meant for me to come and tell it 
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced 
With matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement 
The day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing 
Downplaying the way I keep fellas from catching cases 
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying 
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakers 
From one of the greatest centers, blessed with most of God's graces 
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places 
So next time you rating royalty 
I'm always being given to recordings than the level of your loyalty 
(Hmm) 
Obviously you've been ignoring me 
Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed 
While all the critics was looking for Prince charming 
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt 
Even tho he made a castle out of what used to be a house 
He did shit that all your favorite rappers only rap about 
But most of ya'll don't see the castle through the walls 
And the smiles till it fall in piles so while 
[Christina Aguilera] 
Everyone thinks that I have it all 
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls 
(These castle walls, yeah yeah, yeah yeah) 
If I should tumble (If I should tumble), if I should fall 
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?

            <field name="lyrics">In glory a soldier I stand till the end 
A golden revolver I hold in my hand 
The trigger that I never squeeze 
The war that brings me to my knees 
I'm tired of fighting for peace 
When I am alone on the frontline 
I need you to stand next to me 
Baby ceasefire fire fire 
Throw down your weapons weapons weapons 
I'm on your side your side your side 
So please ceasefire fire fire 
Ceasefire make it stop 
Drop down your defences 
I'm raising my flag 
This fighting is hopeless we need this to end 
It's going too far don't now where it began 
We're hurting each other and I can't pretend 
I'm trying to help you 
To see the casualties that we both lead 
It's all so unnecessary 
Can't you hear me scream 
Baby ceasefire fire fire 
Throw down your weapons weapons weapons 
I'm on your side your side your side 
So please ceasefire fire fire 
Ceasefire make it stop 
Rolling out 
White flag i surrender 
Screaming out 
Make it stop 
We can do better 
Pain and hurt 
Living in fear 
Wasted energy 
In the end 
What is it worth 
What is our legacy 
Rolling out 
White flag i surrender 
Screaming out 
Make it stop 
We can do better 
Pain and hurt 
Living in fear 
Wasted energy 
In the end 
What is it worth 
What is our legacy 
Follow me now 
I'm gonna announce 
Somebody hurt me 
I need you now 
Why can't you see 
Got to believe me 
Fighting for peace 
Here release 
Won't you relieve me 
I'm on your side 
Swallow your pride 
You can confide in me 
Army afoot 
Rise of the sun 
Shining for all to see 
Enemy's left 
Victory's won 
No negativity 
We can be free 
Free as the king 
Who won my destiny 
Baby ceasefire fire fire 
Throw down your weapons weapons weapons 
I'm on your side your side your side 
So please ceasefire fire fire 
Ceasefire make it stop</field>

Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer 
I remember being filled with such wonder 
Before learning that the world can be harsher 
Who you love or the color of your skin 
Or the place that you were born and grew up in 
Shouldn't decide how you will be treated 
'cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing 
Waiting for a change to set us free 
Waiting for the day when you can be you 
And I can be me 
Waiting for a hope to come around 
Waiting for the day when hate is lost 
And love is found 
Waiting for a change, waiting for a change 
Change 
Change 
For all the brave and the souls who went before us 
Stand tall, then proudly lift your voices 
Let them know who we are in our choices 
And one day we won't have to sing this chorus 
Waiting for a change to set us free 
Waiting for the day when you can be you 
And I can be me 
Waiting for a hope to come around 
Waiting for the day when hate is lost 
And love is found 
Waiting for a change, waiting for a change 
Change 
Change 
Waiting for a change 
Change

When I was young every Christmas Eve 
I could not sleep 
Trying to catch that old St 
Nick 
Leaving presents under my tree 
And every year I'd fall asleep laying in my bed 
Dreaming of a million sugarplums 
Dancing in my head 
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time 
The spirit of giving is in our lives, oh 
Oh, how much joy it brings to see the ones you love 
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because 
There'll be family and Christmas cheer 
Peace and goodwill to all men 
Everybody is home for Christmas 
Everybody is home 
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe 
I want a white Christmas so let it snow 
Everybody is home for Christmas 
Everybody is home 
Friends come together as we decorate the tree 
This is the time of year to live in harmony, oh 
Angels watch over as we put the kids to sleep 
And when they awake their smiling faces 
Make it all complete, oh 
This is the holiday you're with the family 
We put aside our differences and let it be, oh 
Oh, how much fun it is to give and to receive 
This time of year, love is all we need 
There'll be family and Christmas cheer 
Peace and goodwill to all men 
Everybody is home for Christmas 
Everybody is home 
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe 
I want a white Christmas so let it snow 
Everybody is home for Christmas 
Everybody is home 
[Rap:] 
Open your heart now 
This is the time for us to give 
The world needs love now 
So live and let live, families all here 
The spirit is good cheer, the sound of carolers 
Ringing sweet in my ear, everything is all fine 
You know why, it's Christmas time, what? 
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time 
The spirit of giving is in our lives 
Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the one's you love 
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because 
There'll be family and Christmas cheer 
Peace and goodwill to all men 
Everybody is home for Christmas 
Everybody is home 
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe 
I want a white Christmas so let it snow 
Everybody is home for Christmas 
Everybody is home, it's Christmas time</field>

I remember when I lost my mind 
There was something so pleasant about that place 
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space 
And when you're out there without care 
Yeah, I was out of touch 
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough 
I just knew too much 
Does that make me crazy? 
Does that make me crazy? 
Does that make me crazy? 
Possibly 
And I hope that you are 
Having the time of your life 
But think twice 
That's my only advice 
Come on now, who do you 
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are? 
Ha ha ha, bless your soul 
You really think you're in control? 
Well, I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
Just like me 
My heroes had the heart 
To lose their lives out on a limb 
And all I remember 
Is thinking, I want to be like them 
Ever since I was little 
Ever since I was little 
It looked like fun 
And it's no coincidence I've come 
And I can die when I'm done 
But maybe I'm crazy 
Maybe you're crazy 
Maybe we're crazy

Living it, leaving it to change 
Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze 
Tongue tied and twisted are all my memories 
Celebrating a fantasy come true 
Packing all my bags, finally on the move 
I'm leaving today 
Livin' it, leaving it to change 
As I'm driving I'm captured by the view 
So much beauty the road becomes my muse 
The heat is rising and my head surfs through the wind 
Cool, calm, collected is the child that lies within, see 
I'm leaving today 
Livin' it, leaving it to change 
I'm leaving today 
Livin' it, leaving it to change 
But somehow I miss it, I think I'll really miss it one day 
I turn up the radio and I'm feeling like I've never felt before 
Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams I bring 
Finally free 
Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze 
I'm leaving today 
Livin' it, leaving it to change 
I'm leaving today 
Livin' it, leaving it to change 
Livin' it, leaving it 
Said I'm living it, leaving it 
Living it, leaving it to change 
(I'm leaving it to change) 
But somehow I miss it, I think I'll really miss it

Breakfast in the mornin', laughing over pancakes 
Smell the coffee burnin' 
forget all of the mistakes that we made 
I want to say, will you mention that she called you? 
Now, why you gotta go and do that? 
It wasn't necessary 
You run your mouth when it's unnecessary 
Maybe I'm too sensitive 
And I find the truth scary 
But we know what we have together is real special 
Now why you wanna go and lose that, boy? 
Can we pause for a moment before this 
commotion takes over? 
I'm sorry, let's fix this 
Sometimes we can't kick the habit of being dramatic

Put me on the jury 
I will take the blame here 
Tell the judge I'm guilty of instilling you with fear 
By tellin' you I'm leaving 
When you know that I don't mean it 
Now, why I gotta go and say that? 
It's only temporary 
Whenever we fight, it's only temporary 
It's passive-agressive 
When you say that you don't need me

Still jumpin', six in the mornin' 
Table dancin', glasses are crashin' 
No question, time for some action 
Temperature's up (can you feel it?) 
'bout to erupt 
Gonna get my girls, get your boys 
Gonna make some noise 
Gonna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly 
Get it fired up in a hurry 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party 
Sweat drippin' over my body 
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival 
Ah, heat is up 
So ladies, fellas, drop your cups 
Bodies packed, front to back 
Now move your ass, I like that 
Tight hip huggers, low for sure 
Shake a little somethin' on the floor 
I need that, uh, to get me off 
Sweatin' till my clothes come off 
Let's get open, cause a commotion 
Still goin', eight in the mornin' 
There's no stoppin', we keep it poppin' 
Hot rockin', everyone's talkin' 
Give all you got (give it to me), just hit the spot 
Gonna get my girls, get your boys 
Gonna make some noise 
Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly 
Get it fired up in a hurry 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party 
Ooh sweat dripping over my body 
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival 
Here it comes, it's the one you've been waitin' on 
Get up, get it up, yup that's what's up 
Givin' just what you love to the maximum 
Uh oh, here we go (here we go) 
What to do when the music starts to drop 
That's when we take it to the parking lot 
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops 
Uh oh, here we go (here we go) 
Ohh ohh ohh, yeah yeah...

Yo, hot damn, Doc and Jam like a summer show 
I keep my car lookin' like a crash dummy drove 
My gear look like the bank got my money froze 
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll 
Doc the one that excite ya divas (ow!) 
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up 
Yo Christina (what?), better hop in here 
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (yeah) 
The club is packed, the bar is filled 
I'm waitin' for sister to act, like Lauryn Hill 
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals 
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels 
Throw it up 
Baby it's Brick City, you heard of that 
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac 
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in 
It's like I'm Odb, the way I'm freakin' 
[Christina] 
Gonna get rowdy (rowdy), gonna get a little unruly (ruly) 
Get it fired up in a hurry (hurry) 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party (party) 
Sweat drippin' over my body (body) 
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival 
Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly 
Get it fired up in a hurry 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party 
Ooh sweat drippin' over my body 
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival 
Rowdy, dancin' and gettin' a little unruly 
Get it fired up in a hurry 
Let's get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party 
Sweat drippin' over my body 
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty 
Wanna get dirty (oh dirty), it's about time for my arrival 
Uh, what</field>

Oh no... 
Oh no... 
You'll never make me stay 
So take your weight off of me 
I know your every move 
So won't you just let me be 
I've been here times before 
But I was too blind to see 
That you seduce every man 
This time you won't seduce me 
She's saying that's ok 
Hey baby do what you please 
I have the stuff the you want 
I am the thing that you need 
She looked me deep in the eyes 
She's touchin' me so to start 
She says there's no turnin' back 
She trapped me in her heart 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana 
Let me be! 
Oh no... 
Oh no... 
Oh no... 
She likes the boys in the band 
She knows when they come to town 
Every musician's fan after the 
curtain comes down 
She waits at backstage doors 
For those who have prestige 
Who promise fortune and fame 
A life that's so carefree 
She says that's ok 
Hey baby do what you want 
I'll be your night lovin' thing 
I'll be the freak you can taunt 
And I don't care what you say 
I want to go too far 
I'll be your everything 
If you make me a star 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana... 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana... 
Diana! 
Diana! 
Dirty Diana! 
It's Dia...aa...aa...ana! 
She said I have to go home 
'Cause I'm real tired you see 
But I hate sleppin' alone 
Why don't you come with me 
I said my baby's at home 
She's problably worried tonight 
I didn't call on the phone to 
Say that I'm alright 
Diana walked up to me, 
She said I'm all yours tonight 
And then I ran to the phone 
Sayin' baby I'm alright 
I said but unlock the door. 
Because I forgot the key. 
She said he's not coming back 
Because he's slepping with me 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana, no 
Dirty Diana... 
Come on! 
Come on! 
Come on!

Oooh...hey, oh yeah 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready 
Don't make me give you more than my kisses, oh ooh oh 
I need you to go slow and steady 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready 
Ooh, oh yeah 
Why you wanna rush into my life 
Don't you wanna stop and get to know me better 
We got all the time in the world tonight 
And if we're meant to be we'll be together, oh oh 
Stay around just slow it down 
'Til we find out if we got what it takes 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready 
Don't make me give you more than my kisses 
I need you to go slow and steady 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready 
Everything I know about you so far 
Makes me believe that you're the one for me 
But there's still a lot that's on my mind 
And I need time before we go further 
Don't you see 
So hold me, fold me, but don't be 
Thinking I don't want you too 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready 
Don't make me give you more than my kisses 
I need you to go slow and steady 
(Slow and steady, 'til I'm ready baby) 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready 
It's better with a little bit of mystery 
Let's wait 'til we have a bit of history 
Behind ourselves, ooh ohh yeah yeah 
We don't got to be in such a rush 
We can live for the moment if we trust 
We'll be right here tomorrow, oh yeah yeah 
Don't make me love you, ooh, ohh ooh 
Don't make me give you, ooh ohh 
I need you to go, ooh yeah 
Don't make me love you, oh, oh, oh yeah yeah, ohh 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready

Don't make me give you more than my kisses 
I need you to go slow and steady 
(Ooh...) 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready 
Don't make me love you, don't make, ooh ohh 
Don't make me give you more than my kisses 
I need you to go slow and steady, baby 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready 
(Ready, yeah yeah) 
Don't make me love you 'til I'm ready 
Don't make me give you more than my kisses

That will see us through, it all 
I have had a dream

Get passed everything, ohh no

Nothing's too impossible 
For us to do, ohh and 
I see, endless opportunities 
We can reach oh, if we both believe, ohh 
Sometimes hoping's not enough 
The paths ahead can be so tough 
But if we stay, confident we'll see 
A brighter day, ohh

In the middle of the night 
And I don't know if i've been sleeping 
But I hold my pillow tight 
Are you real or are you my 
Imagination playing games? 
I can set you free, you'll always be 
My one eternal flame. 
Your dreamy eyes, 
They just won't say good-bye 
Well, it must be my fate 
Cause I just can't escape 
And the passion never dies... 
Oh, dreamy eyes 
No matter how I cry 
I just can't reach you 
Dreamy eyes 
You're a vision of tomorrow 
And a ghost from yesterday 
And i've been trying not to let you 
Take my breath away. 
You're a summer breeze that comes and goes 
But somehow lingers on 
Tell me how can I forget you 
If you've never really gone? 
Your dreamy eyes 
They just won't say good-bye 
Well, it must be my fate 
'cause I just can't escape 
And the passion never dies... 
Oh, dreamy eyes 
No matter how I cry 
I just can't reach you 
Dreamy eyes. 
What do I have to do 
To get that close to you and your... 
Your dreamy eyes 
They just won't say good-bye 
Well, it must be my fate 
'cause I just can't escape 
And the passion never dies... 
Oh, I tried so hard to release you 
But no matter how I cry 
I just keep seeing through 
Dreamy eyes.</field>

Racing to the top with golden rays of light 
I've never felt so free and its so dangerous 
The night was electronic painted red with lust 
I move (move) 
You chase (chase) 
We magnetise 
A time I was exploding with no warning sign 
Dynamite, electrify me all night 
Dynamite, just give it to me, i wont bite 
Dynamite, you make me feel, its alright 
Dynamite, shine it on me (starlight) 
Caught up in this moment i was hypnotized 
(hypnotized) 
Help me shake this feeling got me paralized 
I do (do), i don't (don't), I think i might 
My body was electric like a flashing light 
Dynamite, electrify me all night 
Dynamite, just give it to me, i wont bite 
Dynamite, you make me feel, its alright 
Dynamite, shine it on me (starlight) 
Change, a change is coming 
Change, a change is coming 
Feeling all around me that a change is about to 
happen 
The energy igniting has become my inspiration 
If youd take a deeper look youll find the 
information 
I'm only just a figment of controled imagination 
Dynamite (dynamite) electrify me all night (all 
night) 
Dynamite, just give it to me, i wont bite 
Dynamite, you make me feel, its alright 
Dynamite, shine it on me (starlight) 
Starlight 
Oh-oh-oh 
Electrify me 
Oh-oh-oh I wont bite 
Oh oh o just give it to me

'Cause it comes and goes and pins me like a 
trampoline 
But all this back and forth is freaky, it's confusing me 
Like a pencil trying to write and you're erasing me 
If I was a ruler I'll set you straight 
But your love is like a sharpener, it really grates 
'Cause once I'm trying to bounce, you pull me back 
And when I try to come to you, you give me slack 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
A rubber was an analogy 
You can even say it's a metaphor 
The tension between you and me 
I ain't gonna feel if you let it go 
I can take a little bit and make it more 
A little bit of hate can make it war 
But a lot of love ain't enough 
And so, I don't really know how we find the cure 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together 
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together 
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together 
If we were gaffer tape maybe we could spend the 
summer 
You could say your piece, you could post it on paper 
When your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love

It used to make me cry 
Your tried to cut my pride 
Not this time 
So go ahead and say the thing you got to say 
You know you're only throwing empty words my way 
Cause you won't break me you won't break me 
You can't take me down 
No 
The funny thing about listening is 
I don't have to hear you and the 
Funny thing about talking is your words are tired 
Now I've come to realise that 
Life can be cruel but 
The only approval that I need is mine 
Your voice is like a knife

Cannot be heard or seen 
This journey starts when 
I begin loving me

Been holding down for quite some time and finally the moment's right 
I love to make the people stare 
They know I got that certain savoir-faire 
Fasten up 
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch? 
Step into the fantasy 
You'll never want to leave, baby let's give it to you…Why? 
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque 
It'll move, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque 
All ladies, confident, flaunt it, boys throw it up if you want it 
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's Burlesque. 
I tease ‘em 'til they're on the edge 
They screamin' more for more and more they beg 
I know it's me they come to see 
My pleasure brings them to their knees 
Fasten up 
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch? 
Step into the fantasy 
You'll never want to leave, baby let's give it to you…Why? 
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque

'Cause no one told me 
But you deserve to know 
That in this world, you are not beholden 
You do not owe them 
Your body and your soul 
All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older 
And all the truth in a girl 
is too precious to be stolen from her 
It's just the way it is 
Maybe it's never gonna change 
But I got a mind to show my strength 
And I got a right to speak my mind 
And I'm gonna pay for this 
They're gonna burn me at the stake 
But I got a fire in my veins 
I wasn't made to fall in line 
No, I wasn't made to fall in line, no 
Show some skin, make him want you 
'Cause God forbid you 
Know your own way home 
And ask yourself why it matters 
Who it flatters 
You're more than flesh and bones 
All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older 
And all the truth in a girl 
is too precious to be stolen from her 
It's just the way it is

Never wanted to 
What am I to do? 
I Can't help it 
Love's always been my game 
Play it how I may 
I was made that way 
I Can't help it 
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame 
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame 
Falling in love again 
Never wanted to 
What am I to do? 
I Can't help it 
Fallin' in love again 
Never wanted to 
What am I to do? 
Can't help it 
Love's always been my game 
Play it how I may

Ask for advice, get money twice 
I'm from the dirty, but that chico nice 
Ya'll call it a moment, I call it life 
One day when the light is glowing 
I'll be in my castle golden 
But until the gates are open 
I just want to feel this moment 
Oh oh... 
I just want to feel this moment 
Oh oh... 
I just want to feel this moment 
Mr Worldwide 
Christina Aguilera 
Oye mamita, come on, dale 
Que la cosa esta rica 
(I just want to feel this moment) 
Feel this moment... 
Reporting live, from the tallest buildings in Tokyo 
Long way from them hard ways 
Filled with zoes and oye's 
Dade county always, 305 all day 
Now baby we can parlay 
Oh baby we can party 
She reads books 
Especially 'bout red rooms and tie ups 
I got her hooked 
Cause she see me in a suit with the red tie tied up 
Christian Gris, nice to meet ya 
But time is money 
Only difference is I own it 
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment 
One day when the light is glowing 
I'll be in my castle golden 
But until the gates are open 
I just want to feel this moment 
Oh oh... 
I just want to feel this moment 
Oh oh... 
I just want to feel this moment 
Feel this moment... 
I see the future but live for the moment 
Make sense don't it? Ha 
Now make dollars, I mean billions 
I'm a genius, I mean brilliant 
The streets are what schooled him 
And made him slicker than slick, Rick the ruler 
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot 
But I'm still undefeated like Shula 
I'm far from cheap 
I break down companies with alll my peeps 
Baby we can travel the world 
And I can give you and all you can see 
Time is money 
Only difference is I own it 
Like a stop watch, let's stop time 
And enjoy this moment, dale 
One day when the light is glowing 
I'll be in my castle golden 
But until the gates are open 
I just want to feel this moment 
Oh oh... 
I just want to feel this moment 
Oh oh... 
I just want to feel this moment 
Come on, feel this moment...

Never know how much I care 
When you put your arms around me 
I get a fever that's so hard to bear 
You give me fever, when you kiss me 
Fever when you hold me tight 
Fever in the morning 
Fever all through the night 
Romeo loved Juliet 
Juliet, she felt the same 
When he put his arms around her 
He said, "Juliet, baby, you're my flame" 
You give me fever, when you kiss me 
Fever when you hold me tight 
Fever in the morning 
Fever all through the night 
Sun's light up the daytime 
Moon's light up the night 
I light up when you call my name 
And you know I'm gonna treat you right 
You give me fever, when you kiss me 
Fever when you hold me tight

You'd think I despise you 
But in the end, I wanna thank you 
'Cause you make me that much stronger 
When I, thought I knew you 
Thinking that you were true 
I guess I, I couldn't trust 
Called your bluff, time is up 
'Cause I've had enough 
You were, there by my side 
Always down for the ride 
But your, joy ride just came down in flames 
'Cause your greed sold me out of shame 
After all of the stealing and cheating 
You probably think that I hold resentment for you 
But, oh no, you're wrong 
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do 
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through 
So I wanna say thank you 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Never saw it coming 
All of your backstabbing 
Just so you could cash in 
On a good thing before I realized your game 
I heard you're going round 
Playing the victim now 
But don't even begin 
Feeling I'm the one to blame 
'Cause you dug your own grave 
After all of the fights and the lies 
Yes you wanted to harm me but that won't work anymore 
No more, oh no, it's over 
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture 
I wouldn't know how to be this way now 
And never back down 
So I wanna say thank you 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
Makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
It makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
How could this man I thought I knew 
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel 
Could only see the good in you 
Pretended not to see the truth 
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself 
Through living in denial 
But in the end you'll see 
You won't stop me 
I am a fighter and I 
I ain't goin' stop 
There is no turning back 
I've had enough 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Thought I would forget 
But I remember 
So I remember 
I'll remember 
Thought I would forget 
But I remember 
So I remember 
I'll remember 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter</field>

Ain't what they seem 
All this tension on titling 
Just exactly what we should be 
Now I don't mind us being 
Some kind of casual thing 
Listen all I want to do for now is 
Have you come and take all of me 
Can you put your hands on my waistline 
Want your skin up against mine 
Move my hips to the baseline 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
Hang a "Please don't disturb" sign 
Put my back into a slow grind 
(A slow grind) 
Sending chills up and down my spine 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
If you see me with a man 
Understand that you can't question me 
The feelings that you caught ain't my fault 
Can't help your jealousy 
If you can handle the fact that what we have 
Has got to be commitment free (free) 
Then we can keep this undercover loving coming 
Hidden underneath the sheets 
Can you put your hands on my waistline 
(On my waistline) 
Want your skin up against mine 
Move my hips to the baseline 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
(But don't fall in love) 
Hang a "Please don't disturb" sign 
(No, no love) 
Put my back into a slow grind 
(Slow grind) 
Sending chills up and down my spine 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
Now listen 
So, come on and freak my body 
We can get nasty, naughty 
All night a private party 
Gotta hit that spot just right 
Work me like a 9 to 5 
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin' 
'Cause this is a physical lovin' 
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin' 
Gotta hit that spot just right 
Work me like a 9 to 5 
We have a physical thing 
We'll make love, but don't fall in love 
(Let me get mine, you get yours) 
We spend time 
Just enough so you can get yours, and I get mine 
No strings attached 
(Let me get mine, you get yours) 
I want your body, not your heart 
Can you put your hands on my waistline 
(Hands on my waistline) 
Want your skin up against mine 
Move my hips to the baseline 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
(But don't fall in love) 
Hang a "Please don't disturb" sign 
Put my back into a slow grind 
(Down my spine...) 
Sending chills up and down my spine 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
Put your hands on my waistline 
(Put your hands on my waistline) 
Want your skin up against mine 
(Against mine) 
Move my hips to the baseline 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
(Let me get mine, you get yours, no) 
(But don't fall in love) 
Hang a "Please don't disturb" sign

Put my back into a slow grind

A hasty job really spoils a master's touch 
I don't like a big commotion, I'm a demon for slow motion or such 
Why should I deny that I would die to know a guy who takes his time 
There isn't any fun in getting something done

            <field name="lyrics">Hey yeah yeah, whoa yeah yeah, whoa oh yeah 
Well everyone got an opinion now, don't they? but it ain't no thing to me 
It really don't make any difference now to me if you don't like what you see 
I pay no mind to the negative kind 'cause that's just no way to be 
I don't stop to please some else's needs, gonna live my life for me 
I'm gonna get bold, gonna do my own thing, we've all got a song we're meant to sing 
And no matter what people say or might think, I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay 
Gonna keep doing my own thing 'cause whether they're loving or hating on me 
I'll still be the same girl I used to be 'cause I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay 
I'm here to stay 
I'm here to stay 
I've never been the type to be shy, I know some would say I'm too headstrong 
But I'd rather be a woman who pushes her mind, whether you think I'm right or wrong 
And I know some people wanna criticize, makes them feel better about themselves 
So say what you will, time will reveal, in the end, that I will be still 
I'm gonna get bold, gonna do my own thing, we've all got a song we're meant to sing 
And no matter what people say or might think, I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay 
Gonna keep doing my own thing 'cause whether they're loving or hating on me 
I'll still be the same girl I used to be 'cause I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay 
Gotta get up, keep my head up, gonna keep on turning it up, never let up 
If I keep stepping it up, I'm gonna prove that I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not 
Gotta get up, keep my head up, gonna keep on turning it up, never let up 
If I keep stepping it up, I'm gonna prove that I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not 
No matter the pressures that face me, I believe, I believe that we'll see 
I'll never let anyone break me, yeah, hold me down, all I can do now is have strength in me 
And life ain't always that easy, gotta fight to seek past the boundaries, everytime, now for everytime 
I'm gonna get bold, gonna do my own thing, we've all got a song we're meant to sing 
And no matter what people say or might think, I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay 
Gonna keep doing my own thing 'cause whether they're loving or hating on me 
I'll still be the same girl I used to be 'cause I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face 
You told me how proud you were 
But I walked away 
If only I knew What I know today 
Ooh ooh 
I would hold you in my arms 
I would take the pain away 
Thank you for all you've done 
Forgive all your mistakes 
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear your voice again 
Sometimes I wanna call you 
But I know you won't be there 
Ooh I'm sorry for blaming you 
For everything I just couldn't do 
And I've hurt myself by hurting you 
Some days I feel broke inside 
But I won't admit 
Sometimes I just wanna hide 
Cause it's you I miss 
And it's so hard to say goodbye 
When it comes to this ooh 
Would you tell me I was wrong 
Would you help me understand 
Are you looking down upon me 
Are you proud of who I am 
There's nothing I wouldn't do to have just one more chance 
To look into your eyes 
And see you looking back 
Ooh I'm sorry for blaming you 
For everything I just couldn't do 
And I've hurt myself 
Ooh 
If I had just one more day 
I would tell you how much that I missed you since you've been away 
Ooh 
It's dangerous 
It's so out of line 
To try and turn back time 
I'm sorry for blaming you 
For everything I just couldn't do 
And I've hurt myself by hurting you</field>

I'm asking you to take me just the way that I am 
Please lay down your arms, do you know me?

Used to be calm 
Used to be cool 
But something about you 
Changed all the rules 
I kept to myself 
I guarded my heart 
But that all fell apart 
Now just like a fool 
I've fallen in love with you, oh 
I got these crazy feelings 
All over you, oh 
I come undone 
I come undone 
Every time I'm close to you 
I come undone 
I come undone 
Can't help myself from falling in love 
Kiss me again 
Ooh, there I go 
You got my heart racing 
Out of control 
Got butterflies 
And I can't disguise 
That I'm feeling so much 
You intoxicate 
You fascinate 
You know you make me crazy 
What can I say, oh yeah 
I come undone (alright) 
I come undone 
Every time I'm close to you, ooh 
I come undone 
I come undone 
Can't help myself from falling in love, oh 
I come undone 
I come undone 
Any time you walk in the room, ohh 
I come undone 
I come undone 
I can't help, I can't stop 
I can't shake this crazy love 
Do ya, do ya, do ya know 
What you to do me 
Do ya, do ya 
What you do to me 
Something behind your smile 
Something inside your eyes 
Makes me feel (makes me feel) 
Love...ohh...

Ooh it keeps me 
Alive each day of my life 
Always guiding me 
Providing me 
With the hope I desperately need 
Well I gotta believe 
There's something out there meant for me 
Oh I get on my knees 
Praying I will receive 
The courage to grow and the faith to know 
That I will be 
Strong on my own 
I will see through the rain 
I will find my way 
I will keep on

            <field name="lyrics">Once upon a time there was a girl 
In her early years she had to learn 
How to grow up living in a war that she called home 
Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm 
It hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face 
Every time my father's fist would put her in her place 
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room 
Hoping it would be over soon 
Chorus: 
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same 
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid 
Stenght is my mother for all the love she gave 
And every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday 
And I'm Ok 
I often wonder why I carry all this guilt 
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built 
Shadows stir at night trough a crack in the door 
Echoes of broken child screaming please no more 
Daddy don't you understand the damage you have done 
For you is just a memory but for me it still lives on 
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same 
And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid 
Stenght is my mother for all the love she gave 
And every morning that I pray I look back to yesterday 
It's not so easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck 
When I was thrown against cold stairs 
And everyday afraid to come home in fear of what I might see, next 
Chorus 
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same 
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid 
Stenght is my mother for all the love she gave 
And every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday 
And I'm Ok</field>

It's easy if you try 
No hell below us 
Above us only sky 
Imagine all the people 
Living for today 
Imagine there's no countries 
It isn't hard to do 
Nothing to kill or die for 
And no religion too 
Imagine all the people 
Living life in peace 
You may say, I'm a dreamer 
But I'm not the only one 
I hope some day you'll join us 
And the world will be as one 
Imagine no possessions 
I wonder if you can 
No need for greed or hunger 
A Brotherhood of man 
Imagine all the people 
Sharing all the world 
You may say, I'm a dreamer 
But I'm not the only one 
I hope some day you'll join us 
And the world will live as one</field>

I just got something on my mind 
Alicia: Speak on it girl 
It's impossible 
It's impossible to love you 
If you don't let me know what you're feeling 
It's impossible for me to give you what you need 
If you're always hidin' from me 
I don't know what hurt you 
I just, I wanna make it right 
Cos boy I'm sick and tired of trying to read your mind 
It's impossible (impossible) 
Oh baby it's impossible for me to love you 
It's the way it is 
It's impossible (impossible) 
Oh baby it's impossible 
If you makin' it this way 
Impossible to make it easy 
If you always tryin' to make it so damn hard 
How can I, how can I give you all my love, baby 
If you're always, always puttin' up your guard 
This is not a circus 
Don't you play me for a clown 
How long can emotions keep on goin' up and down 
It's impossible (impossible) 
Oh baby it's impossible for me to love you 
It's the way it is 
It's impossible (impossible) 
Oh baby it's impossible 
If you keep treating me this way 
Over, over (over and over) 
Impossible baby (impossible, impossible) 
If you makin' it this way, this way 
Oh baby, it's impossible 
If you makin' it this way</field>

            <field name="lyrics">He comes from a foreign place 
An island far away 
Intrigues me with every move 
Til I'm breathless, I'm helpless 
Can't keep my cool 
Steals my heart when he takes my hand 
And we dance to the rhythm of the band 
Feel his fingertips grip my hips 
And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss 
Mama used to warn me to beware 
those latin lovers 
Said I gave my heart too soon 
And that's how I became your mother 
Said ay mama, you seem to forget 
I'm not in love yet 
Sweet talk don't win me over 
But I realize 
Big brown eyes I'm hypnotized 
When he says 
I am full blood boricua 
Read the tattoo on his arm 
He tells me "Mami, I need ya!" 
And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
Getting lost in a ritmo 
He whispers "Te quiero", te quiero 
I begin to give in with no hesitation 
Can't help my infatuation 
It's pure infatuation 
Skin the color of cinnamon 
His eyes light up 
And I'm filled within 
Feels so good it must be a sin 
I can't stop what I started I'm giving in 
He brings life to my fantasies 
Sparks a passion inside of me 
Find the words and I cannot speak 
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me 
Mama used to warn me 
not to rush love with another 
Said I'm not trying to lecture 
I just care about my daughter 
Ay mama, you seem to forget 
I never would never let 
A man control my emotions 
When he smiles 
I feel like a little child 
When he says 
I am full blood boricua 
Read the tattoo on his arm 
He tells me "Mami, I need ya!" 
And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
Getting lost in a ritmo 
He whispers "Te quiero", Te quiero 
I begin to give in with no hesitation 
Can't help my infatuation 
It's pure infatuation 
Caught between my mother's words 
And what I feel inside 
Wanting to explore his world 
But part of me wants to hide 
Should I risk it 
Can't resist it 
This has caught me by surprise 
Should I let him take me to Puerto Rico 
I can't hold back no more 
Let's go tonight 
I am full blood boricua 
Read the tattoo on his arm 
He tells me "Mami, I need ya!" 
And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
Getting lost in a ritmo 
He whispers "Te quiero", te quiero 
I begin to give in with no hesitation 
Can't help my infatuation 
It's pure infatuation 
Can't help my infatuation 
It's pure infatuation (Infatuation)</field>

That's how music should sound 
Oh yeah, I've waited for some time to get inside the minds of every legend I ever wanted to stand beside 
It's like an image, feeling the lows and highs of every lyric and melody, every single rhyme 
So here I stand today, in tribute I do pay to those before me who laid it down and paved the way 
So to God I pray that he will give me strength to carry forward the gift of song in his good faith, In his good faith... 
I'm going back to basics to where it all began, I'm ready now to face it, I wanna understand 
What made the soul singers and the blues figures that inspired a higher generation 
The jazz makers and the ground breakers that did so much for themselves and dedication 
So here I stand today, in tribute I do pay to those before me who laid it down and paved the way</field>

Man made the trains to carry heavy loads 
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark 
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark 
This is a man's world, this is a man's world 
But it wouldn't be nothing 
Nothing without a woman or a girl 
Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys 
Man makes them happy 'cause man makes them toys 
And after man has made everything, everything he can 
You know that man makes money to buy from other man 
This is a man's world 
But it wouldn't be nothing 
Nothing without a woman or a girl

He's lost in bitterness</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I woke up this morning with a smile on my face 
Nobody's going to bring me down today 
Been feeling like nothings been going my way lately 
So I decided right here and now that my outlooks got to change 
That's why I'm going to 
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried 
For every time somebody hurt my pride 
Feeling like they won't let me live life 
And take the time to look at what is mine 
I see every lesson so clearly 
I thank God for what I got from above 
I believe they can take anything from me 
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace 
They can say all they want to say about me 
But I'm going to carry on 
Keep on singing my song 
I never want to dwell on my pain again 
There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then 
Remembering all of the hell I felt when I was running out of faith 
Every step I vowed to take was towards a better day 
Because I'm about to 
Say goodbye to every single lie 
All the fears I've held too long inside 
Every time I felt I couldn't try 
All the negativity I had inside 
For too long I've been struggling 
I couldn't go on 
But now I've found 
I'm feeling strong and moving on 
I believe they can take anything from me 
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace 
They can say all they want to say about me 
But I'm going to carry on 
Keep on singing my song 
Every time I tried to be what they wanted from me 
It never came naturally 
So I ended up in misery, wasn't able to see 
All the good around me 
Wasted so much energy on what they thought of me 
Simply just remembering to breathe 
I'm human 
I am not able to please 
Everyone at the same time, so now I find 
My peace of mind living one day at a time 
I'm human and I answer to one god 
It comes down to one love 
Until I get to heaven above 
I have made the decision never to give up 
Till the I day I die no matter what 
I'm going to carry on and keep on singing my song 
(I believe they can take anything from me 
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace) 
They can do what they wanna 
Say what they wanna say 
(They can say what they wanna) 
But I'm gonna keep on 
(keep on) 
I believe that they can take from me 
but they can't take my inner piece 
Say what you wanna say 
I'm gonna sing my song</field>

And it keeps getting better 
Kiss kiss gonna tell you right now 
I'll make it sweet on the lips so it can knock you out 
Shut up I don't care what you say 
Cuz when we both in the way you're gonna like it my way 
Yeah baby there's a feeling in me so sexy sour and sweet

Hold on 
Keeps getting better

In the speed of the light 
All the universal will make the planets collide

and i slip on my suit" 
See the vixen in me 
Becomes the angel for you

I was too weak to carry on 
You picked me up you were my home 
I never stood alone 
No one can tell us what we want 
No one can stop us anymore 
No looking back, we're moving forward 
No one can take this moment away 
Keep on rising higher 
Blaze the room with fire 
Right down to the wire 
Rise the fire higher 
As we stand together 
Chase our dreams forever, forever, forever, forever 
Now we have wings we can fly 
We can be kings you and I 
Wipe away the tears from our eyes 
We light up the sky (x2) 
When skies are grey 
I'll light your way 
I'll be your shoulder 
You can lean on me (x2) 
Now we have wings we can fly 
We can be kings you and I 
Wipe away the tears from our eyes 
We light up the sky (x2) 
We light up the sky 
Light up the sky 
We light up the sky 
We light up the sky</field>

Talk to the reverend 
But I know you better 
And I'm tryna 
Hey, you know we perfect 
Babygirl, look at us 
Make a young 
Cash out that running up 
All that little booty in your trunk 
Make a man wanna say hallelujah 
When they jump 
Make'em buy a little Porsche 
I'm around you so we stunt 
Black men, black car 
Let you buy you what you want 
No, wait, baby you a problem 
Sagittarius, hm, exciting 
Link and Aguilera, so you know we're gossip 
Coexisting, you the moon, I'm the sun 
Genie in my bottle 
I'm trying to rub on your hips 
Ain't no other man who can talk to you like I did 
That's real 
Let's start a family 
I'm uncle Phil 
You my aunt Viv 
Fly to Spain 
Go to Rome 
We don't ever have to ever go home 
I want to love you from your head to your toe 
I like a little fuss and fightin' when I go 
You say leave, tell me stay, want me go 
Then I leave, pouting like I'm gone 
But you know I never leave you on your own 
And you're too bad for these brothers 
who be on your phone like 
Let me make this simple for ya 
Lay it out on the table for ya 
In case you need a little reminder 
I've been doing this way before you 
Boy you already know my story 
You were raised in all my glory 
I don't need your little money 
I can put you on to something 
Stop talking, we can get along 
We can Marvin Gaye and get it on 
Where you want to be, I've been before 
Shh, say no more 
Boy, you're so much better when you don't speak 
If you get somethin' get one thing 
Can't play me, boy, I'm out of your league 
No, baby, you can't do it quite like I do 
I do 
Like I do 
I may not want but just might have to show you 
Show you 
What I do 
And you can't do it quite like I do 
This feeling is legendary 
Welcome to my sanctuary 
Every time like the first time 
But, baby, girls like me ain't temporary 
Can't fake it when it comes this natural 
I ain't ever tried, it's just natural, ha 
I don't need your little money 
I can put you on to something 
Stop talking, we can get along 
We can Marvin Gaye and get it on 
Where you want to be, I've been before 
Shh, say no more 
Boy, you're so much better when you don't speak 
If you get somethin' get one thing 
Can't play me, boy, I'm out of your league 
No, baby, you can't do it quite like I do 
I do 
Like I do 
I may not want but just might have to show you 
Show you 
What I do 
And you can't do it quite like I do 
Ooh 
Can't keep running your mouth 
(can't keep running your mouth) 
I ain't got time but I got some now (got time now) 
What I got to lie, what I got to lie about? 
(what I got to lie about?) 
Ooh 
There you go running your mouth 
(there you go running your mouth) 
Show me what it is, show me right now 
(show me what it is, show me right now) 
'Cause I can do bigger without ya now (oh oh) 
Don't talk for a second 
Just get all this lesson 
Don't you second guess it 
Just show some respect and 
It can go far for you 
I know it's kind of hard for you 
It's not my job but you're working so hard 
I can share a bar or two 
Plus you're kinda cute 
Stop talking, we can get along 
We can Marvin Gaye and get it on 
Where you want to be, I've been before 
Shh, say no more (say no more)

No matter what the distance I will see it through 
I'll fill you in between the sun and moon

I know that you'll go on to shine somehow 
And even if you're miles above the clouds 
'Till the end I'll be waiting 
Now I lay me down to sleep 
I pray we meet inside my dreams 
So long my little dreamer, I will miss your face 
We'll always stay connected through time and space 
The journey that we shared will now have to leave 
Will live inside of us for eternity 
Little dreamer, little dreamer 
Little dreamer, little 
La la la la 
Look through the dark there is a compass in the sky 
If ever you are lonely and question why 
Remember that I'm always by your side 
'Till the end I'll be waiting 
And even though we sleep light years apart 
A galaxy away it's not so far 
Because we know the future is a star 
'Till the end I'll be waiting 
Now I lay me down to sleep 
I pray we meet inside my dreams 
If I should go before I wake 
I pray our souls will join again 
So long, my little dreamer, I'll miss your face 
We'll always stay connected through time and space 
And everything we hoped that could never be

Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner 
Must be hung up for a week 
My best friend, he shoots water rats 
And feeds them to his geese 
Don'cha think there's a place for you 
In between the sheets? 
Come on now, honey 
We can build a home for three 
Come on now, honey 
Don't you wanna live with me? 
And there's a score of harebrained children 
They're all locked in the nursery 
They got earphone heads they got dirty necks 
They're so 20th century 
Well they queue up for the bathroom 
'Round about 7:35 
Don'cha think we need a woman's touch to make it come alive? 
You'd look good pram pushing 
Down the high street 
Come on now, honey 
Don't you wanna live with me? 
Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear 
The cook she is a whore 
Yes, the butler has a place for her 
Behind the pantry door 
The maid, she's French, she's got no sense 
She's wild for Crazy Horse 
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips 
The footman's eyes get crossed 
Don'cha think there's a place for us 
Right across the street 
Don'cha think there's a place for you, 
In between the sheets?</field>

Love will find a way 
Somebody tried to tell me love doesn't last forever 
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams 
After all is said and done were still here together 
Never listen to the lies and jealousy

Don't you let them turn you around 
You better stop 
Hang onto this love that weave found 
Nuthin ever say 
Can stand in our way

People ask if I'm in love with you 
Because I'm sitting here with your picture 
And smiling to myself 
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you 
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through 
And I blush as I say yes 
What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me 
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak 
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being 
With abilities to set me free 
Free, make me be me 
Makes me want to say 
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss 
I must admit it's a part of me 
You please me, complete me, believe me 
Like a melody 
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof 
We were meant to be 
But the best quality thats hookin' me 
Is that you're loving me for me 
Is that you're loving me for me 
People ask why I'm in love with you 
Well, let me start by saying 
You got my heart by just being who you are 
And what we got is between me and you 
It doesn't matter about the money I make 
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star 
Unconditionally you're there for me 
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet 
This is meaningful, is incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable 
The way I feel, so sweet 
Makes me want to say 
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss 
I must admit it's a part of me 
You please me, complete me, believe me 
Like a melody 
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof 
We were meant to be 
But the best quality thats hookin' me 
Is that you're loving me for me 
Is that you're loving me for me 
Its so amazing how something so sweet 
Has come and rearranged my life 
I've been kissed by destiny 
Oh, heaven came and saved me 
An angel was placed at my feet 
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me 
Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes 
No cover ups, push ups 
With him, I dont have to put on a show 
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin 
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in 
He's real,he's honest, he's loving me for me

He-hey 
What is this feeling coming over me? 
I'm taken back in disbelief 
Is this really me, ha, in the mirror I see 
Staring back at me? 
Could it be? 
A new reflection of a woman complete 
All of a sudden I'm so carefree 
(Well, all right) 
'Cause love is doing something strange to me 
(Well, all right) 
Got a new flame, ha, haven't been the same 
Something in me's changed, rearranged 
And I feel that I've been saved 
You got me feeling like you're 
That something I've been missing 
Everything's heaven 
'Cause life with you has been a blessing 
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah 
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) 
Your love has brought me to a higher place, oh yeah 
(Who knew, who knew) 
It'd be you to restore my faith? 
Everyday, I'm amazed 
And it makes me wanna get down and pray 
Makes me wanna get down and pray 
Said, it makes me wanna get down and pray 
Yeah, hey 
I've kept some company I shouldn't have 
(Well, all right) 
Made some mistakes, but that's in the past 
(Well, all right) 
I'm professing here to you 
Proof that I am through 
I'm coming clean 
Now I can breathe 
And I finally believe, yeah 
You got me thinking I'll be all right 
And you're the reason 
Oh, I can feel it 
We're moving in a new direction 
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah 
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) 
Your love has brought me into a higher place, oh yeah

Oh 
Where would I be, where would I be 
Without you by my side? 
Where would I be, where would I be 
Without you standing by? 
Makes me wanna (pray) 
Makes me need to (pray) 
When I'm feeling low and all alone 
You're the light in my day, yeah 
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah 
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) 
Your love has brought me into a higher place, oh yeah

It'd be you to restore my faith? 
Everyday, I'm amazed 
'Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray 
'Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray 
Makes me wanna get down and pray 
Woo, thank you father! 
Wanna lift my hands up and pray

Wanna reach out and rejoice

Maria, don't you hear me calling, Maria? 
Maria, girl you know you were the only one 
How was I supposed to know? 
That it would cost my soul 
Nothin is free', outchea 
I wanna breathe outchea 
And how am I supposed to face this lonely life I've created? 
Is that the price that I'm payin' 
I wanna feel it 
All my life, wouldn't give up 
Was too young too know the difference 
How did I get so low? 
When did I turn so cold 
Inside of my own mind, I believe my own lies 
I'm facing the mirror 
Where, where, where is Maria? 
Why, why, why don't I see her? 
I, I just wanna see her 
Why, why, why don't I see her? 
I, I just need to see ya, Maria 
Now do you hear it in my voice? 
That I'm tryna make a choice 
I don't know which way to go at this crossroads 
You done taped my mouth shut 
Make me feel worthless, used up 
So tired of painting all this makeup 
'Cause it won't hide my deep cuts 
Eyes open but can't see 
Mouth open but can't speak 
I'm facing the mirror 
Where, where, where is Maria? 
Why, why, why don't I see her? 
I, I just wanna see her 
Where, where, where is Maria? 
Oh, I just wanna see ya, Maria 
Oh my lord 
Can you take away this heavy load? 
I can't carry it anymore 
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour? 
Oh my lord 
Can you take away this heavy load? 
I can't carry it anymore 
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour? 
Hear my plea for sympathy 
I just want you here with me 
Hear my plea for sympathy 
I just want you here with me 
Hear my plea for sympathy 
I just want you here with me 
Hear my plea for sympathy 
You keep running away 
Can you hear me callin'? 
My whole world is fallin' 
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya 
Can you hear me callin'? 
My whole world is fallin' 
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya 
Don't keep on runnin' away (you keep on runnin' away) 
Don't run away, don't run away, no 
Don't run away, don't run away, no 
Don't you keep on runnin' from me 
Don't you keep on runnin' from me 
Where, where, where is Maria?

My deceitful, evil ways 
Keep on growing stronger by the day

Beg forgiveness to help set me free

And the devil inside me is torn

What it is to make a life that means a little more

I don't know where I'm going just yet 
Skipping work and I don't need to excuse it 
Long as that floating feeling I get in the moment 
Makes it really worth it 
Hey, forget about your Monday morning 
We are never gonna be that boring 
Hey, forget about your Monday morning 
So, so ordinary same old story 
Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o 
I had a party, it went long, I told 'em all to stay 
Neighbors calling to complain and rain on our parade 
They told me to use my head and keep my focus straight 
Shame on all of you for being stiff and so straight laced 
Let them keep talking, I don't regret 
They can't help it, caught up in their mindset 
Long as that floating feeling I get in the moment 
Makes it really worth it 
Hey, forget about your Monday morning 
We are never gonna be that boring 
Hey, forget about your Monday morning

Everybody go to the beat, don't stop 
Keep up body rock cardiac arrest 
It's a culture shock

You shoot for the stars 
If it feels right 
And in for my heart 
If you feel like 
Can take me away, and make it okay 
I swear I'll behave 
You wanted control 
Sure we waited 
I put on a show 
Now I make it 
You say I'm a kid 
My ego is big 
I don't give a sh*t 
And it goes like this 
[Chorus] 
Take me by the tongue 
And I'll know you 
Kiss til you're drunk 
And I'll show you 
You want the moves like jagger 
I got the moves like jagger 
I got the mooooooves...like jagger 
I don't even try to control you 
Look into my eyes and I'll own you 
You with the moves like jagger 
I got the moves like jagger 
I got the moves...like jagger 
[Verse 2] 
Baby it's hard 
And it feel like you're broken in scar 
Nothing feels right 
But when you're with me 
I make you believe 
That I've got the key 
So get in the car 
We can ride it 
Wherever you want 
Get inside it 
And you want to stir 
But I'm shifting gears 
I'll take it from here 
And it goes like this 
[Chorus] 
Take me by the tongue 
And I'll know you 
Kiss til you're drunk 
And I'll show you 
You want the moves like jagger 
I got the moves like jagger 
I got the moves...like jagger 
I don't even try to control you 
Look into my eyes and I'll own you 
You with the moves like jagger 
I got the moves like jagger 
I got the moves...like jagger 
[Bridge] 
You want to know how to make me smile 
Take control, own me just for the night 
But if I share my secret 
You gonna have to keep it 
Nobody else can see this 
So watch and learn 
I won't show you twice 
Head to toe, ooh baby, roll me right 
But if I share my secret 
You gonna have to keep it 
Nobody else can see this 
And it goes like this 
[Chorus] 
Take me by the tongue 
And I'll know you 
Kiss til you're drunk 
And I'll show you 
You want the moves like jagger 
I got the moves like jagger 
I got the mooooooves...like jagger 
I don't even try to control you 
Look into my eyes and I'll own you 
You with the moves like Jagger 
I got the moves like Jagger 
I got the moves...like Jagger</field>

And slightly dopey gent 
You're my funny Valentine 
Sweet comic Valentine 
You make me smile with my heart 
Your looks are laughable 
Unphotographable 
Yet you're my favorite work of art 
Is your figure less than Greek 
Is your mouth a little weak 
When you open it to speak 
Are you smart? 
But don't change a hair for me 
Not if you care for me 
Stay little Valentine stay 
Each day is Valentine's day!</field>

My girls, so ladies step it up and take control 
Now shout, my girls we're stronger than one 
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun (come on!) 
My girls are screaming 
And yelling, and getting loud 
My girls are shaking up the party while 
you're getting down 
My girls are singing, and dancing and having fun 
My girls are cooking up a beat 
And they want you to come 
[Peaches] 
You ready, Christina? 
I like my girls hot, sweet, tough and playmate 
808 try a little primate 
Self-reliant, giant, death-defiant 
No Kobe Bryant 
I'll take a bullet for you 
If you give me a taste 
I rock a mullet or two 
Yeah, below the waist 
You're my Bff, you're my 606, 303 
I'ma swing and handle my fix 
My girls stay close when they see trouble around 
They got jewels on their fingers, it's about to go down 
We got no time for haters you know 
we just came to party 
Come on, now here we go 
My girls, we're running the show 
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go 
My girls, cause that's the way that we roll 
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control 
Now shout, my girls we're stronger than one 
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun 
My girls we're stronger than one 
Now shout, and sometimes 
Now shout, we gotta have fun</field>

(I said do it, ah, do it, uh, do it 'til you good and tired) 
He-hey 
I was sitting all alone, yeah 
A lot on my mind 
Felt a tap on my shoulder 
I rolled my eyes 
I wasn't in the mood for another man 
Telling me lies 
How can a girl say no when 
You flash that sexy smile and you say 
Aa-ey-ey (hey!) 
I wanna see you get nasty (is that right?) 
I wanna see you shake yo ass, yeah (hey) 
He-hey 
N.A.S.T.Y, you're nasty 
But baby I don't mind 
I love the way you're talking nasty 
You know you're just my type (boy you just so nasty) 
N.A.S.T.Y, you're nasty 
But baby I don't mind 
Love the way you're talking nasty 
You know you're just my type 
In the middle of the floor now, and I just don't care 
See my body so low now, crowd stops and stares 
Let 'em say what they want, but I'm feeling it 
And it's for you baby 
Tell me how can a girl say no 
When you're calling out to me and you say 
Aa-ey-ey (hey!) 
I wanna see you get nasty (is that right) 
I wanna see you shake yo ass, yeah (hey) 
He-hey

Love the way you're talking nasty 
You know you're just my type 
What's your fantasy? (oh, nasty, nasty) 
Tell them all to me (oh, nasty, nasty) 
Don't you be afraid (oh, nasty, nasty) 
Share your nasty secrets

            <field name="lyrics">There you are 
In a darkened room 
And you're all alone 
Looking out the window 
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love 
Like a broken arrow 
Here I stand in the shadows 
Come to me come to me 
Can't you see that 
Nobody wants to be lonely 
Nobody wants to cry 
My body's longing to hold you 
So bad it hurts inside 
Time is precious and it's slipping away 
And i've been waiting for you all of my life 
Nobody wants to be lonely so why 
Why don't you let me love you 
Can you hear my voice 
Do you hear my song 
It's a serenade 
So your heart can find me 
And suddenly your flying down the stairs 
Into my arms baby 
Before I start going crazy 
Run to me run to me 
Cause I'm dying 
Nobody wants to be lonely 
Nobody wants to cry 
My body's longing to hold you 
So bad it hurts inside 
Time is precious and it's slipping away 
And i've been waiting for you all of my life 
Nobody wants to be lonely so why 
Why don't you let me love you 
I want to feel you deeply 
Just like the air you're breathing 
I need you here in my life 
Don't walk away don't walk away 
Don't walk away don't walk away 
No no no no 
Nobody wants to be lonely 
Nobody wants to cry 
Nobody wants to be lonely 
I don't want to be lonely 
Nobody wants to cry 
I don't want to cry 
My body's longing to hold you 
I'm longing to hold you 
So bad it hurts inside 
Time is precious and it's slipping away 
And i've been waiting for you all of my life 
Nobody wants to be lonely so why 
Why don't you let me love you 
Why don't you let me love you 
Why oh why why why why why 
Nobody wants to be lonely 
I don't want to cry 
Nobody wants to cry 
My body's longing to hold you 
So bad it hurts inside 
Nobody wants to be lonely 
I don't want to be lonely 
Nobody wants to cry 
My body's longing to hold you 
So bad it hurts inside 
Time is precious and it's slipping away 
And i've been waiting for you all of my life 
Nobody wants to be lonely so why 
Why don't you let me love you

I am feeling a little out control 
Is this me 
You wanna get crazy 
Because I don't give a... 
I'm out of character 
I'm in rare form 
And If you really knew me 
You'd know its not the norm 
Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do 
The old me's gone I feel brand new 
And if you don't like it f*** you 
The music's on and I'm dancing 
I'm normally in the corner just standing 
I'm feeling unusual 
I don't care cause this is my night 
I'm not myself tonight 
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl 
I'm not myself tonight 
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl 
I'm dancing a lot and I'm taking shots and I'm feeling fine 
I'm kissing all the boys and the girls 
Someone call the doctor cause I lost my mind 
Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do 
The old me's gone I feel brand new 
And if you don't like it fuck you 
The music's on and I'm dancing 
I'm normally in the corner just standing 
I'm feeling unusual 
I don't care cause this is my night 
I'm not myself tonight 
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl 
I'm not myself tonight 
Tonight I'm not the same girl 
In the morning 
When I wake up 
I'll go back to the girl I used to be 
But baby not tonight 
I'm not myself tonight 
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl 
I'm not myself tonight 
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl 
Yah, that feels good 
I needed that 
Get crazy

Is my face aglow 
Isn't it obvious 
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore 
I'm feeling like a little girl 
Caught up in emotions 
I'm out of control 
Isn't it obvious 
Do you see my hands, they tremble 
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes 
Don't know how long 
I can keep this inside 
Isn't it obvious 
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore 
I'm feeling like a little girl 
Caught up in emotions 
I'm out of control

Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart 
Can you see it in my eyes 
Everyglance, every smile must give me away 
And i feel so much I can't hide 
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore 
I'm feeling like a little girl

For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn

Our Father, who art in heaven Hallowed be thy Name 
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done 
On earth as it is in heaven 
Give us this day our daily bread 
And forgive us our trespasses 
As we forgive those who trespass against us 
Lead us not into temptation 
But deliver us from evil 
For thine is the kingdom The power, and the glory 
For ever and ever Amen

She was so young with such innocent eyes, 
She always dreamt of a fairy tale life, 
And all the things that your money can't buy, 
And she thought that he was a wonderful guy. 
Then suddenly, things seemed to change, 
It was the moment she took on his name. 
He took his anger out on her face, 
She kept all of her pain locked away. 
Oh mother, we're stronger, 
From all of the tears you have shed. 
Oh mother, don't look back 
Cause he'll never hurt us again 
So mother, I thank you for all you've done and still do. 
You got me, I got you, 
Together we always pull through. 
We always pull through 
We always pull through, 
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother... 
It was the day that he turned on his kids, 
That she knew she had to leave him. 
So many voices up inside of her head, 
Saying over and over and over, 
"You deserve much more than this." 
She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide, 
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises) 
So tired for defending her life, she could have died, 
Fighting for the lives of her children. 
Oh mother, we're stronger, 
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed) 
Oh mother, don't look back 
Cause he'll never hurt us again (he'll never hurt us again) 
So mother, I thank you (thank you) 
For all you've done and still do (still do) 
You got me, I got you, (yeah you got me and I got you) 
Together we always pull through. 
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother... 
All of your life you have spent, 
Burying hurt and regret. 
but mama, He'll never touch us again. 
For every time he tried to break you down, 
Just remember who's still around, 
It's over, and we're stronger, 
and we'll never have to go back again... 
Oh mother, we're stronger, 
From all of the tears you have shed. 
Oh mother, don't look back (oh mother don't look back again) 
Cause he'll never hurt us again (cause he'll never hurt us again) 
So mother, I thank you (and I thank you for all that you've done) 
for all you've done and still do (together we always move on) 
You got me, I got you, (you got me, I got you) 
Together we always pull through (always pull through) 
We always pull through,

We go 
The horse knows the way 
To carry the sleigh 
Through white 
And drifted snow 
Over the river 
And through the woods 
Oh 
How the wind does blow 
It stings the toes 
And bites the nose 
As over the ground we go 
Over the river 
And through the woods 
To have a full day of play 
Oh, hear the bells 
Ringing ting-a-ling-ling 
For it is Christmas Day 
Over the river 
And through the woods 
Trot fast my dapple gray 
Spring o'er the ground 
Just like a hound 
For this is Christmas Day 
Over the river 
And through the woods 
And straight through 
The barnyard gate 
It seems that we go 
So dreadfully slow 
It is so hard to wait 
Over the river 
And through the woods

Hurrah for fun 
The pudding's done 
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie</field>

Permanent vacation, we should go away 
Way too much for me to wanna throw away 
I'm hopin' that you're racin' through the signs

You may think you see who I really am 
But you'll never know me 
Every day, it's as if I play a part 
Now I see 
If I wear a mask 
I can fool the world 
But I can not fool my heart 
Who is that girl I see 
Staring straight back at me? 
When will my reflection show 
Who I am inside? 
I am now in a world where I have to 
Hide my heart 
And what I believe in 
But somehow I will show the world 
What's inside my heart 
And be loved for who I am 
Who is that girl I see 
Staring straight back at me? 
Why is my reflection someone I don't know? 
Must I pretend that I'm someone else for all time? 
When will my reflection show 
Who I am inside? 
There's a heart that must be free to fly 
That burns with a need to know the reason why 
Why must we all conceal 
What we think 
How we feel 
Must there be a secret me 
I'm forced to hide? 
I won't pretend that I'm 
Someone else for all time 
When will my reflection show 
Who I am inside? 
When will my reflection show 
Who I am inside?</field>

Somehow you're always waiting with 
Your open arms to catch me 
You're gonna save me from myself 
From myself, yes 
You're gonna save me from myself 
My love is tainted by your touch 
Some guys have shown me aces 
But you've got that royal flush 
I know it's crazy everyday 
Well tomorrow maybe shaky 
But you never turn away 
Don't ask me why I'm crying 
'cause when I start to crumble 
You know how to keep me smiling 
You always save me from myself 
From myself, myself 
You're gonna save me from myself 
I know it's hard, it's hard 
But you've broken all my walls 
You've been my strength, so strong 
And don't ask me why I love you 
It's obvious you tenderness 
Is what I need to make me 
A better woman to myself 
To myself, myself 
You're gonna save me from myself.</field>

stronger 
All night long 
Anticipating morning, lying I can?t wait much longer 
Feels so strong 
Our bodies touching, I just can?t get enough 
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh 
Won?t let you sleep, I gotta satisfy my needs 
I need to love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh 
And when the sun rises, there?s one thing on my mind 
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside 
And even though we made sweet love all night 
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right 
Might be late for work, but I promise that it?s worth it baby 
Don?t go 
So hungry for you, taste me and I?ll taste you 
There?s no stopping what I?ll do to get you in the 
mood 
Our bodies touching, I just can?t get enough 
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh 
Won?t let you sleep, I want you deep inside of me 
So I can love you, love you, love you, love you, love you 
And when the sun rises, there?s one thing on my mind 
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside 
And even though we made sweet love all night 
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right 
And I can see break of day beging through the 
curtains 
And I?m so certain, soon I?m gonna feel your honey 
drip my juices start to flow 
Strawberry cream is like a dream, my fantasy is 
reality 
When the morning comes, I know that I will too 
And when the sun rises, there?s one thing on my mind 
I need sex for breakfast, stay inside 
(oh, oh, stay inside baby) 
And even though we made sweet love all night 
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right 
(it feels so good, inside) 
And when the sun rises, there?s one thing on my mind 
Sex for breakfast (I need it, I want it), 
Stay inside (when the morning comes) 
And even though that we made sweet love all night 
Sex for breakfast, feels so right 
(so hungry for you) 
Taste me, and I?ll taste you 
Sex for breakfast 
All done

I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin' 
I'm sick of sittin', been workin' too hard to not be livin' 
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need it no more 
I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin' 
I'm sick of sittin', been workin' too hard to not be livin' 
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need you no more 
I don't need it anymore, yeah 
Oh no, no 
I don't need it anymore 
Just don't need it, just don't need it 
Yeah 
I make it a policy not to tell anybody to sit down 
I just still encourage everybody else to stand up 
I survived the dark ages 
But the former trailblazer took out the knife and cut ties 
I'm just fine 
Honey, don't do me no favours 
The root of evil couldn't change me 
You pray for them, but don't pray for me 
I can't move with these chains on me 
I have to get free 
I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin' 
I'm sick of sittin', I been workin' too hard to not be livin' 
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need it no more 
I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin' 
I'm sick of sittin', been workin' too hard to not be livin' 
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need you no more 
Gotta let it go, let it go, let it go 
Had to be free, oh 
I don't need it anymore 
I don't, no, I don't, no 
They wanna take my shine 
They wanna take my time 
But I'mma take what's mine 
Don't play with me 
They try to use my name 
Oh, what they wouldn't do for the fame 
But I ain't you and we ain't the same 
This ain't a game to me 
I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin' 
I'm sick of sittin', I been workin' too hard to not be livin' 
I'm sick of sittin', I'm so emancipated 
I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin' 
I'm sick of sittin', been workin' too hard to not be livin' 
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need you no more 
I don't need it anymore 
I don't need it anymore

I'm sitting on my bed 
Feeling so so lonely 
Wishing someone hold me 
All I have is three little notes playing in my head 
Outside I can cover all the scars 
Inside lie the words just pleading to be heard 
Cause all I have are three little melodies 
To kill all the hurt 
And now I'm ready 
Now I'm gonna sing em all out 
Sing em out just to myself 
I don't even care what the world thinks 
About how I sound 
Cause when I open my mouth 
My whole heart comes out 
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied 
I'm singing till I'm winning 
Imma sing all night 
Cause when I open my mouth 
Theres no place to hide 
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free 
I'm singing cause I'm winning imma sing for me 
I stand and believe in who I am 
Take shots at my heart but who am I to give up 
Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free 
My stage is the greatest in the world 
Give back to the ones who struggle with me stay true 
Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny 
And now I'm ready 
now I'm gonna sing it all out 
Sing it out just for myself 
I don't even care what the world thinks 
About how I sound 
Cause when I open my mouth 
My whole heart comes out 
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied 
I'm singing till I'm winning 
Imma sing all night 
Cause when I open my mouth 
Theres no place to hide 
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free 
I'm singing cause I'm winning imma sing for me 
Sing for me 
Sing for myself 
Sing with harmony 
Make my whole heart come out 
Right where i am let the rain come down 
Sing for me 
Sing for myself sing with harmony 
Make my whole heart come out 
Right here right now make my on very own sound 
Cause when I open my mouth 
My whole heart comes out 
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied 
I'm singing till I'm winning 
Imma sing all night 
Cause when I open my mouth 
Theres no place to hide 
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free 
I'm singing cause I'm winning imma sing for me</field>

Woo yeah, oooh hey, woo 
I can tell that you're into me 
Baby it's so plain to see 
I can see it in your eyes 
You're paralyzed; every time I pass you by 
You're the kind that gets your way 
Every minute, every single day 
I can see it all in your face, you're blown away 
Cause I don't want you in my space 
You're strutting around here like you think that 
I can't do without you 
You got some nerve to think that 
I would give you everything 
[Chorus] 
Slow down baby, and don't act crazy 
Cos you know, you can look all you want 
but you just can't touch (just can't touch, no) 
So slow down baby (hey), I'm not your lady (lady) 
Boy you're never gonna get it from me 
cause I'm with someone 
Slow it down, slow it down, ooo woo, slow 
After all of the games you played 
How's it feel to finally get a taste? 
You can dish it out 
but can you take the bed you've made? 
Boy it ain't gonna change 
I'm not falling for your stupid lines 
I know you've used'em 'bout a thousand times 
Say'em like they were a nursery rhyme 
But I won't bite; 
baby don't you even try 
You're coming 'round here like 
you think that everything's about you 
If you knew anything 
you'd realize I'm wearing a ring 
Slow down baby, and don't act crazy 
Cos you know, you can look all you want 
but you just can't touch (just can't touch, no) 
So slow down baby (hey), I'm not your lady (lady) 
Boy you're never gonna get it from me 
cause I'm with someone 
Do you really wanna waste your time 
Don't you have better things to do with life (yeah, woah) 
Listen, I don't wanna get you down 
But I ain't never gonna mess around 
So how many ways do I have to say it yeah… 
Slow down baby, and don't act crazy 
Cos you know, you can look all you want 
but you just can't touch (just can't touch, no) 
So slow down baby (hey), I'm not your lady (lady) 
Boy you're never gonna get it from me

Slow down baby, 
And don't act crazy 
Cos you know, you can look all you want

I can't let go I'm so emotional 
I'm sinking fast into an ocean full of you 
I'm so emotional 
You take me high and low, you know 
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go 
You're such a mystery to me 
But baby hot or cold you got a hold 
Of my imagination 
I think you know what I mean 
You make me feel so emotional 
I can't let go I'm so emotional 
I'm sinking fast into an ocean full of you 
I'm so emotional 
Rain is falling down on me 
Suddenly the sun comes out 
Sometimes north or south of love

Tell me can you hold on 
When they say you should change 
Can you lift your head high and stay strong 
Will you give up, give in 
When your heart's crying out "that is wrong" 
Will you love you for you at the end of it all 
Now, in life there's gonna be times 
When you're feeling low 
And in your mind, insecurities seems to take control 
We start to look outside ourselves 
For acceptance and approval 
We keep forgetting that the one thing 
we should know is 
Don't be scared 
To fly alone 
Find a path that is your own 
Love will open every door 
See in your hands the world is yours 
Don't hold back and always know 
All the answers you will unfold 
What are you waiting for 
Spread your wings and soar 
The boy who wonders, is he good enough for them 
Keep trying to please them all 
But he just never seems to fit in 
Then there's the girl who thinks she'll never ever be 
Good enough for him 
He's trying to change and 
That's a game she'll never win 
In life, there will be times when you're feeling low 
And in your mind, insecurities seems to take control 
We start to look outside ourselves 
For acceptance and approval 
We keep forgetting that one thing 
we should know is 
Don't be scared 
To fly alone 
Find a path that is your own 
Love will open every door 
See in your hands the world is yours 
Don't hold back and always know 
All the answers they will unfold 
What are you waiting for 
Spread your wings and soar 
In the mirror is where she comes 
Face to face with her fears 
Her own reflection now foreign to her 
After all these years 
However how she's has tried to be 
Something besides herself 
Now time has passed and she's ended up 
someone else with regret 
What is it is that makes us feel the need 
To keep pretending 
Gotta let ourselves be 
Don't be scared 
To fly alone 
Find a path that is your own 
Love will open every door 
See in your hands the world is yours 
Don't hold back and always know 
All the answers you will unfold 
Don't wait no more 
Spread your wings and soar 
Don't be scared 
To fly alone 
Find a path that is your own 
Love will open every door 
See in your hands the world is yours 
Don't hold back and always know 
All the answers you will unfold 
Don't wait no more 
Spread your wings and soar 
Don't wait no more 
You've got to soar 
Spread your wings and soar 
Don't wait no more 
Spread your wings and soar 
You've can soar 
So what you waiting for 
(Don't wait, Don't wait) 
Soar

            <field name="lyrics">Yeah 
Yeah. 
Ooh, Ooh, Ohh 
If you see me walking down the street, 
or in the pages of your magazine, 
looking just a little differently, 
showing off a softer side of me, 
Saying I'm looking like a lady, 
Saying that love is going to change me. 
But don't be fooled by everything you see, 
Gotta let the naughty in me free. 
There's a woman inside of all of us, 
who never quite seems to get enough. 
Tring to play by the rules is rough 
because sooner or later something's going to erupt us. 
I still got that nasty in me, still got that dirty degree, 
And if you want some more sexy, still got freak in me, 
I still got that nasty in me, still got that dirty degree, 
And if you want some more sexy, still got freak in me, 
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty, 
And if you're still rolling with me, still got it. 
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty, 
Still got that freak in me. 
Why is a woman's sexuality, 
always under so much scrutiny? 
Why can't she do exactly as she please, 
Without being called a million things? 
They say I'm not the girl they used to know, (used to know) 
'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes, (oh) 
But don't be fooled for a moment, I can't hold (I can't hold) 
I'm letting lose, gonna my body choke, (don't you know) 
There's some women out there who talk and stare, 
who never seem to let down their hair, 
like to past judgement, but they're just scared, 
and don't know what they're missing, so they better be aware. 
I still got that nasty in me, still got that dirty degree, (ooh) 
And if you want some more sexy, still got freak in me, 
I still got that nasty in me, still got that dirty degree, 
And if you still want some more sexy, still got freak in me. 
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty, 
And if you're still rolling with me, still got it. 
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty, 
Still got that freak in me. 
Don't tell me to behave, 'cause I'll never play that game, (no) 
Don't tell me what to do, 'cause I'll never a tight? like you, 
Don't look at me that way, 'cause I ain't never gonna change. 
And if you talking about my life, 
you're only wasting your own time. 
If I want to wear lingere outside of my clothes, 
If I want to be erotic in my own videos, 
If I want to be provacative, well that ain't a sin, 
Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin. 
I still got that nasty in me, still got that dirty degree, (in me) 
And if you want some more sexy, still got freak in me, 
I still got that nasty in me, still got that dirty degree, (in me) 
And if you want some more sexy, still got freak in me, 
Ooh, yeah. 
Hey, hey, hey

It's all or nothing, I fear that something's wrong 
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way 
How I wish you, you suffered less too 
It tears us both apart 
And it's not pretty the way you criticize me 
And how it breaks my heart 
And though you tell me that you love me 
I can't feel it and I'm afraid to let you down 
It's all or nothing, I fear that something's wrong 
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail

How I wish you knew, how much I need you 
I feel like running but I can't abandon you 
You avoid my gaze, withdraw from me these days 
You punish me for trying to be all that you wanted 
What more can I do? 
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way

Diddy: (Verse 1) 
Let's play a game 
Let's pretend for a second 
You don't know who I am or what I do 
Let's just put it to the side 
I can feel your heart beating 
And I can hear you breathing 
Look into your eyes 
Trying to see into your mind 
See into your soul 
See, no limits to the levels 
Me and you can go 
When it's me, I take control 
But it's something about you 
That make me wanna change 
I like the way you dancing 
And the way you play the game 
I like the way you take away the pain 
The way you tell me that you want it 
Not saying a thing 
The way you got me going 
Got me going outta my brains 
I see us going at it 
Going in and out of them lanes 
I don't want your innocence 
I don't want you to stutter 
I don't want a commitment 
And I don't want you to suffer 
I don't want your number 
Baby, I want you to wonder 
I want you to come up 
Looking like something you wanna 
Christina Aguilera: (Verse 1) 
Tell me, what you thinking about 
When you got me waiting patiently 
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody 
But there's something about you 
That really got me feeling weak 
And I'm trying to find the words to speak 
Boy, I got my eyes on you 
So tell me what you wanna do 
I can picture you in my room 
Until the morning 
I don't even know your name 
Boy, I need to know your name 
I'm hoping that you feel the same 
Tell me if you want it 
(Hook) 
I know you're gonna like it (I know) 
So tell me how you wanna it (tell me) 
And you don't have to fight it (you don't) 
Cause baby you're invited (baby) 
(repeat) 
Diddy: (Verse 2) 
You're dreams fulfilled 
You're rockin' with the best 
Unforgivable I'ma put your limits to the test 
You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your 
Chest 
You're hyperventilating, trying to catch your breath 
(Don't stop) 
I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end 
I'm the force in your thoughts that'll make your mind bend 
Look how I approach you, look how I expose you 
Look how I studied every move, now I know you 
I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you 
And do everything that I told you 
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me 
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me 
(Don't stop) 
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come 
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast 
I'm the last thing your eyes see 
The passion is inside me, it's yours 
Now come try me, c'mon 
Christina Aguilera: (Verse 2) 
Tell me, what you thinking about 
When your hands is all on me 
Cause I've been thinking about 
All the possibilities 
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be 
Cause you're sweepin' me off my feet 
Boy, I got my eyes on you 
Tell me what you wanna do 
I can picture you in my room 
Until the morning 
I don't even know your name 
Boy, I need to know your name 
I'm hoping that you feel the same 
Tell me if you want it 
(Hook) 
I know you're gonna like it (I know) 
So tell me how you wanna it (tell me) 
And you don't have to fight it (you don't) 
Cause baby you're invited (baby) 
(repeat) 
Christina Aguilera: (Bridge) 
I got a selection of the positions of affection with 
No pressure 
So tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it

It took such a long time 
For me to realize just how to be 
And to listen to me 
Don't go thinking I'm not thankful, 
'Cause me, I've got my hands full of good things, oh 
And I hope I can give back 
A little bit of what you've given me 
So thank you for standing right by me [I will always love you] 
So thank you for being behind me [You are just so amazing] 
And watching me grow and letting others know 
That you still believe in what I'll be 
Ha. 
So people have said things in times 
About me that weren't always true 
Ooh yeah 
But you've always been there 
To give that extra love to pull me through 
To do what I gotta do 
Cause there'll always be those ups and downs 
But you've always seemed to stick around and see 
See me through to believe, yeah 
And I hope I can give back 
A little bit of what you've given me 
You give me all that I need, yeah 
So thank you for standing right by me [I thank you for everything] 
So thank you for being behind me [Thank you, Christina] 
And watching me grow and letting others know 
That you still believe in what I'll be [Sing it, girl] 
It took awhile 'til I could do what I wanted 
And now I'm so happy that it started where we started 
I'm thanking God that I could be in the position 
To do my own thing now and make my own decisions 
And so I'm thanking you for being true

To know what it felt like 
To let something take control 
To live the expression 
I'm head over heels this time 
Unafraid to be open 
And thinking I'd be just fine 
But I found in the very end 
That it all depends 
'Cause love can lift you so high 
Or it'll leave you to die 
And it's not like you ever get to choose 
(Which way that it leads you) 
Ooh it can play with your mind 
Or make you feel so alive 
Either way you'll survive 'cause 
That's what love can do 
Ohh, yeah yeah 
That's what love can do 
I guess now I get why 
They say love is a dangerous game 
'Cause when you think that you're winning 
You find out that you just been played 
You give and you sacrifice 
You make changes in your life 
Everyone's got advice 
But no one's got a clue (not even you) 
And I found in the very end 
That it all depends 
'Cause love can lift you so high 
Or it'll leave you to die 
And it's not like you ever get to choose

Ooh, ohh, ooh 
That's what love can do 
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming 
Dreaming of when I believed in 
Fairy tales, sunset sails, it never fails 
'Til reality sets in 
I begin to comprehend how crazy this has been 
And I can't depend on 
Anyone for my happily ever after 
Yeah, yeah

Always strong, tried not to cry 
Never felt like I needed any man 
To comfort me in life 
But I'm all made up today 
A veil upon my face 
But no father stands beside me 
To give his bride away 
Well I'm standing in the chapel 
Wearing my white dress 
I have waited for this moment 
With tears of happiness 
Here I leave behind my past 
By taking the chance 
I've finally found the right man 
Thoughts racing fast through my mind 
As I'm gazing down the aisle 
That my future will mend the memories 
Sown between father and child 
My emotions overload 
'cause there is no hand to hold 
There's no shoulder here to lean on 
I'm walking all on my own 
Here I go 
Now I'm standing at for corners 
To have and to hold 
Now my love, you stand beside me 
To walk life's winding road 
And I owe it all to you 
For taking the chance 
You've shown my there's a right man 
'cause I never knew a right man 
Well I'm standing in the chapel 
Ready to confess 
That I've waited for this moment 
With tears of happiness 
Now I leave behind my past 
By taking the chance 
Ohh 
Well I'm standing at for corners 
To have and to hold 
Now my love, you stand beside me 
To walk life's winding road 
And I owe it all to you 
For taking the chance 
And one day my little girl

            <field name="lyrics">Young girl, don't cry 
I'll be right here when your world starts to fall 
Young girl, it's alright 
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly 
When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream 
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems 
No one ever wants or bothers to explain 
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means 
Chorus: 
When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within 
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within 
Young girl, don't hide 
You'll never change if you just run away 
Young girl, just hold tight 
Soon you're gonna see your brighter day 
Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed 
It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid 
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold 
When you're lost outside look inside to your soul 
Repeat Chorus 
When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within 
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within 
Yeah... 
Life is a journey 
It can take you anywhere you choose to go 
As long as you're learning 
You'll find all you'll ever need to know (be strong) 
You'll break it (hold on) 
You'll make it (be strong) 
Just don't forsake it because 
(No one can tell you what you can't do) 
No one can stop you, you know that I'm talking to you 
Repeat Chorus 
When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within 
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within 
Young girl, don't cry 
I'll be right here when your world starts to fall

The music on my tounge, when I sing fa la la 
You'll be my flower child, in the month of May 
My sunny summer lover on my holiday 
You'll be my autumn leaves, my Halloween 
The winter snow and everything that's in between 
This year I'm gonna take you home 
This year I don't wanna be alone 
This year, this Christmas, together, 
And the minutes they pass, and the hours the fly 
This year, this Christmas, forever 
And the weeks and the months go rushing by 
This year we have learned how to live 
How to forget, and how to forgive without fear 
Just love, this Christmas, this year 
You'll be my spring ahead, my fall behind 
The shimmy in my hips, oh when I bump and grind 
You'll be my Santa boy, all dressed in red 
And ride that little reindeer all through my head 
Round and round 
Round and round 
Here we go 
This year I'm gonna take you home

When I try to describe how I feel when you hold me 
I get butterflies I HEAR lullabies, it's hard to explain 
Like the sCent of a rose or the sound of the rain 
It's too precious and too wonderful to give it a name 
Chorus 
Too beautiful for words 
A symphony inside me 
Too beautiful for words 
I can not take them lightly 
Can you hear my silent heart 
Verse 2 
It's on the tip of my tongue 
But my lips are still sealed 
Only violins and their innocence can show you how I feel 
And I hear them again 
At the end of the day 
I'm all teary-eyed when we kiss good-bye 
There's nothing I can say 
Chorus 
Too beautiful for words 
A symphony inside of me 
Too beautiful for words 
I can not take them lightly 
Can you hear my silent heart 
Verse 3 
Must be a million times 
I've tried to express this love of mine 
When it goes this deep, when it tastes this sweet 
It's not easy to define 
Chorus 
Too beautiful for words 
A symphony inside me 
Too beautiful for words 
I can not take them lightly 
Can you hear my silent heart.</field>

Are you filthy? Are you pure? 
Oh, I thought by now I'd know

Well, you're no angel

You're my danger 'cause that's just what I need

            <field name="lyrics">I remember when it all first began 
We were tight right from the start 
It wasn't long before you came on strong 
Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it) 
I played hard to get but I couldn't help 
I gave up my ironing 
You were thoughtful 
Careful not to hurt the relationship 
What happened to those days when 
You used to be compassionate 
Caring what I thought and said 
So attentive gentleman 
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set 
Taking me for granted lately 
Frankly, it's gotta quit 
I feel underappreciated 
Now girls help me out 
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say 
I'm feeling Underappreciated 
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment 
Back to the beginning, to the very beginning 
When our love was something new 
Back when romance was important 
Not just another thing to do 
I was feeling high on love tonight 
Thought I never come back down 
Now it seems that you and me 
Have lost our solid ground 
Half the time I realize 
I seem to give more than I get 
Funny how things seem to change 
After a few years commitment 
Used to talk for hours on end 
'Bout our dreams while we lay in bed 
How I missed those days when you stayed awake 
Now you roll over and snore instead 
I feel underappreciated 
Now girls help me out 
'Cause you know what I'm talking about, I say 
I'm feeling underappreciated 
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment 
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
I miss those nice massages 
The long for closeness 
The way you talk 
How it turned me on 
The thoughtfulness and the sweetest lips 
I needed those days back 
I feel underappreciated 
Now girls help me out 
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say

I used to think that 
happiness could only be 
something to happen 
to somebody else 
Everybody believed, everybody but me, yeah-ah 
And I've been hurt so many times before that 
my hopes was dying, 
I was so sick of trying 
Everybody could see, everybody but me, yeah-ah 
But then you came into my life, 
you opened up my softer side and 
Now I can see, to your right, 
suddenly, I realize 
(I made you think, you don't understand...) 
All the times you didn't understand, 
why you just couldn't be my man? 
(I made you think, you don't understand...) 
There were many walls you had to climb 
if you really wanted to be mine 
(I made you think, you don't understand...) 
After all the hoops 
I pushed you through, 
now you see that I'm in love with you 
Now, I hope you finally understand... 
So many tears I've had to cry 
but you had many more of your own, 
you had to try 
But you stuck it out and 
you're here with me now 
And remember when the days when I pushed away your love, 
you called my beloved and you still stayed around 
Yeah, you figured me out, said, you got me down 
And there's no way I lie to you, 
you know me better than I do 
Baby, oh, you see me through, 
I'll be no good without you 
(I made you think, you don't understand...) 
All the times you didn't understand, 
why you just couldn't be my man? 
(I made you think, you don't understand...) 
There were many walls you had to climb 
if you really wanted to be mine 
(I made you think, you don't understand...) 
After all the hoops 
I pushed you through, 
now you see that I'm in love with you 
Now, I hope you finally understand... 
Baby, won't you listen now, 
can't you see just what I'm talking about? 
Said: baby won't you listen now, 
can't you see just what I'm talking about? 
Time went on and I was wrong 
to keep my distance for so long 
So afraid, you wouldn't stay 
but you never turned away 
Always right by my side, 
you're forever in my life 
Don't you go, it's not mine, no, 
that ain't you, I found my home 
I could see, to your right, 
suddenly, I realize

Unless it's with you, unless it's with you 
You came into my life when I wasn't trying to find 
Anybody to love, hiding what I felt inside 
But you opened me up and now I finally realize 
I'll be your girl for life 
We don't need a big audience 
Thousand people we never met 
Me and you and a couple of friends 
And here we are and I must confess 
Yeah, I'm in over my head feeling confused 
I'm losing my mind, don't know what to do 
'Cause I don't want to get married 
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you 
And oh, I know that it's scary 
But I know that it's true, I'm saying I do 
'Cause I don't want to get married 
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you 
Beating heart and trembling hands 
Take me just the way I am 
'Cause all that I want is one and the same 
For the rest of my days, for the rest of my days 
You can ask me in a hundred years 
If I would still be standing here 
When we're old and gray, I'd answer the same 
Our love will remain, oh, our love will remain 
Yeah, I was over my head feeling confused 
Been losing my mind, don't know what to do 
'Cause I don't want to get married 
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you 
And oh, I know that it's scary 
(But I know that it's true, I'm saying I do) 
'Cause I don't want to get married 
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you 
Unless it's with you</field>

(What do you do when you know something's bad for you 
but you still can't let go?) 
I was naive, your love was like candy 
artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping 
Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed 
I was prey in your bed and devoured completely 
And it hurts my soul cause I can't let go 
All these walls are caving in, I can't stop my sufferin' 
I hate to show that I lost control 
Cause I, I keep going right back 
To the one thing that I need 
To walk away from 
Yeaah... 
I need to get away from you, need to walk away from you 
get away, walk away, walk away 
. 
I should have known that I was used for amusement(for amusement) 
Couldn't see through the smoke, 
It was all an illusion 
Now I've been licking my wounds,(licking my wounds) but the venom seeps deeper (deeper, deeper) 
We both can seduce, but darlin' you hold me prisoner (prisoner) 
Oh, I'm about to break, I can't stop this ache 
I'm addicted to your allure, and I'm fiendin' for a cure 
Every step I take leads to one mistake 
I keep going right back to the one thing that I need 
Oh, I can't mend this torn state I'm in 
Getting nothing in return, what did I do to deserve 
The pain of this slow burn 
And everywhere I turn, 
I keep going right back to the one thing that I need 
To walk away from 
yeahh... 
I need to get away from you, need to walk away from you 
Every time I try to grasp for air 
I am smothered in despair 
It's never over, over, oh oh 
. 
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare, 
I let out a silent prayer 
. 
Let it be over, oh 
. 
Inside I'm screaming, begging, pleading no more (oooh) 
Now what to do, my heart has been bruised 
So sad but it's true, each beat reminds me of you 
It hurts my soul, cause I can't let go 
All these walls are caving in, I can't stop my sufferin' 
I hate to show that I've lost control 
Cause I, I keep going right back to the one thing that I need 
Oh, I'm about to break, I can't stop this ache 
I'm addicted to your allure, and I'm fiendin' for a cure 
Every step I take leads to one mistake 
I keep going right back to the one thing that I need 
Oh, I can't mend this torn state I'm in 
Getting nothing in return, what did I do to deserve 
The pain of this slow burn 
And everywhere I turn, I keep going right back to the one thing that I need 
To walk away from 
yeaahh... 
dying.. 
oooh... 
i said... 
need to get away from you, need to walk away from you 
get away, walk away, walk away [repeat] 
(mmm) 
Only thing I need to do 
Is walk away from you</field>

Every single time the wind blows 
Every single time the wind blows 
I see it in your face 
In a cold night, there will be no fair fight 
There will be no good night, to turn and walk away

I'm gonna wake up screaming your name 
Yes, I'm a sinner, yes I'm a saint

We remain 
Now, we talk about our wasted future 
But, we take a good look around 
Yeah, we take a good look around

No, we never let it slow us down

We can breathe a sigh, 
seems the storm has passed 
All our friends would ask us why 
with all that stood between us 
why did we even try 
no one I know 
imagined we would make it 
But it only made us glad we both believed.... 
oooohhhhhhhhhh.... 
Chorus: 
You and me, we're a miracle 
Meant to be and nothing can change it 
Mountains move and oceans part, 
when they are standing in our way 
You and me, we're a miracle 
Angels stand watching over us, 
and heaven shines upon us everyday 
All my life I felt incomplete 
but you touch my soul whit your love so sweetelly 
you hear my thoughts 
you read my mind 
you're the part of me I thought I never find 
Chorus: 
You and me, we're a miracle 
Meant to be and nothing can change it 
Mountains move and oceans part,

You and me, we're a miracle 
Angels stand watching over us, 
and heaven shines upon us everyday 
The chance was so unlikely, 
that we would ever be, oh 
Two stars among the heavens 
Destiny brought you to me 
Chorus: 
You and me, we're a miracle 
Meant to be and nothing can change it, 
Mountains move and oceans part,

You and me we're a miracle, miracle 
You and me we're a miracle, miracle

Greatest show on earth 
You've never seen before 
Let the fairytale unfold 
What's behind the smoke and glass? 
Painted faces, everybody wears a mask 
Are you selling them your soul? 
Well, you'll be left out in the cold 
Is it all blue skies 
Fun and games untill you fall 
Then you're left without anyone at all 
You're ridin' on a shooting star 
With a smile upon your face 
But soon the shine fades 
And you're left out all alone 
Wondering "where did they all go?" 
Been jaded, hated 
Who'll be around when the limelight's faded? 
Been shut down, pushed out 
Made to smile when I wanted to frown 
Always takin' a bow 
Always workin' the crowd 
Always breakin' new ground 
Always playin' the clown 
Who'll be stickin' it out? 
Who'll be stayin' around 
When the lights go down?

What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Ooh ohh, yeah yeah 
I wanna thank you 
For giving me, time to breathe 
Like a rock you waited so patiently 
While I got it together, oh 
While I figured it out 
I only looked but I never touched 
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us 
Holding hands, making plans 
And it's lucky for me you understand 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever keeps me in your arms 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me 
What I want is what you got 
And what you got, is what I want 
There was a time I was blind, I was so confused 
Run away just to hide it all from you. 
But baby, you knew me better than I knew myself 
They say if you love something let it go 
If it comes back it's yours 
That's how you know 
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure 
And you're ready and willin' 
To give me more than 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free 
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever keeps me in your arms 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me 
Oh baby, oh darling 
Thank you, thank you 
A girl needs 
Somebody sensitive but tough 
Somebody there when the going gets rough 
Every night he'll be giving his love 
(He'll be giving his love) 
To just one girl (to one girl, oh) 
Somebody cool but real tender too 
Somebody, baby, just like you 
Can keep me hanging around 
With the one who always knew... 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free 
Ohh oh, I'm thanking you for being there for me 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever keeps me in your arms is what I neeed, ohh... 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free... 
Always what I need, always what I want 
What I need, what I want, and you've got, yeah yeah 
Oh baby, I thank you, cause you know... 
What you got, is what I need 
What you want, hahaha, what I want 
Ooh, ohh yeah 
Oh baby, oh darling 
I thank you, thank you 
For giving me what I need 
And for what I want 
Ohh...oh yeah yeah

Nas: 
I can feel what was bothering Marvin 
Why his words forever remain 
Dealing with these modern day problems 
'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my

Too many infected 
Too many lives diminishing

Latinos and Asians 
Pray together 
Less fight 
We better unite 
As genocide chemical war 
And the rich and the poor 
Know that God delivers a cure 
Eve: 
It's a shame our reality is devastating 
People praying for a cure 
Dying while they're waiting 
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it 
All the kids with dreams 
Won't get the chance to chase it 
Makes me sad 
Think about the lives they would've had 
Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads 
How can we sit back and not try to make it right 
We gotta come together 
We gotta fight for life 
Fred Durst: 
Somebody tell me what's going on

We got human beings using humans for a bomb 
But everyone wanna live 
Don't nobody really want to die

And watching people cry 
Let me break it down for a minute 
If there's enough room here for you and me 
There's plenty of room for some humanity

And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom 
I haven't smiled 
When alone in my room very much 
Then we touched 
I just know 
When you put your hands on me 
I feel sexy 
And my body turns to gold 
i just know 
When you put your hands on me 
I feel ready 
And I lose my self control 
I don't know if a doll can unwind 
Or how to make a person go 
I don't know how to be what you like 
And simply open up the depths of my soul 
So I keep my wings 
And my eyes on the down 
Ready for nothing 
But holding my ground 
I haven't used 
A particular noun very much 
Then we touched 
I won't notice 
Or pay you no mind 
Boy I couldn't care less 
what you do with your time 
Your fingertips on my hips 
Just move me like one of a kind.</field>

What kind of world would it be without you? I couldn't breathe without you near 
What kind of world would I see without you? I can't dream without you here 
Beautiful boy, how on Earth did I do something worth deserving you? 
My better half, how I cherish through and through every part of you, I do 
Loving you's made me whole, now I belong, I found my home 
Promise me we'll always stay the way we are today 
What kind of world would it be without you? I couldn't breathe without you near 
What kind of world would I see without you? I can't dream without you here 
I can't ever imagine if this never had happened, I thank God everyday 
Almost lost you forever but I always remember say you're my saving grace

We've lost it all, the love is gone 
She has won 
Now it's no fun 
We've lost it all, the love is gone 
And we had magic 
And this is tragic 
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself 
(Chorus:) 
I feel like our world's been infected 
And somehow you left me neglected 
We found our life's been changed 
Babe, you lost me 
And we tried, oh how we cried 
We lost ourselves, the love has died 
And oh, we tried, you can't deny 
We're left as shells, we lost the fight 
And we had magic 
And this is tragic 
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself 
(Chorus:) 
I feel like our world's been infected 
And somehow you left me neglected 
We found our life's been changed 
Babe, you lost me 
Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet 
But you chose lust when you deceived me 
You'll regret it but it's too late 
How can I ever trust you again?

I must say everyday I pray 
When realize you're by my side, 
I know I'm truly 
 
Blessed for everything you've given me, 
Blessed for all the tenderness you show, 
Do my best with every breath that's in me, 
Blessed to make sure you never go. 
 
There are times  that I test your faith, 'til you think you might surrender. 
Baby I'm, I'm not ashamed to say, that my hopes will grow in splendor 
 
You walked by in the nick of time 
looking like an answered prayer 
You know I'm truly 
 
Blessed for everything you've given me, 
Blessed for all the tenderness you show, 
Do my best with every breath that's in me, 
Blessed to make sure you never go. 
 
Blessed with love and understanding, 
Blessed when I hear you call my name, 
Do my best with faith that's never-ending, 
Blessed to make sure you feel the same. 
 
Deep inside you fill me with your tender touch 
 
Blessed for everything you've given me, 
Blessed for all the tenderness you show, 
Do my best with every breath that's in me,

You're always there givin' me all you've got. 
 
For a shield from the storm, for a friend for a love to keep me safe and warm, I turn to you. 
For the strength to be strong, for the will to carry on, 
For everything you do for everything that's true I turn to you, yes. 
 
When I lose the will to win I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again. 
I can do anything, 'cause your love is so amazing, 
Cause your love inspires me. And when I need a friend you're always on my side, 
Givin' me faith to get me through the night. 
 
For a shield (for a shield) 
From the storm (from the storm) 
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm. 
I turn to you. (I turn to you) 
For the strength (for the strength) 
To be strong for the will to carry on. 
For everything you do I turn to you. 
(oh yeah oh) 
 
For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain. 
For truth that will never change. 
For someone to lean on. 
 
For a heart I can rely on through anything. 
For the one who I can run to 
Oh yeah 
(so do you oh yeah) 
 
For a shield from the storm, for a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm 
(to keep me safe and warm, yeah) 
I turn to you (I turn to you) 
For the strength (for the strength yea) 
To be strong, for the will to carry on. 
For everything you do (everything you do) 
For everything that's true 
For everything you do 
For everything that's true 
I turn to you.</field>

Wherever you go I'll follow 
Ooh babe you're like a cool breeze 
On a summer day 
When you're near me 
I don't know what to do 
I feel like a fool 
Like a schoolgirl 
True blue girl 
Who wants to know 
Can you come out and play 
You make me feel the way 
A woman is supposed to feel 
Show you that my love's for real 
 
I'll be the rain in your summer 
The chill in your fall 
I'll be what ya want 
Anything at all 
I've got a love for all seasons 
A love for all time 
I'll be the fire in your winter 
The sun in your spring 
I'll do what you want 
Give ya everything 
I've got a love for all seasons 
A love for all time 
 
I'll be there for you 
Keeping you warm 
Through the storm 
I'll guide you 
Stand by you until the stars fall from the sky 
When you call me 
I never hesitate 
Making you wait for my love 
Never lie love 
It's something that I just can't deny 
I'll read your each and every feeling 
When you need me to 
So now I gotta let you know 
This love's for you 
 
You don't have to search no more 
Baby you don't have to dream 
Cause what I've got inside for you 
It's all that you'll ever need 
You don't have to search no more 
My heart is yours 
For real for sure 
You don't have to wonder why 
I'll never leave 
I'll never lie</field>

Love was gonna be easy  
Gotta take the ups and downs  
The in betweens  
If you take this journey  
Gotta give yourself completely  
Never let nobody ever step on a dream  
 
You better stop  
Listen to these words I say  
You better stop  
Don't you throw this good thing away  
no no  
Put your trust in me  
And I'll make you see  
 
[Chorus] 
No the rain won't last forever  
Find a way to make it better  
Long as we can stand together  
Love will find a way  
Gonna make a new tomorrow  
Say good-bye to tears and sorrow  
Better listen when I say  
Love will find a way  
 
Somebody tried to tell me love  
doesn't last forever  
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams  
After all is said and done  
We're still here together  
Never listen to the lies and jealousy  
 
You better stop  
Don't you let them turn you around  
You better stop  
Hang onto this love that we've found  
Nothing ever say  
Can stand in our way

Was it something I let slip 
Does the whole world know 
Isn't it obvious? 
 
I'm the one who's in control 
Now I'm acting like a fool 
Do my feelings show? 
Is my face aglow? 
Isn't it obvious? 
 
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore 
I'm feeling like a little girl 
Caught up in emotions 
I'm out of control 
Isn't it obvious? 
 
Do you see my hands  they tremble 
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes 
Don't know how long 
I can keep this inside 
Isn't it obvious? 
 
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore 
I'm feeling like a little girl 
Caught up in emotions 
I'm out of control 
Isn't it obvious? 
 
Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart 
Can you see it in my eyes 
Every glance, every smile 
Must give me away 
And I feel so much I can't hide 
 
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore 
I'm feeling like a little girl 
Caught up in emotions 
I'm out of control 
Isn't it obvious?</field>

You make me feel so emotional 
I can't let go I'm so emotional 
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you 
I'm so emotional 
 
You take me high and low  you know 
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go 
You're such a mystery to me 
 
But baby hot or cold, you got a hold 
Of my imagination 
I think you know what i mean 
 
You make me feel so emotional 
I can't let go I'm so emotional 
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you 
I'm so emotional 
 
Rain is falling down on me 
Suddenly the sun comes out 
Sometimes north or south of love 
But never out.</field>

Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 
 
Like a rock you waited so patiently, while I got it together. 
While I figured it out, I only looked but I never touched, 
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us, 
Holding hands, making plans, 
And it's lucky for me, you understand. 
 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,

Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 
 
A weaker man might have walked away, but you had faith 
Strong enough to move over and understand, while I got it together. 
While I figured it out, they say, "If you love something let it go. 
If it comes back it's yours, and that's how you know. 
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure." 
And you're ready and willing to give me more than 
 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly, 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 
 
Somebody sensitive and tough; 
Somebody there when the going gets rough; 
Every night, he'll be giving his love 
To just one girl, one girl, one. 
Somebody cool but real tender too, 
Somebody, baby, just like you 
Can keep me hangin' around with the one who always knew. 
I'm thankin' you for being there for me.

See I haven't danced to a musical tune 
And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom 
I haven't smiled when alone in my room very much 
Then we touched 
 
I just know when you put your hands on me 
I feel sexy and my body turns to gold 
I just know when you put your hands on me 
I feel ready and I lose my self control 
 
I don't know if a doll can unwind 
Or how to make a person go 
I don't know how to be what you like 
And simply open up the depths of my soul 
 
So I keep my wings and my eyes on the down 
Ready for nothing but holding my ground 
I haven't used a particular noun very much 
Then we touched 
 
I just know when you put your hands on me 
I feel sexy and my body turns to gold 
I just know when you put your hands on me 
I feel ready and I lose my self control 
 
I won't notice or pay you no mind 
Boy I couldn't care less what you do with you time 
Your fingertips on my hips 
Just move me like one of a kind</field>

When I was young every Christmas Eve 
I could not sleep 
Trying to catch that old St. Nick 
Leaving presents under my tree 
And every year I'd fall asleep laying in my bed 
Dreaming of a million sugarplums 
Dancing in my head 
 
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time 
The spirit of giving is in our lives 
Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the ones you love 
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because 
 
There'll be family and Christmas cheer (oh ooh) 
Peace and goodwill to all men (ooh) 
Everybody is home for Christmas 
Everybody is home (everybody is home) 
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe 
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (let it snow) 
Everybody is home for Christmas (oooh) 
Everybody is home for Christmastime 
 
Friends come together as we decorate the tree 
This is the time of year to live in harmony 
Angels watch over as we put the kids to sleep 
And when they awake their smiling faces 
Make it all complete, oh 
 
This is the holiday you're with the family 
We put aside our differences and let it be 
Oh, oh how much fun it is to give and to receive 
This time of year, love is all we need, ohh 
 
There'll be family (family) and Christmas cheer (oh) 
Peace and goodwill to all men 
Everybody is home for Christmas 
Everybody is home (everybody is home) 
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe 
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (oh yeah) 
Everybody is home for Christmas 
Everybody is home it's Christmastime 
 
It's Christmas time 
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la 
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la 
 
Open your heart now 
This is the time for us to give 
The world needs love now 
So live and let live, families all here 
The spirit is good cheer, the sound of carolers 
Ringing sweet in my ear, everything is all fine 
You know why, it's Christmastime, what 
 
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time 
The spirit of giving is in our lives 
Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the ones you love 
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth, oh yeah 
Now, long lay the world in sin and error pining 
Till he appeared, and the soul felt its worth 
The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices 
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn 
 
Fall on your knees 
Oh hear the angel voices 
Oh night divine 
Oh night when Christ was born 
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine 
 
Our Father, who art in heaven 
Hallowed be thy Name 
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done 
On Earth as it is in heaven 
Give us this day our daily bread 
And forgive us our trespasses 
As we forgive those who trespass against us 
Lead us not into temptation 
But deliver us from evil 
For thine is the kingdom 
The power, and the glory 
For ever and ever 
Amen

You'll be my flower child in the month of May 
My sunny summer love on my holiday 
You'll be my autumn leaves, my Halloween 
The winter snow and everything that's in between

And the minutes they pass, and the hours, they fly 
This year, this Christmas, forever 
And the weeks and the months go rushing by 
This year we have learned how to live 
How to forget, and how to forgive without fear 
Just love, this Christmas, this year 
 
You'll be my spring ahead, my fall behind 
The shimmy in my hips, oh when I bump and grind 
You'll be my Santa Boy, all dressed in red 
And ride that little reindeer all through my head, ooh, ooh 
 
Here we go, oh yeah

Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 
 
Like a rock you waited so patiently, while I got it together. 
While I figured it out, I only looked but I never touched, 
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us: 
Holding hands, making plans, 
And it's lucky for me, you understand. 
 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly... 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 
 
A weaker man might have walked away, but you had faith 
Strong enough to move over and understand, while I got it together. 
While I figured it out, they say, "If you love something let it go. 
If it comes back it's yours, and that's how you know. 
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure." 
And you're ready and willing to give me more [than].... 
 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly... 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 
 
Somebody sensitive and tough; 
Somebody there when the going gets rough; 
Every night, he'll be giving his love 
To just one girl... one girl... one. 
Somebody cool but real tender too; 
Somebody, baby, just like you 
Can keep me hangin' around with the one who always knew. 
I'm thankin' you for being there for me. 
 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly... 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me.</field>

We were so much more than they were 
I hope they can see their mistakes now 
And not do it to another 
But if they don't, I hope that person 
Finds someone like you

Can you feel it, feel the groove 
Let the music take control and let your body move 
Just relax and listen to the sound 
Once the music takes you you will finally have found 
 
It will take you away to another state of mind 
Where peace you'll find inside the sound 
Just escape to a place 
Troubles seem to flow away when you get away 
 
Get this party going on, the feel of the rhythm 
Gotta, gotta make it strong, leave it going on 
If you wanna get away and ease your mind now 
Come on everybody stay and let the song take you away, yeah 
Alright 
 
Can you feel it, feel the groove 
Let the music take control and let your body move

Everyday is so wonderful 
Then suddenly 
It's hard to breathe 
Now and then I get insecure

I am beautiful 
No matter what they say 
Words can't bring me down 
I am beautiful 
In every single way 
Yes words can't bring me down 
Oh no 
So don't you bring me down today 
 
To all your friends you're delirious 
So consumed 
In all your doom, ooh 
Trying hard to fill the emptiness 
The pieces gone 
Left the puzzle undone 
Ain't that the way it is 
 
You're beautiful 
No matter what they say 
Words can't bring you down 
Oh no 
You're beautiful 
In every single way 
Yes words can't bring you down 
Oh no 
So don't you bring me down today 
 
No matter what we do (no matter what we do) 
No matter what we say (no matter what we say) 
We're the song inside the tune (yeah, oh yeah) 
Full of beautiful mistakes 
 
And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go) 
The sun will always shine (the sun will always, always, shine) 
And tomorrow we might awake 
On the other side 
 
We're beautiful 
No matter what they say 
Yes words won't bring us down 
Oh no 
We are beautiful 
In every single way 
Yes words can't bring us down

Living it 
Leaving it 
To change 
 
Slowly drifting 
Into a peaceful breeze 
Tongue tied and twisted 
Are all my memories 
Celebrating a fantasy come true 
Packing all my bags 
Finally on the move 
 
I'm leaving today 
I'm living it 
Oh I'm leaving it 
To change 
 
As I'm driving 
I'm captured by the view 
So much beauty 
The road becomes my muse 
The heat is rising 
And my hand surfs through the wind 
Cool, calm, collected 
Is the child that lies within 
 
See I'm leaving today 
I'm living it 
Oh I'm leaving it 
To change, oh yeah 
 
See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm 
Living it 
Oh I'm leaving it 
To change 
 
But somehow I miss it 
I think I'll really miss it 
One day, oh 
 
I turn up the radio 
And I'm feeling like I've never felt before 
Turn down the memories of 
Yester-years and broken dreams I bring 
Finally free, ooh 
 
Slowly drifting 
Into a peaceful breeze, oh 
Oh 
 
Ooh yeah 
I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm 
Living it, oh yeah 
Leaving it to change 
To change, oh no 
 
See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm 
Living it, living it 
Leaving it, leaving 
To change 
Oh oh 
 
I'm leaving today 
Oh I'm living it 
I'm leaving it to change 
Living it, to change 
Leaving it 
To change 
Ooh, oh yeah 
 
Living it, leaving it 
Said I'm living it 
I'm leaving it 
Living it, leaving it 
To change 
I'm leaving it to change 
 
But somehow I miss it 
I think I'll really miss it

            <field name="lyrics">Well I thought I knew you, thinkin' that you were true 
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up 
'Cause I've had enough 
You were there by my side, always down for the ride 
But your joy ride just came down in flames cause your greed sold me out in shame 
 
After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that 
I hold resentment for you 
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong 
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know 
Just how capable I am to pull through 
So I want to say thank you 
Cause it 
 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
 
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing 
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game 
I heard you're goin' round playin', the victim now 
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame 
'Cause you dug your own grave 
After all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to haunt me 
But that won't work anymore, no more, 
It's over 
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture 
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down 
So I want to say thank you 
Cause it 
 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
 
How could this man I thought I knew 
Turn out to be unjust so cruel 
Could only see the good in you 
Pretended not to know the truth 
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself 
Through living in denial 
But in the end you'll see 
You won't stop me 
 
I am a fighter and I 
I ain't goin' stop 
There is no turning back 
I've had enough 
 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
 
You thought I would forget, 
But I remember 
'Cause I remember 
I remember 
You thought I would forget, 
But I remember 
'Cause I remember 
I remember 
 
'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
Makes me work a little bit harder 
It makes me that much wiser 
So thanks for making me a fighter 
Made me learn a little bit faster 
Made my skin a little bit thicker 
Makes me that much smarter 
So thanks for making me a fighter</field>

All this tension telling me just exactly what we should be 
Now I don't mind us being some kind of casual thing 
Listen, all I want to do right now is have your contact on me 
 
Can you put your hands my waistline 
Want your skin up against mine 
Move my hips to the baseline 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
Hang a please don't disturb sign 
Put my back into a slow grind 
Sending chills up and down my spine 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
 
If you see me with a man 
Understand that you can't question me 
The feelings that you call, it ain't my fault 
It can't help your jealousy 
If you can handle the fact that 
What we have has got to be commitment free 
Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin', hittin' 
Underneath the sheets 
 
Can you put your hands my waistline 
Want your skin up against mine 
Move my hips to the baseline 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
Hang a please don't disturb sign 
Put my back into a slow grind 
Sending chills up and down my spine 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
 
Now listen 
So, come on and freak my body 
We can get nasty, naughty 
All night a private party 
Gotta hit that spot just right 
Work me like a 9 to 5 
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin' 
Cause this is a physical lovin' 
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin' 
Gotta hit that spot just right 
Work me like a 9 to 5 
 
We have a physical thing 
We'll make love, but don't fall in love 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
You spend time 
Just enough so you get yours, and I get mine 
No strings attached 
I want your body, not your heart 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
 
Can you put your hands my waistline 
Want your skin up against mine 
Move my hips to the baseline 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
Hang a please don't disturb sign 
Put my back into a slow grind 
Sending chills up and down my spine 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
 
Can you put your hands my waistline 
Want your skin up against mine 
Move my hips to the baseline 
Let me get mine, you get yours 
Hang a please don't disturb sign 
Put my back into a slow grind 
Sending chills up and down my spine 
Let me get mine, you get yours

Don't be shy 
I won't bite

Oh, baby it's impossible 
For me to love you, this way 
It's impossible 
Oh baby it's impossible 
If you're making it this way 
(if you keep treating me this way 
Over, and over) 
 
Impossible to make it easy 
If you're always trying to make it so damn hard 
How can I, how can I, give you all my love baby 
If you're always, always putting up your guard 
This is not a circus 
Don't ya play me for a clown 
How long can emotions keep on going up and down 
 
'Cause it's impossible 
Oh, baby it's impossible 
For me to love you, this way 
It's impossible 
Oh baby it's impossible 
If you're making it this way 
(if you keep treating me this way 
Over, and over)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Ooh oh, hey 
Hey, oh oh, hey 
 
He comes from a foreign place 
An island far away 
Intrigues me with every move 
Til' I'm breathless, I'm helpless 
Can't keep my cool 
Steals my heart when he takes my hand 
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band 
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips 
And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss 
 
Mama used to warn me 
To beware of those Latin lovers 
She said I gave my heart too soon 
And that's how I became your mother 
I said hey mama, you seem to forget 
I'm not in love yet 
Sweet talk don't win me over 
But I realized 
Big brown eyes can hypnotize 
When he says 
 
I am full blood boricua 
Reads the tattoo on his arm 
He tells me, mami I need ya 
And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
Getting lost in el ritmo 
He whispers te quiero, te quiero 
I begin to give in with no hesitation 
Can't help my infatuation 
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah) 
It's pure infatuation 
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah) 
Hey 
 
Skin the color of cinnamon 
His eyes light up and I melt within 
Feels so good it must be a sin 
I can't stop what I started 
I'm giving in 
He brings life to my fantasies 
Sparks a passion inside of me 
Finds the words when I can not speak 
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me 
 
Mama used to warn me 
Not to rush love with another 
She said I'm not trying to lecture 
I just care about my daughter 
Ay mama, you seem to forget 
I never will let 
A man control my emotions 
But when he smiles (when he smiles) 
I feel like a little child 
When he says 
 
I am full blood boricua 
Reads the tattoo on his arm (whoa, whoa) 
He tells me, mami I need ya 
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong) 
Getting lost in el ritmo 
He whispers te quiero, te quiero 
I begin to give in with no hesitation 
Can't help my infatuation 
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah) 
It's pure infatuation 
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah) 
 
Caught between my mama's words 
And what I feel inside 
I'm wanting to explore his world 
But a part of me wants to hide 
Should I risk it, can't resist it 
This has caught me by surprise 
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico 
I can't hold back no more 
Let's go tonight 
Ooh, hey 
 
You adore me, never be lonely, oh 
 
I am full blood boricua (boricua) 
Reads the tattoo on his arm (on his arm) 
He tells me, mami I need ya 
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong) 
Getting lost in el ritmo 
He whispers te quiero, te quiero (oh, quiero) 
I begin to give in with no hesitation 
Can't help my infatuation 
 
I can't help, what I'm feeling 
Infatuated 
Oh oh, oh 
Infatuation

I woke up this morning with a smile on my face 
Nobody's gonna bring me down today 
Been feeling like nothings been going my way lately 
So I decided right here and now that my outlook's gotta change 
 
That's why I'm gonna 
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried 
For every time somebody hurt my pride 
Feeling like they won't let me live life 
Take the time to look at what is mine 
 
I see every lesson completely 
I thank God for what I got from above 
I believe they can take anything from me 
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace 
They can say all they want to say about me 
 
But I'm gonna carry on 
Keep on singing my song 
 
I never want to dwell on my pain again 
There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then 
Remembering all of the hell I felt when I was running out of faith 
Every step I vowed to take was towards a better day 
 
'Cause I'm about to 
Say goodbye to every single lie 
All the fears I've held too long inside 
Every time I felt I could try 
All the negativity I had inside 
 
For too long I've been struggling. I couldn't go on 
But now I've found I'm feeling strong and moving on 
I believe they can take anything from me 
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace 
They can say all they want to say about me 
 
But I'm gonna carry on 
I'm gonna keep on singing my song 
 
Whoa, and every time I tried to be what they wanted from me 
It never came naturally 
So I ended up in misery, wasn't able to see 
All the good around me 
They wasted so much energy on what they thought of me 
Simply just remembering to breathe 
 
I'm human, I ain't able to please 
Everyone at the same time, so now I find 
My peace of mind living one day at a time 
 
I'm human and I answer to one god 
It comes down to one love 
Until I get to heave above I've made the decision 
Never to give up 
Til the I day I die no matter what I'm gonna carry on and keep on singing my song 
 
(They can't take anything from me) 
I believe that they can do what they wanna 
Say what they want to say 
 
(They can say what they wanna) 
But I'm gonna keep on 
(Keep on ) 
I believe it 
That they can take from me 
But they can't take my inner peace 
 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
Say what you want to say, but I'm gonna sing my song 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</field>

A dancer

Because I'm sitting here with your picture 
And smiling to myself 
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you 
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through 
And I blush as I say yes 
 
What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me 
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak 
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being 
With abilities to set me free 
Free, make me be me 
Makes me want to say 
 
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss 
I must admit it's a part of me 
You please me, complete me, believe me 
Like a melody 
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof 
We were meant to be 
But the best quality that's hookin' me 
Is that you're loving me for me 
Is that you're loving me for me 
 
People ask why I'm in love with you 
Well, let me start by saying 
You got my heart by just being who you are 
And what we got is between me and you 
It doesn't matter about the money I make 
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star 
 
Unconditionally you're there for me 
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet 
This is meaningful, is incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable 
The way I feel, so sweet 
Makes me want to say 
 
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss 
I must admit it's a part of me 
You please me, complete me, believe me

Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof 
We were meant to be 
But the best quality that's hookin' me 
Is that you're loving me for me 
Is that you're loving me for me 
 
Its so amazing how something so sweet 
Has come and rearranged my life 
I've been kissed by destiny 
Oh, heaven came and saved me 
An angel was placed at my feet 
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me 
 
Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes 
No cover ups, push ups 
With him, I don't have to put on a show 
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin 
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in 
He's real,he's honest, he's loving me for me 
Yeah</field>

So sick and tired of bein' so misused

You're taking me down with all your mental abuse

Everybody's always trying to look me over

Saving all your bullshit for another day 
I'm the only one that can rescue me from me 
 
Leaving the house around quarter to five 
Zipped up my boots and I'm ready to ride 
And I feel so high, and I feel so alice 
Let my hair down feel the wind on my skin 
Crossin' the border where my new life begins 
And I close my eyes and take it all in 
I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over

I just want to live simple and free

Will you love you for you 
At the end of it all 
 
In life there's going to be times 
When you're feeling low 
And in your mind insecurity 
Seems to take control 
We start to look outside ourselves 
For acceptance and approval 
We keep forgettin' that 
The one thing we should know is 
 
Don't be scared to fly alone 
Find a path that is your own 
Love will open every door 
Its in your hands 
The world is your 
Don't hold back and always know 
All the answers will unfold 
What are you waiting for 
Spread your wings and soar 
 
The boy who wonders 
Is he good enough for them 
Keeps tryin' to please em' all 
But he just never seems to fit in 
Then there's the girl who thinks 
She'll never be good enough for him 
Keeps tryin' to change 
And that's a game she'll never win

In the mirror 
Is where she come face to face 
With her fears 
Her reflection-so foreign to her 
After all these years 
All of her life she has tried to be something 
Besides herself 
Now time has passed 
And she's ended up someone else with regret 
 
What is it in us that makes us feel the need 
To keep pretending 
Gotta let ourselves be

We were tight right from the start 
It wasn't long before you came on strong 
Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it) 
 
I played hard to get but I couldn't help 
I gave up my ironing 
You were thoughtful 
Careful not to hurt the relationship 
 
What happened to those days when 
You used to be compassionate 
Caring what I thought and said 
So attentive gentleman 
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set 
Taking me for granted lately 
Frankly, it's gotta quit 
 
I feel under appreciated 
Now girls help me out  
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say 
I'm feeling underappreciated 
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment 
 
Back to the beginning, to the very beginning 
When our love was something new 
Back when romance was important 
Not just another thing to do 
 
I was feeling high on love tonight 
Thought I never come back down 
Now it seems that you and me 
Have lost our solid ground 
 
Half the time I realize 
I seem to give more than I get 
Funny how things seem to change 
After a few years commitment 
 
Used to talk for hours on end 
'Bout our dreams while we lay in bed 
How I missed those days when you stayed awake 
Now you roll over and snore instead 
 
I feel under appreciated 
Now girls help me out  
'Cause you know what I'm talking about, I say 
I'm feeling under appreciated 
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment 
 
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
I miss those nice massages 
The long for closeness 
The way you talk 
How it turned me on 
The thoughtfulness and the sweetest lips 
 
I needed those days back 
 
I feel under appreciated 
Now girls help me out  
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say 
I'm feeling under appreciated

Ooh 
Young girl, it's alright 
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly, ooh 
 
When you're safe inside your room, you tend to dream 
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems 
No one ever wants or bothers to explain 
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means 
 
When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within 
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within, oh 
 
Young girl, don't hide 
You'll never change if you just run away 
Ooh, whoa yeah 
Young girl, just hold tight 
Soon you're gonna see your brighter day, ooh 
 
Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed 
It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid 
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold 
When you look outside, look inside to your soul 
 
When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within 
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
If you will learn to begin to trust the voice within 
 
Oh, ho, yea 
Ooh, oh, yea (Ooh, ooh, ooh) oh, yea 
Life is a journey (Ooh, ooh,ooh) 
It can take you anywhere you choose to go (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Break it (Hold on) 
You'll make it (Be strong) 
Just don't forsake it because (Hold on)

And you still can't let go? 
 
I was naive 
Your love was like candy 
Artificially sweet 
I was deceived by the wrapping 
 
Got caught in your web 
And I learned how to bleed 
I was prey in your bed 
And devoured completely 
 
And it hurts my soul 
Cause I can't let go 
All these walls are caving in 
I can't stop my suffering 
I hate to show that I've lost control 
'Cause I, I keep going right back 
To the one thing that I need to walk away from 
 
I need to get away from ya 
I need to walk away from ya 
Get away, walk away, walk away 
 
I should have known 
I was used for amusement 
Couldn't see through the smoke 
It was all an illusion 
 
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds) 
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper) 
We both can seduce 
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner) 
 
I'm about to break 
I can't stop this ache 
I'm addicted to your allure 
And I'm fiendin' for a cure 
Every step I take 
Leads to one mistake 
I keep going right back 
To the one thing that I need 
 
I can't mend 
This torn state I'm in 
Getting nothing in return 
What did I do to deserve 
The pain of this slow burn 
And everywhere I turn 
I keep going right back 
To the one thing that I need to walk away from 
 
I need to get away from ya 
I need to walk away from ya 
 
Every time I try to grasp for air 
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over 
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare, 
I let out a silent prayer 
Let it be over, over 
 
Inside I'm screaming 
Begging, pleading 
No more 
 
I don't know what to do 
My heart has been bruised 
So sad but it's true 
Each beat reminds me of you 
 
It hurts my soul 
'Cause I can't let go 
All these walls are caving in 
I can't stop my suffering 
I hate to show that I've lost control 
Cause I 
I keep going right back 
To the one thing that I need, oh 
 
I'm about to break 
And I can't stop this ache 
I'm addicted to your allure 
And I'm fiendin' for a cure 
Every step I take 
Leads to one mistake 
I keep going right back 
To the one thing that I need, Oh 
 
I can't mend 
This torn state I'm in 
Getting nothing in return 
What did I do to deserve

Full of beautiful mistakes 
 
And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go) 
The sun will always shine (the sun will always, always, shine) 
And tomorrow we might awake 
On the other side 
 
We're beautiful 
No matter what they say 
Yes words won't bring us down 
Oh no 
We are beautiful 
In every single way 
Yes words can't bring us down 
Oh no 
So don't you bring me down today 
 
Oh, oh

(Miss Aretha, (The Real Thing) James Brown, Billie Holiday) 
(Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Louis Armstrong) 
(Minnie Riperton, Otis Redding, Etta James) 
 
Back in the day, they used to say 
Play that song, get it going, and the band played 
And still today, you hear us say 
Play that song all night long, Mr. DJ 
Though times have change 
It's still the same 
We all need a minute to get away 
So let it go, and feel the flow 
If you've got soul, let the world know 
 
We're gonna set the mood (set the mood off right) 
Gonna go back to an old school groove (go back to an old school groove) 
Gonna rewind to another time 
When the originators, innovators were alive, yeah 
 
Here, we say now 
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James 
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane 
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life 
The sound and vibe of yesterday 
Open your mind, enjoy the ride 
Live out tonight, and grab that soul train 
 
[Chorus] 
Take it back, take it 
Back in the day, back in the day 
Oh baby 
Back in the day, back in the day 
Won't you take me back? 
Back in the day, back in the day 
I'll do it 
Back in the day, back in the day 
 
Oh yeah 
 
Y'all remember back in the day, you dig 
Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald 
 
Yeah 
Now 'Chain Of Fools' and 'Respect' 
Was the anthem of a woman, Aretha said 
'What's Going On,' 'Let's Get It On' 
Such classic songs; don't forget them 
Though times have changed 
They still remain my inspiration everyday 
So give it up for the ones 
Who came before, opened up that door 
 
We're gonna set the mood 
(We're gonna set the mood) 
Gonna go back to an old school groove 
(Go back to an old school groove) 
Gonna rewind to another time

When the originators, innovators were alive 
 
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James 
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane 
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life 
The sound and vibe of yesterday 
(The sound and vibe of yesterday) 
Open your mind, enjoy the ride 
Live out tonight, and grab that soul train 
 
[Chorus] 
 
So get up, relive it 
Gotta let yourself flow 
Give up your praise 
Come celebrate 
Just get up, get on it 
Get yourself on the floor 
Don't back away (don't back away) 
Come celebrate (gonna celebrate, yeah) 
 
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James 
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane 
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life 
The sound and vibe of yesterday 
(The sound and vibe, all right, yeah) 
Open your mind, enjoy the ride 
Live out tonight, and grab that soul train 
 
Takin' back in the day, day 
Back in the day, back in the day 
Back in the day, back in the day 
Back in the day, back in the day 
Back in the day, back in the day

Candy man, candy man 
 
(Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine) 
Sweet, sugar, candy man 
 
I met him out for dinner on a Friday night 
He really got me working up an appetite 
He had tattoos up and down his arm 
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm 
He's a one stop shop, makes the panties drop 
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man 
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man 
 
He took me to the Spider club on Hollywood and Vine 
We drank champagne, and we danced all night 
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (a big surprise) 
The gossip tonight will be tommorow's headlines 
He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop 
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man (oh yeah) 
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man 
 
He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop 
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man (oh) 
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man 
 
Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot 
When he kissed my mouth, he really hit the spot 
He had lips like sugar cane, oh 
Good things come for boys who wait 
 
(Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine) 
Candy man, candy man 
(Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine) 
Candy man, candy man

He's a one stop, gotcha hot, makin' all the panties drop 
(Sweet, sugar, candy man) 
He's a one stop, got me hot, makin' my (uh) pop 
(Sweet, sugar, candy man) 
He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby, don't stop 
(Sweet, sugar) 
 
He got those lips like sugar cane 
Good things come for boys who wait 
He's a one stop shop with a real big (uh) 
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man

Well, they say things aren't always what they seem to be 
Even your greatest fantasies 
You won't believe your eyes 
Won't even recognize 
The wonderment that lies 
Behind the shimmer and the lights 
 
Is it true what they say? 
Is it all just fun and games? 
Or is there more behind the makeup 
And the faces full of paint? 
 
I ask you, do you want to come and play? 
Ha ha ha ha 
Get the world to come and play 
Ha ha ha ha

Well, everybody got an opinion now, don't they? 
But it ain't no thang to me 
It really don't make any difference now to me 
If you don't like what you see 
I pay no mind to the negative kind 
'Cause it's just no way to be 
I don't stop to please someone else's needs 
Gonna live my life for me 
 
[Chorus] 
I'm gonna keep on; I'm a do my own thing 
We all got a song that we're meant to sing 
And no matter what people say, or might think 
I ain't going no place; no, I'm here to stay 
Gonna keep on doing my thing 
'Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me 
I'll still be the same girl I used to be 
'Cause I ain't going no place; no, I'm here to stay 
 
I'm here to stay 
I'm here to stay 
I'm here to stay 
 
I've never been the type to be shy 
I know that some would say I'm too headstrong 
But I'd rather be a woman who voices her mind 
Whether you think I'm right or wrong 
 
And I know some people wanna criticize 
Makes them feel better 'bout themselves 
So say what you will 
Time will reveal 
In the end that I will be here still 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Gotta get up 
Keep my head up 
Gonna keep on turnin' it up, never let up 
If I keep steppin' it up, I'm a prove that I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not 
Gotta get up 
Keep my head up 
Gonna keep on turnin' it up, never let up 
If I keep steppin' it up, I'm a prove that I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not 
 
Whoa, whoa, whoa 
 
No matter the pressures that face me 
I believe, I believe that we'll see 
I'll never let anyone break me 
All your doubt can do now is strengthen me 
 
And life - it ain't always that easy 
Gotta fight to see past the boundaries 
Crossin' the lines I will define 
Every time 
That forever is mine

I've waited for some time 
To get inside the minds 
Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside 
It's like an endless ride 
Feeling the lows and highs 
Of every lyric and melody 
Every single rhyme 
So here I stand today 
In tribute I do pay 
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way 
And so to God I pray that he will give me strength 
To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith 
In his good faith 
 
I'm going back to basics 
To where it all began 
I'm ready now to face it 
I wanna understand 
What made the soul singers 
And the blues figures 
That inspired a higher generation 
The jazz makers, and the ground breakers 
They gave so much of themselves and dedication 
 
So here I stand today

Got a new flame, ha, haven't been the same 
Something in me's changed, rearranged 
And I feel that I've been saved 
 
You got me feeling like you're that something I've been missing 
Everything's heaven 'cause life with you has been a blessing 
 
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) 
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah 
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) 
Your love has brought me to a higher place, oh yeah 
(Who knew, who knew) 
It'd be you to restore my faith? 
Everyday, I'm amazed 
And it makes me wanna get down and pray 
Makes me wanna get down and pray 
Said, it makes me wanna get down and pray 
Yeah, hey 
 
I've kept some company I shouldn't have (well, all right) 
Made some mistakes, but that's in the past (well, all right) 
I'm professing here to you 
Proof that I am through 
 
I'm coming clean 
Now I can breathe 
And I finally believe, yeah 
 
You got me thinking I'll be all right, and you're the reason 
Oh, I can feel it: we're moving in a new direction 
 
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) 
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah 
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) 
Your love has brought me into a higher place, oh yeah 
(Who knew, who knew) 
It'd be you to restore my faith? 
Everyday, I'm amazed 
And it makes me wanna get down and pray 
Makes me wanna get down and pray 
Said, it makes me wanna get down and pray 
Makes me wanna get down and pray 
Makes me wanna get down and pray 
 
Oh 
Where would I be, where would I be 
Without you by my side? 
Where would I be, where would I be 
Without you standing by? 
 
Makes me wanna (pray) 
Makes me need to (pray) 
When I'm feeling low and all alone 
You're the light in my day, yeah 
 
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) 
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah 
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) 
Your love has brought me into a higher place, oh yeah 
(Who knew, who knew) 
It'd be you to restore my faith? 
Everyday, I'm amazed 
'Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray 
'Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray 
Makes me wanna get down and pray 
 
Woo, thank you father! 
 
Wanna lift my hands up and pray 
'Cause every time I'm hearing your name 
Wanna reach out and rejoice 
Sound of your voice, yeah

Jesus, I must confess 
That in all my loneliness 
I've forsaken, and I've sinned 
Leaving fragments of a man so broken 
 
I could tell you what I've done 
Or should I tell you where I went wrong? 
 
Well, the more that I start to play 
My deceitful, evil ways 
Keep on growing stronger by the day 
 
Oh lord, have mercy on my soul 
For I have walked a sinful road 
So I'm gonna get down on my knees 
Beg forgiveness to help set me free 
Lord, have mercy on me, please 
 
Mother Mary full of grace 
In my weakness, I've lost faith 
I've been careless, and I have been warned 
And the devil inside me is torn 
God bless the men that I have scorned 
 
Oh lord, have mercy on my soul 
For I have walked the sinful road 
So I'm gonna get down on my knees 
Beg forgiveness to help set me free 
Lord have mercy on me, please 
 
Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah 
Whoa, yeah, yeah, oh, oh 
Oh-oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh 
 
So don't let me fool around no more 
Send your angels down to guide me through that door 
Well, I've gone and confessed my regrets 
And I pray I'm not held in contempt 
I'm so lost, and I need you to help me repent 
 
Oh lord, have mercy on my soul 
Oh, I'm begging, I'm pleading, I'm needing 
I want you to know 
So I'm down upon my knees 
Oh lord, I need forgiveness 
I need forgiveness from you</field>

She was so young with such innocent eyes 
She always dreamt of a fairytale life 
And all the things your money can't buy 
She thought that he was a wonderful guy 
Then, suddenly, things seemed to change 
It was the moment she took on his name 
He took his anger out on her face 
She kept all of her pain locked away 
 
Oh mother, we're stronger 
From all of the tears you have shed 
Oh mother, don't look back 
'Cause he'll never hurt us again 
 
So, mother, I thank you 
For all you've done and still do 
You got me, I got you 
Together we always pull through 
We always pull through 
We always pull through 
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother 
 
It was the day that he turned on his kids 
That she knew she just had to leave him 
So many voices inside of her head 
Saying over and over and over 
'You deserve much more than this.' 
 
She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide 
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises) 
So tired of defending her life; she could have died 
Fighting for the lives of her children 
 
Oh mother, we're stronger 
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed) 
Oh mother, don't look back 
'Cause he'll never hurt us again (He'll never hurt us again) 
 
So, mother, I thank you (thank you) 
For all that you've done and still do (still do) 
You got me, I got you 
(Yeah, you got me, and I got you) 
Together we always pull through 
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother 
 
All of your life you have spent 
Burying hurt and regret 
But, mama, he'll never touch us again 
 
For every time he tried to break you down 
Just remember who's still around 
It's over, and we're stronger 
And we'll never have to go back again 
 
Oh mother, we're stronger 
From all of the tears you have shed 
Oh mother, don't look back (Oh mother, don't look back again) 
'Cause he'll never hurt us again 'Cause he'll never hurt us again) 
 
So, mother, I thank you (And I thank you for everything you've done) 
For all that you've done and still do (Together we always move on) 
You got me, I got you (You got me, I got you) 
Together we always pull through (always pull through) 
We always pull through 
We always pull through

            <field name="lyrics">So many years have gone by 
Always strong, tried not to cry 
Never felt like I needed any man 
To comfort me in life 
But I'm all made up today 
A veil upon my face 
But no father stands beside me 
To give this bride away 
 
Well, I'm standing in the chapel 
Wearing my white dress 
I have waited for this moment 
With tears of happiness 
Here I leave behind my past 
By taking the chance 
I've finally found the right man 
 
Thoughts racing fast through my mind 
As I'm gazing down the aisle 
That my future will mend the memories 
Torn between father and child 
 
My emotions overload 
'Cause there is no hand to hold 
There's no shoulder here to lean on 
I'm walking all on my own 
 
Here I go 
 
Now I'm standing at four corners 
To have and to hold 
Now, my love, you stand beside me 
To walk life's winding road 
And I owe it all to you 
For taking that chance 
You've shown me there's a right man 
'Cause I never knew the right man 
 
Well, I'm standing in the chapel 
Ready to confess 
That I've waited for this moment 
With tears of happiness 
Now I leave behind my past 
By taking the chance 
Whoa 
 
Well, I'm standing at four corners 
To have and to hold 
Now, my love, you stand beside me 
To walk life's winding road 
And I owe it all to you 
For taking the chance 
 
And one day, my little girl 
Will reach out her hand 
She'll know I found the right man</field>

Oh, oh, oh 
 
If you see me walking down the street 
Or in the pages of your magazine 
Looking just a little differently 
Showing off a softer side of me 
 
They saying I'm looking like a lady 
They say that love has gone and changed me 
But don't be fooled by everything you see 
Gotta let the naughty in me free 
 
There's a woman inside of all of us 
Who never quite seems to get enough 
Trying to play by the rules is rough 
'Cause sooner or later something's gonna erupt us 
 
'Cause I still got that nasty in me 
Still got that dirty degree (still got it) 
And if you want some more sexy 
Still got that freak in me 
I still got that nasty in me 
Still got that dirty degree (oh yeah) 
And if you want some more sexy 
Still got that freak in me 
 
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty 
And if you're still rolling with me, still got it 
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty 
Still got that freak in me 
 
Why is a woman's sexuality 
Always under so much scrutiny? 
Why can't she do exactly as she please 
Without being called a million things? 
 
They say I'm not the girl they used to know (used to know) 
'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes (oh) 
But don't be fooled: the moment I get home (I get home) 
I'm letting loose, giving a private show (Don't you know?) 
 
There's some women out there who talk and stare 
Who never seem to let down their hair 
Like to past judgment, but they're just scared 
And don't know what they're missing; so they better beware 
 
'Cause I still got that nasty in me 
Still got that dirty degree (oh) 
And if you want some more sexy 
Still got that freak in me 
I still got that nasty in me 
Still got that dirty degree (oh yeah) 
And if you want some more sexy 
Still got that freak in me (oh yeah) 
 
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty 
And if you're still rolling with me, still got it 
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty 
Still got that freak in me 
 
Don't tell me to behave 
'Cause I'll never play that game (no) 
Don't tell me what to do 
'Cause I'll never be uptight like you 
Don't look at me that way 
'Cause I ain't never gonna change 
And if you're talking about my life 
You're only wasting your own time 
 
If I want to wear lingerie outside of my clothes 
If I want to be erotic in my own videos 
If I want to be provocative, well, that ain't a sin 
Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin 
 
I still got that nasty in me 
Still got that dirty degree (in me) 
And if you still want some more sexy 
Still got that freak in me 
I still got that nasty in me 
Still got that dirty degree (in me) 
And if you still want some more sexy 
Still got freak in me

Some people have said things at times 
About me that weren't always true 
Oh yeah 
But you've always been there 
To give that extra love to pull me through 
To do what I gotta do 
 
'Cause there'll always be those ups and downs 
But you've always seemed to stick around and see 
See me through to believe, yeah 
 
And I hope I can give back 
A little bit of what you've given me 
You give me all that I need, yeah 
 
So thank you for standing right by me (I thank you for everything) 
So thank you for being behind me (Thank you, Christina) 
And watching me grow, and letting others know 
That you still believe in what I'll be (Sing it, girl) 
 
It took awhile till I could do what I wanted 
And now I'm so happy that it started where we started 
I'm thanking God that I could be in the position 
To do my own thing now, and make my own decisions 
 
And, so, I'm thanking you for being true 
And standing by me through and through</field>

After all the hoops I put you through 
Now I see that I'm in love with you 
 
Now I hope you finally understand 
 
So many tears I've had to cry 
But you had many more of your own you had to try 
But you stuck it out, and you're here with me now, yeah, yeah 
And rememberin' the days I pushed away your love 
You called my bluff, and you still stayed around 
Yeah, you figured me out 
Said, you got me down 
And there's no way to lie to you 
You know me better than I do 
 
Baby, oh, you see me through 
I'd be no good without you 
 
I made you think you don't understand 
All the times you didn't understand 
Why you couldn't just be my man 
I made you think you don't understand 
There were many walls you had to climb 
If you really wanted to be mine 
I made you think you don't understand 
After all the hoops I put you through 
Now I see that I'm in love with you 
 
Now I hope you finally understand 
 
Oh 
 
Baby, won't you listen now? 
Can't you see just what I'm talking about? 
Said, baby, won't you listen now? 
Can't you see just what I'm talking about? 
 
Time went on, and I was wrong 
To keep my distance for so long 
So afraid you wouldn't stay 
But you never turned away 
 
Always right by my side 
You're forever in my life 
Don't you go 
'Cause now I know 
That in you I found a home 
 
Now I can see into your eyes 
Suddenly, I realize 
 
I made you think you don't understand 
All the times you didn't understand 
Why you couldn't just be my man 
I made you think you don't understand 
There were many walls you had to climb 
If you really wanted to be mine 
I made you think you don't understand 
After all the hoops I put you through 
Now I see that I'm in love with you 
 
Now I hope you finally understand 
 
I made you think you don't understand</field>

Welcome to the greatest show 
Greatest show on earth 
You've never seen before 
Here, the fairytale unfolds 
 
What's behind the smoke and glass? 
Painted faces, everybody wears a mask 
Are you selling them your soul? 
Well, you'll be left out in the cold 
 
Is it all blue skies 
Fun and games until you fall? 
Then you're left without anyone at all 
You're riding on a shooting star 
With a smile upon your face 
But soon the shine fades 
 
And you're left out all alone 
Wondering where did they all go? 
Oh 
 
Been jaded, hated 
Who'll be around when the limelight's faded? 
Been shut down, pushed out 
Made to smile when I wanted to frown 
 
Always taking a bow 
Always working the crowd 
Always making new grounds 
Always playing the clown 
Who'll be sticking it out? 
Who'll be staying around 
When the lights go down?</field>

For the first in my life 
I feel I've opened up my eyes 
Since you have arrived 
Like an angel from the sky 
I am on a spiritual high 
 
So don't you ever go away 
I could never face... 
Losing you would kill my faith in a higher place 
 
What kind of world would it be without you? 
I couldn't breath without you here 
What kind of world would I see without you? 
I can't dream without you here 
 
Beautiful boy 
How on earth did I do something worth deserving you? 
My better half 
How I cherish through and through every part of you? 
I do 
 
Loving you's made me whole; now I belong 
I found my home 
Promise me we'll always stay 
The way we are today 
 
What kind of world would it be without you? 
I couldn't breath without you here 
What kind of world would I see without you? 
I can't dream without you here 
 
I can't ever imagine, if this never had happened 
I thank God every day 
Almost lost you forever, but now I'll always remember 
That you're my saving grace 
 
What kind of world would it be without you? 
I couldn't breath without you here 
What kind of world would I see without you? 
I can't dream without you here</field>

It took such a long time 
For me to realize just how to be and to listen to me 
 
Don't go thinking I'm not thankful 
'Cause me, I've got my hands full of good things 
And I hope I can give back 
A little bit of what you've given me 
 
So thank you for standing right by me, I will always love you 
So thank you for being behind me, you are just so amazing 
And watching me grow and letting others know 
That you still believe in what I'll be 
 
So people have said things in times 
About me that weren't always true, ooh, yeah 
But you've always been there 
To give that extra love to pull me through, to do what I gotta do 
 
'Cause there'll always be those ups and downs 
But you've always seemed to stick around and see 
See me through to believe, yeah 
 
And I hope I can give back 
A little bit of what you've given me 
You given me all that I need, yeah 
 
So thank you for standing right by me, I thank you for everything 
So thank you for being behind me, thank you, Christina 
And watching me grow and letting others know 
That you still believe in what I'll be, sing it, girl 
 
It took awhile 'til I could do what I wanted 
And now I'm so happy that it started where we started 
I'm thanking God that I could be in the position 
To do my own thing now and make my own decisions 
 
And so I'm thanking you for being true 
And standing by me through and through

If only I knew what I know today 
Ohhh ohhh 
 
I would hold you in my arms 
I would take the pain away 
Thank you for all you've done 
Forgive all your mistakes 
There's nothing I wouldn't do 
To hear your voice again 
Sometimes I want to call you, but I know you won't be there 
 
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do 
And I've hurt myself by hurting you 
Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit 
Sometimes I just want to hide 'cause it's you I miss 
You know it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this 
 
Would you tell me I was wrong?  
Would you help me understand? 
Are you looking down upon me? 
Are you proud of who I am?

I move, you chase, we magnetize 
A time I was exploding with no warning sign

Dynamite 
Electrify me all night 
Dynamite 
Just give it to me, I won't bite 
Dynamite 
You make me feel, it's alright 
Dynamite 
Shine it on me 
 
Caught up in this moment I was hypnotized 
Shake this feeling got me paralyzed 
I do, I don't, I think I might 
My body was electric like a flashing light

A change, a change is coming 
A change, a change is coming 
 
All around me that a change is bout to happen

Words can't bring me down  
I am beautiful in every single way  
Yes, words can't bring me down

To all your friends, you're delirious  
So consumed in all your doom  
Trying hard to fill the emptiness  
The piece is gone left the puzzle undone

Then the clouds won't stay  
 
And everywhere we go

The sun won't always shine  
(sun won't always shine)  
But tomorrow will find a way  
All the other times  
 
Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say  
Yes, words won't bring us down, oh no  
We are beautiful in every single way  
Yes, words can't bring us down

Everything not quite what it seems to be 
Slipping and falling through the looking glass 
Catching a glimpse at all that lies behind the masks 
 
You disappear with the dawn 
You only see what you want 
 
When you're out with the birds of prey (prey, prey, prey) 
When you're out with the birds of prey 
 
They watch and they feed 
They take what they need 
They bite as you bleed 
The birds of prey 
 
Taking the blue pill only made you cry 
And all that the red pill did was make you forget why 
There is no right, there's no wrong 
You only see what you want 
 
When you're out with the birds of prey 
 
They watch and they feed 
They take what they need 
They bite as you bleed

            <field name="lyrics">A rubber band is what I call your love for me 
'Cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline 
But all this back and forth is freaky, it's confusing me 
Like a pencil trying to write and you're erasing me 
 
If I was a ruler I'd set you straight 
But your love is like a sharpener, it really grates 
'Cause once I'm trying to bounce, you pull me back 
And when I try to come to you, you give me slack 
 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 
A rubber band was an analogy 
You can even say it's a metaphor 
The tension between you and me 
I ain't gonna feel it if you let it go 
 
I can take a little bit and make it more 
A little bit of hate can make it war 
But a lot of love ain't enough 
And so, I don't really know how we find the cure 
 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
 
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together 
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together 
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together 
 
If we were gaffer tape maybe we could spend the summer 
You could say your piece, you could post it on a paper 
When your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler 
 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love 
Elastic love, everlastic love 
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love</field>

Glam 
 
Walk, turn, pose, stop, give 'em what you got 
Work those hips, side to side, get that angle right (right) 
 
Paint your face like a movie queen 
A naughty dream or a fantasy 
Anything goes, gotta be the scene 
Create your look, out a fashion book 
Ready, set, now go 
 
Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you 
Let's get glam, it's all in how you move 
Let's get glam, don't let the clothes wear you 
Let's get glam, it's all in attitude 
 
Now snap, now snap 
 
Here we go, blush on, lashes long, mascara strong (strong, strong) 
Lips, eyes, cheeks, face, give it style grace (grace) 
 
Better be ready for your photo op 
Step in the light for your perfect close up 
Be superficial it's your one shot 
Unleash the diva, deep inside 
 
Ready, set, now go (bitches)

Lose control, inhibitions run wild 
Get on the floor in your best couture

(Boys) they're only good for fruit, I mean bananas.

If sweet mama nature never had,

Boys wants them women, though they barely can remember. 
Then again all men are dogs.

Watching as the waves roll by it makes me understand 
What it is to make a life that means a little more 
Seems so easy to forget what we're all looking for 
 
I don't know where I'm going just yet 
Skipping work and I don't need to excuse it 
Long as that floating feeling I get in the moment 
Makes it really worth it (worth it) 
 
Hey, forget about your Monday morning 
We are never gonna be that boring 
Hey, forget about your Monday morning 
So, so ordinary same old story 
Ey, oh, ey, oh, ey, oh, ey, oh, ey, oh, ey, oh 
(No we don't wanna go, no no we don't wanna go) 
 
I had a party, it went long, I told 'em all to stay 
Neighbors calling to complain and rain on our parade 
They told me to use my head and keep my focus straight 
Shame on all of you for being stiff and so straight laced 
 
Let them keep talking, I don't regret 
They can't help it, caught up in their mindset 
Long as that floating feeling I get in the moment 
Makes it really worth it 
 
Hey, forget about your Monday morning 
We are never gonna be that boring 
Hey, forget about your Monday morning 
So, so ordinary same old story 
Ey, oh, ey, oh, ey, oh, ey, oh, ey, oh, ey, oh

Everybody go to the beat, don't stop 
Keep up body rock cardiac arrest 
It's a culture shock

Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun (come on!)

My girls are singing, and dancing and having fun 
My girls are cooking up a beat, and they want you to come 
 
I like my girls hot, sweet, tough, or play me 
Either way trainable primate 
Self reliant, giant, death defiant,  
No Colby Briant 
I take it both for you, if you give me a taste 
I wreck a mullet or two yeah below the waist 
You're my bff, you're my 606 
303 am I swingin' 
 
My girls stay close when they see trouble around 
They got jewels on their fingers, it's about to go down 
We got no time for haters you know, we just came to party

            <field name="lyrics">Tossing and turning makes my appetite keep growing stronger 
All night long 
Anticipating morning, lying I can't wait much longer 
Feels so strong 
 
Our bodies touching, I just can't get enough 
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh 
Won't let you sleep, I gotta satisfy my needs 
I need to love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh 
 
And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind 
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside 
And even though we made sweet love all night 
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right 
 
Might be late for work, but I promise that it's worth it baby 
Don't go 
So hungry for you, taste me and I'll taste you 
There's no stopping what I'll do to get you in the mood 
 
Our bodies touching, I just can't get enough 
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh 
Won't let you sleep, want you deep inside of me 
So I can love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh 
 
And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind 
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside 
And even though we made sweet love all night 
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right 
 
And I can see break of day begging through the curtains 
And I'm so certain, 
Soon I'm gonna feel your honey drip my juices start to flow 
Strawberry cream is like a dream, my fantasy is reality 
When the morning comes, I know that I will too 
 
And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind 
I need sex for breakfast, stay inside 
And even though we made sweet love all night 
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right 
 
And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind 
Sex for breakfast (I need it, I want it), 
Stay inside (when the morning comes) 
And even though that we made sweet love all night 
Sex for breakfast, feels so right 
 
So hungry for you 
Taste me, and I'll taste you 
Sex for breakfast 
All done 
 
Sex for breakfast (feels so right)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">What you gave me I know you gave me 
You remind me all the time 
And how you hurt me and you don't see it 
Again I am the child 
 
And though you tell me that you love me 
I can't feel it and I'm afraid to let you down 
It's all or nothing, I fear that something's wrong 
 
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way 
 
How I wish you, you suffered less too 
It tears us both apart 
And it's not pretty the way you criticize me 
And how it breaks my heart 
 
And though you tell me (though you tell me)  
That you love me (that you love me) 
I can't feel it (I can't feel it) 
And I'm afraid to let you down 
It's all or nothing, (it's all or nothing) 
I fear that something's wrong 
 
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way 
 
How I wish you knew, how much I need you 
I feel like running but I can't abandon you 
You avoid my gaze, withdraw from me these days 
You punish me for trying to be all that you wanted 
What more can I do? 
 
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
(So tired of walking on, don't want to fail) 
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way 
 
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
(In order to please you, I've abandoned myself) 
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way, oh</field>

Smoking gun 
We've lost it all 
The love is gone 
 
She has won 
Now its no fun 
We've lost it all 
The love is gone 
 
And we had magic 
And this is tragic 
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself 
 
I feel like our world's been infected, 
And somehow you left me neglected 
We've found our life's been changed 
Babe, you lost me 
 
And though we tried 
Oh how we cried 
We lost ourselves 
The love has died 
 
And though we tried 
You can't deny 
We're left as shells 
We lost the fight 
 
And we had magic 
And this is tragic 
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself 
 
Oh, I feel like our world's been infected 
And somehow you left me neglected 
We've found our life's been changed 
'Cause babe, you lost me 
 
Now I know you're sorry 
And we were sweet 
But you chose lust when you deceived me 
And you'll regret it, but it's too late 
How can I ever trust you again?

Praying that you'd come and get me 
But now I've found my second wind 
Now I found my second skin 
Well I know what you were thinking 
You thought you'd watch me fade away 
When you broke me into pieces 
But I gave each piece a name 
 
One of me is wiser 
One of me is stronger, one of me is a fighter 
And there's a thousand faces of me 
And we're gonna rise up 
And we're gonna rise up 
For every time you broke me 
Well you're gonna face an army, army of me 
 
Welcome to my revolution 
All your walls are breaking down 
It's time you had a taste of losing 
Time the table's turned around 
I see a glimpse of recognition 
But it's too late ugh it's too late 
And what you though was your best decision 
Just became your worst mistake 
 
One of me is wiser 
One of me is stronger 
One of me is a fighter 
And there's a thousand faces of me 
And were gonna rise up 
And were gonna rise up 
For every time you broke me 
Well you're gonna face an army, army of me 
 
So how does it feel 
To know that I beat ya 
That I can defeat ya 
Oh how does it feel 
'Cause it sure feels sweeter 
It should be sweeter to me 
Now that I'm wiser 
Now that I'm stronger 
Now that I'm a fighter 
There's a thousand faces of me 
And I'm gonna rise up 
I'm gonna rise up 
For every time you broke me 
There's a thousand faces of me 
And I'm gonna rise up 
Yeah I'm gonna rise up 
For every time you broke me 
You're gonna face an army

So damn wrong 
Feel the weight, of your hate

Words cut through my skin 
Tears roll down my chin 
My walls crumble within 
But I'll take it all on 
And get up when I fell 
Till the last curtain call 
 
But you'll never get the best of me, no more 
Said you'll never get the best of me, no more 
Aren't you tired of throwing stones 
Trying to kick me when I'm down 
But you'll never get the best of me, no more 
 
So you're cold, made of ice 
Heart of stone, born to fight 
But I cry 
I still cry 
Are you happy, you know 
I'm unhappy, you know 
Take your shot 
I'm wide open 
 
Words cut through my skin 
Tears roll down my chin 
My walls crumble within 
But I'll take it all on 
And get up when I fell 
Till the last curtain call

Said you'll never get the best of me, no more

But you'll never get the best of me no more 
Said you'll never get the best of me no more 
Aren't you tired of throwing stones 
Trying to kick me when I'm down 
But you'll never get the best of me no more 
 
Heartbroken an beaten 
Knocked down and mistreated 
I will rise undefeated 
I will not let you bring me down 
Now the pain is deleted 
And I will never repeat it 
I will rise and defeat it 
I will not let you bring me down 
No I won't let you bring me down 
 
Knocked down and mistreated 
Heartbroken and bleeding 
Still I rise undefeated 
Cause you'll never 
 
Cause you'll never get the best of me no more 
Said you'll never get the best of me no more 
Aren't you tired of throwing stones 
Trying to kick me when I'm down 
But you'll never get the best of me no more 
 
Heartbroken and bleeding 
Knocked down and mistreated 
Still I rise undefeated 
I will not let you bring me down

I'm tired of fighting for peace 
When I am alone on the front line 
I need you to stand next to me 
 
Baby ceasefire, fire, fire 
Throw down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons 
I'm on your side, on your side, on your side 
So please ceasefire, fire, fire 
Ceasefire make it stop 
 
Drop down your defenses I'm raising my flag 
This fighting is hopeless we need this to end 
It's going too far don't know where it began 
We're hurting each other and I can't pretend 
 
I'm trying to help you to see 
The casualties that we both lead 
It's all so unnecessary 
Can't you hear me scream

What is our legacy?

Swallow your pride 
You can confide in me 
Army afoot 
Rise of the sun 
Shining for all to see 
Enemy's left 
Victory's won 
No negativity 
We can be free 
Free as the king 
Who won my destiny

Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger, won't you 
Round and round sit on my middle finger motherfucker 
Round and round sit on my middle finger motherfucker 
 
So you went around went around talking shit-ah shit-ah 
Keep my name up out your mouth spit it out you bitch-aa bitch-aa 
Wish that you could hang around me and my thick-aa thick-aa 
Lime lights, prime life how you get the pictcha'-pictcha' 
 
Hold up, I got more money than I can fold up 
I see you superhatin' when your roll up 
And I suggest that you go and grow the fuck up (ha) 
Or you can spin around in circles 
 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
 
I see you run around run around like you gita-gita 
Why you always tryna be up in my mixture mixture 
Cause I'm freaky fly fashion you just bitter bitter 
Shine bright day and night no matter how I get up get up 
 
Hold up, I got more money than I can fold up 
I see you superhatin' when your roll up 
And I suggest that you go and grow the fuck up (ha) 
Or you can spin around in circles 
 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
 
Use my name as your claim to fame 
Got my seal of success

Desperate, you're a mess 
Go ahead get your press 
You're no win 
You're shameless 
Think you'll rain on my middle 
Tryna break me but you can just 
 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger 
Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger

How bad it hurts when you're gone (na na na) 
 
Turn the music up a little bit louder 
Just gotta get past the midnight hour 
Maybe tomorrow it won't 
Be this hard 
Who am I kidding 
I know what I'm missing 
 
I had my heart set on you 
But nothing else hurts like you do 
Who knew that love was so cruel

Waited and waited so long 
For someone who'd never come home 
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah) 
I'm just a fool 
(Yeah) 
 
I said that I don't care 
I'd walk away whatever 
And I tell myself we were bad together (uh huh) 
But that's just me trying to move on 
With out you

Is never ever gonna come back 
I can't accept that it's lost

Held my tongue 
Can't fight the motion

Wrong, wrong

            <field name="lyrics">Sometimes when I'm sitting on my bed 
Feeling so so lonely 
Wishing someone hold me 
All I have is three little notes playing in my head 
 
Outside I can cover all the scars 
Inside lie the words just pleading to be heard 
'Cause all I have are three million melodies to kill all the hurt 
Now I'm ready gonna sing 'em all out 
Sing 'em out just for myself 
I don't even care what the world thinks about how I sound 
 
'Cause when I open my mouth 
My whole heart comes out 
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied 
I'm singing till I'm winning, Imma sing all night 
'Cause when I open my mouth 
There's no place to hide 
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free 
I'm singing 'cause, I'm winning Imma sing for me 
 
I stand and believe in who I am 
Take shots at my heart but who am I to give up 
Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free 
My stage is the greatest in the world 
Give back to the ones who struggle with me stay true 
Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny 
And now I'm ready now I'm gonna sing it all out 
Sing it out just for myself 
I don't even care what the world thinks about how I sound 
'Cause when I open my mouth 
My whole heart comes out 
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied 
I'm singing till I'm winning Imma sing all night 
'Cause when I open my mouth 
There's no place to hide 
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free 
I'm singing 'cause I'm winning Imma sing for me 
 
Sing for me (Sing for me) 
Sing for myself 
Sing what I believe 
Make my whole heart come out 
Right where I am let the rain come down 
Sing for me (Sing for me) 
Sing for myself, sing what I believe 
Let my whole heart come out 
Right here right now make my own, my very own sound 
 
'Cause when I open my mouth 
My whole heart comes out 
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied 
I'm singing till I'm winning Imma sing all night 
'Cause when I open my mouth 
There's no place to hide 
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free

You can't take me down, no 
 
The funny thing about listening is 
I don't have to hear you and the 
Funny thing about talking is 
Your words are tired 
Now I've come to realize that 
Life can be cruel but 
The only approval that I need is mine 
 
Your voice was like a knife

You tried to cut my pride

We light the darkness you and I 
We are the flicker in the night 
Never shine so bright 
 
We are the strong and though we fall 
We fought for love we risked it all 
Never back down against the walls 
It's what we're living for yeah 
 
Keep on rising higher 
Blazing through the fire 
Right down to the wire 
Rise the fire higher 
As we stand together 
Chase our dreams forever 
Forever, forever, forever 
 
Now we have wings we can fly 
We can be kings you and I 
Wipe away the tears from our eyes 
We light up the sky 
 
Now we have wings we can fly 
We can be kings you and I 
Wipe away the tears from our eyes 
We light up the sky 
 
Although the road ahead was long 
I was too weak to carry on 
You picked me up you were my home 
I never stood alone 
 
No one can tell us what we want 
No one can stop us anymore 
No looking back we're moving forward 
No one can take this moment away 
 
Keep on rising higher 
Blazing through the fire 
Right down to the wire 
Rise the fire higher 
As we stand together 
Chase our dreams forever 
Forever, forever, forever 
 
Now we have wings we can fly 
We can be kings you and I 
Wipe away the tears from our eyes 
We light up the sky 
 
Now we have wings we can fly 
We can be kings you and I 
Wipe away the tears from our eyes 
We light up the sky 
 
When skies are grey 
I'll light your way 
I'll be your shoulder 
You can lean on me

And help us to be wise in times when we don't know 
Nella mia preghiera 
Let this be our prayer 
Quanta fede c'e 
When shadows fill our day 
Lead us to the place, guide us with your grace 
To a place where we'll be safe 
 
Sognamo un mondo senza piu violenza 
Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza 
Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino 
Simbolo di pace, di fraternita 
 
La forza che ci da 
We ask that life be kind 
E il desiderio che 
And watch us from above 
Ognuno trovi amor 
We hope each soul will find 
Intorno e dentro se 
Another soul to love 
 
Let this be our prayer 
Let this be our prayer, just like every child 
 
Need to find a place, guide us with your grace 
Give us faith so we'll be safe 
 
E la fede che 
Hai acceso in noi, 
Sento che ci salvera</field>

            <field name="lyrics">There's no need for distance 
No need for touch 
No need for answers 'cause I've heard enough 
I've just found a chest some place out of reach 
I entered the darkness and laid my release 
And open my, open my heart 
Seem like a nightingale opened my, opened my hands 
When no one else understands 
 
I just close my eyes 
And count to ten 
Breathing twice 
And all be bent 
Nowhere to go 'cause I've been there before 
In my mind it is near 
I escape all I fear 
So by closing my eyes 
I am anywhere but here 
 
There's no need for anger 
Religion or faith 
One glade of grief 
Will always remain 
It's not on the paper 
Or a story book 
It's a place to reunite with all that was took 
And open my, I open my heart 
Seem like a nightingale opened my, opened my hands 
When no one else understands 
 
I just close my eyes 
And count to ten 
Breathing twice 
And all be bent 
Nowhere to go 'cause I've been there before 
In my mind it is near 
I escape all I fear 
So by closing my eyes 
I am anywhere but here 
 
Picture a land where you never have been 
Where life is a eternal and ever green 
The future of happiness ends silently 
He loved and you're lost for now in eternity 
 
Oh, I close my eyes 
And count to ten 
Breathing twice 
And all be bent 
Nowhere to go 'cause I've been there before

Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer 
That I remember being filled with such wonder 
Before learning that the world can be harsher 
 
Ooh, ooh 
Who you love or the colour of your skin 
Or the place that you were born and grew up in 
Shouldn't decide how you will be treated 
'Cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing 
 
Waiting for a change to set us free 
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me 
Waiting for hope to come around 
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found 
Waiting for a change, waiting for a change 
Change, change 
 
For all the brave and the souls who went before us 
Stand tall, then proudly lift your voices 
Let 'em know who we are and our choices 
And one day we won't have to sing this chorus 
 
Waiting for a change to set us free 
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me 
Waiting for hope to come around 
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found

Change (oh), change (hold on) 
Waiting for a change, change

Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam In full glory reflected now shines in the stream 'Tis the star-spangled banner, oh long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a country should leave us no more Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave Oh, thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved home and the war's desolation Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation Then conquer we must when our cause it is just And this be our motto, "In God is our trust" And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave</field>

Im stuck in a well with tear drops falling, my guide out is your voice but i dont hear your calling! I always hear through the grape vine, that you you talk about me all the time. chours where do i turn for shelter from this heartbreaking storm. I used to be able to turn to you to keep me safe and warm! But now she came in the picture, and ripped our future from my grasp, why cant you say, you want me back, so everything can be like our past.... and love me again!</field>

I couldn't go on But now I've found I'm feeling strong and moving on I believe they can take anything from me But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace They can say all they wanna say about me But I'm gonna carry on I'm gonna keep on singing my song Whoa, and everytime I tried to be what they wanted from me It never came naturally So I ended up in misery, wasn't able to see All the good around me They wasted so much energy on what they thought of me Simply just remembering to breathe I'm human, I ain't able to please Everyone at the same time, so now I find My peace of mind living one day at a time I'm human and I answer to one god It comes down to one love Until I get to heave above I've made the decision Never to give up Til the I day I die no matter what I'm gonna carry on and keep on singing my song..... (They can't take anything from me) I believe that they can do what they wanna. Say what they wanna say (They can say what they wanna) But I'm gonna keep on (Keep on ) I believe it That they can take from me But they can't take my inner peace Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Say what you wanan say, but I'm gonna sing my song Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah [Laugh] [Outro] [Guy 1] Hey I said [Guy 2] Hi dog [Guy 1] Hi [Guy 2] Hey dog [Guy 1] Hi [Guy 2] It's me Wassim.

That's all that's going through my mind, the tape of you, the tape of you and her, the tape that brought me to tears, the tape that ruined my life, my world.

            <field name="lyrics">I found a love for me 
Darling, just dive right in 
and follow my lead 
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet 
Oh, I never knew you were 
The someone waiting for me 
'Cause we were just kids 
When we fell in love 
Not knowing what it was 
I will not give you up this time 
But darling, just kiss me slow 
Your heart is all I own 
And in your eyes you're holding mine 
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark 
With you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass 
Listening to our favorite song 
When you said you looked a mess 
I whispered underneath my breath 
But you heard it, darling 
You look perfect tonight 
Well I found a woman, stronger 
Than anyone I know 
She shares my dreams 
I hope that someday I'll share her home 
I found a love, to carry 
More than just my secrets 
To carry love, to carry 
children of our own 
We are still kids 
But we're so in love 
Fighting against all odds 
I know we'll be alright this time 
Darling, just hold my hand 
Be my girl, I'll be your man 
I see my future in your eyes 
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark 
With you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass 
Listening to our favorite song 
When I saw you in that dress 
Looking so beautiful 
I don't deserve this, darling 
You look perfect tonight 
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark 
With you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass 
Listening to our favorite song 
I have faith in what I see 
Now I know I have met an angel in person 
And she looks perfect, I don't deserve this 
You look perfect tonight</field>

Loving can hurt sometimes 
But it's the only thing that I know 
And when it gets hard 
You know it can get hard sometimes 
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive 
We keep this love in a photograph 
We made these memories for ourselves 
Where our eyes are never closing 
Hearts were never broken 
And time's forever frozen still 
So you can keep me inside the pocket 
Of your ripped jeans 
Holding me close until our eyes meet 
You won't ever be alone 
Wait for me to come home 
Loving can heal 
Loving can mend your soul 
And it's the only thing that I know 
I swear it will get easier 
Remember that with every piece of you 
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die 
We keep this love in a photograph 
We made these memories for ourselves 
Where our eyes are never closing 
Our hearts were never broken 
And time's forever frozen still 
So you can keep me inside the pocket 
Of your ripped jeans 
Holding me close until our eyes meet 
You won't ever be alone 
And if you hurt me that's okay baby 
Only words bleed 
Inside these pages you just hold me 
And I won't ever let you go 
Wait for me to come home 
Oh you can fit me 
Inside the necklace you got 
When you were sixteen 
Next to your heartbeat where I should be 
Keep it deep within your soul 
And if you hurt me 
Well that's okay baby 
Only words bleed 
Inside these pages you just hold me 
And I won't ever let you go 
When I'm away 
I will remember how you kissed me 
Under the lamppost back on 6th street 
Hearing you whisper through the phone 
Wait for me to come home</field>

So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots 
Drinking fast and then we talk slow 
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me 
And trust me I'll give it a chance now 
Take my hand, stop 
Put Van The Man on the jukebox 
And then we start to dance 
And now I'm singing like 
Girl, you know I want your love 
Your love was handmade for somebody like me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don't mind me 
Say, boy, let's not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
Come, come on now, follow my lead 
I'm in love with the shape of you 
We push and pull like a magnet do 
Although my heart is falling too 
I'm in love with your body 
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I 
I'm in love with your body 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with the shape of you 
One week in we let the story begin 
We're going out on our first date 
You and me are thrifty 
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate 
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour 
And how your family is doing okay 
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat 
Tell the driver make the radio play 
And I'm singing like 
Girl, you know I want your love 
Your love was handmade for somebody like me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don't mind me 
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

I'm in love with the shape of you 
We push and pull like a magnet do 
Although my heart is falling too 
I'm in love with your body 
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with your body 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
I'm in love with your body 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
I'm in love with your body 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
I'm in love with your body 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with the shape of you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When your legs don't work like they used to before 
And I can't sweep you off of your feet 
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love 
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks 
Darlin' I will be lovin' you 
Till we're seventy 
Baby my heart could still fall as hard 
At twenty three 
I'm thinkin' bout how 
People fall in love in mysterious ways 
Maybe just the touch of a hand 
Me, I fall in love with you every single day 
I just wanna tell you I am 
So honey now 
Take me into your lovin' arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
Maybe we found love right where we are 
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades 
And the crowds don't remember my name 
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mm) 
I know you will still love me the same 
Cause honey your soul 
Could never grow old 
It's evergreen 
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory 
I'm thinkin' bout how 
People fall in love in mysterious ways 
Maybe it's all part of a plan 
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes 
Hoping that you'll understand 
That baby now (ooh) 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
Maybe we found love right where we are 
Baby now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars (oh darlin') 
Place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
Maybe we found love right where we are 
Maybe we found love right where we are 
And we found love right where we are</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Walking down 29th and park 
I saw you in another's arms 
Only a month we've been apart 
You look happier 
Saw you walk inside a bar 
He said something to make you laugh 
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours 
Yeah, you look happier, you do 
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you 
But ain't nobody love you like I do 
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby 
If you're moving on with someone new 
'Cause baby you look happier, you do 
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too 
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth 
But I know I was happier with you 
Sat on the corner of the room 
Everything's reminding me of you 
Nursing an empty bottle 
And telling myself you're happier 
Aren't you? 
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you 
But ain't nobody need you like I do 
I know that there's others that deserve you 
But my darling, I am still in love with you 
But I guess you look happier, you do 
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too 
I could try to smile to hide the truth 
But I know I was happier with you 
Baby, you look happier, you do 
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new 
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do 
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When I was six years old I broke my leg 
I was running from my brother and his friends 
And tasted the sweet perfume 
Of the mountain grass I rolled down 
I was younger then, take me back to when I 
Found my heart and broke it here 
Made friends and lost them through the years 
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long 
I know I've grown 
But I can't wait to go home 
I'm on my way 
Driving at 90 down those country lanes 
Singing to "Tiny Dancer" 
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real 
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes 
Running from the law through the backfields 
And getting drunk with my friends 
Had my first kiss on a Friday night 
I don't reckon that I did it right 
But I was younger then, take me back to when 
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid 
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight 
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long 
Oh how we've grown 
But I can't wait to go home 
I'm on my way 
Driving at 90 down those country lanes 
Singing to "Tiny Dancer" 
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real 
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
Over the castle on the hill 
Over the castle on the hill 
One friend left to sell clothes 
One works down by the coast 
One had two kids but lives alone 
One's brother overdosed 
One's already on his second wife 
One's just barely getting by 
But these people raised me 
And I can't wait to go home 
And I'm on my way, I still remember 
These old country lanes 
When we did not know the answers 
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real 
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
Over the castle on the hill 
Over the castle on the hill</field>

Oh, darling just dive right in and follow my lead 
Well I found a girl, beautiful and sweet 
Oh, I never knew you were the 
someone waiting for me 
Cause we were just kids when 
we fell in love 
Not knowing what it was, 
I will not give you up this time 
Darling just kiss me slow, 
your heart is all I own 
And in your eyes you're holding mine 
Baby I'm dancing in the dark, 
with you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass, while 
listening to our favourite song 
When you said you looked a mess, 
I whispered underneath my breath 
But you heard it, 
darling you look perfect tonight 
Well I found a man, stronger 
than anyone I know 
He shares my dreams, 
I hope that someday we'll share a home 
I found a love, to carry more 
than just my secrets 
To carry love, to carry 
children of our own 
We are still kids, 
but we're so in love, 
fighting against all odds 
I know we'll be alright this time 
Darling just hold my hand, 
be your girl, you'll be my man 
And I see my future in your eyes 
Well baby I'm dancing in the dark, 
with you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass, 
while listening to our favourite song 
When I saw you in that dress, 
looking so beautiful 
I don't deserve this, 
darling you look perfect tonight 
Baby I'm dancing in the dark, 
with you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass, 
while listening to our favourite song 
I have faith in what I see 
Now I know I have met an angel in person 
And she looks perfect, I don't deserve this 
You look perfect tonight</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I was born inside a small town 
I've lost that state of mind 
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house 
But stopped at the age of nine 
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride 
The paving stones I played upon 
They kept me on the grind 
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life 
Friends and family filled with envy 
When they should be filled with pride 
And when the world's against me 
Is when I really come alive 
And every day that Satan tempts me 
I try to take it in my stride 
You know that I've got whisky 
With white lies and smoke in my lungs 
I think life has got to the point 
I know without it's no fun 
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up 
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become 
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me 
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree 
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
Showed me the locked doors 
I find another use for the key 
And you'll see 
I'm well aware of certain things 
That can destroy a man like me 
But with that said give me one more, higher 
Another one to take the sting away 
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day 
And I'll find comfort in my pain 
Eraser 
I used to think that nothing could be better 
Than touring the world with my songs 
I chased the picture perfect life 
I think they painted it wrong 
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell 
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well 
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps 
Because you're living your dream 
Man, this shit should be fun 
Please know that I'm not trying to preach 
Like I'm Reverend Run 
I beg you, don't be disappointed 
With the man I've become 
Our conversations with my father on the A14 
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams 
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me 
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans 
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou 
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud 
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed 
The world may be filled with hate 
But keep erasing it now 
Somehow 
I'm well aware of certain things 
That will befall a man like me 
But with that said give me one more, higher 
Another one to take the sting away 
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day 
And I'll find comfort in my pain 
Eraser 
And I'll find comfort in my pain 
Eraser 
And I'll find comfort in my pain 
Eraser 
Welcome to the new show 
I guess you know I've been away 
But where I'm heading, who knows 
But my heart will stay the same 
Welcome to the new show 
I guess you know I've been away 
But where I'm heading, who knows 
My pain, eraser 
And I'll find comfort in my pain 
Eraser 
And I'll find comfort in my pain

'Cause lately I've been waking up alone 
Pain splattered teardrops on my shirt 
Told you I'd let them go 
And I'll fight my corner 
Maybe tonight I'll call ya 
After my blood turns into alcohol 
No I just wanna hold ya 
Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out 
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around 
All I want is the taste that your lips allow 
My my, my my oh give me love 
My my, my my oh give me love 
My my, my my give me love 
Give me love like never before 
'Cause lately I've been craving more 
And it's been a while but I still feel the same 
Maybe I should let you go 
You know I'll fight my corner 
And that tonight I'll call ya 
After my blood, is drowning in alcohol 
No I just wanna hold ya

            <field name="lyrics">She played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
I met her on Grafton street 
Right outside of the bar 
She shared a cigarette with me 
While her brother played the guitar 
She asked me what does it mean 
The Gaelic ink on your arm? 
Said it was one of my friend's songs 
Do you want to drink on? 
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun 
She got Arthur on the table with 
Johnny riding a shotgun 
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar 
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance 
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
With my pretty little Galway Girl 
You're my pretty little Galway Girl 
You know she beat me at darts 
And then she beat me at pool 
And then she kissed me 
Like there was nobody else in the room 
As last orders were called 
Was when she stood on the stool 
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes 
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet 
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat 
Oh, I could have that voice 
Playing on repeat for a week 
And in this packed out room 
Swear she was singing to me 
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
My pretty little Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
And now we've outstayed our welcome 
And it's closing time 
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine 
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine 
As we fill up our lungs 
With the cold air of the night 
I walked her home then she took me inside 
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine 
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write 
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night 
She played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
My pretty little Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

            <field name="lyrics">Oh, misty eye of the mountain below 
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls 
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke 
Keep watching over Durin's sons 
If this is to end in fire 
Then we should all burn together 
Watch the flames climb higher into the night 
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will 
Watch the flames burn on and on 
The mountainside 
And if we should die tonight 
Then we should all die together 
Raise a glass of wine for the last time 
Calling out father, oh 
Prepare as we will 
Watch the flames burn on and on 
The mountainside 
Desolation comes upon the sky 
Now I see fire 
Inside the mountains 
I see fire 
Burning the trees 
And I see fire 
Hollowing souls 
And I see fire 
Blood in the breeze 
And I hope that you remember me 
Oh, should my people fall then 
Surely I'll do the same 
Confined in mountain halls 
We got too close to the flame 
Calling out father, oh 
Hold fast and we will 
Watch the flames burn on and on 
The mountainside 
Desolation comes upon the sky 
Now I see fire 
Inside the mountains 
I see fire 
Burning the trees 
And I see fire 
Hollowing souls 
And I see fire 
Blood in the breeze 
And I hope that you remember me 
And if the night is burning 
I will cover my eyes 
For if the dark returns then 
My brothers will die 
And as the sky's falling down 
It crashed into this lonely town 
And with that shadow upon the ground 
I hear my people screaming out 
Now I see fire 
Inside the mountains 
I see fire 
Burning the trees 
And I see fire 
Hollowing souls 
And I see fire 
Blood in the breeze 
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning) 
(Fire) 
And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin) (fire) 
And I see fire (fire) 
And I see fire (burn on and on the mountainside)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I met this girl late last year 
She said don't you worry if I disappear 
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake 
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait 
But then I jump right in 
A week later return 
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn 
But I gave her my time for two or three nights 
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right 
I went away for months until our paths crossed again 
She told me I was never looking for a friend 
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10 
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin 
We'll be in between the sheets until the late Am 
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said 
She's singing 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe 
For a couple weeks I 
Only want to see her 
We drink away the days with a take away pizza 
Before a text message was the only way to reach her 
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her 
Singing out Aretha 
All over the track like a feature 
Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either 
But me and her we make money the same way 
Four cities, two planes the same day 
Those shows have never been what it's about 
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out 
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch 
But we should get on a plane 
Or we'll be missing it now 
Wish I'd have written it down 
The way that things played out 
When she was kissing him 
How I was confused about 
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe 
*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door 
I don't even know if she knows what for 
She was crying on my shoulder 
I already told ya 
Trust and respect is what we do this for 
I never intended to be next 
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all 
And I never saw him as a threat 
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course 
It's not like we were both on tour 
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor 
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment 
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different 
This is not the way you realize what you wanted 
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest 
All this time God knows I'm singing 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You look so wonderful in your dress 
I love your hair like that 
The way it falls on the side of your neck 
Down your shoulders and back 
We are surrounded by all of these lies 
And people who talk too much 
You got the kind of look in your eyes 
As if no one knows anything but us 
And should this be the last thing I see 
I want you to know it's enough for me 
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need 
I'm so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love 
You look so beautiful in this light 
Your silhouette over me 
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes 
Is the Tenerife Sea 
And all of the voices surrounding us here 
they just fade out when you take a breath 
Just say the word 
and they'll all disappear into the wilderness 
And should this be the last thing I see 
I want you to know it's enough for me 
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need 
I'm so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love 
Lumiere, darlin' 
Lumiere over me

            <field name="lyrics">It's just another night 
And I'm staring at the moon 
Saw a shooting star and thought of you 
Sang a lullaby by the water side and knew 
If you were here, I'd sing to you 
You're on the other side 
As the skyline splits in two 
I'm miles away froom seeing you 
I can see the stars from America 
I wonder, do you see them too? 
So open your eyes and see 
The way our horizons meet 
And all of the lights will lead 
Into the night with me 
And I know these skies will bleed 
But both of our hearts believe 
All of the stars will guide us home 
I can hear your heart 
On the radio beat 
They're playing"Chasing Cars" and I thought of us 
Back to the time you were lying next to me 
I looked across and fell in love 
So I took your hand 
Back through lands and streets I knew 
Everything led back to you 
So, can you see the stars 
Over Amsterdam 
You're the song my heart is beating to? 
So open your eyes and see 
The way our horizons meet 
And all of the lights will lead 
Into the night with me 
And I know these scars will bleed 
But both of our hearts believe 
All of the stars will guide us home 
I can see the stars from America</field>

Breathing in snowflakes 
Burnt lungs, sour taste 
Light's gone, day's end 
Struggling to pay rent 
Long nights, strange men 
And they say 
She's in the Class A Team 
Stuck in her daydream 
Been this way since eighteen 
But lately her face seems 
Slowly sinking, wasting 
Crumbling like pastries 
And they scream 
The worst things in life come free to us 
Cause we're just under the upperhand 
And go mad for a couple of grams 
And she don't want to go outside tonight 
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland 
Or sells love to another man 
It's too cold outside 
For angels to fly 
Angels to fly 
Ripped gloves, raincoat 
Tried to swim and stay afloat 
Dry house, wet clothes 
Loose change, bank notes 
Weary-eyed, dry throat 
Call girl, no phone 
And they say 
She's in the Class A Team 
Stuck in her daydream 
Been this way since eighteen

But she don't want to go outside tonight 
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland 
Or sells love to another man 
It's too cold outside 
For angels to fly 
An angel will die 
Covered in white 
Closed eye 
And hoping for a better life 
This time, we'll fade out tonight 
Straight down the line 
And they say 
She's in the Class A Team 
Stuck in her daydream 
Been this way since eighteen 
But lately her face seems 
Slowly sinking, wasting 
Crumbling like pastries

Glass on the side now 
I've been sat with you 
For most of the night 
Ignoring everybody here 
We wish they would disappear 
So maybe we could get down now 
I don't wanna know 
If you're getting ahead of the program 
I want you to be my lady 
To hold your body close 
Take another step into the no-man's land 
For the longest time lady 
I need you darling 
Come on set the tone 
If you feel you're falling 
Won't you let me know 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
If you love me, come on, get involved 
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Sing 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Louder 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Sing 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
This love is ablaze 
I saw flames from the side of the stage 
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days 
Until then, we got nothing to say 
And nothing to know 
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke 
Let it go until our roads are changed 
Singing "We Found Love" in a local rave, no 
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say 
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray 
I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet you" 
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila 
I already know that she's a keeper 
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep 
If anybody find out 
I meant to drive home 
But I drank all of it now 
Not sober enough, we just sat on the couch 
One thing led to another 
Now she's kissing my mouth 
I need you darling 
Come on set the tone 
If you feel you're falling 
Won't you let me know 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
If you love me, come on, get involved 
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Sing 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Louder 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Sing 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Can you feel it? 
All the guys in here don't really wanna dance 
Can you feel it? 
All that I can hear is music from the back 
Can you feel it? 
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling 
Before the beat kicks in again 
Can you feel it? 
Can you feel it? Oh no 
Sing 
I need you darling 
Come on set the tone 
If you feel you're falling 
Won't you let me know 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (sing) 
If you love me, come on, get involved 
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

You know that it's true 
I'm feeling younger 
Every time that I'm alone with you 
We were sitting in a parked car 
Stealing kisses in a front yard 
We got questions we shouldn't had asked but 
How would you feel 
If I told you I loved you 
It's just something that I want to do 
I'll be taking my time 
Spending my life 
Falling deeper in love with you 
So tell me that you love me too 
In the summer 
As the lilacs bloom 
Love flows deeper than a river 
Every moment that I spend with you 
We were sat upon our best friend's roof 
I had both of my arms around you 
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but 
How would you feel 
If I told you I loved you 
It's just something that I want to do 
I'll be taking my time 
Spending my life 
Falling deeper in love with you 
So tell me that you love me too

And just stay with me 
All my senses come to life 
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I 
Have ever been, and I'll never leave again 
'Cause you are the only one 
And all my friends have come to find 
Another place to let their hearts collide 
Just promise me you'll always be a friend 
'Cause you are the only one 
Take my hand and my heart and soul 
I will only have these eyes for you 
And you know, everything changes 
But we'll be strangers 
If we see this through 
You can stay within these walls and bleed 
But just stay with me

Just promise me you'll always be a friend

I'm stumbling off drunk 
Getting myself lost 
I am so gone 
So tell me the way home 
I'm listening sad songs 
Singing about love 
Where it goes wrong 
All my senses come to life 
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I 
Have ever been, and I'll never leave again 
'Cause you are the only one 
And all my friends have come to find

But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song 
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in 
Politics, religions or other people's quarrels" 
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
I know when I have children 
They will know what it means 
And I pass on these things my family's given to me 
Just love and understanding, positivity 
We could change this whole world with a piano 
Add a bass, some guitar 
Grab a beat and away we go 
I'm just a boy with a one-man show 
No university, no degree, but lord knows 
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth 
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios 
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote 
Sing, love could change the world in a moment 
But what do I know? 
Love can change the world in a moment 
But what do I know? 
Love can change the world in a moment 
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away 
I saw people marching in the streets today 
You know we are made up of love and hate 
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade 
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams 
Just re-remember life 
Is more than fittin' in your jeans 
It's love and understanding, positivity 
We could change this whole world with a piano 
Add a bass, some guitar 
Grab a beat and away we go

Love can change the world in a moment 
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me 
So let's all get together, we can all be free 
Spread love and understanding, positivity 
We could change this whole world with a piano 
Add a bass, some guitar 
Grab a beat and away we go 
I'm just a boy with a one-man show

I threw the day old tea from the cup 
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made 
Memories of a life that's been loved 
Took the get well soon cards 
And stuffed animals 
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink 
Dad always told me 
"Don't you cry when you're down" 
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink 
Oh, I'm in pieces 
It's tearing me up, but I know 
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved 
So I'll sing Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum 
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up 
Spread your wings as you go 
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah 
You're home" 
Fluffed the pillows, made the beds 
Stacked the chairs up 
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case 
John says he'd drive 
Then put his hand on my cheek 
And wiped a tear from the side of my face 
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know 
A life with love is a life that's been lived 
So I'll sing Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum 
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up 
Spread your wings as you go 
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah 
You're home" 
Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum 
You got to see the person I have become 
Spread your wings and I know 
That when God took you back he said, "Hallelujah 
You're home"</field>

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans 
Goes to the gym at least six times a week 
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet 
And I hear he's on a new diet 
And watches what he eats 
He's got his eyebrows plucked 
And his arsehole bleached 
Owns every single Ministry CD 
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means 
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me 
But still, I'm just keepin' it real 
Still lookin' at your Instagram 
And I'll be creepin' a lil' 
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back 
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at 
Let me remind you of the days when 
You used to hold my hand 
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans 
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman 
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved 
So let me give it to ya 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
'Cause if it was meant to be 
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to 
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
We'll get there eventually 
I know you're missin' all this kind of love 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb 
And wears a man bag on his shoulder 
But I call it a purse 
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas 
Drinks beer, but has a six pack 
I'm kinda jealous 
He wears sunglasses indoors 
In winter, at nighttime 
And every time a rap song comes on 
He makes a gang sign 
Says "Tune, boydem light up the room! " 
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you 
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin' 
Eatin' a packet of crisps 
But you will never find you cheatin' 
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym 
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim 
In the back of the club 
Kissin' a boy that ain't him 
Okay, you need to be alone 
And if you wanna talk about it 
You can call my phone 
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know 
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved 
So let me give it to ya 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
'Cause if it was meant to be 
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to 
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
We'll get there eventually 
I know you're missin' all this kind of love 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week 
But you act so differently 
When you're with him, I know you're lonely 
Please remember you're still free 
To make the choice and leave 
Don't call me up, you need to show me 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
'Cause if it was meant to be 
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to 
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
We'll get there eventually 
I know you're missin' all this kind of love 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about

Should see the way she holds me 
When the lights go low 
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time 
Took my heart upon a one way trip 
Guess she went wandering off with it 
None like most women I know 
This one will bring it back whole 
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead 
Oh my baby, lately I know 
That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love, aren't we? 
Hands in your hair 
Fingers and thumbs, baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near 
Love the way that you conquer your fear 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah 
She is the river flowin' Orwell 
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells 
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs 
Spend my summertime beside her 
And the rest of the year the same 
She is the flint that sparks the lighter 
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh 
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my 
All this, all this I know 
But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear

You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah 
Well, I've found love inside 
The arms of the woman I know 
She is the lighthouse in the night 
That will safely guide me home 
And I'm not scared of passing over 
Or the thought of growing old 
'Cause from now until I go 
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love, aren't we? 
Hands in your hair 
Fingers and thumbs, baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near

How was I supposed to know 
That something wasn't right here 
Oh baby, baby 
I shouldn't have let you go 
And now you're out of sight, yeah 
Show me how you want it to be 
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now 
Oh because 
My loneliness is killing me (and I) 
I must confess, I still believe (still believe) 
When I'm not with you I lose my mind 
Give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time 
Oh baby, baby 
The reason I breathe is you 
Yeah, you got me blinded 
Oh pretty baby 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
That's not the way I planned it 
Show me how you want it to be 
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now 
Oh because

            <field name="lyrics">Things were all good yesterday 
And then the devil took your memory 
And if you fell to your death today 
I hope that heaven is your resting place 
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain 
But then that could have been the medicine 
And now you are lying in the bed again 
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them 
My father told me, son 
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face 
You're not the only one 
Although my grandma used to say 
That he used to sing 
Darlin' hold me in your arms the way you did last night 
And we'll lie inside for a little while here oh 
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up 
And we're wrapped In light and life and love 
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut 
For they're designed to be together oh 
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one 
And we set alight, we're afire love 
Things were all good yesterday 
Then the devil took your breath away 
Now we're left here in the pain 
Black suit black tie standing in the rain 
And now my family is one again 
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend 
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen 
6 years old I remember when 
My father told me, son 
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face 
You're not the only one 
Although my grandma used to say 
That he used to sing 
Darlin' hold me in your arms the way you did last night 
And we'll lie inside for a little while here oh 
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up 
And we're wrapped In light and life and love 
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut 
For they're designed to be together oh 
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one 
And we set alight, we're afire love 
My father and all of my family 
Rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah 
And my mother and all of my family 
Rise from their seats to say hallelujah 
And my brother and all of my family 
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah 
My father and all of my family 
Rise from the seats to sing 
Hallelujah</field>

And I'm staring at the moon 
Saw a shooting star and thought of you 
Sang a lullaby by the water side and knew 
If you were here, I'd sing to you 
You're on the other side 
As the skyline splits in two 
I'm miles away froom seeing you 
I can see the stars from America 
I wonder, do you see them too? 
So open your eyes and see 
The way our horizons meet 
And all of the lights will lead 
Into the night with me 
And I know these skies will bleed 
But both of our hearts believe 
All of the stars will guide us home 
I can hear your heart 
On the radio beat 
They're playing"Chasing Cars" and I thought of us 
Back to the time you were lying next to me 
I looked across and fell in love 
So I took your hand 
Back through lands and streets I knew 
Everything led back to you 
So, can you see the stars 
Over Amsterdam 
You're the song my heart is beating to? 
So open your eyes and see 
The way our horizons meet 
And all of the lights will lead 
Into the night with me 
And I know these scars will bleed 
But both of our hearts believe 
All of the stars will guide us home 
I can see the stars from America</field>

Passes by just like mine 
It's not complicated 
Another mind 
Another soul 
Another body to grow old 
It's not complicated 
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? 
Float down 
Like autumn leaves 
Hush now 
Close your eyes before the sleep 
And you're miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me 
Another tear 
Another cry 
Another place for us to die 
It's not complicated 
Another love that's gone to waste 
Another light lost from your face 
It's complicated 
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you? 
Float down 
Like autumn leaves 
Hush now 
Close your eyes before the sleep 
And you're miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me 
Ooh how I miss you 
My symphony played the song that carried you out 
Ooh how I miss you 
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay 
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? 
Float down 
Like autumn leaves 
Hush now 
Close your eyes before the sleep 
And you're miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me 
Ooh oh, ooh oh 
Ooh oh, ooh oh 
Touch down 
Like a seven four seven 
Or stay out and we'll live forever now</field>

I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine 
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline 
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline 
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music 
Don't care what the DJ chooses 
Get lost in the rhythm with me 
Please don't close until we wanna leave it 
And you and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight 
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright 
Just close your eyes 
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street 
In Barcelona 
Barcelona 
Barcelona 
Barcelona 
Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move 
It's a Saturday night 
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight 
Reflected in your beautiful eyes 
I guess that is destiny doing it right 
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean 
Spin you around me again and again, and 
You're like something that God has sent me 
I want you, baby, solamente 
And you and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight 
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright 
Just close your eyes 
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

Sí, te adoro, señorita (Barcelona)

Come on, let's be free in Barcelona

And you'd breathe me 'til you're not feeling sure 
Everything will brighten up 
If we go to Brighton I'll take you along the pier 
Everything will lighten up 
If you feel too frightened I'll make it disappear 
Darling don't be nervous 
I'll understand if you let me go 
I did this on purpose now 
When I'm missing you I'll stop eating food 
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you 
And then I'll see your bitterness 
And why you're leaving too 
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you 
I think that I love you 
Sunny days that left my skin blood red 
And you squeeze me 'til these thoughts leave my head 
If it gets too complicated 
I'll give up and be frustrated 
Can you see what's wrong? 
If you feel like you've been hated 
This loves too overrated 
See what's going on, on 
Darling don't be nervous 
I'll understand if you let me go 
I did this on purpose now 
When I'm missing you I'll stop eating food 
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you 
And then I'll see your bitterness 
And why you're leaving too 
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you 
I think that I love you 
Take me back to live at home, take me back to Albert Road 
Now I'm missing you, I've stopped eating food 
And I've squeezed in to your dress so I can feel like you 
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too 
I thought I'll put you to a test and say that I love you 
I think that I love you 
And I've stopped eating food 
And I've squeezed in to your dress so I could feel like you 
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too 
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you 
Now it seems you loved me too</field>

I lost my shoes last night 
I don't know where I put my keys 
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree 
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar 
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee 
And all I know 
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat 
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain 
I tell myself in every way 
I won't be doing this again 
And tomorrow's a brand new day 
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind" 
And I am only being honest with you, I 
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time 
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye 
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye 
Bibia be ye ye 
I remember less and less 
And mostly things that I regret 
In my phone are several texts 
From girls I've never met 
And in the pocket of my jeans 
Are only coins and broken dreams 
My heart is breaking at the seams 
And I'm coming apart now 
Now things are looking up 
I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree 
And I'll get a bus straight into town 
And spend the afternoon 
Looking around for the things 
That I left on the ground 
And say you're with me 
Tomorrow's a brand new day 
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind" 
And I am only being honest with you, I 
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time 
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye

Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own 
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see 
That I am more than what is hiding in me 
Come and show me if you can 
See I know you're me 
But I can't seem to understand 
If you know me, place my hand on mine 
And we will resurrect the time 
That we lost when you left my mind 
it's psycho-paranoia disappearing in time 
Come and show me what makes you tick 
I need you to get out of my mind quick

            <field name="lyrics">I want to be real 
Not some conscience to myself 
The way you worship, never ending 
Some idol who's pretending to be true 
How you put upon yourself 
A man who never seems 
To answer to you words 
So go and make me over 
I'm a fly upon your neck 
You can't control me 
I have my words, my voice 
My strengths, my choice 
And I can cut as deep 
Just as deep as I need 
Don't want your advice 
Cos I've made up my own mind 
The way you bore me with the stories 
Of far and distant times 
I've heard it before 
So don't try that on me 
The way you worship, never-ending 
Some idol who's pretending to be true 
It could be you 
Brainwashed by the lies 
It's no surprise 
That you'd wanna waste your time 
I'm a fly upon your neck 
You can't control me 
I have my words, my voice 
My strengths, my choice 
And I can cut as deep 
Just as deep as I need</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Goodbye Norma Jean 
Though I never knew you at all 
You had the grace to hold yourself 
While those around you crawled 
They crawled out of the woodwork 
And they whispered into your brain 
They set you on the treadmill 
And they made you change your name 
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never knowing who to cling to 
When the rain set in 
And I would liked to have known you 
But I was just a kid 
Your candle burned out long before 
Your legend ever did 
Loneliness was tough 
The toughest role you ever played 
Hollywood created a superstar 
And pain was the price you paid 
Even when you died 
Oh the press still hounded you 
All the papers had to say 
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude 
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never knowing who to cling to 
When the rain set in 
And I would liked to have known you 
But I was just a kid 
Your candle burned out long before 
Your legend ever did 
Goodbye Norma Jean 
Though I never knew you at all 
You had the grace to hold yourself 
While those around you crawled 
Goodbye Norma Jean 
From the young man in the 22nd row 
Who sees you as something as more than sexual 
More than just our Marilyn Monroe 
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never knowing who to cling to 
When the rain set in 
And I would liked to have known you 
But I was just a kid 
Your candle burned out long before 
Your legend ever did 
Your candle burned out long before 
Your legend ever did</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When I was six years old I broke my leg 
I was running from my brother and his friends 
And tasted the sweet perfume 
Of the mountain grass I rolled down 
I was younger then, take me back to when I 
Found my heart and broke it here 
Made friends and lost them through the years 
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long 
I know I've grown 
But I can't wait to go home 
I'm on my way 
Driving at 90 down those country lanes 
Singing to "Tiny Dancer" 
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real 
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes 
Running from the law through the backfields 
And getting drunk with my friends 
Had my first kiss on a Friday night 
I don't reckon that I did it right 
But I was younger then, take me back to when 
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid 
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight 
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long 
Oh how we've grown 
But I can't wait to go home 
I'm on my way 
Driving at 90 down those country lanes 
Singing to "Tiny Dancer" 
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real 
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
Over the castle on the hill 
Over the castle on the hill 
One friend left to sell clothes 
One works down by the coast 
One had two kids but lives alone 
One's brother overdosed 
One's already on his second wife 
One's just barely getting by 
But these people raised me 
And I can't wait to go home 
And I'm on my way, I still remember 
These old country lanes 
When we did not know the answers 
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real 
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
Over the castle on the hill 
Over the castle on the hill</field>

I'm drunk off last night's whiskey and coke 
She'll make me shiver without warning 
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke 
And you can stay with me forever 
Or you could stay with me for now 
Tell me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm right 
Tell me if you need a loving hand 
To help you fall asleep tonight 
Tell me if I know, tell me if I do 
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to 
I'll wake with coffee in the morning 
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea 
Outside the day is up and calling 
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep 
Stay with me forever 
Or you could stay with me for now 
Tell me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm right 
Tell me if you need a loving hand 
To help you fall asleep tonight 
Tell me if I know, tell me if I do 
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to 
'Cause I love the way you wake me up 
For goodness sake will my love not be enough? 
Tell me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm right 
Tell me if you need a loving hand 
To help you fall asleep tonight 
Tell me if I know, tell me if I do 
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to 
Tell me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm right

I reckon its been doing weights 
Eating raw eggs and cereal 
And running ten miles a day 
And your love as I'm driving vans 
I try to steer intoxicated with another love inside lands 
And your love is a friend of mine 
So we'll take care tonight 
If you could only say the words 
I'll take it and I'll write it down 
And hold it deep inside of me 
Untill the day you found me out 
But I know your love 
And thats why 
I could be your diary 
Baby if you open me up 
Keep it inside me 
I'll give you the world 
Just give me the words 
And I could be your diary 
Baby if you open me up 
Keep it inside me 
I'll give you the world 
Just give me the words 
And your love 
Has never my enemy 
Used to hold me 
And pormise it would never leave 
Never been better since all the therapy 
To read the words between the lines 
And take away my melody 
And your lo-o-ve 
Told me it was fell into a different page 
And you know if I let you go 
I'll still keep you safe 
If you could only say the words 
I'll take it and I'll write it down 
And hold it deep inside of me 
Untill the day you found me out 
But I know your love 
And thats why 
I could be your diary 
Baby if you open me up 
Keep it inside me 
I'll give you the world 
Just give me the words 
And I could be your diary 
Baby if you open me up 
Keep it inside me 
I'll give you the world 
Just give me the words 
You are the one I fall asleep with 
But never wake up to 
Coz work is something you must do 
I trust you like you trust me 
It must mean true love 
It does exactly what it says on the tin 
Let me begin 
You are the one I watch the movies with 
For recognising my love for kiera knightley for what it truly is 
Just an excuse so I dont have 
to watch love actually again but you're actually the same 
Its just to spite me 
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it 
Untill the dishes finish 
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it 
I tried to make tea once for you in bed 
But all I did was spill it 
So you made it for me instead 
Let me in bed 
If you get in ahead of me 
Its better to do 
Yep love is ahead of the truth 
That in love 
We are better in two 
I'll be the newcomer 
Stuck in heaven with the devin you 
Diary 
Baby if you open me up 
Keep it inside me 
I'll give you the world 
Just give me the words 
And I could be your diary 
Baby if you open me up 
Keep it inside me 
I'll give you the world 
Just give me the words

Uh, let me loose 
Ooh, I'm overdue 
Gimme some room, comin' through 
Paid my dues, in the mood 
Me and the girls gonna shake the room 
Dj's spinnin' (show your hands) 
Let's get dirty (that's my jam) 
I need that, uh, to get me off 
Sweatin' till my clothes come off 
It's explosive, speakers are thumpin' 
Still jumpin', six in the mornin' 
Table dancin', glasses are crashin' 
No question, time for some action 
Temperature's up (can you feel it?) 
'Bout to erupt 
Gonna get my girls, get your boys 
Gonna make some noise 
Gonna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly 
Get it fired up in a hurry 
Wanna get dirty 
It's about time that I came to start the party 
Sweat drippin' over my body 
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty

Bodies packed, front to back 
Now move your ass, I like that 
Tight hip huggers, low for sure 
Shake a little somethin' on the floor 
I need that, uh, to get me off 
Sweatin' till my clothes come off 
Let's get open, cause a commotion 
Still goin', eight in the mornin' 
There's no stoppin', we keep it poppin' 
Hot rockin', everyone's talkin' 
Give all you got, just hit the spot 
Gonna get my girls, get your boys 
Gonna make some noise 
Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly 
Get it fired up in a hurry 
Wanna get dirty

Sweat dripping over my body 
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival 
It's the one you've been waitin' on 
Get up, get it up, yup that's what's up 
Givin' just what you love to the maximum 
Uh oh, here we go 
What to do when the music starts to drop 
That's when we take it to the parking lot 
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops 
Uh oh, here we go 
Yo, hot damn, Doc and Jam like a summer show 
I keep my car lookin' like a crash dummy drove 
My gear look like the bank got my money froze 
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll 
Doc the one that excite ya divas 
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up 
Yo Christina, better hop in here 
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair 
The club is packed, the bar is filled 
I'm waitin' for sister to act, like Lauryn Hill 
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals 
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels 
Throw it up 
Baby it's Brick City, you heard of that 
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac 
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in 
It's like I'm Odb, the way I'm 
Gonna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly 
Get it fired up in a hurry 
Wanna get dirty 
It's about time that I came to start the party 
Sweat drippin' over my body 
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty 
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival 
Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly 
Get it fired up in a hurry

Maybe I waited too long

I have travelled the world 
There's no other girl like you 
No one, what's your history? 
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on? 
'Cause I heard you do, mmh 
I could fall or I could fly 
Here in your aeroplane 
And I could live, I could die

Hanging on the words you say 
And I've been known to give my all 
Sitting back, looking at 
Every mess that I made 
So don't call me baby

There's no need to be afraid 
At christmas time we let in light and banish shade 
And in our world of plenty 
We can spread a smile of joy 
Throw your arms around the world 
At christmas time 
But say a prayer 
Pray for the other ones 
At christmas time, it's hard, but while you're having fun 
There's a world outside your window 
And it's a world of dread and fear 
Where a kiss of love can kill you 
And there's death in every tear 
And the christmas bells that ring there 
Are the clanging chimes of doom 
Well, tonight we're reaching out and touching you 
No peace and joy this christmas to west africa 
A song of hope and there's no hope tonight, ooh 
Why is coming first to be feared? 
Why is to touch to be scared? 
How can they know it's christmas time at all? 
Here's to you 
Raise a glass to everyone 
Here's to them 
And all their years to come 
How they know it's christmas time at all? 
Feed the world, let them know it's christmas time again 
Feel the world, let them know it's christmas time again 
Heal the world, let them know it's christmas time again 
Feed the world, let them know it's christmas time again 
Feel the world, let them know it's christmas time again 
Heal the world, let them know it's christmas time again 
Feed the world, let them know it's christmas time again

            <field name="lyrics">I met this girl late last year 
She said don't you worry if I disappear 
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake 
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait 
But then I jump right in 
A week later return 
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn 
But I gave her my time for two or three nights 
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right 
I went away for months until our paths crossed again 
She told me I was never looking for a friend 
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10 
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin 
We'll be in between the sheets until the late Am 
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said 
She's singing 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe 
For a couple weeks I 
Only want to see her 
We drink away the days with a take away pizza 
Before a text message was the only way to reach her 
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her 
Singing out Aretha 
All over the track like a feature 
Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either 
But me and her we make money the same way 
Four cities, two planes the same day 
Those shows have never been what it's about 
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out 
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch 
But we should get on a plane 
Or we'll be missing it now 
Wish I'd have written it down 
The way that things played out 
When she was kissing him 
How I was confused about 
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe 
*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door 
I don't even know if she knows what for 
She was crying on my shoulder 
I already told ya 
Trust and respect is what we do this for 
I never intended to be next 
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all 
And I never saw him as a threat 
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course 
It's not like we were both on tour 
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor 
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment 
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different 
This is not the way you realize what you wanted 
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest 
All this time God knows I'm singing 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe</field>

Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin' 
On a back block you may catch the boss 
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off 
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey 
No prom date, women they would love to hate me 
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch 
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this 
See it my way or see me at the top 
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock 
Microphone check, microphone check

But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now 
Wish I'd have written it down 
The way that things played out 
When she was kissing him 
How I was confused about 
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe 
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door 
I don't even know if she knows what for 
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya 
Trust and respect is what we do this for 
I never intended to be next 
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all 
And I never saw him as a threat 
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course 
It's not like we were both on tour 
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor 
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment 
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different 
This is not the way you realised what you wanted 
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest 
And all this time, God knows I'm singing 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows

            <field name="lyrics">I met this girl late last year 
She said don't you worry if I disappear 
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake 
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait 
But then I jump right in 
A week later return 
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn 
But I gave her my time for two or three nights 
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right 
I went away for months until our paths crossed again 
She told me I was never looking for a friend 
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10 
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin 
We'll be in between the sheets until the late AM 
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said 
She's singing 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my arm 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Ah-la-la-la-la 
Don't fuck with my love 
I told her she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe 
For a couple weeks I 
Only want to see her 
We drink away the days with a take away pizza 
Before a text message was the only way to reach her 
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her 
Singing out Aretha 
All over the track like a feature 
Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either 
But me and her we make money the same way 
Four cities, two planes the same day 
Those shows have never been what it's about 
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out 
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch 
But we should get on a plane 
Or we'll be missing it now 
Wish I'd have written it down

            <field name="lyrics">I'm in so deep 
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real 
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it 
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill 
Keeping my head above water 
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner 
So I move with the force of a sorcerer 
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow 
And I'm parro, running out of ammo 
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow 
The less then the better 
More proof for the last one left 
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella 
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever? 
How can I be at my best with this pressure? 
I've got a lot to lose 
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror 
No wonder I'm under stress 
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds 
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave 
And invited more than a hundred guests 
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence 
It seems when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda 
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back 
Back to 15, [?] 
I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat 
OO, you can drag me in the deep ends 
OO, but you will never drown me out 
OO, you can drag me in the deep ends 
OO, but you will never drown me out, out, out 
You won't drown me out, out, out 
You won't drown me out 
You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low 
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone 
I've never seen someone drown without 
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs 
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch 
Do I sound like I'm choking? 
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating 
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean 
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining 
Plain sailing, no commotion 
Like a dolphin when it's in motion 
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken? 
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion 
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open 
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon 
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you 
Arm for arm, eye for eye 
I just want to live my life 
But they don't want to see this guy survive 
OO, you can drag me in the deep ends 
OO, but you will never drown me out 
OO, you can drag me in the deep ends 
OO, but you will never drown me out, out, out 
You won't drown me out, out, out 
You won't drown me out</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I wanna be drunk when I wake up, 
On the right side of the wrong bed, 
And never an excuse that I made up, 
Tell you the truth I hate, 
What didn't kill me, 
It never made me stronger at all, 
Love will scar your makeup 
Lip sticks to me, so now I'll maybe leave back there 
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober, 
I know I'll never hold you like I used to 
But the house gets cold when you cut the heating, 
Without you to hold I'll be freezing, 
Can't rely on my heart to beat it 
'Cause you take part of it every evening, 
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing, 
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?' 
Should I? Should I? 
Maybe I'll get drunk, again 
I'll be drunk, again, 
I'll be drunk, again 
To feel a little love 
I wanna hold your heart in both hands, 
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can, 
And I've got no plans for the weekend, 
So shall we speak then? Keep it between friends? 
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to 
There may be other people like us, 
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light us, 
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before 
You don't hold me anymore 
On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's name 
I know I can't heal things with a handshake 
You know I can't change, as I began saying 
You cut me wide open like a landscape 
Open bottles of beer but never champagne 
I'm here to applaud you with the sound that my hands make 
Should I? Should I? 
Maybe I'll get drunk, again 
I'll be drunk, again, 
I'll be drunk, again 
To feel a little love 
All by myself 
I'm here again 
All by myself 
You know I'll never change 
All by myself 
All by myself 
I'm just drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
To feel a little love</field>

I'm the new Sinatra 
And since I made it here

(Yeah they love me everywhere) 
I used to cop in Harlem 
All of my Dominicanos (Hey yo) 
Right there off of Broadway 
Brought me back to that McDonalds 
Took it to my stash spot 
560 State Street 
Catch me in the kitchen like Simmons whipping Pastry 
Cruising down 8th street 
Off-white Lexus 
Driving so slow 
(but BK, it's from Texas!) 
Me I'm out that BedStuy 
Home of that boy Biggie 
now I live on Billboard 
and I brought my boys with me 
Say what up to Ta-ta 
Still sipping Mai Tais 
Sitting courtside 
Knicks and Nets give me high-5 
N**ga, I be Spiked out 
I could trip a referee 
tell by my attitude that I'm MOST DEFINITELY FROM

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

but I got a gang of n-ggas 
walking with my clique though 
welcome to the melting pot 
corners where we selling rocks 
Afrika bambaataa sh-t 
home of the hip hop

they forgot how to act 
8 million stories out there and they're naked 
city it's a pity 
half of y'all won't make it

If Jeezy's payin LeBron

Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York 
Welcome to the bright light 
Lights is blinding 
girls need blinders 
so they can step out of bounds quick 
the side lines is blind with casualties 
who sip the lite casually 
then gradually become worse 
don't bite the apple Eve 
caught up in the in crowd 
now you're in-style 
and in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out 
the city of sin is a pity on a whim 
good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them 
Mommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out 
everybody ride her, just like a bus route 
Hail Mary to the city your a Virgin 
and Jesus can't save you 
life starts when the church ends 
came here for school, graduated to the high life 
ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight 
MDMA got you feeling like a champion 
the city never sleeps better slip you a Ambien 
New York! 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

Now you're in New York! 
These streets will make you feel brand new

Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York 
One hand in the air for the big city 
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty

Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeaahh

By the Tennessee skyline 
They told me 
I'd find my hopes and my dreams 
But I long to be in the bed of my true love 
Back where I came from 
She's waiting for me 
So I'll make my way 
Through long, winding country roads 
But my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose 
I told my dad 
On the phone, "It's amazing" 
From the straight to the crazy 
These places I've seen 
But I long to be 
In the arms of my true love 
Like he loves my mother 
He understands me 
I spend my days just traveling and playing shows 
But my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose 
I met a man 
In a bar down in Memphis 
He told me he went there to follow his dreams 
And he told me, "son, you know I lost my true love 
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea" 
And I found truth in people I barely know 
But my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose 
My heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose 
My heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose</field>

I've lost that state of mind 
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house 
But stopped at the age of nine 
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride 
The paving stones I played upon 
They kept me on the grind 
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life 
Friends and family filled with envy 
When they should be filled with pride 
And when the world's against me 
Is when I really come alive 
And every day that Satan tempts me 
I try to take it in my stride 
You know that I've got whisky 
With white lies and smoke in my lungs 
I think life has got to the point 
I know without it's no fun 
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up 
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become 
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me 
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree 
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
Showed me the locked doors 
I find another use for the key 
And you'll see 
I'm well aware of certain things 
That can destroy a man like me 
But with that said give me one more, higher 
Another one to take the sting away 
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day 
And I'll find comfort in my pain 
Eraser 
I used to think that nothing could be better 
Than touring the world with my songs 
I chased the picture perfect life 
I think they painted it wrong 
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell 
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well 
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps 
Because you're living your dream 
Man, this shit should be fun 
Please know that I'm not trying to preach 
Like I'm Reverend Run 
I beg you, don't be disappointed 
With the man I've become 
Our conversations with my father on the A14 
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams 
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me 
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans 
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou 
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud 
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed 
The world may be filled with hate 
But keep erasing it now 
Somehow 
I'm well aware of certain things 
That will befall a man like me 
But with that said give me one more, higher 
Another one to take the sting away 
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror 
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner 
The industry told me to look like them 
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner 
I wish that she could have been my first time 
And I wish that I'd never took that first line 
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed 
But forgive me if it doesn't 
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin 
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't 
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high 
And my face feels buzzin' 
And the taste stays underneath my tongue, and 
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngling 
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school 
And missed every single party 
With that hardly matters now, man, does it? 
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it 
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget 
But while we're on the subject 
I wish my private life would have never gone public 
But that's the sacrifice that we make 
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away 
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here 
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear 
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care 
I wanna see you sing it 
Put your hands in the air, one wish 
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here 
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear 
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care 
I wanna see you sing it 
Put your hands in the air, one wish 
I wish my family and friends, they stay healthy 
I wish that love was a currency 
And the whole world was wealthy 
I found myself late night wishin' on a star 
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh 
And I wish I'd never run through 
Every woman that I loved that kept my life 
And what it's come to 
I wish I was the role model you looked up to 
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, "Fuck you" 
I wish I was home more 
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays 
But yo, we're on tour 
And I wish I'd grow more, wish I told more 
People that I love 'em but 
It's in the music that I'm known for 
And I wish he never got cancer 
And if I smoke a pack a day 
Well, does that make me a wanker? 
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause 
Every day this shit gets the best of us 
Usin' my balance on razor blades 
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait 
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here 
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear 
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care 
I wanna see you sing it 
Put your hands in the air, one wish 
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here 
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear 
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care 
I wanna see you sing it 
Put your hands in the air, one wish 
I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold 
Mum sayin', "Don't smoke, " no, I don't listen 
I got love for a ghost note 
Shows on the gold coast 
People that I don't know share the same vision 
I find truth in the hard times 
And words that aren't mine 
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign 
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme 
Starin' at my notepad quick 
I'm tryin' to find mine 
Shit quick before I hit it again 
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men 
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen 
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again 
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick 
My daddy told me 
"Work hard and you can never be shit" 
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad 
Set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had 
One wish</field>

So don't wipe your eyes 
Tears remind you you're alive 
It's alright to die 
Cause that's the only thing you haven't tried 
But just for tonight 
Hold on 
So live life like you're giving up 
Cause you act like you are 
Go ahead and just live it up 
Go on and tear me apart 
It's alright to shake 
Even my hand does sometimes 
So inside we'll rage 
Against the dying of the light 
It is alright to say 
That death's the only thing you haven't 
tried 
But just for today 
Hold on 
So live life like you're giving up 
Cause you act like you are 
Go ahead and just live it up 
Go on and tear me apart

Is I know something now 
Know something now I didn't before 
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago 
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile 
In the back of my mind making me feel right 
I just want to know you better know 
You better know you better now 
I just want to know you better know 
You better know you better now 
I just want to know you better know 
You better know you better now 
I just want to know you know you know you 
Cause all I know is we said hello 
And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed 
All I know is we held the door 
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed 
And all my walls stood tall painted blue 
But I'll take them down 
Take them down and open up the door for you 
And all I feel in my stomach 
Is butterflies the beautiful kind 
Making up for lost time, taking flight 
Making me feel right 
I just want to know you better know 
You better know you better now 
I just want to know you better know 
You better know you better now 
I just want to know you better know 
You better know you better now 
I just want to know you know you know you 
Cause all I know is we said hello 
And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed 
All I know is we held the door 
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed 
Come back and tell me why 
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time 
And meet me there tonight 
And let me know that it's not all in my mind 
I just want to know you better know 
You better know you better now 
I just want to know you know you know you 
Cause all I know is we said hello 
And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed 
All I know is we held the door 
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed 
All I know is we said hello 
So dust off your highest hopes 
All I know is pouring rain 
And everything has changed 
All I know is a newfound brightness 
All my days, I'll know your face 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed</field>

I was just lonely 
And everybody falls apart sometimes 
I know you found another one 
Won't you just hold me tonight? 
I wish I never called you up 
But nobody told me 
They don't know we don't speak anymore 
So take a good look at us 
Won't you just hold me tonight? 
And I will stop trying to fall in love again 
And keep it a secret, it never works out anyway 
But I'm not anything like it was 
Cause you were the only one for me 
Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend 
In one night, if that's alright 
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind 
And your life, too many times 
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely 
Darling you are my only love 
Behind my truth 
Lies everything you are 
I never meant to sleep around 
I was just lonely 
And you did the same 
Again and again and again 
I know 
So here's to the both of us 
Here's to our story tonight 
And I will stop trying to fall in love again 
And keep it a secret, it never works out anyway 
But I'm not anything like it was 
Cause you were the only one for me 
Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend

Darling you are my only love 
Behind my truth 
Lies everything you are 
When I see my future, it is with you 
We'll get there 
I want my children to be with you 
We'll get there 
Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend 
In one night, if that's alright

But this place'll stay the same 
And I'll know 
When I'll go 
Yeah 
And I'm pickin' up another bag 
And I pack another knapsack 
The airport's like a stop light to me 
Sittin' on red, green light go 
Can't see my family 
My family grew into a global trance 
Or fans, some may call 'em 
And it's on the stage I stand 
To jam, rock, sing *no wakin' up to stop the dream 
I lived the life, signed a picture 
Cuz no dam could stop the stream 
Or flood gates, I'm in a fucked race 
And a pocket fulla culture condoms 
They put you on the podium for first place 
But on the block, they judge you on 'em 
So 
Who got the South in a six pack 
And a shotgun just for show? 
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth 
Put the hood in mossy oak 
I'm the 
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life 
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's right 
With a broken pen, there they go again 
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin jam 
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin in 
I'm goin home, I'm home again 
Bring it back up in the Uk 
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack 
Catfish Billy, hell, you say 
I'm just bein' blunt, homie 
Keep the grass 
You changed me 
Into what I am now 
You made me 
It was something I was always gonna be 
It seems these broken dreams don't lie 
And so now my broken wings will fly 
Yeah, take one look 
Better yet, take two 
But if I take that break, there's a move you made 
This dude you shape will come take you back 
Back to the roots I've been 
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in 
Or a spot to sleep in 
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season 
Cuz I am not the reason 
That the image you're used to seein' 
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless 
Meaning yes, I'm different 
Differently made 
And me screamin' the A 
Is not the difference in grades 
It's the place I stayed 
Cuz the schools were underpaid 
The teachers taught, but to me they fought 
A star that was underway 
It was under Wayne, it was in my name 
Michael 
M 
W 
A 
Atha 
And in trouble I stayed 
Breakin out of this bubble they made 
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven 
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet 
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand 
Committed to the words I say 
A blood line's not a family tree 
It's a needle in my skin for all to see 
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk 
But I drink and take the ink 
You changed me 
Into what I am now 
You made me 
It was something I was always gonna be 
It seems these broken dreams don't lie 
And so now my broken wings will fly</field>

Tell me that there's no were left to land 
and I'll fall down 
Catch me with the strength of your own hands 
and I'll fall down 
Oh I need you, without you I'll fall apart 
and last winter, I need you to feed my heart 
But all the night 
Sky blue 
Stars are bright 
Shine through 
Like you 
And I'm far away from home 
Tell me that there's no were left to land

            <field name="lyrics">Hmm let me go, 
To see my family. 
Please Father let me go, 
As my mother sleeps. 
I don't know about days gone, 
But round here nobody lives twice. 
When your gone, your gone, without no bye, 
Because only a judge can give you life. 
This is my advice, 
Trust me, I nearly lost my life. 
3 weeks after I got this rhyme, 
It seems like I had too much wine. 
Which that I I didn't get one, 
Anyway, I was going to the ? booked for a set, 
Even though I didn't have a set one. 
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one. 
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one. 
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination, 
Then I was off to the next one, 
20 minutes later I was on the M1, 
Tired. 
But I kept on going, 
Fell asleep without even knowing. 
No motion in my face, 
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going. 
Woke up, 
Lorry, 
Flash, 
Panic, 
Break, 
Skid, 
Crash, 
Skidded, 
More, 
Bang, 
Smash, 
Out, 
Cold, 
Ribs, 
Cracked, 
Ouch. 
I was in so much pain, 
Crawled out of a Megan that now looked like a Mini, 
When I was still on the first lane. 
Baffled, didn't even know my name. 
Fainted, too much shock in my brain. 
Surrounded by paramedics and feds, 
Trying to get up but fainted again. 
I just want you to take a second, hear me out. 
Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out. 
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared, 
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go, 
To see my family, 
And keep it inside, 
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps. 
Save my soul, 
Please Father let me go. 
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps. 
Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open, 
I can hear voices and my phone ringing. 
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning, 
One of the worst situations I've been in. 
I can hear all of the angels singing. 
But when it stopped humming, 
My brain turned on, stared running. 
Still in pain, but it started numbing, 
the stone cold comeback I made was stunning. 
I still tried to do a few shows cuz I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming. 
But I was left with a permanent problem, 
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside). 
Ever so cunning, 
6 weeks later, jogging and running. 
I used the first air kit like a drum set, 
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming. 
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes, 
You can't afford to let one in. 
Never done dream for a while, 
The black plan was blocked, 
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing. 
They say tomorrow never dies, 
But he forgot to tell you 'you can'. 
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang, 
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam. 
You can try beg for another, 
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show, 
Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother', 
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner. 
I just want you to take a second, hear me out. 
Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out. 
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared. 
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go, 
To see my family. 
And keep it inside, 
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps. 
Save my soul.</field>

Burning fires in this room 
It just fits 
Light and smooth 
Like my feet in my shoes 
Little one, lie with me 
Sew you heart to my sleeve 
We'll stay quiet 
Underneath shooting stars 
If it helps you sleep 
And hold me tight 
Don't let me breathe 
Feeling like 
You won't believe 
There's a firefly 
Loose tonight 
Better catch it 
Before it burns this place down 
And I lie 
If I don't feel so right 
But the world looks better 
Through your eyes 
Teach my skin 
Those new tricks 
Warm me up 
With your lips 
Heart to heart 
Melt me down 
It's too cold 
In this town 
Close your eyes 
Lean on me 
Face to mouth 
Lips to cheek 
Feeling numb 
In my feet 
You're the one 
To help me 
Get to sleep 
And hold me tight 
Don't let me breathe

Better catch it

            <field name="lyrics">She played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
I met her on Grafton street 
Right outside of the bar 
She shared a cigarette with me 
While her brother played the guitar 
She asked me what does it mean 
The Gaelic ink on your arm? 
Said it was one of my friend's songs 
Do you want to drink on? 
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun 
She got Arthur on the table with 
Johnny riding a shotgun 
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar 
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance 
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
With my pretty little Galway Girl 
You're my pretty little Galway Girl 
You know she beat me at darts 
And then she beat me at pool 
And then she kissed me 
Like there was nobody else in the room 
As last orders were called 
Was when she stood on the stool 
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes 
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet 
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat 
Oh, I could have that voice 
Playing on repeat for a week 
And in this packed out room 
Swear she was singing to me 
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
My pretty little Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
And now we've outstayed our welcome 
And it's closing time 
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine 
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine 
As we fill up our lungs 
With the cold air of the night 
I walked her home then she took me inside 
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine 
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write 
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night 
She played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
My pretty little Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl</field>

But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
I met her on Grafton street 
Right outside of the bar 
She shared a cigarette with me 
While her brother played the guitar 
She asked me what does it mean 
The Gaelic ink on your arm? 
Said it was one of my friend's songs 
Do you want to drink on? 
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun 
She got Arthur on the table with 
Johnny riding a shotgun 
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar 
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance 
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
With my pretty little Galway Girl 
You're my pretty little Galway Girl 
You know she beat me at darts 
And then she beat me at pool 
And then she kissed me 
Like there was nobody else in the room 
As last orders were called 
Was when she stood on the stool 
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes 
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet 
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat 
Oh, I could have that voice 
Playing on repeat for a week 
And in this packed out room 
Swear she was singing to me 
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" 
My pretty little Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

'Cause lately I've been waking up alone 
Pain splattered teardrops on my shirt 
Told you I'd let them go 
And I'll fight my corner 
Maybe tonight I'll call ya 
After my blood turns into alcohol 
No I just wanna hold ya 
Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out 
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around 
All I want is the taste that your lips allow 
My my, my my oh give me love 
My my, my my oh give me love 
My my, my my give me love 
Give me love like never before 
'Cause lately I've been craving more 
And it's been a while but I still feel the same 
Maybe I should let you go 
You know I'll fight my corner 
And that tonight I'll call ya 
After my blood, is drowning in alcohol 
No I just wanna hold ya 
Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out 
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around 
All I want is the taste that your lips allow 
My my, my my, oh give me love 
Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out 
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around

As youth we used to play games 
like Hide and Seek and Simon Says 
and then we realized 
we? are not mice, we? re men 
and that was kinda dead 
For one more time, let? Is play Simon Says 
But this time, it? s not Simon, cause Simon? s Ed 
Give me love like it meant life or death 
like it meant your final breathe, yeah 
Give me love like you could buy it from the corner shop 
You could spend your time 
so it don? t matter if you? re poor or not 
Give me that real love 
Something you could feel, love 
Maybe it could heal ya 
Just like the first time you said it 
Give me love 
Because hate is the worst kind of weapon 
It?Is like I finally see the person in my reflection</field>

I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eyes 
She left a note "I'll be back in 5" 
Well, I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive, hey 
I was told to put my job in front of you 
But it won't hold me like you do 
But I do it for the love 
Waiting on the gold rush 
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up 
When I see my friends 
All they say is hold up 
And remember the time 
When we were in school 
Listening to grown ups, didn't learn a thing 
But then again you know what? 
You know how to sing 
But you don't know anything other than that 
So maybe you should learn to love her 
Like, like the way 
Maybe you should learn to love her 
Like, like the way 
Maybe you should learn to love her 
Like, like the way 
And maybe you should learn to love her 
Like, like the way 
You want to be loved 
I never told her that I liked 
They way she dances slightly out of time 
And pretends she knows the words 
To a song she's never heard 
But I tell her all the time, hey 
I was told to put my job in front of you 
But it won't hold me like you do 
But I do it for the love 
Waiting on the gold rush 
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up 
When I see my friends

            <field name="lyrics">Hey, can you hear me 
I just wanted to let you know hmm 
I hope you can hear what I write to you 
how could I say goodbye to you 
when I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life 
that was inside of you 
I gotta respect the way you provided food, 
for the whole fam 
you came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man, 
cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels plus racists full of 
hatred in your own plant , 
3 jobs in a day , 
rest in life in you working but you were never stressed free 
just locked in a cage slaving , they said they were 
gold in the pavements but you came and saw the road to 
amazement , broke your heart but still you were prone 
to last and your sorrow was over fast 
I hope your listening right , 
I still think of you every Sunday no 
one can top your chicken and rice, 
even through the darkness times 
you held us all up cause your vision was 
bright I knew your strength was your wisdom inside , 
you never let anyone see your heartache 
you just got on with it , 
anyone tells me that they knew you said 
you were beautiful and your words you would stand 
strong with it 
Cause they were like warmth on a winter 
night but I was just too young to go on with it and 
there something's I could try to do but it's an 
impossible task for me to even try and say goodbye to 
you , I couldn't do that , I owe my life to you. 
And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign I 
hope this pain will heal in time 
you know I never want to be alone ohh 
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and 
will you think of me up there, can I say goodbye to you? 
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
or feel the chill of your warm embrace. 
Can I say goodbye to you ohh 
I think you phoney I was younger with the knowledge of 
things that I know now I would be by your side when you 
needed me instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out' 
standing in a road with the gangs that I know now , 
everyone's missing you loads , Jessica's grown up , 
warren Lauren and Alex are fine and imp living with 
hope , it's been a while since I've seen V and the 
mouths I miss seeing and being a family and us agreeing 
with smiles how it used to be as a child but as time 
goes by the bridge seems longer family problems have 
never been funny , in my heart the only one that dissed 
me was Sonia she took all our inheritance money , left 
the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
i never forgive 
the way she betrayed us , there ent a big enough reason 
before I sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing , 
but I guess that everyone's different or should I say 
no one's perfect she had happiness in front of her but 
chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing  
Since you 
gone the foundations crumbled so building it back up is 
my next step I got all the bricks and the cement but 
it's hard when it's done I don't know what to expect, 
so give me the strength that I need to perform this 
task make it right I must do and I ask cause I trust 
you it goes way beyond a song when I say I love you. 
And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign I 
hope this pain will heal in time 
you know I never want to be alone ohh 
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and 
will you think of me up there, can I say goodbye to you? 
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
or feel the chill of your warm embrace. 
Can I say goodbye to you? 
It's just for now so I should hush I'll never get 
enough I'll see you when I see you but I miss you 
ohh how I miss you, It's just for now so I should hush 
I'll never get enough I'll see you when I see you but I 
miss you ohh how I miss you. 
there ain't enough words to describe how sorry I am for 
the pain that I caused sorry for when I stuck up my 
own blood we were young he said I was rape and he broad 
and for the day police came to the door , I'm sorry for 
being such a bad youth stealing from your purse and 
making you mourn , I never been able to say this 
before cause I've was so inconsiderate you love me 
unconditionally and I took advantage of it like a idiot 
not seeing the pure soul that I was living with I 
really hope that you can forgive me , you going away 
was a punishment but I won't let go I'm holding you 
with me but I still fight the emotions within me 
You see the stars as the cold wind greets the air and 
will you think of me up there can I say goodbye to you? 
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face 
feel the chill of your warm embrace 
Can I say goodbye to you? 
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and 
will you think of me up there? 
Can I say goodbye to you? 
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face or 
feel the chill of your warm embrace. 
Can I say goodbye to you?</field>

My heart is a foreigner 
My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset 
I'll never keep it bottled up 
And left to the hands of the coroner 
Be a true heart not a follower 
We're not done yet 
And I see it in your movements tonight 
If we should ever do this right 
I'm never gonna let you down 
I'll never let you down 
And I'm keeping on the down low 
And I'll keep you around so I'll know 
That I'll never let you down 
I'll never let you down 
You're strumming on my heart strings 
Like you were a grade 8 
But I've never felt this way 
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground 
And never ever let you down, now 
You're strumming on my heart strings 
Like you were a grade 8 
But I never felt this way 
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground 
And never ever let you down, now 
My eyes are a river filler 
This drink is a liver killer 
My chest is a pillow 
For your weary head to lay to rest again 
Your body is my ballpoint pen 
And your mind is my new best friend 
Your eyes are the mirror 
To take me to the edge again, now 
And I see it in your movements tonight 
If we should ever do this right 
I'm never gonna let you down 
I'll never let you down

Just to trip straight back in 
Times like this don't come round here 
And chances are slim

Love stole my sympathy 
When she belonged to him 
But now I will feel the soft touch of her lips again 
But chances are slim 
But eventually 
You'll be mine 
I won't miss a thing 
If you're mine 
I don't care if you're lost 
Cause in our hearts we both know that 
We both know that 
All I see, is you 
And I miss this 
And we cant see this through 
We can't fix this 
Love 
It wont grow back 
She said its time for a quick cigarette by the bike shed 
She asked me if I'd regret it all and I said 
I replied no love this about as far as it goes 
See me going by the thought of you and it shows 
She said you weren't even listening 
I might be too much right now man it's sickening 
Can't believe I'm running from her 
I'm stranded, her beauty is too much to bear 
And oh, I think I want her 
And oh, I swear she's never been deep in before 
And oh, I think I need her 
I can't tell her I want her its not right in summer 
I think that I need her 
I won't miss one thing 
If you're mine 
I don't care if you're lost

That David played and it pleased the Lord 
But you don't really care for music do ya 
Well it goes like this the fourth the fifth 
The minor fall and the major lift 
The baffled king composing hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof 
You saw her bathing on the roof 
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya 
She tied you to her kitchen chair 
She broke your throne and she cut your hair 
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
Baby I've been here before 
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor 
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya 
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch 
And love is not a victory march 
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
Well there was a time when you let me know 
What's really going on below 
But now you never show that to me do you 
But remember when I moved in you 
And the holy dove was moving too 
And every breath we drew was hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
Well maybe there's a god above 
But all I've ever learned from love 
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya 
And it's not a cry that you hear at night 
It's not somebody who's seen the light 
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
Hallelujah

Down from his hill on high 
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles 
He rode to a woman's sigh 
For she was his secret treasure 
She was his shame and his bliss 
And a chain and a keep are nothing 
Compared to a woman's kiss 
For hands of gold are always cold 
But a woman's hands are warm 
For hands of gold are always cold 
But a woman's hands are warm</field>

I saw you in another's arms 
Only a month we've been apart 
You look happier 
Saw you walk inside a bar 
He said something to make you laugh 
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours 
Yeah, you look happier, you do 
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you 
But ain't nobody love you like I do 
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby 
If you're moving on with someone new 
'Cause baby you look happier, you do 
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too 
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth 
But I know I was happier with you 
Sat on the corner of the room 
Everything's reminding me of you 
Nursing an empty bottle 
And telling myself you're happier 
Aren't you? 
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you 
But ain't nobody need you like I do 
I know that there's others that deserve you 
But my darling, I am still in love with you 
But I guess you look happier, you do 
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too 
I could try to smile to hide the truth 
But I know I was happier with you 
Baby, you look happier, you do 
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new 
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do 
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you</field>

Took my heart upon a one way trip 
Guess she went wandering off with it 
None like most women I know 
This one will bring it back whole 
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead 
Oh my baby, lately I know 
That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love, aren't we? 
Hands in your hair 
Fingers and thumbs, baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near 
Love the way that you conquer your fear 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah 
She is the river flowin' Orwell 
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells 
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs 
Spend my summertime beside her 
And the rest of the year the same 
She is the flint that sparks the lighter 
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh 
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my 
All this, all this I know 
But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love, aren't we? 
Hands in your hair 
Fingers and thumbs, baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near 
Love the way that you conquer your fear 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah 
Well, I've found love inside 
The arms of the woman I know 
She is the lighthouse in the night 
That will safely guide me home 
And I'm not scared of passing over 
Or the thought of growing old 
'Cause from now until I go 
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love, aren't we? 
Hands in your hair 
Fingers and thumbs, baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near 
Love the way that you conquer your fear 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah, yeah 
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love, aren't we? 
Hands in your hair 
Fingers and thumbs, baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near 
Love the way that you conquer your fear 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah</field>

Even my dad does sometimes 
So don't wipe your eyes 
Tears remind you you're alive

Hold on 
So live life like you're giving up 
'Cause you act like you are 
Go ahead and just live it up 
Go on and tear me apart 
It's alright to shake 
Even my hand does sometimes 
So inside we'll rage 
Against the dying of the light 
It's alright to say 
That that's the only thing you haven't tried 
But just for today 
Hold on

Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors 
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur 
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt 
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides 
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time 
Highbury estate's fine 
Smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines 
I haven't slept for the past week 
Two hours ain't enough for me 
I feel inspired at quarter to three am 
I haven't changed since our last meet 
I'm still getting all my meals for free 
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again 
It's not a homeless life for me 
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be 
And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my Ipod 
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up 
Driver turns the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on 
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong 
Truth be, never went to Uni 
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see 
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22, done 
Everything I need to except get a 2:1 
I haven't slept for the past week 
Two hours ain't enough for me 
I feel inspired at quarter to three am 
I haven't changed since our last meet 
I'm still getting all my meals for free 
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again 
It's not a homeless life for me 
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be 
When I feel cold you keep me warm 
And I'm not looking for some loose changes 
Just wanna find a true mate 
Who wants to be my duvet 
It's not a homeless life for me 
It's just I'm home, less than I'd like to be</field>

You know that it's true 
I'm feeling younger 
Every time that I'm alone with you 
We were sitting in a parked car 
Stealing kisses in a front yard 
We got questions we shouldn't had asked but 
How would you feel 
If I told you I loved you 
It's just something that I want to do 
I'll be taking my time 
Spending my life 
Falling deeper in love with you 
So tell me that you love me too 
In the summer 
As the lilacs bloom 
Love flows deeper than a river 
Every moment that I spend with you 
We were sat upon our best friend's roof 
I had both of my arms around you 
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but 
How would you feel 
If I told you I loved you 
It's just something that I want to do 
I'll be taking my time 
Spending my life 
Falling deeper in love with you

And when I fell hard 
You took a step back 
Without me, without me, without me 
And he's long gone 
When he's next to me 
And I realize the blame is on me 
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in 
So shame on me now 
Flew me to places i'd never been 
Till you put me down oh 
I knew you were trouble when you walked in 
So shame on me now 
Flew me to places i'd never been 
Now i'm lying on the cold hard ground

The days that I had gone 
The note I wrote 
I wrapped up in a cigarette 
Burned away the memories 
I tried to forget 
But not yet 
Wishing my life away 
But these three words 
I have to say to you 
My baby blue 
You know it's true 
I love you 
I love you 
How can I tell you? 
I don't know what to say 
This chance that I won't miss 
But I miss you anyway 
I feel your pain 
It's turning me insane 
Thrown away 
I had to take the last train home 
But then you came 
Wishing my life away 
But these three words

So can you help me out? 
Things we try to do won't work 
So can you help me out? 
And say if you love somebody new 
So even in my mind it's true 
Cause I have fallen for you 
Say if you love somebody new 
See and I don't wanna take it to the get gate 
Where I came fly show 
I could have taken anyone there 
But I like the way she brushed her hair back 
I never trust, begin to realize 
How fast I would turn and I 
I was blind to all 
Yeah I saw all 
Say if you love somebody new 
So even in my mind it's true 
Cause I have fallen for you 
Say if you love somebody new 
So even in my mind it's true 
Cause I have fallen for you 
Say if you love somebody new 
Seeing this fake heart break 
And stomach ache has got me 
Acting like a pregnancy 
I never fell for you, you tripped me 
Cause even in my mind, in my mind 
I never fell for you, you tripped me 
In my mind it's true, in my mind now 
I never fell for you, you tripped me 
Even in my mind, in my mind 
I never fell for you, you tripped me

            <field name="lyrics">Oh, misty eye of the mountain below 
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls 
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke 
Keep watching over Durin's sons 
If this is to end in fire 
Then we should all burn together 
Watch the flames climb higher into the night 
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will 
Watch the flames burn on and on 
The mountainside 
And if we should die tonight 
Then we should all die together 
Raise a glass of wine for the last time 
Calling out father, oh 
Prepare as we will 
Watch the flames burn on and on 
The mountainside 
Desolation comes upon the sky 
Now I see fire 
Inside the mountains 
I see fire 
Burning the trees 
And I see fire 
Hollowing souls 
And I see fire 
Blood in the breeze 
And I hope that you remember me 
Oh, should my people fall then 
Surely I'll do the same 
Confined in mountain halls 
We got too close to the flame 
Calling out father, oh 
Hold fast and we will 
Watch the flames burn on and on 
The mountainside 
Desolation comes upon the sky 
Now I see fire 
Inside the mountains 
I see fire 
Burning the trees 
And I see fire 
Hollowing souls 
And I see fire 
Blood in the breeze 
And I hope that you remember me 
And if the night is burning 
I will cover my eyes 
For if the dark returns then 
My brothers will die 
And as the sky's falling down 
It crashed into this lonely town 
And with that shadow upon the ground 
I hear my people screaming out 
Now I see fire 
Inside the mountains 
I see fire 
Burning the trees 
And I see fire 
Hollowing souls 
And I see fire 
Blood in the breeze 
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning) 
(Fire) 
And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin) (fire) 
And I see fire (fire) 
And I see fire (burn on and on the mountainside)</field>

Inside out 
Searching for a sweet surrender 
But this is not the end 
I can't work it out, how? 
Going through the motions 
Going through us 
And though I've known it for the longest time 
And all of my hopes 
All of my words are all over written on the signs 
But you're my road walking me home 
Home, home 
See the flames inside my eyes 
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love 
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar 
But for tonight I wanna fall in love 
Put your faith in my stomach 
I messed up this time 
Late last night 
Drinking to suppress devotion 
With fingers intertwined 
I can't shake this feeling now 
We're going through the motions 
Hoping you'd stop 
And though I've only caused you pain 
You know all of my words 
Will always be low 
Of all the love we spoke 
When you're on my road walking me home 
Home, home, home 
See the flames inside my eyes 
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love 
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar 
But for tonight I wanna fall in love 
Put your faith in my stomach 
And for how long I loved my lover 
For how long I loved my lover 
And now, for how long, long I loved my lover 
Now, now, for how long, long I loved my lover 
Now now, for how long, long I loved my lover 
(And I feel loved) 
For how long, long I loved my lover 
For how long, long I loved my lover

For how long, long I loved my lover 
Now, now, for how long, long I loved my lover

Been too long my fear is 
Holding back the memories of your eyes 
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me 
All that's left is shattered hearts 
It's plain enough for us to see that 
You've got me 
You've got me 
We're just friends tangled up in loose ends 
I feel it coming around again 
Let me know where you let your heart go 
And I will just pretend 
That I have never felt this way 
Since you I have never felt this way 
Since you 
I feel strange 
Playing games 
It's no fuss 
I'm not in love 
Twisted tunes, a melody of spite 
If you give me the words then I might 
Let go unknown feelings 
Telling me that I cannot fight 
When you speak that shite 
Let go unknown feelings 
Telling me that 
You've got me 
You've got me 
We're just friends tangled up in loose ends 
I feel it coming around again

It's no fuss 
I'm not in love 
I lost it in your kiss, your lips, 
Sweetness, in your smile 
Your words make me whole 
But your scars demand a healer's touch

I'm glad I'm not you</field>

More than blue 
The words inside my head 
And I know that you're gone 
The cheeky smile 
Of jokes and laughs 
The memories of times 
We crossed the line 
The stepping stones 
Across my mind 
Washed away 
We all now feel so blind 
Missing you

There is no one compared with you

Cos you're trying to take this from me 
And it's something that I wanted so bad 
Cos you're the definition 
Of someone who has to ruin 
The best thing that I ever had 
Cos you're a jealous girl 
And all I can say is 
It's your fault but partially mine 
For losing hope 
For not treating you right 
But that will disappear in time 
All I gotta do is pass you by 
Never say what's wrong 
Whenever I say why? 
Standing in the corner 
Shadowed by the light 
To you I seem much smaller 
But I know it might be you 
How much better could I do 
To be myself, not someone else? 
I'm losing sleep 
I live only for the week 
I've grown to ignore you 
Cos when I seem to bore you 
You pretend that you're not interested 
Your eyes start to twinkle 
Your smile starts to widen 
And I just seem to try and forget 
But you pay me no attention 
Even though I do 
But I don't care as long as you're mine 
It's happening every time 
All I gotta do is pass you by 
Never say what's wrong 
Whenever I say why? 
Standing in the corner 
Shadowed by the light 
To you I seem much smaller 
But I know it might be you 
How much better could I do 
To be myself, not someone else? 
I'm losing sleep 
I live only for the week 
And I'm falling harder now it seems 
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams 
And I can't sleep although I think I can 
It's insomnia I think I have 
But who cares when I'm not your man? 
Standing in the corner 
Shadowed by the light 
To you I seem much smaller 
But I know it might be you 
How much better could I do 
To be myself, not someone else? 
I'm losing sleep 
I live only for the week</field>

I can live without heart, without love 
But I do need a name 
Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire? 
Does your head spin with rage 
when fooled by the liars? 
King of the kings do you feel any pain? 
Do you feel any pain? 
Do you feel any pain?</field>

Cover me up 
Cuddle me in 
Lie down with me 
And hold me in your arms 
And your heart's against my chest 
Your lips pressed in my neck 
I'm falling for your eyes 
But they don't know me yet 
And with a feeling I'll forget 
I'm in love now 
Kiss me like you wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
This feels like falling in love 
Falling in love 
We're falling in love 
Settle down with me 
And I'll be your safety 
You'll be my lady 
I was made to keep your body warm 
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms 
And your heart's against my chest 
Your lips pressed in my neck 
I'm falling for your eyes 
But they don't know me yet 
And with a feeling I'll forget 
I'm in love now 
Kiss me like you wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
This feels like falling in love 
Falling in love 
We're falling in love 
Yeah I've been feeling everything 
From hate to love from love to lust 
From lust to truth I guess that's how I know you 
So I hold you close to help you give it up 
So kiss me like you wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
This feels like falling in love 
Falling in love 
We're falling in love 
Kiss me like you wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved

And cold air met me 
Lost a grip on my shoes 
Walked home in bare feet 
And I'll stay awake 
Till the morning greets me 
And I'll stay away, out 
Tonight, this day won't end 
The fire keep burning now 
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight 
I'm here again, the fire keeps burning now 
I'm never gonna leave here 
Let the dark cover me 
And hold me tight, 
Hear the words in my sleep 
Close your eyes for a second life within 
And I'll stay awake till the morning greets me 
And I'll stay away out, tonight 
This day won't end, the fire keeps burning out 
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight I'm here again 
The fire keeps burning out, 
I'm never gonna leave here 
Outside, in the winter, in the cold, I have not been asked where to go, and so, oh 
I am here alone, waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight 
And day, to end, the fire is burning now 
I ain't ever gonna leave here now, and I'm here again 
Oh, oh I ain't ever gonna leave here 
Tonight, I'm out to meet ya 
Tonight, I will feel no cold, 
Tonight, I'll ignore that my feet hurt 
And I'll be no more, without you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be 
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any 
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many 
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true 
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths 
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves 
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme 
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
Cause real recognise real is what my father says 
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away 
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow 
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 
5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire 
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require 
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed? 
It's D-E-V to the Zed 
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers 
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired 
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll 
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying 
Cause I got too much to stay awake for 
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war 
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line 
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines 
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by 
I never sleep 
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
It could be 
The times I'm living in 
I never sleep 
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
It could be 
The times I'm living in lately 
[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran] 
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth 
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those 
That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy 
Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be 
On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in 
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows 
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone 
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro 
Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow 
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework 
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older 
I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie 
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die) 
[Verse 4: Devlin] 
Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge 
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes 
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze 
Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move 
We scan the situation, analyse information 
And then decide what probably is most practical to do 
Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets 
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true 
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em 
We got the fans all like, "Oh wow it's Devs and Ed" 
What less did you bloody expect from 'em? " 
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock 
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got 
I keep my pupils engaged 
Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake 
I never sleep 
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
It could be 
The times I'm living in 
I never sleep 
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
It could be 
The times I'm living in lately</field>

Now 
I'm gonna paint you by numbers 
And colour you in 
If things go right 
We could frame it 
And put you on a wall 
And it's so hard to say it 
But I've been here before 
Now I'll surrender up my heart 
And swap it for yours 
I'm out of touch 
I'm out of love

We could nurse it, she said 
Come in side for a little lie down with me 
And if you fall asleep it wouldn't be the worst thing. 
But when I wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder 
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now 
And let me hold ya, ohh 
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth 
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do 
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet 
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon. 
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird. 
My little bird 
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew 
We can lay down, so I'm next you 
Come inside for a little home made tea 
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me 
And if I wake up, say it's late love get back to sleep 
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now 
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me 
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth 
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do 
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet 
'cause that leads to regret, diving into soon. 
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird 
My little bird 
My little bird 
My little bird 
And of all this thing I'm sure of, 
I'm not quite certain of your love 
You made me scream, but then I made you cry 
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die 
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth 
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do 
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet 
'cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.

            <field name="lyrics">(verse 1 - mikill pane) 
Listen 
Little lady, this is just the worst way to spend your birthday 
It's 30 degrees, thursday 
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes 
Lady the word 'rape' sums up events that take place every night 
You wanna get up but you no your legs will ache if you try 
and you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
You drag yourself to the mirror to check face then you cry 
Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
You'll make a trip to the whittington were they'll look at your jaw 
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
They'll know your fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
But young woman 
The pimp see's you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
Medical attention could be fatal 
'cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone thats getting dough for him 
'cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in 
(chorus - ed sheeran) 
She's just under the upper hand 
Goes mad for a couple grams 
and she don't wanna go outside, tonight. 
'cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
Sell love to another man 
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly. 
(verse 2 - mikill pane) 
Little lady, your mind you've made up 
Your injurys you can't hide with make-up 
You need some medical advice, you make up 
A little lie to say just 
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb 
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stiched your top lip 
Last year when your pimp just lost it 
He wouldn't recognise if you stared him in the face anyway 
'cos all the heroin is making you age 
But your a heroin for taking the strain of being a prostitue and punching bag 
The funds you have left go where your from using moneygram 
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
Little does she know your never coming back 
She put you in her brother's hand only for him to formulate another plan 
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state the summer fans 
See that you came to london to get pimped by your uncle, damn. 
(chorus - ed sheeran) 
She's just under the upper hand 
Goes mad for a couple grams 
and she don't wanna go outside, tonight. 
'cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
Sell love to another man 
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly 
Now an angel will die, covered in white 
With closed eyes and hoping for a better life 
This time, we'll fade out tonight, 
Straight down the line. 
(verse 3 - mikill pane) 
Little lady, your trembling with fear 
Your skinny frame kinda resembles the dear 
Your sitting facing the detective, oh dear 
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it, 
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused 
Your causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
The coppers trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you 
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, who you working for? 
He's talking to like your worth more than a dirty whore 
Your having a conversation you could be murdered for 
Your learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before 
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard 
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
Begs you to use it 
He's useless if your gonna be stupid 
'cos an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, your on your own 
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home 
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
And then a voice says 'where you been bitch? I wanna know.' 
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness 
You open the front door, he boots you in 
There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror 
Get your albibi straight, you could be killed for an error 
He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
At this point your life flashes before your eyes 
Your handbags dropped and all the contents are all over the floor 
Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye 
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece 
And dumps her body in the boot of his merc in the street. 
Little lady left this earth in the worst way 
All because she got a card on her 30th birthday 
(chorus - ed sheeran) 
and we're all under the upper hand 
and go mad for a couple grams 
and we don't wanna go outside, tonight. 
'cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
Sell love to another man 
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly.</field>

There wasn't much left 
Except for the last twenty sack 
And the last twenty of my last cheque 
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step 
Woke up and took it in with a half breath 
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick 
I lit my cigarette 
Feeling half dead, whisky on my mind 
Then came the dead 
Sherrif in the yard, here comes the rest 
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by 
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye 
Baby in her arms 
She took a cab home 
She told me I was only good for a sad song 
A crooked smile I gave 
Nonchalant about it 
Maybe she'll come back 
This time I doubt it 
Act like I care, but I really don't 
Wanted to change 
But somehow I knew I really won't 
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle 
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow 
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal 
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill 
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand 
God's not going to land another saving hand 
If the time came like it has time again 
Then I would watch the clock and be late again 
One gun and a harley in the driveway 
One way out, dirt road, pathway 
Put another dead butt in the ash tray 
I stand up still drunk, half baked 
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring 
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring 
Paid him no attention 
In fact I barely seen him 
Until he walked away 
And he started singing 
(Ed Sheeran) 
London Bridge is falling down, falling down 
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown 
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again 
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again 
(Yelawolf) 
I didn't see it coming 
I didn't see the wall 
And I went from running, to a slow crawl 
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry 
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie 
I speak no evil, but hear no angels 
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers 
Take the bible from the hotel drawer 
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door 
Knock knock 
I'm on the salt road non stop 
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot 
And the gust of a dry summer 
Dirty water in the tap 
I think I found my number in the sand 
Right next to an empty can 
Old number seven, Jack is back again 
And the voice goes round and round 
And I would take the bridge 
But I can't forget the sound 
(Ed Sheeran) 
London Bridge is falling down, falling down 
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown 
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again 
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again 
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down 
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground 
Running from the law but I can't be found 
Only my God can track me down 
(x4) 
And we'll crash, crash, right down again 
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again 
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down 
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground 
Running from the law but I can't be found 
Only my God can track me down

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' 
You should go and love yourself 
But when you told me that you hated my friends 
The only problem was with you and not them 
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong 
And tried to make me forget where I came from 
And I didn't wanna write a song 
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care 
I don't but, you still hit my phone up 
And baby I been movin' on 
and I think you should be somethin' 
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that 
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone 
And I never like to admit that I was wrong 
And I've been so caught up in my job 
Didn't see what's going on 
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own 
Cause if you like the way you look that much 
Oh baby you should go and love yourself 
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' 
You should go and love yourself 
For all the times that you made me feel small 
I fell in love now I feel nothin' at all 
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable 
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls? 
Cause if you like the way you look that much 
Oh baby you should go and love yourself 
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' 
You should go and love yourself 
Cause if you like the way you look that much 
Oh baby you should go and love yourself 
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' 
You should go and love yourself</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When the sins of my father 
Weigh down in my soul 
And the pain of my mother will not let me go 
Well I know there can come fire from the sky 
To refine the purest of canes 
Even though I know this fire brings me pain 
Even so and just the same 
Make it rain 
Make it rain down low 
Make it rain, make it rain 
Make it rain 
Make it rain down low 
Make it rain, make it rain 
And the seed needs the water 
Before it grows out of the ground 
But it just keeps on getting hotter 
And the hunger more profound 
Well I know there can come tears from their eyes 
But they may as well all be in vain 
Even though I know these tears come with pain 
Even so and just the same 
Make it rain 
Make it rain down low 
Make it rain, make it rain 
Make it rain 
Make it rain down low 
Make it rain, make it rain 
And the seas are full of water 
It stops by the shore 
Just like the riches of grandeur 
That never reach the port 
And let the claps fill with thunderous applause 
And let the lightning be the veins 
And fill the sky 
With all that they can drop 
When it's time to make a change 
Make it rain 
Make it rain down low 
Make it rain, make it rain 
Make it rain 
Make it rain down low 
Make it rain, make it rain</field>

Well, I've walked this street before 
And everyone's locked up their door

It's taken you a long time to see 
You've got a goldfish memory

Lost, you're not around 
There's a lump in my chest that 
Sends cold through my head, and 
My mind shuts sound out 
I'm on auto-pilot 
And my tongue's gone silent 
Just switch it off and lay it down 
Lay it down 
Next to me 
I don't know when I lost my mind 
Maybe when I made you mine 
I don't know when I lost my mind 
Maybe it was every time 
That you said, you said, you said 
That I miss you 
And I miss you 
These words mean nothing to me 
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be 
These three words are aching 
Constrict and suffocating 
My mind is racing 
With the picture I'm painting 
And my belly's sick to it's stomach 
When I remember all the times 
He was with you when you laid it down 
When you laid down 
Next to me 
I don't know when I lost my mind 
Maybe when I made you mine 
I don't know when I lost my mind 
Maybe it was every time 
That you said, you said, you said 
That I miss you, more than I let on 
I kissed you, far too long 
I'll let go, as soon as you do 
See, I know we're not through 
I don't know when I lost my mind 
Maybe when I made you mine 
I don't know when I lost my mind 
Maybe it was every time 
That you said, you said, you said

Already sick of what you're saying 
Hoping now I'm only praying 
My baby's gone away 
And I've already packed my bags 
You didn't know me 
(I've run away) 
You couldn't show me 
(What you have to say) 
My one and only 
Has gone away 
Far away 
You'll never leave me alone 
Now I'm off on my own 
I'll never ring your phone again 
And still you keep on crying 
If I said I loved you 
I'd be lying 
You need to dry your eyes 
And I've still gone to pack my bags 
You didn't know me 
(I've run away) 
You couldn't show me

To me there's only up, there ain't no point in looking down 
However hard I try, I only get weaker 
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold 
What you gotta do is never get yourself down 
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground 
Keep out of trouble, ain't no trouble being pure 
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now 
Move on, forget it 
Now move on, forget it 
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters 
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar 
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark 
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody 
Hennesey shots and glocks, all these fools on the block 
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top? 
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy 
With my head in the sky 
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die 
So see the signs, stand to the side 
Open your eyes and take a look and realise 
The resurrection's arrived 
And as the mist clears, homie I arise 
From my tomb in disguise 
I'm all alone, Alonestar 
Urban Angel rising from the ashes 
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move 
Now back up! 
Move on, forget it 
Now move on, forget it 
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it 
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music 
Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who ?what the fuck does it matter? 
Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder 
It don't matter to me 
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely 
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me? 
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I was twenty-four years old 
When I met the woman I would call my own 
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old 
In that house that your brother bought ya 
On the summer day when I proposed 
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold 
And I asked her father, but her daddy said: "No 
You can't marry my daughter" 
She and I went on the run 
Don't care about religion 
I'm gonna marry the woman I love 
Down by the Wexford border 
She was Nancy Mulligan 
And I was William Sheeran 
She took my name and then we were one 
Down by the Wexford border 
Well, met her at Guy's in the Second World War 
And she was working on a soldier's ward 
Never had I seen such beauty before 
The moment that I saw her 
Nancy was my yellow rose 
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes 
We got eight children, now growing old 
Five sons and three daughters 
She and I went on the run 
Don't care about religion 
I'm gonna marry the woman I love 
Down by the Wexford border 
She was Nancy Mulligan 
And I was William Sheeran 
She took my name and then we were one 
Down by the Wexford border 
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair 
Over sixty years I've been loving her 
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs 
You know Nancy, I adore ya 
From a farm boy born near Belfast town 
I never worried about the king and crown 
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground 
There's no difference, I assure ya 
She and I went on the run 
Don't care about religion 
I'm gonna marry the woman I love 
Down by the Wexford border 
She was Nancy Mulligan 
And I was William Sheeran 
She took my name and then we were one 
Down by the Wexford border</field>

No, I want some fucking Nando's 
Wanna eat it up with chicken and chips 
Everyone knows I freestyle like this 
When I freestyle on the beat about chicken 
You know it's finger lickin' 
And now I'm gonna pass it over to Example now 
He's gonna freestyle 
and he's gonna show you how he do 
Chicken, chicken wings 
They're my favorite things and I love to sing 
I say chicken, chicken wings 
If you give me them I will eat them things 
Yo, and we eat chicken for free 
'Cause he's got a black card you see 
He made a song about chicken from Nando's 
And are you gonna bang yo 
Yes please I want some chicken right now 
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes 
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken 
With the fucking breasts and the wings 
And the thighs and the chips and 
All them things that are nice 
(One sec.. 
keep going...) 
Nandos from me, fat chance I've gotta black card 
If you come to me and ask for chicken you'll get a fat scar 
In your left cheek I eat Nando's every week 
Sometimes on a Tuesday, sometimes on a Thursday (yo) 
I get free drinks, refillable even when I'm thirsty 
On a Thursday I eat chicken in the worst ways 
Yeah, I said we are on tour so him I'm like 
Get out the store, yo! 
'Cause you are a whore 
Eat Nando's for free everyday on tour, yo! 
And it's a par, I ate nandos from your car 
Can't freestyle 'cause you'll see me starve 
I slap you in the face 'cause like I'm like Febreze.. 
Yar! 
Chicken on the phone 
Chicken on the phone 
Chicken on the phone 
Chicken on the phone 
Chicken on the phone 
I eat chicken off the floor 
I eat chicken off the bone 
Chicken on the phone 
Chicken on the phone 
Chicken on the phone 
Chicken on the phone 
Chicken off the floor 
Chicken off the sky 
Chicken off the bone 
I eat chicken off the bone 
I love Nando's more than your mum does 
More than your mum does 
Nando's (I said ohh) 
I love Nando's 
My tongue is on fire 
I wanna say hell yeah, (yes Ed) 
Nando's I desire (I give it to you anytime you want babe) 
I want some free Nando's from your black card 
You ain't getting in my wallet 
Ain't getting in my wallet 
My wallet, my wallet (I wanna take your black card) 
You ain't getting my wallet 
And I gain ten pounds everytime I go there to eat my food 
And you're so fucking rude you don't fucking buy it for me 
So I want Nando's for free 
And you look like you put your fingers in electricity socket 
To get your hair up like this 
Your never touching my card, this is my card 
Your never touching my card, this is my card 
You come to me play your guitar 
Step to me hard you ain't getting my card star 
I want some Nando's 
I want some Nando's 
I want some Nando's, (right now) 
I want some Nando's right now</field>

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans 
Goes to the gym at least six times a week 
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet 
And I hear he's on a new diet 
And watches what he eats 
He's got his eyebrows plucked 
And his arsehole bleached 
Owns every single Ministry CD 
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means 
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me 
But still, I'm just keepin' it real 
Still lookin' at your Instagram 
And I'll be creepin' a lil' 
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back 
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at 
Let me remind you of the days when 
You used to hold my hand 
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans 
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman 
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved 
So let me give it to ya 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
'Cause if it was meant to be 
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to 
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
We'll get there eventually 
I know you're missin' all this kind of love 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb 
And wears a man bag on his shoulder 
But I call it a purse 
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas 
Drinks beer, but has a six pack 
I'm kinda jealous 
He wears sunglasses indoors 
In winter, at nighttime 
And every time a rap song comes on 
He makes a gang sign 
Says "Tune, boydem light up the room! " 
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you 
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin' 
Eatin' a packet of crisps 
But you will never find you cheatin' 
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym 
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim 
In the back of the club 
Kissin' a boy that ain't him 
Okay, you need to be alone 
And if you wanna talk about it 
You can call my phone 
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know 
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved 
So let me give it to ya 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
'Cause if it was meant to be 
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to 
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
We'll get there eventually 
I know you're missin' all this kind of love 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week 
But you act so differently 
When you're with him, I know you're lonely 
Please remember you're still free 
To make the choice and leave 
Don't call me up, you need to show me 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
'Cause if it was meant to be 
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to 
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
I don't wanna know about your new man 
We'll get there eventually 
I know you're missin' all this kind of love 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about 
I don't wanna know about your new man</field>

Five drinks in on Friday night 
We only came to dry your eyes 
And get you out of your room 
Now this bar has closed it's doors 
I found my hand is holding yours 
Do you wanna go home so soon? 
Or maybe we should take a ride 
Through the night 
And sing along to every song 
That's on the radio 
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn no no no 
The sun could rise 
Burning all the street lamps out at 3am 
So Dj, play it again 
Until the night turns into morning 
You'll be in my arms 
And we'll keep driving 
Along the boulevard 
And if I kiss you, darling 
Please don't be alarmed 
It's just the start of everything if you want 
A new love 
In New York 
In New York 
Yesterday you gave me a call 
Stressing out about it all 
Said the world is moving too fast 
And you don't know where to begin 
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in 
Only to wind up on the other side 
By yourself 
And every day 
Screaming out 
To all the people that you used to know 
From a window that looks upon the Manhattan skyline now 
It's just the way that life goes 
And you live it in every song you know 
So Dj, play it again 
Until the night turns into morning 
You'll be in my arms 
And we'll keep driving 
Along the boulevard 
And if I kiss you, darling 
Please don't be alarmed 
It's just the start of everything if you want 
A new life 
In New York 
And every song that plays 
Is just like the day you had 
And it's okay to cry 
But I'm saying that it's a waste of water 
You know I'm here for you 
In the back of the taxi cab tonight 
In New York 
It's just reached the morning 
And you're still in my arms 
Now we've stopped driving 
Down the boulevard 
And I just kissed you, darling 
I hope you weren't alarmed 
It's just the start of everything if you want 
A new love 
In New York 
A new life 
In New York</field>

But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see 
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease 
To the retrieve then I can't let them be 
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon's green 
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week 
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife 
Right now it's better than it's ever been 
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen 
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me 
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak 
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be 
They chase dreams together like a slumber party 
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing 
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in 
When the darkness creeps in 
I feel my nightmares watching me 
And when my dreams are sleeping 
I feel my nightmares watching me 
Oh, oh, oh! 
I feel my nightmares watching me 
You better wake up cause I am making moves 
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules 
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training 
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze 
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading 
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em 
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her 
Now I'm taking control of my inception 
Cause they try to hit my misses with my erection 
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike 
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them 
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish 
The haters know where the family lives 
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger 
Is gonna lose a lot more, than I need it 
They say sleep is the cousin of death 
But I hear shit, cousin I am deaf 
Gang signs I'm a N A reading 
I'm a Ceo, man you suckers are next 
When the darkness creeps in 
I feel my nightmares watching me 
And when my dreams are sleeping 
I feel my nightmares watching me 
Oh, oh, oh! 
I feel my nightmares watching me 
They watching me! They watch me sleep! 
Let me go! 
I fell asleep on sofa, woke up in reality 
And daydream about losing my sanity 
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow 
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed 
But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep 
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat 
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep 
See, all the dreams I'm fond of 
You placed me in the team insomnia 
Now, I'm Mr hard worker 
In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up 
And I missed my chance worst luck 
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner 
Ch'yeah, but I walked from that ish 
Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress 
When the darkness creeps in 
I feel my nightmares watching me 
And when my dreams are sleeping 
I feel my nightmares watching me 
Oh, oh, oh! 
I feel my nightmares watching me 
Watching me!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I met you when I was a teen 
But then you were one as well 
And I could play the guitar 
Just like ringing the bells 
Sometimes I wonder 
In any other summer 
Could you have been my part time lover 
To me listening to Stevie Wonder 
Under the covers where we used to lay 
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played 
I'll be on tour almost every day 
When I was home up in my flat 
Is where we used to stay 
Just watching the Dvd, smoking illegal weed 
Getting high as two kites, we needed to breathe 
We used each other's air just for the people to see 
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep 
We go anywhere, our minds would take us 
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up 
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause 
We can all be loved the way that God made us 
And time's the only reason that we could break up 
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much 
Distance is relative to the time that it takes 
To get on a plane 
Or make a mistake, so say it again 
Oh Nina, you should go Nina 
'Cause I ain't never coming home Nina 
Oh, won't you leave me now 
And I've been living on the road Nina 
And then again you should know Nina 
'Cause that's you and me both Nina 
Oh , won't you leave me now 
And every weekend in the winter 
You'd be wearing my hoodie 
With drawstrings pulled tight 
To keep your face in the cold 
Taking day trips to the local 
Where we'd eat on our own 
Cause every day when I was away 
We'd only speak on the phone 
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits 
And as if we were two rabbits and then you vanish 
Back to burrow all of the celtics are disappearing 
You call me selfish 
I understand but I can't help it 
I put my job before everything 
Except my family and friends 
But you'll be in between forever 
So I guess we'll have to take a step back 
Overlook the situation 
Cause mixing business and feelings 
Will only lead to complications 
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break 
Just re-evaluating quick 
Before we make a mistake and it's too late 
So we can either deal with the pain 
Or wait to get on a plane 
But in the day we'll have to say it again 
Oh Nina, you should go Nina 
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina 
Oh , won't you leave me now 
And I've been living on the road Nina 
And then again you should know Nina 
'Cause that's you and me both 
Oh , won't you leave me now 
Love will come and love will go 
But you can make it on your own 
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now 
People grow, and fall apart 
But you can mend your broken heart 
Take it back, oh won't you leave me now 
Oh Nina, you should go Nina 
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina 
Oh , won't you leave me now 
And I've been living on the road Nina 
And then again you should know Nina 
'Cause that's you and me both 
Oh , won't you leave me now</field>

Baby got 'em open all over town 
Strictly biz, she don't play around 
Cover much ground, cocaine by the pound 
Getting paid is a forte 
Each and every day, true player way 
I can't get her out of my mind 
(Say what) 
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow) 
East side to the west side 
Pushing phat rides, ain't no surprise 
She got tricks in the stash 
Stacking up the cash 
Quick when it comes to the gas 
By no means average 
It's always she's got to have it 
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in 
Let me come in, so I can win 
I like the way you work it 
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now 
I like the way you work it 
No diggity, bout to bag it up 
I like the way you work it 
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now 
I like the way you work it 
No diggity, I got to bag it up 
She's got class and style 
And balance by the pound 
Shorty, never act wild 
Very low key on the profile 
Catching feelings is a no 
Let me tell you how it goes 
Curves the words, spins the verbs 
Lovin' it curves so freak what you heard 
Rollin' with the phatness 
You never quite know what the half is 
You got to pay to play 
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way 
I like the way you work it 
Top notch, Trumped tight, every day 
You're blowing my mind, baby, in time 
Maybe, I can get you in my ride 
I like the way you work it 
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now 
I like the way you work it 
No diggity, I'm bout to bag it up 
I like the way you work it 
No diggity, I'm bout to bag it, bag it up now 
I like the way you work it 
No diggity, I'm about to bag it up 
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo 
Hey yo, damn that girl looks good 
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo 
Play on, play on play on 
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo 
Damn that girl looks good 
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo 
No no no 
I'm gonna pop some tags 
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket 
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come up 
This is freaking awesome 
Now I'm gonna pop some tags 
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket 
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come up 
This is freaking awesome 
Now, now I'm gonna pop some tags (I like the way you work it)

And I see you all over him 
Irresistible sin 
When can we be the same again? 
What can I do to be making you see? 
To come out clean? 
you're better off with me 
we're stuck 
Taking time and wasting mine 
No luck 
Running around and crashing down 
In you I trust nevermore 
Leaving you in sand and glass 
All I ever felt for you 
Went up in a cloud of smoke 
How I could I be such a fool 
To ever think that we were close?

And just stay with me 
All my senses come to life 
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I 
Have ever been, and I'll never leave again 
'Cause you are the only one 
And all my friends have come to find 
Another place to let their hearts collide 
Just promise me you'll always be a friend 
'Cause you are the only one 
Take my hand and my heart and soul 
I will only have these eyes for you 
And you know, everything changes 
But we'll be strangers 
If we see this through 
You can stay within these walls and bleed

Getting myself lost 
I am so gone 
So tell me the way home 
I'm listening sad songs 
Singing about love 
Where it goes wrong

While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I

            <field name="lyrics">Lying in a bedroom 
Lighting up a Benson 
Face hair is growing 
So I cut with a vengeance 
Hey, did I mention 
As she makes an entrance 
Said I had a tendency 
To finish off a sentence 
Oh well, she's a local girl 
No make-up 
Cos she knows me well 
Hair tied up in elastic band 
With a kiss on the cheek 
For her one-night man 
Is it fast food 
I'll regret it after 
And I needed money 
But I'm too shy to ask her 
So she buys me chips and cheese 
And I tell her I love her 
And she's all I need 
I take it with a cold glass 
Of the fruit and the barley 
She's still a sucker for the 
Apple and Bacardi 
Heading to the party 
Sitting in the car seat 
B.E.P 
on radio 
It makes me feel naughty 
She knows me well 
Bit of a catch 
To have a local girl 
Hair tied up in elastic band 
With a kiss on the cheek 
For her one-night man 
I don't wanna go alone 
I don't wanna go alone 
Tell her that I love her 
Tell her that I need her 
Tell her that she's more 
Than a one-night stand 
Tell her that she turns my cheeks 
The colour of my hair 
All I wanna do is be near 
Tell her that I want her 
Tell her that I need her 
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand 
Tell her that I love her 
More than anyone else 
If you don't, then I'll tell her myself 
And we've got love in us 
So if the drink kill us 
We're gonna dance all night 
Till the floor fillers 
If we talk outside 
I say I hate wasps too 
I don't really dance 
So I'll just watch you 
Are you taking me back tonight? 
Tell me if that's alright 
I don't wanna be here 
I'm not the sofa type 
Tell me if you have a toothbrush 
You don't mind sharing 
She said I wanna take off 
What you're wearing 
I don't wanna go alone 
I don't wanna go alone 
Tell her that I love her 
Tell her that I need her 
Tell her that she's more 
Than a one-night stand 
Tell her that she turns my cheeks 
The colour of my hair 
All I wanna do is be near 
Tell her that I want her 
Tell her that I need her 
Tell her that she's more 
Than a one-night stand 
Tell her that I love her 
More than anyone else 
If you don't, I'll tell her myself 
She's like the fast food 
I'll regret it after 
And I needed money 
But I'm too shy to ask her 
But she buys me chips and cheese 
So I tell her that she's all I need 
Tell her that she's more

To find some peace and sanity 
I've been playing hide-and-seek too long 
Shaking, making, everybody waking 
Setting the hi-fi bleed 
Keeping me back 
While you're spinning my track 
That'll knock you off your feet 
Monkey see what monkey do 
But I'm a monkey telling you 
I just think that we should take a break 
Tickity-tock the clock 
With the hip-hop 
And Alonestar backing me up 
We won't stop 
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind 
Now let the track rewind 
And play, let the music play 
It came, so let the music say what it feels 
Shame, shame it took too long 
To see that you were wrong 
Now turn the song back on 
This is Alonestar coming at you 
With a new style 
Kicking dust 
Ready to bust 
It's Urban Angel 
Artistic, flipping the script 
Who d'you really want to get it with? 
Ed and Alonestar 
We're like live wires sparking 
Ready to blow 
We've already sown our seeds 
We're just waiting to grow - blow 
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body 
Metaphorical speech when we come and see 
You ducking for cover 
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock 
With Urban Angel and Alonestar 
And Ed - keep it locked 
Let the beat pump 
Drop the bass but don't stop 
We're kicking the sound 
Let the bass bins pound 
We're gonna roll 
Can you feel me now with my body? 
Get down to the sound 
It's Ed Sheeran in the place 
And Alonestar rising up 
We gotta rise up 
I said rise up 
And play, let the music play 
It came, so let the music say what it feels 
Shame, shame it took so long 
To see that you were wrong

children of our own

Sei la mia donna 
La forza delle onde del mare 
Cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti molto di più 
Spero che un giorno, l'amore che ci ha accompagnato 
Diventi casa, la mia famiglia, diventi noi 
E siamo sempre bambini ma 
Nulla è impossibile 
Stavolta non ti lascerò 
Mi baci piano ed io, torno ad esistere 
E nel tuo sguardo crescerò 
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità 
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi 
Dentro la nostra musica 
Ti ho guardato ridere e sussurando ho detto 
Tu stasera, vedi sei perfetta per me 
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità 
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi 
Dentro la nostra musica 
Ho creduto sempre in noi 
Perchè sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato 
Quanto ti ho aspettato 
Perchè tu stasera, sei perfetta per me</field>

Loving can hurt sometimes 
But it's the only thing that I know 
And when it gets hard 
You know it can get hard sometimes 
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive 
We keep this love in a photograph 
We made these memories for ourselves 
Where our eyes are never closing 
Hearts were never broken 
And time's forever frozen still 
So you can keep me inside the pocket 
Of your ripped jeans 
Holding me close until our eyes meet 
You won't ever be alone 
Wait for me to come home 
Loving can heal 
Loving can mend your soul 
And it's the only thing that I know 
I swear it will get easier 
Remember that with every piece of you 
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die 
We keep this love in a photograph 
We made these memories for ourselves 
Where our eyes are never closing 
Our hearts were never broken 
And time's forever frozen still 
So you can keep me inside the pocket 
Of your ripped jeans 
Holding me close until our eyes meet 
You won't ever be alone 
And if you hurt me that's okay baby 
Only words bleed 
Inside these pages you just hold me 
And I won't ever let you go 
Wait for me to come home 
Oh you can fit me 
Inside the necklace you got 
When you were sixteen 
Next to your heartbeat where I should be 
Keep it deep within your soul 
And if you hurt me 
Well that's okay baby 
Only words bleed 
Inside these pages you just hold me 
And I won't ever let you go 
When I'm away 
I will remember how you kissed me 
Under the lamppost back on 6th street 
Hearing you whisper through the phone 
Wait for me to come home</field>

I'm looking for a partner 
Someone who knows how to ride 
Without even fallin' off 
Gotta be compatible 
Takes me to my limits 
Girl when I break you off 
I promise you, won't want to get off 
If your horny, lets do it 
Ride it, my pony 
My saddle's waitin' 
Come and jump on it 
If your horny lets do it 
Ride it, my pony 
My saddles waitin' 
Come and jump on it 
Sittin' here, flossin' 
Peepin' your steelo 
Just once if I have the chance 
The things I would do to you 
You and your body 
Every single portion 
I'll send shivers up and down your spine 
And fluids flowin' down your thigh 
If your horny lets do it 
Ride it my pony 
My saddle's waitin' 
Come and jump on it 
If your horny, lets do it 
Ride it, my pony 
My saddles waitin' 
Come and jump on it 
Wanna get freaky, baby 
And feel you next to me 
And you can join jockey team 
Wanna get nasty, baby 
And feel you next you me 
And you can join my jockey team 
Oh

Replace, she was so unforgiving 
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated 
And she's telling me I've wasted my time 
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right 
To tell me your voice takes me through the night 
Your smile and your memory 
Simply eases me to sleep 
In my ear while the whispering 
Melts my heart on every beat 
Still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place 
And we're asking for so much more 
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face 
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor 
Face me, are you tired of living? 
Replace, she was so unforgiving 
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated 
And she's telling me I've wasted my time 
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right 
To tell me your voice takes me through the night 
Time past, heal this broken heart 
Pulled away that sellotape 
Take your time, 'cos I won't mind 
I doubt if I even know that I'm awake 
And still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place 
And we're asking for so much more 
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face

Cut tension with a knife 
I find it hard to cope 
Stop playing with my life 
You analyse my fears 
Analyse my dreams 
Choke on burning tears 
Through my silent screams 
Things aren't what they seem 
Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me 
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe 
Open doors just to take away the key 
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better 
Watch me fall 
As I stumble at your feet 
Always losing in this game 
Your lies cut me deep 
And you don't even know my name 
With your consistency 
To always make me crawl 
And my durability 
Not affected at all 
Still things aren't what they seem 
Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me 
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe 
Open doors just to take away the key 
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better 
Feel the pain 
On my brain 
Feel the strain 
As I start to decay 
Feel the strain 
Every passing day 
Feel the pain 
As I start to decay 
Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me 
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe 
Open doors just to take away the key

            <field name="lyrics">Hi, my name is JME, there was a time when radio played me 
Cause my music came from my heart, it was real to me 
But now it's a part 
I'm here struggling, keeping it real, while the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal 
Sometimes I sit back and think, JME just do one tune, make a couple cheese and chill 
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I'll never do it, I swear 
I didn't go through all of that for this, 
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is, I'm fair, straight 
Who can tell me different? you could be determined 
Man on a mission, my music is me, and I am my music 
So like it or lump it, I'ma do this 
[Chorus] 
I never had a playlist in my heart, ooh 
Now I need an A list just to chart 
But I've been famous from the start 
How am I gonna make my mark? ooh 
Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio 
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist 
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh 
Thank God for night clubs and the raves 
Cos I don't think they like us on the airwaves 
Unless we water it down, but cordial music is boring me now 
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is 
Or in this music scene, what your role is 
I'm still trying here, cause I'm a pioneer 
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears 
See I'm just telling you the truth 
Cant shoot the messenger, bullet proof booth, 
You won't hear me on the radio, but go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof 
Why does that? What's going on there? 
To tell you the truth, I don't really care 
I am my music, my music is me 
Like it or lump it, this is how it's gonna be 
[Chorus] 
I never had a playlist in my heart, ooh 
Now I need an A list just to chart 
But I've been famous from the start 
How am I gonna make my mark? ooh 
Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio 
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist 
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh 
I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial 
Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile 
So won't you hear me out? 
Never feel it from the base line, feel it in the club 
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub 
So won't you hear me out? 
I never had a playlist in my heart, ooh 
Now I need an A list just to chart 
But I've been famous from the start 
How am I gonna make my mark? ooh 
Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio 
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist 
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I've been a liar, been a thief 
Been a lover, been a cheat 
All my sins need holy water 
Feel it washing over me 
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something 
If all it's gonna cause is pain 
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain 
So let the river run 
He's coming home with his neck scratched 
To catch flack 
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch 
On his breast jacket's a sex addict 
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back 
It's a chess match, she's on his back 
Like a jet pack 
She's kept track of all his internet chats 
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next? 
Actually, just shit on my last chick 
And she has what my ex lacks 
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath 
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that 
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back 
Knife-in-hand scissor relationships hanging by a strand 
So she's been on the web lately 
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man 
And I know she's using me to try to play him 
I don't care, hi Susan, but I shoulda said "Bye Susan" 
After the first night, but tonight I am 
I've been a liar, been a thief 
Been a lover, been a cheat 
All my sins need holy water 
Feel it washing over me 
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something 
If all it's gonna cause is pain 
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain 
So let the river run 
One-night stand 
Turned in two-night stand 
He was calling so might scram 
Now we hug tight, and 
He found out, now she feels deserted and used 
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too 
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through? 
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued 
And witnessed you hurt 
But what you deserve is the truth 
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you 
So I revert to the studio like Hole in the Wall diners 
Don't have to be reserved in a booth 
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's 
Irreversible, I preyed on you 
Like it's church at the pew 
And now that I got you I don't want you 
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue 
Why do I do this dirt that I do? 
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon, and speech 
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound 
'Cause now with her in the womb 
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew 
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit.. 
fuck! 
I've been a liar, been a thief 
Been a lover, been a cheat 
All my sins need holy water 
Feel it washing over me 
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something 
If all it's gonna cause is pain 
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain 
So let the river run 
My name's (ooh) , my name's (ooh) 
Denver (ooh) , watch the river run 
Call me (ooh) , call me (ooh) 
River (ooh) , we'll let the river run 
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey! " 
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway 
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes 
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe 
That's why I made they came at you sideways 
I can't keep my lies straight 
Well, I made you terminate, my baby 
This love triangle, left us in a wreck-tangled 
What else can I say? It was fun for a while 
Bet I really woulda loved your smile 
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it 
What's one more lie 
To tell a unborn child? 
I've been a liar, been a thief 
Been a lover, been a cheat 
All my sins need holy water 
Feel it washing over me 
Oh, little one (I'm sorry) , I don't wanna admit to something 
(I fucked up) If all it's gonna cause is pain 
The truth in my lies now, are falling like the rain 
So let the river run</field>

Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine 
Disappearing all night 
I don't wanna know where he's been lying 
I know what I wanna do 
Wanna runaway, runaway with you 
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morn-in' go 
How long you leaving 
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening 
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this 
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway,but 
I love him from my skin to my bones 
But I don't wanna live in his home 
There's nothing to say cos he knows 
I'll just runaway and be on my own 
I've never seen my dad cry 
Cold as stone in the kitchen light 
I'll tell you it's about time 
But I was raised to keep quiet 
This is what I'm gonna do 
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move 
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morn-in, go 
How long you leaving 
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening 
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this 
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway,but 
I love him from my skin to my bones 
But I don't wanna live in his home 
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows 
I'll just runaway and be on my own 
Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back 
As I packed my clothes up 
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack, intends to show love 
I don't wanna live this way 
Gonna take my things and go 
If things change in a matter of days 
I could be persuaded to hold up 
Mama was the same 
None of us are saints I guess that god knows that 
I don't wanna runaway 
And one of these days I might just show that 
Put my home in a suitcase 
Tie both shoe laces and hope that 
Things change but for now I'll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder 
I love him from my skin to my bones 
But I don't wanna live in his home 
There's nothing to say cos he knows 
I'll just runaway and be on my own</field>

Cheer me up when I'm in a mood 
So I thought I'd write a song for you 
And may I say, you look like an angel today 
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays 
If only to make you smile today 
'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that 
Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock 
Behind a can of Strongbow 
Oh wow, I said 
Sara, you say that you don't look good when you do 
Even with that soul 
Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue 
Half the guys I know are after you 
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood

When I go away things will change 
And you'll never know it was easy 
It won't help pretending that we'll stay close 
I can't help thinking that 
I try to pretend that it's your loss 
And I never know, oh I'll never know if it will work 
There's no better time 
She's still thinking I'm too far away 
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait 
And I left her today 
And I left her today 
Come Sunday I'll see that one day you'll rescue me 
And when I leave again I'll feel strange 
And I'll never know, oh I'll never know if you're in love again 
I can't stop being a fool for you 
I won't help thinking that 
Still I am falling for her and she did too 
Oh I'll never know, oh I'll never know if I'm in love 
There's no better time 
She's still thinking I'm too far away 
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait 
But I left her today 
There's no better time 
She's still thinking I'm too far away 
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait

            <field name="lyrics">I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe 
I gave away my money 
And now we don't even speak 
I drove miles and miles 
But would you do the same for me? 
Oh, honestly? 
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon 
Gave you constant shelter 
And a bed to keep you warm 
They gave me the heartache 
And in return I gave a song 
It goes on and on 
Life can get you down so 
I just numb the way it feels 
I drown it with a drink 
And out-of-date prescription pills 
And all the ones that love me 
They just left me on the shelf 
No farewell 
So before I save someone else 
I've got to save myself 
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain 
'Cause human beings are 
Destined to radiate or drain 
What line do we stand upon 
'Cause from here it looks the same 
And only scars remain 
Life can get you down so 
I just numb the way it feels 
I drown it with a drink 
And out-of-date prescription pills 
And all the ones that love me 
They just left me on the shelf 
No farewell 
So before I save someone else 
I've got to save myself 
But if don't 
Then I'll go back 
To where I'm rescuing a stranger 
Just because they needed saving just like that 
Oh, I'm here again 
Between the devil and the danger 
But I guess it's just my nature 
My dad was wrong 
'Cause I'm not like my mum 
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song 
But it helps 
So before I save someone else 
I've got to save myself 
Life can get you down so 
I just numb the way it feels 
I drown it with a drink 
And out-of-date prescription pills 
And all the ones that love me 
They just left me on the shelf 
No farewell 
So before I save someone else 
I've got to save myself 
And before I blame someone else 
I've got to save myself 
And before I love someone else 
I've got to love myself</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You got scars on your body and your soul 
Bruises on your back now 
Broken heart with nowhere to go 
Living in a high-rise flat 
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together 
Nothing is forever, you know 
You can start again like this, like this 
Now I see blood in the sky 
Blood in my eyesight 
And everything's turning to red 
So We'll beat it away, coloring the nightlife 
And light me up, burn me today 
I'm seeing the blood in the skyline 
Stuck in the right mind 
Afraid again to let any dream 
And replace it with anything better 
So, get up 
And take away your scars 
You can never be alone, if you are bleeding with the skyline 
Waiting for the right time 
When the night's already gone 
It's been traveling without your mind now 
Let go and fuel you 
Like petrol you find so much 
Beauty in what makes you mental 
Your friends know it's only 
A state of mind, you're only getting by 
By always getting high, that's why... 
Now I see blood in the sky 
Blood in my eyesight 
And everything's turning to red 
So We'll beat it away, coloring the nightlife 
And light me up, burn me today 
I'm seeing the blood in the skyline 
Stuck in the right mind 
Afraid again to let any dream 
And replace it with anything better 
So, get up 
And take away your scars 
I can take away your scars 
I can take away your scars</field>

Take my hand, stop 
Put Van The Man on the jukebox

Girl, you know I want your love 
Your love was handmade for somebody like me 
Come on now, follow my lead

Say, boy, let's not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

We're going out on our first date 
You and me are thrifty 
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate 
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour 
And how your family is doing okay 
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat 
Tell the driver make the radio play

Check it, I've gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape 
You said them other bruddas 
couldn't really juggle your weight 
And you were shy in the beginning 
used to cover your face 
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake 
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for 
Love you through whatever 
who you tryna skip a meal for? 
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for? 
I ain't even gassing 
they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk 
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack 
And when you've finished what you're doing 
we'll be kicking it back 
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps 
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that 
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won 
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done 
I ain't even tryna play it cool 
'cuh this is bigger than my pride 
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide 
Ayy, check 
I'm in love with the shape of you

Pour out my liquor, there's not a flaw in your figure 
I'm so impressed 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
And baby, you can call me, it's quicker 
I don't be talking on Twitter, girl, that's dead 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Girl, stop curbing the question 
I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight 
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Weigh up your options 
and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right 
I'm in love with the shape of you

Patience's my enemy, loving's my friend 
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve 
Than to stay and just pretend 
Oh, she knows me so well 
Oh, she knows me like I know myself 
I made all my plans and as she has made hers 
She kept me in mind but I wasn't sure 
I searched every room for a way to escape 
But every time I try to leave she keeps holding on to me for delight 
And blocking my way 
Patience's my enemy, loving's my friend 
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve 
Than to stay and just pretend 
Oh, she knows me so well 
Oh, she knows me like I know myself 
And like the back of her hand she already understands everything 
"Won't you stay?", she says 
And she already knows how it goes 
And where she stands I'll stay, anyway

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of 
Anchored down in my throat, love 
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now 
With just one armband to carry me home 
When the salted tears won't dry 
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves 
Under your eyes 
These hearts will be fully tonight 
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves 
Under your eyes 
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes 
I still taste salt water 
Oh my lips from your kiss bitterness 
And I drown within the oceans you made 
And I hate to love you 
These cuffs are covered in your make up 
I'll never trust you again 
You can just be a friend 
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of 
Anchored down in my throat, love 
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now

I'll wipe my shirtsleeves 
Under your eyes 
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth 
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild 
Tonight, the fact design 
I'm on my way home 
On the way home 
I lied, I tried to cry 
But I'm drowning in the oceans you made 
When the salted tears won't dry 
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves

Glass on the side now 
I've been sat with you 
For most of the night 
Ignoring everybody here 
We wish they would disappear 
So maybe we could get down now 
I don't wanna know 
If you're getting ahead of the program 
I want you to be my lady 
To hold your body close 
Take another step into the no-man's land 
For the longest time lady 
I need you darling 
Come on set the tone 
If you feel you're falling 
Won't you let me know 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
If you love me, come on, get involved 
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Sing 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Louder 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Sing 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
This love is ablaze 
I saw flames from the side of the stage 
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days 
Until then, we got nothing to say 
And nothing to know 
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke 
Let it go until our roads are changed 
Singing "We Found Love" in a local rave, no 
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say 
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray 
I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet you" 
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila 
I already know that she's a keeper 
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep 
If anybody find out 
I meant to drive home 
But I drank all of it now 
Not sober enough, we just sat on the couch 
One thing led to another 
Now she's kissing my mouth 
I need you darling 
Come on set the tone 
If you feel you're falling 
Won't you let me know 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
If you love me, come on, get involved 
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Sing 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Louder 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Sing 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Can you feel it? 
All the guys in here don't really wanna dance 
Can you feel it? 
All that I can hear is music from the back 
Can you feel it? 
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling 
Before the beat kicks in again 
Can you feel it? 
Can you feel it? Oh no 
Sing 
I need you darling 
Come on set the tone 
If you feel you're falling 
Won't you let me know 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (sing)

Come on skinny love just last the year 
Pour a little salt we were never here 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my 
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer 
I tell my love to wreck it all 
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my 
Right in the moment this order's tall 
And I told you to be patient 
And I told you to be fine 
And I told you to be balanced 
And I told you to be kind 
In the morning I'll be with you 
But it will be a different "kind" 
'cause I'll be holding all the tickets 
And you'll be owning all the fines 
Come on skinny love what happened here 
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my 
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split 
And I told you to be patient 
And I told you to be fine 
And I told you to be balanced 
And I told you to be kind 
Now all your love is wasted? 
Then who the hell was I? 
Now I'm breaking at the bridges 
And at the end of all your lines 
 
Who will love you? 
Who will fight? 
Who will fall far behind?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You're just a small bump unborn 
In four months you're brought to life 
You might be left with my hair 
But you'll have your mother's eyes 
I'll hold your body in my hands 
Be as gentle as I can 
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans 
A small bump in four months 
you'll open your eyes 
And I'll whisper quietly and give you nothing but truth 
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you 
You are my one and only 
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb 
And hold me tight 
Oh, you are my one and only 
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb 
And hold me tight 
And you'll be alright 
You're just a small bump unknown 
You'll grow into your skin 
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin 
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice 
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide 
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes 
And I'll hold you tightly and tell you nothing but truth 
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you 
You are my one and only 
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb 
And hold me tight 
And you'll be alright 
You can lie with me 
With your tiny feet 
When you're half asleep 
I'll leave you be 
Right in front of me 
For a couple weeks 
So I can keep you safe 
'Cause you are my one and only 
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb 
And hold me tight 
You are my one and only 
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb 
And hold me tight 
And you'll be alright 
You were just a small bump unborn 
For four months then torn from life 
Maybe you were needed up there 
But we're still unaware as why</field>

And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth 
And hey, I lay in this world for a while 
When all is lost just smile 
They've written the dates and the times to follow 
See all the fakes that look so hollow 
But you don't care 
What ever happened to the youth and culture? 
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper 
So you don't care

When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa 
It must have been about 5.01 
Like my blue ripped jeans 
And my eyes are closed 
And I'm way too tired 
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire 
On the sofa, where we lay I wanna stay inside all day 
And it's cold outside, again 
And we're both so high 
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica 
We can go where you want 
Say the word and I'll take ya 
But I'd rather stay on the sofa 
On the sofa, with you 
When the morning comes 
We're not watchingFormula 1 
It's not what we breathe for 
So kick off the day with 
Friends on T4 
Two, boiled and brew 
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you 
On the sofa, where we lay I wanna stay inside all day 
And it's cold outside, again 
And we're still so high 
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica 
We can go where you want 
Say the word and I'll take ya 
But I'd rather stay on the sofa 
On the sofa, with you 
And it feels like I'm flying 
And it feels like 
We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica 
Through the streets of New York 
That is where I will take ya Paris, Rome, to Rio 
Passing through Las Vegas 
We can go where you want 
Say the word, and I'll take ya 
But I'd rather stay on the sofa

I moved far away from you 
And I want to see you here beside me, dear 
But things aren't clear 
When we never even tried 
We never even talked 
We never even thought in the long run 
Whenever it was painful 
Whenever I was away 
I'd miss you 
And I miss you 
She was mine 
I was hers 
And all that's in between 
If she would cry 
I would shelter her 
And keep her from the darkness that would be 
If I moved far away from you 
And I want to see you here beside me, dear 
But things aren't clear, woah 
We never even tried 
We never even talked 
We never even thought in the long run

Whenever I was away 
I'd miss you 
And I miss you 
Don't drop me in 
It's not my turn 
If you cut deep 
Then I might learn 
That you scar and leave me 
Like a sunburn 
Don't drop me in 
It's not my turn 
And if you cut deep 
Then I might learn 
That you scar and leave me

I threw the day old tea from the cup 
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made 
Memories of a life that's been loved 
Took the get well soon cards 
And stuffed animals 
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink 
Dad always told me 
"Don't you cry when you're down" 
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink 
Oh, I'm in pieces 
It's tearing me up, but I know 
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved 
So I'll sing Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum 
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up 
Spread your wings as you go 
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah 
You're home" 
Fluffed the pillows, made the beds 
Stacked the chairs up 
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case 
John says he'd drive 
Then put his hand on my cheek 
And wiped a tear from the side of my face 
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know 
A life with love is a life that's been lived 
So I'll sing Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum 
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up 
Spread your wings as you go 
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah 
You're home" 
Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum 
You got to see the person I have become 
Spread your wings and I know 
That when God took you back he said, "Hallelujah 
You're home"</field>

At the Amsterdam sky 
Oh baby I was high last night 
Cafe clouds and red lights 
When I gotcha in mind 
You slowed down time 
Oh baby I was out of my mind 
Sing a song cover and hold me tight 
I drill you deep into my chest 
That's where it feels the best 
You can remove all the scars 
Stop them from breaking my heart 
Been on a hurting spree 
That brought out the worst in me 
'Cause I don't want to be alone 
'cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one 
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off 
Of my tongue 
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs 
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing another song 
Café clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky 
Oh baby what a beautiful sight 
But we're only satellites 
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights 
Oh baby I am so damn high 
Have you seen my eyes 
With the beat beat of my heart 
You take me back to the start 
Where everything began 
Holding you inside my hands 
Between my fingers and thumb 
I seal you in with my tongue 
'Cause I don't want to be alone 
'Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one 
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off 
Of my tongue 
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs 
Sweet Mary Jane won't you me sing another song

Mary Jane 
Since you came along

I'm almost home

            <field name="lyrics">I'm not a rapper; I'm a singer with a flow 
I've got a habit of spitting 
Quicker lyrics you know 
You found me ripping the writtens 
Out of the pages they sit in 
And never want to get bitten 
Because plagiarism is sin 
Watch how I sit on the rhythm 
Prisoner with a vision 
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism 
Thought you knew but you didn't 
So perk your ears up and listen 
Studio is a system 
And you could say that I'm driven 
And now it's on to the next saga 
We drink the best lager 
I never tried to win you 
Over like your stepfather 
I do my own thing now, and get respect after 
And I'm avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter 
For four years I never had a place to stay 
But it's safe to say that it kept me 
Grounded like a paperweight 
At 16 years old I moved out of my home 
I was Macey Gray I tried to say goodbye and 
I choked 
And we've been sleeping at the subway station 
Sleeping with a movie star 
And adding to the population 
Not my imagination, I don't want to relax 
But would it hurt your reputation 
If I put it on wax? 
So take it back now 
C'mon and take it back love 
C'mon and take it back for us 
Don't you fade into the back love 
Ooh 
Take it back with the rhythm and blues 
And my back pack I'll be singing the news 
Trying to act like Jack Black when 
I'm running the school 
I'll make a beat with my feet 
By just hitting a loop 
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes 
And keeping the truth through the vocal booth 
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit 
They try and take aim like Beckham 
When he goes to shoot 
But then again that's what they're supposed to do 
And I'm supposed to be calm 
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm 
Whispering everything that happens is from now on 
I'll be willing to start again at the end of the song 
Still they claim that I handled it wrong 
But then I never had an enemy, except for Nme 
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as 
The magazines will ever be 
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees 
And healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree 
Singing for the masses 
Rubber dinghy rapids 
Keep this rapping a habit 
And keep on passioning magic 
I'm battling with respect 
I don't know if I'll have it 
This songs from the heart 
Grabbing the plaque 
I'll take it back now 
C'mon and take it back love 
C'mon and take it back for us 
Don't you fade into the back love 
Ooh 
Take it back now 
I don't ever want to be perfect 
Cause I'm a singer that you 
Never want to see shirtless 
I accept the fact that 
Someone has to win worst-dressed 
Taking my first steps into the scene 
Giving me focus 
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton 
Considering a name change 
Thinking it was hopeless 
Rhyming over recordings 
Avoiding tradition 
Cause every day some lyrics 
And a melody can be written 
Now absence can make your heart ache 
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly 
I need to let my liver be 
And I say it again 
Living life on the edge 
With a closed hand full of friends 
Is good advice from a man 
Who took his life on the road with me 
And I hope to see him blowing up globally 
Cause that's how it's supposed to be 
Screaming out vocally 
Might seem totally impossible 
Achieving life's dreams 
But, but I just write schemes 
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans 
Madison Square Garden is where I might be 
But more likely 
You'll find me in the back 
Room of a dive bar with my mates 
Having a pint with Mcdaid 
Discussing records we made 
And every single second knowing 
That we'll never betray 
The way we were raised 
Remembering our background 
Sat down 
That's how we put it out 
It's time to take it back now 
C'mon and take it back love 
C'mon and take it back for us 
Don't you fade into the back love 
Ooh 
C'mon and take it back love 
C'mon and take it back for us 
Don't you fade into the back love

            <field name="lyrics">You look so wonderful in your dress 
I love your hair like that 
The way it falls on the side of your neck 
Down your shoulders and back 
We are surrounded by all of these lies 
And people who talk too much 
You got the kind of look in your eyes 
As if no one knows anything but us 
And should this be the last thing I see 
I want you to know it's enough for me 
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need 
I'm so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love 
You look so beautiful in this light 
Your silhouette over me 
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes 
Is the Tenerife Sea 
And all of the voices surrounding us here 
they just fade out when you take a breath 
Just say the word 
and they'll all disappear into the wilderness 
And should this be the last thing I see 
I want you to know it's enough for me 
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need 
I'm so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love 
Lumiere, darlin' 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin' 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin' 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin' 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin' 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin' 
Lumiere over me 
And should this be the last thing I see 
I want you to know it's enough for me 
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need 
I'm so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love 
You looked so wonderful in your dress 
I loved your hair like that 
And in the moment I knew you better</field>

            <field name="lyrics">White lips, pale face 
Breathing in snowflakes 
Burnt lungs, sour taste 
Light's gone, day's end 
Struggling to pay rent 
Long nights, strange men 
And they say 
She's in the Class A Team 
Stuck in her daydream 
Been this way since eighteen 
But lately her face seems 
Slowly sinking, wasting 
Crumbling like pastries 
And they scream 
The worst things in life come free to us 
Cause we're just under the upperhand 
And go mad for a couple of grams 
And she don't want to go outside tonight 
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland 
Or sells love to another man 
It's too cold outside 
For angels to fly 
Angels to fly 
Ripped gloves, raincoat 
Tried to swim and stay afloat 
Dry house, wet clothes 
Loose change, bank notes 
Weary-eyed, dry throat 
Call girl, no phone 
And they say 
She's in the Class A Team 
Stuck in her daydream 
Been this way since eighteen 
But lately her face seems 
Slowly sinking, wasting 
Crumbling like pastries 
And they scream 
The worst things in life come free to us 
Cause we're just under the upperhand 
And go mad for a couple of grams 
But she don't want to go outside tonight 
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland 
Or sells love to another man 
It's too cold outside 
For angels to fly 
An angel will die 
Covered in white 
Closed eye 
And hoping for a better life 
This time, we'll fade out tonight 
Straight down the line 
And they say 
She's in the Class A Team 
Stuck in her daydream 
Been this way since eighteen 
But lately her face seems 
Slowly sinking, wasting 
Crumbling like pastries 
They scream 
The worst things in life come free to us 
And we're all under the upperhand 
Go mad for a couple of grams 
And we don't want to go outside tonight 
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland 
Or sell love to another man 
It's too cold outside 
For angels to fly 
Angels to fly 
To fly, fly 
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly 
Angels to die</field>

I hear the people walk by when it's late 
Sirens beat through my window cill 
I can't close my eyes 
Don't control what I'm into 
This town is alive 
With lights that blind keep me awake 
Put my hood up, unlace and tie 
The street fills my mind 
Don't control what I'm into 
London calls me a stranger 
A traveller Ohoohohh 
This is now my home, My home 
Oh Woah 
Burning on the back street 
Oh Woah 
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat 
Oh Woah 
And I'm blazing on the street 
What I do isn't upto you 
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two 
The pavement is my friend 
It'll take me where I need to go 
If I find it trips me up 
And puts me down 
This is not what I'm used to 
The shop across the road 
It fills my needs and keeps me company 
When I need it 
Voices beat through my walls 
I don't think I'm gonna make it 
Past tomorrow 
London calls me a stranger 
A traveller Ohoohohh 
This is now my home, My home 
Oh Woah 
Burning on the back street 
Oh Woah 
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat 
Oh Woah 
And I'm blazing on the street 
What I do isn't upto you 
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two 
And my lungs hurt 
And my ears bled 
With the sounds of the city life 
Echoed in my head 
Do I need this, To keep me alive? 
The traffic stops and starts but I 
Need to move alone 
London calls me a stranger 
This is now my home, Home 
Oh Woah 
Burning on the back street 
Oh Woah 
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat 
Oh Woah 
And I'm blazing on the street 
What I do isn't upto you 
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two</field>

            <field name="lyrics">No I don't wanna hate you 
Just wish you'd never gone for the man 
And waited two weeks at least 
Before you let him take you 
I stayed true 
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school 
He's waiting for the time to move 
I knew he had his eyes on you 
He's not the right guy for you 
Don't hate me cos I write the truth 
No I would never lie to you 
But it was never fine to lose you 
And what a way to find out 
It never came from my mouth 
You never changed your mind 
But you were just afraid to mind out 
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it 
I'll make your little secret public its nothing 
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with 
in your closet to get back at me 
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep 
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack 
So casually 
You're practically my family 
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be 
But tragically our love just lost the will to live 
But would I kill to give it one more shot 
I think not 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't want you no 
Anymore 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't wanna love you no 
Anymore 
Recently I tend to zone out 
Up in my headphones to Holocene 
You promised your body but I'm away so much 
I stay more celibate than in a monastery 
I'm not cut out for life on the road 
Cos I didn't know I'd miss you this much 
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me 
I guess I'm not the man that you need 
Ever since you went to uni 
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack 
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad 
But when I broke the industry 
That's when I broke your heart 
I was supposed to chart and celebrate 
But good things are over fast 
I know it's hard to deal with and see this 
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features 
Then I turn the music off 
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus 
I never really want to believe this 
Got advice from my dad and he 
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need 
I guess I'm unaware of it 
Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't want you no 
Anymore 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't wanna love you no 
Anymore 
And since you left 
I've given up my days off 
It's what I need to stay strong 
I know you have a day job 
But mine is 24/7 
I fell like writing a book 
I guess I lied in the hook 
Cos I still love you and I need you by my side 
If I could 
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist 
In 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid 
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink 
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and its 
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts 
That I'm trying to kill 
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27 
I'll die from a thrill 
Go down in history as just a wasted talent 
Can I face the challenge 
Or did I make a mistake erasing 
It's only therapy 
My thoughts just get ahead of me 
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be 
Either way I guess I'm not prepared 
But I'll say this 
These things happen for a reason and you can't change 
Take my apology 
I'm sorry for the honesty 
But I had to get this off my chest 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't want you no 
Anymore 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't wanna love you no 
Anymore</field>

And of all the harm that e'er I've done, alas it was to none but me 
And all I've done for want of wit, to memory now I can't recall 
So fill to me the parting glass 
goodnight and joy be with you all 
Of all the comrades that e'er 
I had, they're sorry for my going away 
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had 
They would wish me one more day to stay 
But since it falls unto my lot that 
I should rise and you should not 
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call, 
"goodnight and joy be with you all!" 
A man may drink and not be drunk, 
a man may fight and not be slain 
A man may court a pretty girl 
and perhaps be welcomed back again 
But since it has so ordered been 
by a time to rise and a time to fall 
Come fill to me the parting glass, 
Good night and joy be with you all 
Good night and joy be with you all</field>

Your consciousness sinks 
Tears from a crocodile

Giving me the speech 
You try to, don't reach 
Your smile 
You're holding your tears 
Your inside is dead 
You're eating your fears 
In a cigarette 
You've waited too long 
To finally see 
The sunshine in the rain 
Is as deep as the sea 
I've taken the blow 
It's all down on paper 
Had fun in the snow 
But no? see you later? 
You're wasting your time 
Giving me the speech 
You try to, don't reach 
Your smile 
You're holding your tears 
Your inside is dead 
You're eating your fears

Won't leave me in peace 
My mind was running back 
To the west coast of Clare 
Thinking of you 
And the times we had there 
I walked to Spanish Point 
I knew I'd find you there 
I stood on the white strand 
You were everywhere 
Vivid memories fade 
But the mood still remains 
I wish I could go back 
And be with you again 
In Milltown there's a pub 
It's there that I sat down 
I see you everywhere 
Your face is all around 
The search for times past 
Contains such sweet pain 
I'll banish lonesome thoughts 
But they'll return again 
I walk along the shore 
The rain in my face 
My mind is numb with grief 
Of you there is no trace 
I'll think of this again 
In far off lands I roam 
Walking with you 
By this cold Atlantic fog 
Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief 
Memories I have of you 
Won't leave me in peace 
My mind was running back 
To the west coast of Clare 
Thinking of you

            <field name="lyrics">I keep my hopes and dreams inside of you 
Amongst the other things 
My mother seems to never see the bruises 
That I'm covering 
Never been known as my government name 
My foster home is where I've been placed away 
From the pain 
And now you sit before me with a folder 
Holding my story, you're my savior with nothing on me 
But power and glory 
And surely you'll never ignore me 
'cause when the the call came 
The court date was made to disappear for me 
You think you understand me 
But never what I went through 
But you were never meant to I won't hold it against you 
I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot 
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms 
Forget me not never let me stop 
You'll just sit and watch it's your job to be patient 
So you'll let me off 
So come with me take a walk on the wild side 
See life in a day through a child's eyes 
And these dreams are all I have to hold me 
When sleep's the only thing that I want to take me away 
Away 
Okay, session's over time to get back to the classroom 
I hate this lesson 
And I guess the teacher finds it hard too 
You told me I should try my best but guess what? 
I still find this trigonometry a head fuck 
Constantly told I won't pass my gcse's 
I'll end up in micky d's serving burgers and cheese 
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it 
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em 
Lately classmates think I'm crazy 
Turn up daily resembling bill bailey 
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it 
Without new clothes or shower it hard to do 
So after school you'll take me shopping 
For some new clothes 
But they'll get taken off me 
When I get back to the group home 
So come with me take a walk on the wild side 
See life in a day through a child's eyes 
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me 
When sleep's the only thing 
That I want to take me away, away</field>

Yeah, slumdon bridge 
Mr 
red, catfish 
Back me up 
Let's go 
I'm out to bark again, ball cracked on the target 
Demolish it 
Don't jump, I just see, nah, took a swattin', then 
Think while I jump back on the beat 
Like I need audiences 
To speak too like a leech, needs to retrieve blood 
Should I creep into these ambient sounds 
With the speech? obvious 
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy 
That's several pauses 
You might need a coffin 
With holes on the top of these tubes to receive oxygen 
You buried alive like a freak, six feet 
Clawing and snatching and clawin' like a cat 
And a dog and a rat 
And a hog in a pen 
With a frog and all there is to eat 
Is frog and they 
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth and jaws and then 
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of them 
See that you back to bars again 
He's all asleep in coffin, man 
I'm all, they all that's been, ever was at the start of it 
You mention the squad and then 
You mention the god of pens 
Not of it, but I'm harder then 
Flesh I'm harder than titanium brass plates 
That are polished in 
Sticking emcees off like a fly trap, or a bobby pin 
When I rap I'm astonishing 
I attack tracks like a train track 
Strapped to a bomb and send 
Shockwave's that's what I made 
Got this bastard popping then 
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin' 
Take shits on shih tzus 
Pisses on igloos 
Throw it up to the whole fucking world, it's sick too 
Vomitin' stomach fluid like you just ate shit stew 
Did I say shit again? do I give a shit, dude? 
Neither does [?] or they [?] 
Swimming in this ocean no, he just moves 
What I'm trying to say is, it's my motherfucking ocean 
And I crossed it 
Built a bridge, the slumdon bridge, holla!</field>

Feeling feelings I never felt 
The way you got me under your spell 
Don't you keep it all to yourself 
So won't you take it 
I feel like for the first time I am not faking 
Fingers on my buttons 
And now you're playing 
Master of anticipation 
Don't you keep it all to yourself 
Just a touch of your love is enough 
To knock me off of my feet all week 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
Just a touch of your love is enough 
To take control of my whole body 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
Photograph with no T-shirt on 
Why you making me wait so long? 
(Wait so long) 
I promise to keep this a secret, I'll never tell 
But don't you keep it all to yourself 
So won't you take it 
I feel like for the first time I am not faking 
Fingers on my buttons 
And now you're playing 
Master of anticipation 
Don't you keep it all to yourself (to yourself)

To knock me off of my feet all week 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
Just a touch of your love is enough 
To take control of my whole body 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
And now my whole week, my whole week is golden 
Can you see me glowing? 
That's how I feel 
And I'm not afraid to feed into emotions 
'Cause I know that this could be something real 
Just a touch of your love is enough 
To knock me off of my feet all week 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
Just a touch of your love, oh 
Just a touch of your love is enough 
To take control of my whole body

Midnight, november 
And you're still in my bed 
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya 
There's things we've never said 
So if I go for a little while longer 
When I'm home 
We can talk about the pitifuls of the road 
If you said "go" 
I would stop everything, oh 
My heart would play the role 
And act like it's never been broke 
Oh, my soul 
Lately, I really need to know 
How long, how long can we be touch and go 
Oh, my soul 
How long, how long can we be touch and go 
It's not enough to say "I want ya" 
'Cause I'll say anything 
I'm holding out to feel without a doubt 
I have just been questioned, yeah 
So if I go for a little while longer 
When I'm home 
We can talk about the pitifuls of the road 
If you said "go" 
I would stop everything, oh 
My heart would play the role 
And act like it's never been broke 
Oh, my soul 
Lately, I really need to know 
How long, how long can we be touch and go 
Oh, my soul 
How long, how long can we be 
All of my bones, they scream I'm right 
If you're taking me home to stay the night 
Darling, my soul, believe 
If you said "go" 
I would stop everything, oh 
My heart would play the role 
And act like it's never been broke 
Oh, my soul 
Lately, I really need to know 
How long, how long can we be touch and go 
Oh, my soul 
How long, how long can we be touch and go 
How long, how long can we be touch and go

I'm like "hey, what's up, hello" 
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in that door 
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll 
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove 
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low 
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando 
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go 
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos 
Got 50, 60 grand, 500 grams though 
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole 
Hit the strip club, we be letting bands go 
Everybody hating, we just call them fans though 
In love with the money, I ain't never letting go 
And I get high with my baby 
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby 
And I can ride with my baby 
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby 
And I get high with my baby 
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeaahh 
And I can ride with my baby 
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby 
I hit the strip with my trap queen cause all we know is bands 
I just might snatch up a 'Rari and buy my boo a Lamb' 
I might just snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring 
She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything 
It's big Zoo Wap from the bando, without dinero can't go 
Remy boys got the stamp, though 
Count up hella, them bands though 
How far can your bands go? 
Fetty Wap I'm living fifty thousand K how I stand though 
If you checkin' for my pockets I'm like 
And I get high with my baby

Shake the thing your mother gave ya! 
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart 
Be on your worst behaviour 
I'd wager that you're gonna take it 
Make you fight nature, born and raised in 
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night 
Turn off the dark, put on the light 
And he said 'You and your big cheeks have got me' 
Along with 'Disarm' and 'Flooded Quarry' 
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox 
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks 
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black 
You make the room's hands laugh as they clap 
You make my mouth water with support acts 
They could even match you in talent - ignore that! 
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain't wrong 
He's got me singing to 'Amerikan Folk Song' 
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry 
You gotta know your enemy 
Gotta check your distance 
Don't talk, only whisper 
Slap the base so hard you get blisters 
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom 
Jp beat-box, feet as flip-flops 
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock 
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand 
This ain't no fake, it's music in your hand 
As you run into the centre of the crowd 
Silence falls like water 
You just wanna shout 'Wow!' 
How did they even have the guts to do it ? 
If your name's Nizlopi, then there ain't much to it 
'Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now</field>

Like lots of other boys and girls 
One's at home with my family and the other's school 
Where I learn all that I can be 
I live in two different worlds 
I live in two different worlds 
In home I can speak whenever I please 
I can talk real loud and shoot the breeze 
At school I raise my hand in the air 
When there's something that I want to share 
At home we go 
At school we go 
At home we go 
At school we go 
I live in two different worlds 
I live in two different worlds 
At home I can sit here and there 
In the couch, my bed or easy chair 
In school I have a special place 
My desk, and that's my learning space 
At home we go 
At school we go 
At home we go 
At school we go 
I live in two different worlds 
I live in two different worlds 
School got more rules 
Because learning is a goal 
Learning takes focus, so you need self control 
In home I move wherever I like 
I can run around and ride my bike 
In school we have a different way 
We stand in line everyday 
At home we go 
At school we go 
At home we go 
At school we go 
I live in two different worlds 
I live in two different worlds 
Home and school are two different worlds 
Two awesome worlds</field>

The only evidence that you've been here before 
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore 
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes 
Never getting dry, so I get high 
Smoke away the days never sleep with the light on 
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye 
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night 
I don't drink like everybody else 
I do it to forget things about myself 
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got 
My mind's with you but my heart's just not 
So am I close to you anymore if it's over? 
And there's no chance that we'll work it out 
That's why you and I 
Ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine 
But you're the only one that knows I lied 
You and I 
Ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine 
But you're the only one that knows I lied 
Everybody said we'd be together forever 
But I know that I never wanna settle down 
Come around, break up the love like Lego now 
Never wanna turn into another "like you" 
Sleep with my thoughts and I dance with my views 
Everything's great, not everything's sure 
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus 
Now I'm in position to be another stalker 
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward 
Like our last kiss it was perfect 
But we were nervous on the surface 
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it 
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts 
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative 
And go back to the day 
We fell in love on first kiss 
So am I close to you anymore if it's over? 
And there's no chance that we'll work it out 
That's why you and I 
Ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine 
But you're the only one that knows I lied 
You and I 
Ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine 
But you're the only one that knows I lied 
Because if I was gonna go somewhere 
I'd be there by now 
And maybe I can let myself down 
And I'm thinking I'm unaware 
I keep my feet on the ground 
And keep looking around to make sure 
I'm not the only one to feel low 
Because if you want 
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered 
From all that I've done wrong 
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one 
But I know God made another one of me 
To love you better than I ever will 
'Cause you and I 
Ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine 
But you're the only one that knows I lied 
You and I 
Ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine 
But you're the only one that knows I lied</field>

With your name 
And take my passport out again 
Just replace it 
See, I could do without 
A tan on my left hand 
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle 
And I should run you a hot bath 
And fill it up with bubbles 
'Cause maybe you're loveable 
And maybe you're my snowflake 
And your eyes turn from green to grey 
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place 
And you should never cut your hair 
'cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder 
And you will never know, just how beautiful you are to me 
But maybe I'm just in love 
When you wake me up 
And would you ever feel guilty? 
If you did the same to me 
Would you make me a cup of tea 
To open my eyes in the right way? 
And I know you love shrek 
'Cause we've watched it twelve times 
But, maybe you're hoping for a fairytale too 
And if your dvd breaks today 
You should've gotten a VCR 
'Cause I've never owned a blue-ray, true say 
And I've always been shit at computer games 
And your brother always beats me 
And if I lost, I'd got cross 
Then chuck all the controllers at the tv 
And then you'd laugh at me 
And be asking me, if I'm gonna be home next week 
And then you'd lie with me, 'til I fall asleep 
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets 
And you will never know, just how beautiful you are to me 
But maybe I'm just in love 
When you wake me up 
And I think you hate the smell of smoke 
You always try get me to stop 
You drink as much as me, and I get drunk a lot 
So I'll take you to the beach 
And walk along the sand 
And I'll make you a heart pendant 
With a pebble held in my hand 
And I'll carve it like a necklace 
So the heart falls where your chest is 
And now a piece of me, is a piece of the beach 
And it falls just where it needs to be 
And rests peacefully 
You just need to breathe 
To feel my heart against yours now 
Against yours now 
So maybe I'm just in love 
When you wake me up 
But maybe I'm just in love 
When you wake me up 
Maybe I fell in love 
When you woke me up</field>

Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone 
He tried to live, no effort was shown 
He's slowly finding a way back home 
He had a family with smiles and frowns 
They never could solve his way to be down 
Cos he's one dog who don't want a bone 
He's slowly finding a way back home 
He had a nice house with windows and doors 
He said to his wife what's mine is yours 
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown 
He's slowly finding a way back home 
His children have left but the rooms are still there 
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair 
But far from the nest the babies have flown 
He's slowly finding a way back home 
His wife was an angel sent from above 
He never returned her kisses or love 
But soon he'd found that she'd overgrown 
This man who's finding a way back home 
So the leaves are all dead in this broken man's june 
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon 
He stares at the floor, no more to roam 
He's slowly finding a way back home 
Well I once heard a story about a run-down home 
Where a man with regrets lived all alone 
He tried to live, no effort was shown 
He'll never find a way back home</field>

I miss your tears 
I miss your rambling 
About your fears 
Your smile 
The crowed has gathered 
All around 
No ones speaking 
No one makes a sound 
And I 
And we break down 
We lose touch 
Sometimes 
We are 
Alone 
We break down 
We lose touch 
Sometimes 
Alone 
Alone now.. 
(x5) 
They're never gonna change you 
They're never gonna change me 
They're never gonna change us 
We'll always stay the same 
We break down 
We lose touch 
Sometimes 
We are 
We break down 
We lose touch 
Sometimes 
We are 
We break down 
We lose touch 
Sometimes 
We are 
Alone</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon 
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song 
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in 
Politics, religions or other people's quarrels" 
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
I know when I have children 
They will know what it means 
And I pass on these things my family's given to me 
Just love and understanding, positivity 
We could change this whole world with a piano 
Add a bass, some guitar 
Grab a beat and away we go 
I'm just a boy with a one-man show 
No university, no degree, but lord knows 
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth 
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios 
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote 
Sing, love could change the world in a moment 
But what do I know? 
Love can change the world in a moment 
But what do I know? 
Love can change the world in a moment 
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away 
I saw people marching in the streets today 
You know we are made up of love and hate 
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade 
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams 
Just re-remember life 
Is more than fittin' in your jeans 
It's love and understanding, positivity 
We could change this whole world with a piano 
Add a bass, some guitar 
Grab a beat and away we go 
I'm just a boy with a one-man show 
No university, no degree, but lord knows 
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth 
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios 
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote 
Sing, love could change the world in a moment 
But what do I know? 
Love can change the world in a moment 
But what do I know? 
Love can change the world in a moment 
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me 
So let's all get together, we can all be free 
Spread love and understanding, positivity 
We could change this whole world with a piano 
Add a bass, some guitar 
Grab a beat and away we go 
I'm just a boy with a one-man show 
No university, no degree, but lord knows 
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth 
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios 
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote

We’ll fight and then make up 
I’ll breathe your air into my lungs

Tell me your secrets

Grows around the blooming heather 
Would you go, lassie, go? 
And I will build my love a bower 
And yon pure crystal fountain 
And around it I will place 
All the colors of the mountain 
Would you go, lassie, go? 
And we'll all go together 
Where the wild mountain thyme 
Grows around the blooming heather 
Would you go, lassie, go? 
And If my true love's gone 
I will surely find another 
And to her I will sing 
Things that make her know I want her 
Would you go, lassie, go? 
And we'll all go together 
Where the wild mountain thyme 
Grows around blooming heather 
Would you go, lassie, go?</field>

At the bottom of my stomach 
She put my hand on her chest 
While she looked into my eyes 
You rescued me 
And called up these words in threes 
And you know I can't forget it 
And 10 months on you liberate truth 
See, I was wrong on how I hate you 
And it's the worst thing that I did 
When I read through you 
You weren't translated 
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages 
So I'd be free from it 
See, all this truth sparks lies in me 
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy 
The key is just to ignore 
Even if this time has made me unsure 
And 12 months on I'm back in my mood 
See, I got drunk and said I loved you 
And it's the worst thing that I did 
When I read through you 
You weren't translated

            <field name="lyrics">The thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid 
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit 
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it 
Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute? 
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones 
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones 
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum 
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots 
What's better than thinking about the ones you love? 
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love 
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above 
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up 
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan 
No one here to save the day now you're all alone 
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth 
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone 
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes 
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when 
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you 
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you 
I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile 
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind 
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say "Yes Nan" 
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying "Yes Nan" 
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one 
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like 
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like 
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write 
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine 
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die 
And when I'm gone I want my music to play 
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry 
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made 
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly 
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it 
I work round the clock I don't stop at night 
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes 
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when 
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you 
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you</field>

My knees feel weak and I fell too fast 
The tide is high but we swam in too deep 
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece 
You can take away all this mess 
And I could never think anything less of you 
'Cos you break me 
You numb me 
You still seem to stun me 
This pain has outrun me 
You are all I have left 
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms 
To spur this on we left that room too long 
You open wide and all the lies flow out 
To eat you whole 
But we both know that you're too cold 
And she said 'I can put away all those lies 
And show you there's no surprise in me' 
Well still, you break me 
You numb me 
You still seem to stun me 
This pain has outrun me 
You are all that I have left 
Exorcise these demons 
But they keep talking to me 
I am no believer 
But I believe you will relieve me 
I believe you will relieve me 
And that's what's going on 
'Cos you break me 
You numb me 
You still seem to stun me 
This pain has outrun me 
You are all that I have left 
You break me</field>

For fuck's sake 
(Ed Sheeran) 
Living the life of a student 
Yeah, I begin on a high 
Losing my mind 
And they say that I've been winning for time 
Never been to a gun fight, never needed a knife 
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines 
Sit on the side, with a rhyme pad 
With a tin in my sights 
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends 
Cause I paid in my pride 
Giving the time to write rhymes 
But I find truth at a quarter to five 
Eh 
(Yelawolf) 
It's kinda like I took a train 
To the left side of my brain, oh, main 
Toddle some mud, under my door 
You know I'm stepping in my own lane 
All of these speakers sitting behind me 
But what psychology, psychologically insane 
Part of me wanna get down, down, down 
Making you go low, inside 
(Ed Sheeran) 
You don't know, if you don't know by now 
You better tell him 'bout it 
What you gonna tell him bout it? 
Yeah, yeaaaah 
(Yelawolf) 
Ten toes to the dirt 
Pencil to the paper 
God has a favour for your thirst 
Drink-drink ya pint bye-bye 
To this bullshit praise allah 
To the wheels I'm a ridah 
Steering your prada 
Only closed in my ada-di-das 
I'm a fetus in my boom sake nana 
Daddy's home, on the mic, hey papa 
(Ed Sheeran) 
Back with my bang yo, straight loop on my ? 
But every single one of my fans know that 
Every damn show, I'm taking their ears on a journey 
Like I'm flying overseas with Van Gogh 
Livin' so sweet without Gretel and Hansel 
Critics hate the lyrics cause they think I've been tangoed 
Find me wearing old clothes rocking a Kangol 
I'm riding round with Yelawolf in your daddy's Lambo 
(Yelawolf) 
Hello me, how ya been? 
You got a mullet again like when you was 10 
You're probably sipping sweet tee's, you still huh? 
And your piggy bank is full of change 
Fact, what you used to steal from 
You been playing fools, like a steel drum 
Pulling out early, and they still come 
Eating from the game, when you know the meal's done 
Yelawolf is kicking back at these pilgrims 
Hold up baby, sit still son 
Woah, this old rock, it heals been rolled 
Still shocking when I see 'em go 
Bananas and they hammer the ? 
(Hook) 
You don't know, if you don't know by now 
You better tell him 'bout it 
What you gonna tell him 'bout it? 
Yeah, yeaaaah 
(Yelawolf) 
I'm not the average half wit 
After this hour gets out of this 
60 seconds I'm going in any directions 
And chasing this jack with a shot of Budweiser and water 
It's probably the better idea you move the direction in 
Fact its a part of me to be the looser of cannons 
Blowing his fucking mics like the winds ? 
Hooligans, hooligans, hooligans 
But really who's a friend? 
Jump in this little fire jump right back in the pool again 
Know I be new again 
A student of you my friend 
Marshall Mathers, I'm tossing rappers up at my crew of 10 
Minus 4, minus war 
You don't want it 
Shady records I'm already better, fuck it, doggonnit 
Dog don't gotta lead 
Dog's already home 
Jack, dog I'm a beast, I'm a wolf 
Bring your dogs back 
A melody man in a melancholic mellow yellow can 
Shhh, tell him how we gonna sell 'em man 
Been working hard all week 
(So if you wonder if we earned it, well its not a probably) 
So won't you bring that back to me 
(And holla when you hear it like all the screams of a halloween) 
I got blisters on my feet 
(To walk in night with you is not the shoes to be borrowing) 
So won't you bring that back to me 
(Cause all the sole of my pin is what all the sorrow brings) 
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no 
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no 
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no

Thinking' of making' a new sound 
Playing a different show every night 
In front of a new crowd 
That's you now ciao 
Seems that life is great now 
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud 
I can't, no I wont hush 
I say the words that make you blush 
I'm gonna sing this now 
See I'm true my songs are where my heart is 
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists 
I'm not you now that would be disastrous 
Let me sing and do my thing 
I move to greener pastures 
See I'm real I do it all it's all me 
I'm not fake don't ever call me lazy 
I won't stay put give me the chance be free 
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me 
Cos you need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
At all you need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
At all you need me 
I sing I write my own tune and I write my 
Own verse hell 
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell 
Call yourself a singer writer you're just bluffing 
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing 
I sing fast I know that all my shit's cool 
I will blast and I didn't go to brits' school 
I came fast with the way I act right 
I can't last if I smoking on a crack pipe 
And I won't be a product of my genre 
My mind will always be stronger, than my songs are 
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya 
Always read the stories that you hear in wikipedia 
And musically I'm demonstrating 
When I perform live it feels like I am meditating 
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me 
Young singer writer like a gabriella cilmi 
Cos you need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
Until you need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
Until you need me 
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right 
I won't stop till my name is in light 
Stadium heights with damien rice 
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights 
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice 
Long nighter, short heigh, and I'm going hyper 
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter 
yeah the game's over but now I'm on a new level 
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal 
People think that I'm bound to blow up 
I've done around about a thousand shows 
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch 
So you could be the lyrics when I'm singing them out 
From day one, I've been prepared 
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair 
So now I'm back to this sofa giving a dose 
Of what the future holds 
Cos' it's another day, plus 
I keep my last name forever keep the genre 
Pretty basic 
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it 
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift 
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces 
I'm selling cd's from my rucksack aiming for the papers 
Selling cd's from my rucksack aiming for the majors 
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back 
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache 
I hit back when the pen hurts me 
I'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee 
I'm still the same as a year ago 
But more people hear me though 
According to the myspace and youtube videos 
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio 
Truly broke never growing up call me Rufio 
Melody music maker, reading all the papers 
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in 
An elevator 
Cos you need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
At all you need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
You need me man I don't need you 
At all you need me 
Man, I don't need you</field>

In a warm cold April rain 
We barely went outdoors 
And your family took the blame 
Take time to be with you 
She can only glare 
I'm a bad influence, that'll do 
‘Cos I need to cut my hair 
Wash my mouth, change my clothes 
Just don't talk to those friends of yours 
Tell them not to come here anymore 
Time to go, don't be slow 
This'll only take a mo' 
Take yourself right out of my door 
It's just that they don't care 
Dad said beware, watch your back 
ajust don't reply to that woman there 
And even if she makes a fuss 
Just ignore that trust 
And don't give in to lust 
And leave that one alone 
The girl's trouble 
Time spent in burnt-down shed 
Add up near two days 
Fall down and cut my head 
Take time to misbehave 
Spend time and be with you 
She can only glare 
‘Cos you're a bad influence, that'll do 
Boy you need to cut your hair 
Wash your mouth, change your clothes 
Just don't talk to those friends of yours 
Tell them not to come here anymore 
Time to go, don't be slow 
This'll only take a mo' 
Take yourself right out of my door

Dad said beware, watch your back 
Just don't reply to that woman there 
And even if she makes a fuss 
Just ignore that trust 
And don't give in to lust 
And leave that one alone 
This is the dancing song 
Close your eyes 
Hypnotise to the beat 
And the movement of the week 
Do that shuffle of your feet 
And pound out the fever, either 
Dance as you're a true believer 
Cleaner lives are what you don't see 
Fell the weight, gravitate 
Feel the pace of me 
This world is 2d 
The only thing that's free in life is love 
And that don't come cheap 
It's just that they don't care 
Dad said beware, watch your back 
Just don't reply to that woman there 
And even if she makes a fuss

Can't control what I'm into 
 
London calls me a stranger 
A traveler 
This is now my home, my home 
I'm burning on the back street 
Stuck here sitting in the backseat 
I'm blazing on the street 
What I do isn't up to you 
And if the city never sleeps 
Then that makes two 
 
The pavement is my friend 
And it will take me where I need to go 
I find it trips me up 
And puts me down 
This is not what I'm used to 
The shop across the road 
Fulfills my needs and gives me company 
When I need it 
Voices speak through my walls 
I don't think I'm gonna make it 
Past tomorrow 
 
London calls me a stranger 
A traveler 
This is now my home, my home 
I'm burning on the back street 
Stuck here sitting in the backseat 
I'm blazing on the street 
What I do isn't up to you 
And if the city never sleeps 
Then that makes two 
 
And my lungs hurt 
And my ears bled 
With the sound of the city life 
Echoed in my head 
Do I need this to keep me alive? 
The traffic stops and starts 
But I need to move along 
 
London calls me a stranger 
This is not my home, home 
I'm burning on the back street 
Stuck here sitting in the backseat 
I'm blazing on the street 
What I do isn't up to you 
And if the city never sleeps 
Then that makes two</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I wanna be drunk when I wake up 
On the right side of the wrong bed 
And every excuse I made up 
Tell you the truth I hate 
What didn't kill me 
It never made me stronger at all 
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me 
So now I'll maybe leave back there 
I'm sat here wishing I was sober 
I know I'll never hold you like I used to 
 
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating 
Without you to hold I'll be freezing 
Can't rely on my heart to beat it 
'Cause you take part of it every evening 
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing 
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me 
 
Should I, should I? 
Maybe I'll get drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
To feel a little love 
 
I wanna hold your heart in both hands 
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can 
And I've got no plans for the weekend 
So shall we speak then 
Keep it between friends 
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to 
 
There maybe other people like us 
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up 
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before 
You don't hold me anymore 
 
On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name 
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake 
You know I can't change as I began saying 
You cut me wide open like landscape 
Open bottles of beer but never champagne 
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make 
 
Should I, should I? 
Maybe I'll get drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
To feel a little love 
 
All by myself 
I'm here again 
All by myself 
You know I'll never change 
All by myself 
All by myself 
I'm just drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
To feel a little love</field>

'Cause lately I've been waking up alone 
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt 
Told you I'd let them go 
And that I'll fight my corner 
Maybe tonight I'll call ya 
After my blood turns into alcohol 
No, I just wanna hold ya 
 
Give a little time to me or burn this out 
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around 
All I want is the taste that your lips allow 
My, my, my, my, oh give me love 
My, my, my, my, oh give me love 
My, my, my, my, oh give me love 
My, my, my, my, oh give me love 
My, my, my, my, oh give me love 
 
Give me love like never before 
'Cause lately I've been craving more 
And it's been a while but I still feel the same 
Maybe I should let you go 
You know I'll fight my corner 
And that tonight I'll call ya 
After my blood is drowning in alcohol 
No I just wanna hold ya

Of all the money that e'er I had 
I've spent it in good company 
And all the harm that e'er I've done 
Alas it was to none but me 
And all I've done for want of width 
To memory now I can't recall 
So fill to me the parting glass 
Good night and joy be with you all 
 
Of all the comrades that ever I had 
They are sorry for my going away 
And all the sweethearts that ever I had 
They would wish me one more day to stay 
But since it falls unto my lot 
That I should rise and you should not 
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call 
Good night and joy be with you all 
 
A man may drink and not be drunk 
A man may fight and not be slain 
A man may court a pretty girl 
And perhaps be welcomed back again 
But since it has so ought to be 
By a time to rise and a time to fall 
Come fill to me the parting glass 
Good night and joy be with you all 
Good night and joy be with you all</field>

My heart is a foreigner, 
My eyes are the color of red like the sunset, 
I'll never keep it bottled up, 
Left to the hands of the coroner, 
Be a true heart not a follower, 
We're not done yet now, 
I see it in your movements tonight, 
If we can ever do this right, 
I'm never gonna let you down, 
Oh I'll never let you down, 
Now keep it on the down low 
And I'll keep you around so I'll know, 
That I'll never let you down, 
I'll never let you down. 
 
You're strumming on my heart strings 
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way, 
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground 
And never ever let you down, 
You're strumming on my heart strings 
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way, 
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground 
And never ever let you down 
 
My eyes are a river filler, 
This drink is a liver killer, 
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again, 
Your body is my ballpoint pen 
 
And your mind is my new best friend, 
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again, 
Now I see it in your movements tonight, 
If we should ever do this right, 
I'm never gonna let you down, 
Oh I'll never let you down, 
We'll keep it on the down low 
And I'll keep you around so I'll know,

You're strumming on my heart strings 
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way, 
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground 
And never ever let you down 
 
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, 
And I'll never let you down 
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, 
And I'll never let you down 
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, 
And I'll never let you down 
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now,

And your heart's against my chest, your lips pressed in my neck 
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet 
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now 
 
Kiss me like you wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
This feels like falling in love 
Falling in love 
We're falling in love 
 
Settle down with me 
And I'll be your safety 
You'll be my lady 
 
I was made to keep your body warm 
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms 
 
Oh no 
My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed in my neck 
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet 
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now 
 
Kiss me like you wanna be loved

This feels like falling in love 
Falling in love 
We're falling in love 
 
Yeah I've been feeling everything 
From hate to love 
From love to lust 
From lust to truth 
I guess that's how I know you 
So I hold you close to help you give it up 
 
So kiss me like you wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved 
This feels like falling in love 
Falling in love 
We're falling in love 
 
Kiss me like you wanna be loved 
You wanna be loved

And build a Lego house 
When things go wrong we can knock it down 
 
My three words have two meanings 
There's one thing on my mind, it's all for you 
 
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm 
And if you're broken I'll mend ya 
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now 
 
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love 
I'll pick you up when you're getting down 
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now 
 
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind 
I'll do it all for you in time 
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now 
 
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in 
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall 
 
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before 
And I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours 
 
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love 
I'll pick you up when you're getting down 
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now 
 
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind, I'll do it all for you in time 
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now 
 
Don't hold me down 
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take 
 
And if it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm 
And if you're broken I'll mend ya 
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now 
 
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love

Breathing in snowflakes 
Burnt lungs, sour taste 
 
Lights gone, days end 
Struggling to pay rent 
Long nights, strange men 
 
And they say 
She's in the class A team 
Stuck in her daydream 
Been this way since eighteen 
But lately her face seems 
Slowly sinking, wasting 
Crumbling like pastries 
 
And they scream 
The worst things in life come free to us 
'Cause we're just under the upper hand 
And go mad for a couple grams 
And she don't want to go outside, tonight 
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland 
Or sells love to another man 
It's too cold outside 
For angels to fly, for angels to fly 
 
Ripped gloves, raincoat 
Tried to swim and stay afloat 
Dry house, wet clothes 
 
Loose change, bank notes 
Weary-eyed, dry throat 
Call girl, no phone 
 
And they say 
She's in the class A team 
Stuck in her daydream 
Been this way since eighteen 
But lately her face seems 
Slowly sinking, wasting 
Crumbling like pastries 
 
And they scream 
The worst things in life come free to us 
'Cause we're just under the upper hand 
And go mad for a couple grams 
But she don't want to go outside, tonight 
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland 
Or sells love to another man 
Its too cold outside 
For angels to fly 
An angel will die 
Covered in white 
Closed eye 
And hoping for a better life 
This time, we'll fade out tonight 
Straight down the line 
 
And they say 
She's in the class A team 
Stuck in her daydream 
Been this way since eighteen 
But lately her face seems 
Slowly sinking, wasting 
Crumbling like pastries 
 
They scream 
The worst things in life come free to us 
And we're under the upper hand 
And go mad for a couple grams 
And we don't want to go outside, tonight

For angels to fly, angels to fly 
To fly, fly 
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly 
Angels to die</field>

Watched you fall, now

Take me home 
Watch me fall 
Down to earth 
Take me back for

The only evidence that you've been here before 
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore 
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes 
Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light on 
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye 
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night 
I don't drink like everybody else 
End up forgetting things about myself 
I'm stubborn I'm forward head's just blocked 
My head's still with you but my hearts just not 
 
So am I close to you anymore if it's over 
And there's no chance that we'll work it out 
That's why you and I ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied 
You and I ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied 
 
Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that 
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now 
Never wanna turn into another like you 
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views 
Everything's great but everything's short 
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus 
Now I'm in position to be another stalker 
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward 
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous 
On the surface 
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it 
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts 
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative 
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss 
 
So am I close to you anymore if it's over 
And there's no chance that we'll work it out 
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied 
You and I ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied 
 
Because if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now 
And maybe I can let myself down oh 
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground 
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not he only one to feel low 
Because if you want I'll take you in my arms 
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong 
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one 
But I know that god made another one of me 
To love you better than I ever will 
 
'Cause you and I ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied 
You and I ended over U-N-I 
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied</field>

With your name 
And take my passport out again 
And just replace it 
 
See I could do without a tan 
On my left hand, where my fourth finger meets my knuckle 
And I should run you a hot bath 
And fill it up with bubbles 
 
'Cause maybe you're lovable 
And maybe you're my snowflake 
And your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter I'll 
Hold you in a cold place 
And you should never cut your hair 
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder 
 
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me 
But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up 
 
And would you ever feel guilty 
If you did the same to me 
Would you make me a cup of tea 
To open my eyes in the right way 
And I know you love Shrek 
'Cause we've watched it twelve times 
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too 
And if your DVD breaks, today 
You shoulda got a VCR 
'Cause I never owned a Blu-Ray 
True say 
 
And now I've always been s*** at computer games and your brother always beats me 
And if I lost, I go all cross 
And chuck all the controllers at the TV 
And then you'd laugh at me 
And be asking me 
If I'm gonna be home next week 
And then you'd lie with me till I fall asleep 
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets 
 
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me 
But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up 
 
I think you hate the smell of smoke 
You always tryna get me to stop 
But you drink as much as me 
And I get drunk a lot 
 
So I'll take you to the beach 
And walk along the sand And I'll 
Make you a heart pendant 
With a pebble held in my hand 
 
And I'll carve it like a necklace 
So the heart falls where your chest is 
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be 
And rests peacefully 
So you just need to breathe 
To feel my heart against yours now 
Against yours now 
 
'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up 
 
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up 
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up</field>

Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd

See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud 
And I can't, no, I won't hush 
I'll say the words that make you blush 
I'm gonna sing this now 
 
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is 
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists 
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous 
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures 
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me 
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy 
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free

You need me man, I don't need you at all 
You need me 
 
I sing and write my own tune 
And I write my own verso 
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell 
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing 
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing 
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool 
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School 
I came fast with the way I act, right 
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe 
 
And I won't be a product of my genre 
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are 
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya 
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia 
And musically I'm demonstrating 
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating 
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me 
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi' 
 
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all 
You need me, man, I don't need you 
 
You need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all 
You need me 
 
'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right 
I won't stop till my name's in light 
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice 
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights 
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice 
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper 
 
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter 
The games over but now I'm on a new level 
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal 
 
People think that I'm bound to blow up 
I've done around about a thousand shows 
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch 
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow) 
 
From day one, I've been prepared 
With V05 wax for my ginger hair 
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds 
'Cause it's another day plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic 
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it 
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift 
Into another rappers shoes using new laces 
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers 
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors 
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back 
 
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache 
I hit back when the pen hurts me 
I'm still a choir boy in a French church tee 
I'm still the same as a year ago 
But more people hear me though 
According to the myspace and youtube videos 
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio 
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio 
Melody music maker 
Reading all the papers 
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator 
 
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all 
You need me, man, I don't need you 
 
You need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all 
You need me, man, I don't need you</field>

Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors 
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur 
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt 
 
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides 
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time 
Highbury estate's fine 
Smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines 
 
I haven't slept for the past week 
Two hours ain't enough for me 
I feel inspired at quarter to three am 
 
I haven't changed since our last meet 
I'm still getting all my meals for free 
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again 
 
It's not a homeless life for me 
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be 
 
And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my Ipod 
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up 
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on 
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong 
 
Truth be, never went to Uni 
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see 
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22, done 
Everything I need to except get a 2:1 
 
I haven't slept for the past week 
Two hours ain't enough for me 
I feel inspired at quarter to three am 
 
I haven't changed since our last meet 
I'm still getting all my meals for free 
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again 
 
It's not a homeless life for me 
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be 
 
When I feel cold you keep me warm 
And I'm not looking for some loose change 
Just wanna find a true mate 
Who wants to be my duvet 
 
It's not a homeless life for me 
It's just I'm home, less than I'd like to be</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Lying in a bedroom 
Lighting up a Benson 
Face hair is growing 
So I cut with a vengeance 
Hey, did I mention 
As she makes an entrance 
Said I had a tendency 
To finish off a sentence 
 
Oh well, she's a local girl 
No make-up 
Cos she knows me well 
Hair tied up in elastic band 
With a kiss on the cheek 
For her one-night man 
 
Is it fast food 
I'll regret it after 
And I needed money 
But I'm too shy to ask her 
So she buys me chips and cheese 
And I tell her I love her 
And she's all I need 
I take it with a cold glass 
Of the fruit and the barley 
She's still a sucker for the 
Apple and Bacardi 
Heading to the party 
Sitting in the car seat 
B.E.P. on radio 
It makes me feel naughty 
 
She knows me well 
Bit of a catch 
To have a local girl 
Hair tied up in elastic band 
With a kiss on the cheek 
For her one-night man 
I don't wanna go alone 
I don't wanna go alone 
I don't wanna go alone 
 
Tell her that I love her 
Tell her that I need her 
Tell her that she's more 
Than a one-night stand 
Tell her that she turns my cheeks 
The colour of my hair 
All I wanna do is be near 
 
Tell her that I want her 
Tell her that I need her 
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand 
Tell her that I love her 
More than anyone else 
If you don't, then I'll tell her myself 
 
And we've got love in us 
So if the drink kill us 
We're gonna dance all night 
Till the floor fillers 
If we talk outside 
I say I hate wasps too 
I don't really dance 
So I'll just watch you 
Are you taking me back tonight? 
Tell me if that's alright 
I don't wanna be here 
I'm not the sofa type 
Tell me if you have a toothbrush 
You don't mind sharing 
She said I wanna take off 
What you're wearing 
I don't wanna go alone 
I don't wanna go alone 
I don't wanna go alone 
 
Tell her that I love her 
Tell her that I need her 
Tell her that she's more 
Than a one-night stand 
Tell her that she turns my cheeks 
The colour of my hair 
All I wanna do is be near 
Tell her that I want her 
Tell her that I need her 
Tell her that she's more 
Than a one-night stand 
Tell her that I love her 
More than anyone else 
If you don't, I'll tell her myself 
 
She's like the fast food 
I'll regret it after 
And I needed money 
But I'm too shy to ask her 
But she buys me chips and cheese 
So I tell her that she's all I need 
 
Tell her that she's more

Tell her that she turns my cheeks

            <field name="lyrics">Hmm let me go, 
To see my family. 
Please Father let me go, 
As my mother sleeps. 
 
I don't know about days gone, 
But round here nobody lives twice. 
When your gone, your gone, without no bye, 
Cause only a judge can give you life. 
This is my advice, 
Trust me, I nearly lost my life. 
3 weeks after I got this ride 
It seems like I had too much wine. 
Which that I I didn't get one, 
Anyway, I was going to the [?] booked for a set, 
Even though I didn't have a set one. 
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one. 
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one. 
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination, 
Then I was off to the next one, 
20 minutes later I was on the M1, 
Tired. 
But I kept on going, 
Fell asleep without even knowing. 
No emotion in my face, 
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going. 
Woke up, 
Lorry, 
Flash, 
Panic, 
Break, 
Skid, 
Crash, 
Skidded, 
More, 
Bang, 
Smash, 
Out, 
Cold, 
Ribs, 
Cracked, 
Ouch. 
I was in so much pain, 
Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini, 
When I was still on the first lane. 
Baffled, didn't even know my name. 
Fainted, too much shock in my brain. 
Surrounded by paramedics and feds, 
Trying to get up but fainted again. 
 
See I just want you to take a second, hear me out. 
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out. 
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared, 
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go, 
To see my family, 
And keep it inside, 
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps. 
Save my soul, 
Please Father let me go. 
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps. 
 
Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open, 
I can hear voices and my phone ringing. 
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning, 
One of the worst situations I've been in. 
I can hear all of the angels singing. 
 
But when it stopped humming, 
My brain turned on, stared running. 
Still in pain, but it started numbing, 
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning. 
I still tried to do a few shows cause I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming. 
But I was left with a permanent problem, 
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside). 
Ever so cunning, 
6 weeks later, jogging and running. 
I used the first aid kit like a drum set, 
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming. 
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes, 
You can't afford to let one in. 
Never done dream for a while, 
The pipeline was blocked, 
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing. 
They say tomorrow never dies, 
But he forgot to tell you 'you can'. 
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang, 
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam. 
You can try beg for another, 
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show, 
Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother', 
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner. 
 
I just want you to take a second, hear me out. 
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out. 
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared. 
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go, 
To see my family. 
And keep it inside, 
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps. 
Save my soul, 
Please Father let me go. 
Keep me safe.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Hey 
Can you hear me? 
I just wanted to let you know 
Hm 
 
I hope you can hear what I write to you 
How could I say goodbye to you? 
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you 
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam' 
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels 
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
3 jobs in a day 
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free 
Just locked in a cage slaving 
They said they were gold in the pavements 
But you came and saw the road to amazement 
Broke your heart 
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast 
I hope your listening right 
I still think of you every Sunday 
No one can top your chicken and rice 
Even through the darkness times 
You held us all up because your vision was bright 
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
You never let anyone see your heartache 
You just got on with it 
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
And your words you would stand strong with it 
'Cause they were like warmth on a winter night 
But I was just too young to go on with it 
And there somethings I could try to do 
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you 
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you. 
 
And of the pieces of my soul 
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
You know I never want to be alone 
 
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
And will you think of me up there? 
Can I say goodbye to you? 
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
Can I say goodbye to you, oh 
 
I think you phoney 
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now 
I would be by your side when you needed me 
Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out?' 
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now 
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up 
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope 
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths 
I miss seeing a family, being a family 
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer 
Family problems have never been funny 
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia 
She took all our inheritance money 
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
I never forgive the way she betrayed us. 
There ain't a big enough reason 
Before I sell out my fam' I'll be giving up breathing 
But I guess that everyone's different 
Or should I say no one's perfect? 
She had happiness in front of her 
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing. 
Since you gone the foundations crumbled 
So building it back up is my next step 
I got all the bricks and the cement but 
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect 
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task 
Make it right, I must do 
And I ask cause I trust you 
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you. 
 
And of the pieces of my soul 
(Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time) 
You know I never wanna be alone 
 
I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air 
And will you think of me up there? 
Can I say goodbye to you? 
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
Can I say goodbye to you, oh 
 
It's just for now so I should hush 
I'll never get enough, I'll see you, when I see you but, 
I miss you 
Ohh how I miss you 
It's just for now so I should hush 
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but, 
I miss you 
Ohh how I miss you 
 
There ain't enough words to describe 
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused 
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood 
We were young and he said it was raping his broad 
And for the day police came to the door 
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth 
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
I never been able to say this before 
'Cause I was so inconsiderate 
You loved me unconditionally 
And I took advantage of it like a idiot. 
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with 
I really hope that you can forgive me 
You going away was a punishment 
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me 
But I still fight the emotions within me. 
 
I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air 
And will you think of me up there? 
And can I say goodbye to you? 
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face, 
Feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
And can I say goodbye to you? 
 
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air, 
And will you think of me up there? 
Can I say goodbye to you? 
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
Can I say goodbye to you?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be 
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe. 
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any 
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many 
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true 
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables 
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves 
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme 
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
"'Cause real will recognize real" is what my father says 
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away 
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow 
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close. 
 
Five o'clock with lights off 
Interview with a vampire 
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require 
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z 
Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers 
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired 
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying 
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game 
It's time to wage war 
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line 
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes, 
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines 
Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by 
 
[Chorus] 
I never sleep 
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be, 
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... 
The times I'm living in lately. 
 
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth 
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
Deliver the raps how I flow 
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron 
But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded 
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in 
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows 
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con 
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow 
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework 
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older 
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie 
Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die. 
Never die. 
 
Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws 
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes 
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze, 
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move 
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do, 
Driven young gentlemen 
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true! 
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em 
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em 
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got, 
I keep my pupils engaged, 
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake. 
 
[Chorus] 
I never sleep 
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be, 
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... [x4] 
The times I'm living in lately.</field>

But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see 
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease 
To the retrieve then I can't let them be 
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen? 
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week, 
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife, 
Right now it's better than it's never been 
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen 
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me, 
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak, 
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it. 
They chase dreams together like a slumber party, 
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing 
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading. 
 
[Chorus] 
When the darkness creeps in, 
I feel my nightmares watching me. 
And when my dreams are sleeping, 
I feel my nightmares watching me. 
Oh, oh, oh! 
I feel my nightmares watching me. 
 
You better wake up cause I am making moves, 
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms, 
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training, 
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze. 
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading, 
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em 
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her 
Now I'm taking control of my inception, 
cause they try to hit misses with my direction, 
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike, 
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night, 
The haters know where the family lives, 
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger. 
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it. 
They say sleep is the cause of death, 
But I hear shit because I am deaf 
Gang signs I'm N/A reading. 
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next. 
 
[Chorus] 
When the darkness creeps in, 
I feel my nightmares watching me. 
And when my dreams are sleeping, 
I feel my nightmares watching me. 
Oh, oh, oh! 
I feel my nightmares watching me. 
They watching me! They watch me sleep! 
 
Let me go! 
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality, 
And daydream about losing my sanity. 
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow. 
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed. 
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep 
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat. 
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep. 
See, all the dreams I'm fonder, 
You placed me in the team insomnia 
Now, I Mr hard worker, 
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up, 
And I missed my chance worst luck, 
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up 
Yeah, and I walked from ish, 
thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress 
 
[Chorus] 
When the darkness creeps in, 
I feel my nightmares watching me. 
And when my dreams are sleeping, 
I feel my nightmares watching me. 
Oh, oh, oh! 
I feel my nightmares watching me. 
Watching me!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Hi, my name is JME, there was a time when radio played me 
'Cause my music came from my heart, it was real to me 
But now it's a par 
I'm here struggling, keeping it real,  
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal, 
Sometimes I sit back and think JME just do one tune, make a couple G's and chill, 
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I'll never do it, I swear 
I didn't go through all that for this 
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is, unfair, straight  
Who could tell me different, look at me, determined, 
Man on a mission, my music is me, and I am my music 
So like it or lump it, I'm a do this 
 
I never had a playlist in my heart, oho 
Now I need an A list just to chart oho 
But I've been famous from the start oho 
How am I gonna make my mark? oho oh 
Are you gonna play me, though,  
This song was never meant for the radio 
I get in, forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing,  
And I don't have time for a playlist 
How much will you pay me though?  
The song was not a hit on the radio,  
Oho, oho, oho, oh, oh, oh 
 
Thank God for night clubs and the raves 
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves 
Unless we water it down, but cordial music is boring me now 
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is 
Or in this music scene, what your role is 
I'm still trying here, cause I'm a pioneer 
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears 
See I'm just telling you the truth 
Can't shoot the messenger, bullet proof booth, 
You won't hear me on the radio,  
But go to the rave and the crowd, they're raising roof 
Why is that? What's going on there? 
To tell you the truth, I don't really care 
I am my music, my music is me 
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be 
 
I never had a playlist in my heart, oho 
Now I need an A list just to chart oho 
But I've been famous from the start oho 
How am I gonna make my mark oho 
Are you gonna play me, though,  
This song was never meant for the radio 
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing,  
And I don't have time for a playlist 
How much will you pay me though?  
The song was not a hit on the radio,  
Oho, oho, oho, oh, oho, oh 
 
I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial 
Bleeding through the speakers, rhythm by the pile, 
So won't you hear me out? 
Never feel it from the base line, feel it in the club 
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub 
So won't you hear me out? 
Are you gonna play me, though,  
This song was never meant for the radio 
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing,  
And I don't have time for a playlist 
How much will you pay me though?  
The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh 
Are you gonna play me, though,  
This song was never meant for the radio 
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing,  
And I don't have time for a playlist 
How much will you pay me though?  
The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">These thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid 
the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits 
I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it 
Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute? 
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones 
Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones 
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum 
It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots 
 
Whats better than thinking about the ones you love 
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love 
I feel the same when I'm in the floor, see the sun above 
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up 
No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan 
No one here to save the day now you're all alone 
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth 
Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone 
 
 
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again 
I never close my eyes, 
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when) 
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you 
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you) 
 
I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile 
'Cause you're been trespassing, and you won't leave my mind 
Now even think about this, call me say, yes nan 
I'm 31 now I'm still saying yes nan 
You had to replace my mom, dad 2 parents in one 
I know your proud staring at your grandson 
I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I 
like 
Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write 
Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine 
Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die 
And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin' 
And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry 
I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must 
now I gotta fly 
My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock, 
I don't stop at night. 
 
 
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again 
I never close my eyes, 
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when) 
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you 
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you) 
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you 
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you).</field>

Passes by just like mine 
It's not complicated 
 
Another mind 
Another soul 
Another body to grow old 
It's not complicated 
 
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? 
Float down 
Like autumn leaves 
Hush now 
Close your eyes before the sleep 
And you're miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me 
 
Another tear 
Another cry 
Another place for us to die 
It's not complicated 
 
Another love that's gone to waste 
Another light lost from your face 
It's complicated 
 
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you? 
Float down 
Like autumn leaves 
Hush now 
Close your eyes before the sleep 
And you're miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me 
 
Ooh how I miss you 
My symphony played the song that carried you out 
Ooh how I miss you 
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay 
 
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? 
Float down 
Like autumn leaves 
Hush now 
Close your eyes before the sleep 
And you're miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me 
 
Touch down 
Like a seven four seven 
Or stay out and we'll live forever now</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Smoke alarm went off at night 
I woke up wiped the sleep out of my eye 
She left a note, I'll be back in five 
Well I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive 
 
Hey! 
 
I was told to put my job in front of you, 
But it won't hold me like you do 
 
But I do it for the love, 
Waiting on the gold rush 
Keep it on the edge 
Smoking on a roll up 
When I see my friends all they say is hold up 
And remember the time 
When we were in school, listening to grown ups 
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what 
You know how to sing 
But you don't know anything other than that 
 
So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way 
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way 
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way 
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way 
You wanna be loved 
 
I never told her that I liked 
The way she dances slightly out of time 
And pretends she knows the words, to a song she's never heard 
But I tell her all the time 
 
Hey! 
 
Well I was told to put my job in front of you 
But it won't hold me like you do 
 
But I do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush 
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up 
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up 
And remember the time 
When we were in school, listening to grown ups 
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what

            <field name="lyrics">If we take this bird in, with it's broken leg, 
We can nurse it, she said, 
Come inside for a little lie down with me, 
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worse thing. 
 
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder, 
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now? 
And let me hold you, oh. 
 
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth, 
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do, 
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet, 
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon, 
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird, 
My little bird. 
 
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew, 
We can lie down, so I'm next to you, 
Come inside for a little home made tea, 
And if you fall asleep, at least you're next to me, 
And if I wake up, say it's late love, go back to sleep, 
I'm covered by nature, and I'm safe now, 
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me. 
 
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth, 
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do, 
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet, 
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon, 
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird, 
My little bird, 
My little bird, 
My little bird. 
 
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love, 
You make me scream, then I made you cry, 
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die. 
 
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth, 
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do, 
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet, 
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon, 
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird, 
My little bird, whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, 
My little bird, 
My little bird, 
You're my little bird.</field>

I'm drunk off last nights whisky and coke 
She'll make me shiver without warning 
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke 
 
And you can stay with me forever 
Or you could stay with me for now 
 
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right 
Tell me if you need a loving hand 
To help you fall asleep tonight 
Tell me if I know 
Tell me if I do 
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to 
 
I'll wake with coffee in the morning 
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea 
Outside the day is up and calling 
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep 
 
Stay with me forever 
Or you could stay with me for now 
 
Tell me if I'm wrong 
Tell me if I'm right 
Tell me if you need a loving hand

Tell me if I know

Sew you heart to my sleeve

Shooting stars if it helps you sleep 
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe 
Feeling like you won't believe 
 
There's a firefly loose tonight 
Better catch it before it burns this place down 
And I lie if I don't feel so right 
But the world looks better through your eyes 
 
There's a firefly loose tonight 
Better catch it before it burns this place down 
And I lie if I don't feel so right 
But the world looks better through your eyes 
 
Teach my skin those new tricks 
Warm me up with your lips 
Heart to heart, melt me down 
It's too cold in this town 
Close your eyes, lean on me 
Face to mouth, lips to cheek 
Feeling numb in my feet 
You're the one 
To help me get to sleep 
 
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe

There's a firefly loose tonight 
Better catch it before it burns this place down

That left us on the floor 
And you breathe me 
Till you're not feeling sure 
Everything will brighten up 
If we go to Brighton 
I'll take you along the Pier 
Everything will lighten up 
If you feel too frightened 
I'll make it disappear, dear 
 
Darling, don't be nervous 
I'll understand 
If you'll let me go 
I did this on purpose 
Now, when I'm missing you 
I'll stop eating food 
And I'll squeeze into a dress

And then I'll see your bitterness 
And why you're leaving too 
Maybe, I'll put you to a test 
And say that I love you 
I think that I love you 
 
Sunny days 
That left my skin dark red 
You squeeze me 
Till these thoughts leave my head 
If it gets too complicated 
I'll give up and be frustrated 
Can you see what's wrong? 
If you feel like you've been hated 
This love's too overrated 
See what's going on, on

And say that I love you 
Now it seems you loved me too</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Now I don't wanna hate you 
Just wish you'd never gone for the man 
And waited two weeks at least 
Before you let him take you 
I stayed true 
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school 
He's waiting for the time to move 
I knew he had his eyes on you 
He's not the right guy for you 
Don't hate me cause I write the truth 
No I would never lie to you 
But it was never fine to lose you 
And what a way to find out 
It never came from my mouth 
You never changed your mind 
But you were just afraid to mind out 
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it 
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing 
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me 
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep 
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually 
You're practically my family 
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be 
But tragically our love just lost the will to live 
But would I kill to give it one more shot 
I think not 
 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't want you no 
Anymore 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't wanna love you no 
Anymore 
 
Recently I tend to zone out 
Up in my headphones to Holocene 
You promised your body but I'm away so much 
I stay more celibate than in a monastery 
I'm not cut out for life on the road 
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much 
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me 
I guess I'm not the man that you need 
Ever since you went to uni 
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack 
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad 
But when I broke the industry 
That's when I broke your heart 
I was supposed to chart and celebrate 
But good things are over fast 
I know it's hard to deal with and see this 
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features 
Then I turn the music off 
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus 
I never really want to believe this 
Got advice from my dad and he 
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need 
I guess I'm unaware of it 
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with 
 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't want you no 
Anymore 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't wanna love you no 
Anymore 
 
And since you left, I've given up my days off 
It's what I need to stay strong 
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook 
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could 
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist 
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid 
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink 
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's 
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill 
And I'd be writing my will before I'm twenty seven, I'll die from a thrill 
Go down in history as just a wasted talent 
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing? 
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me 
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be 
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this 
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit 
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty 
But I had to get this off my chest 
 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't want you no 
Anymore 
I don't love you baby 
I don't need you baby 
I don't wanna love you no 
Anymore</field>

Who asked for your hand 
'Cause you're waiting for me 
And I know, you're gonna be away a while 
But I've got no plans at all to leave 
And would you take away my hopes and dreams? 
Just stay with me 
 
All my senses come to life 
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I 
Have ever been and I'll never leave again 
'Cause you are the only one 
And all my friends have gone to find 
Another place to let their hearts collide 
Just promise me, you'll never leave again 
'Cause you are the only one 
 
Take my hand and my 
Heart and soul, I will 
Only have these eyes for you 
And you know, everything changes but 
We'll be strangers if, we see this through 
You could stay within these walls and bleed 
But just stay with me 
 
All my senses come to life 
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I

Just promise me, you'll always be a friend 
'Cause you are the only one 
 
I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost 
I am so gone, so tell me the way home 
I listen to sad songs, singing about love 
And where it goes wrong? 
 
All my senses come to life 
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I 
Have ever been and I'll never leave again 
Cause you are the only one 
And all my friends have gone to find 
Another place to let their hearts collide 
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend

I love your hair like that 
The way it falls on the side of your neck 
Down your shoulders and back 
 
We are surrounded by all of these lies 
And people who talk too much 
You've got that kind of look in your eyes 
As if no one knows anything but us 
 
And should this be the last thing I see 
I want you to know it's enough for me 
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need 
 
I'm so in love, so in love 
So in love, so in love 
 
You look so beautiful in this light 
Your silhouette over me 
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes 
Is the Tenerife sea 
 
And all of the voices surrounding us here 
They just fade out when you take a breath 
Just say the word and I will disappear 
Into the wilderness 
 
And should this be the last thing I see 
I want you to know it's enough for me 
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need 
 
I'm so in love, so in love 
So in love, so in love

Lumiere over me 
Lumiere, darling 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere, darling 
Lumiere over me

So in love, love, love, love, 
So in love

And I can't sweep you off of your feet 
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love 
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks 
 
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70 
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23 
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways 
Maybe just the touch of a hand 
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day 
And I just wanna tell you I am 
 
So honey now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
Maybe we found love right where we are 
 
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades 
And the crowds don't remember my name 
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm 
I know you will still love me the same 
 
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen 
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory 
 
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways 
Maybe it's all part of a plan 
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes 
Hoping that you'll understand 
 
But baby now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh 
 
(Ah la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la) 
 
So baby now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart

            <field name="lyrics">Oh, misty eye of the mountain below 
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls 
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke 
Keep watching over Durin's son 
 
If this is to end in fire 
Then we should all burn together 
Watch the flames climb high into the night 
Calling out for the rope, sent by and we will 
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey 
 
And if we should die tonight 
Then we should all die together 
Raise a glass of wine for the last time 
Calling out for the rope 
Prepare as we will 
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side 
Desolation comes upon the sky 
 
Now I see fire, inside the mountain 
I see fire, burning the trees 
And I see fire, hollowing souls 
And I see fire, blood in the breeze 
And I hope that you'll remember me 
 
Oh, should my people fall 
Then surely I'll do the same 
Confined in mountain halls 
We got too close to the flame 
Calling out father hold fast and we will 
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side 
Desolation comes upon the sky 
 
Now I see fire, inside the mountain 
I see fire, burning the trees 
And I see fire, hollowing souls 
And I see fire, blood in the breeze 
And I hope that you'll remember me 
 
And if the night is burning 
I will cover my eyes 
For if the dark returns then 
My brothers will die 
And as the sky's falling down 
It crashed into this lonely town 
And with that shadow upon the ground 
I hear my people screaming out 
 
Now I see fire, inside the mountain 
I see fire, burning the trees 
And I see fire, hollowing souls 
And I see fire, blood in the breeze 
 
I see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire) 
And I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire) 
And I see fire (fire) 
And I see fire (burn on and on and mountains side)</field>

And if I blink again 
You'll be sinking in 
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made 
I'll hold ya and you'll think of him 
And pretty soon you'll be floating away 
 
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of 
Anchored down in the throat, love 
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now 
With just one armband to carry me home 
 
When salted tears won't dry 
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves 
Under your eyes 
These hearts will be flooded tonight 
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves 
Under your eyes 
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes 
 
I still taste salt water 
On my lips from your kiss, bitterness 
And I'll drown within the oceans you made 
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make up 
I'll never trust you again 
You can just be a friend 
 
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of 
Anchored down in the throat, love 
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now

I'll wipe my shirtsleeves

These hearts will be flooded tonight 
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves 
Under your eyes 
 
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth 
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild 
Tonight, the fact is I 
I'm on my way home 
I'm on my way home 
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm, I'm drowning in the oceans you made 
 
When salted tears won't dry

            <field name="lyrics">I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow 
I've got a habit of spitting 
Quicker lyrics you know 
You found me ripping the writtens 
Out of the pages they sit in 
And never once I get bitten 
Because plagiarism is hidden 
Which I would sit on the rhythm 
Prisoner with a vision 
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism 
Thought you knew but you didn't 
So perk your ears up and listen 
Studio is a system 
And you could say that I'm driven 
And now it's on to the next saga 
We drink the best lager 
I never tried to win you over 
Like your stepfather 
I do my own thing now, and get respect after 
And I'm avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter 
For four years I never had a place to stay 
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight 
At sixteen years old, yeah I moved out of my home 
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked 
And went from sleeping at the subway station 
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population 
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax 
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? 
I'll take it back now 
 
Mmmm c'mon and take it back love 
C'mon and take it back for us 
Don't you fade into the back love 
No 
 
I take it back with the rhythm and blues 
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news 
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school 
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop 
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes 
I give you the truth through the vocal booth 
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit 
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot 
But then again that's what they're supposed to do 
And I'm supposed to be calm 
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm 
Whispering everything that happens is from now on 
I'll be ready to start again at the end of the song 
Still their claiming that I handled it wrong 
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME 
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be 
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees 
I'm healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree 
Singing for the masses 
Rubber dinghy rapids 
Keep this rapping a habit 
And keep on passioning magic 
I'm battling for respect 
I don't know if I'll have it 
This songs from the heart 
Cover the planet 
I'll take it back now 
 
Mmmm c'mon and take it back love 
C'mon and take it back for us 
Don't you fade into the back love 
No 
 
Take it back now 
Now I don't ever want to be perfect 
Cause I'm a singer that you 
Never want to see shirtless 
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed 
Taking my first steps into the scene 
Giving me focus 
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton 
Considering a name change 
Thinking it was hopeless 
Rhyming over recordings 
Avoiding tradition 
Cause every day some lyrics 
And a melody can be written 
Now absence can make your heart break 
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly 
I need to let my liver be 
And I say it again 
Living life on the edge 
With a closed hand full of friends 
Is good advice from a man 
Who took his life on the road with me 
And I hope to see him blowing up globally 
Cause that's how it's supposed to be 
I'm screaming out vocally 
It might seem totally impossible 
Achieving life's dreams 
But, but I just write schemes 
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans 
Madison Square Garden is where I might be 
But more likely 
You'll find me in the back 
Room of a dive bar with my mates 
Having a pint with McDaid 
Discussing records we made 
And every single second knowing 
That we'll never betray 
The way we were raised 
Remembering our background 
Sat down 
That's how we plan it out 
It's time to take it back now 
 
Mmmm c'mon and take it back love 
C'mon and take it back for us 
Don't you fade into the back love 
No 
 
Mmmm c'mon and take it back love 
C'mon and take it back for us 
Don't you fade into the back love 
No</field>

The seed needs the water 
Before it grows out of the ground 
But it just keeps on getting hard 
And the hunger more profound 
Well I know there can come tears from the eye 
But they may as well be in vain 
Even though 
I know these tears come with pain

That stops by the shore 
Just like the riches of grandeur, oh no no

By the Tennessee skyline 
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams 
 
But I'd long to be 
In the bed of my true love 
Back where I came from 
She's waiting for me 
 
So I'll make my way  
Through long winding country roads 
But my heart still beats  
For my home and my English rose 
 
I told my dad  
On the phone it's amazing 
From the street to the craziest places I've seen 
 
But I'd long to be 
In the arms of my true love 
Like he loves my mother 
He understands me 
 
I spend my days 
Just travelling and playing shows 
But my heart still beats  
For my home and my English rose 
 
I met a man  
In the bar down in Memphis 
He told me he went there to follow his dreams 
He told me "son 
You know I lost my true love 
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea" 
 
And I found truth  
In people I barely know 
But my heart still beats  
For my home and my English rose 
 
Oh, my heart still beats  
For my home and my English rose 
Oh, my heart still beats  
For my home and my English rose</field>

Instead of in New York 
If the curve of you was curved on me 
 
I'd tell you that I loved you 
Before I even knew you 
'Cause I loved the simple thought of you 
 
If our hearts had never broken  
Well there's no joy in the mending  
So much this hurt can teach us both 
 
There's distance and there's silence 
Your words have never left me 
They're the prayer that I say every day 
 
Come on come out come here come here 
 
Come on come out come here come here 
 
Come on come out come here come here 
 
Come on come out come here come here 
 
The lone neon lights 
And the heat of the ocean 
And the fire that had started to spark 
I miss it all from the love to the lightning 
And the lack of it snaps me in two 
 
If you were here beside me 
Instead of New York 
In the arms you said you'd never leave 
 
I'd tell you that it's simple  
And it was only ever thus  
There is nowhere else that I belong

The lone neon lights 
And the want of the ocean 
And the fire that had started to spark 
I miss it all from the love to the lightning 
And the lack of it snaps me in two 
 
Just give me a sign  
There is end in a beginning 
Til the quiet chaos driving me mad  
The lone neon lights  
And the want of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to go out</field>

And you're still in my bed 
It's kinda rough, 'cause since I met ya 
There's things we've never said 
 
So if I go for a little while longer 
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road 
If you say go 
I would stop everything, oh 
My heart would play the role now 
And act like it's never been broke 
 
Though my soul 
Oh, oh, oh 
Lately I really need to know 
How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go? 
Oh my soul, oh, oh, oh 
How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go? 
 
It's not enough, to say I want ya 
'Cause I'll say anything 
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt 
I have just been questioning, yeah 
 
If I go for a little while longer 
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road 
If you say go, I would stop everything oh 
My heart would play the role 
And act like it's never been broke 
 
Though my soul 
Oh, oh, oh 
Lately I really need to know 
How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go? 
Oh my soul, oh oh oh 
How long, how long, can we be? 
 
All of my bones, they scream I'm right 
If you're taking me home to stay the night 
Darling my soul would heal 
 
If you say go 
I would stop everything, oh 
My heart would play the role 
And act like it's never been broke 
Though my soul, oh, oh, oh 
Lately I really need to know 
How long, how long, can we be touch and go 
Oh my soul, oh, oh, oh 
How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go?

And you speak to me 
Behind your dark green stare 
And you let me be

Free from any regret 
Another couple based on teen sex 
You idiot, true I was just like you

I was running from my brother and his friends 
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down 
I was younger then, take me back to when I 
 
Found my heart and broke it here 
Made friends and lost them through the years 
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown 
But I can't wait to go home 
 
I'm on my way 
Driving at ninety down those country lanes 
Singing to "Tiny Dancer" 
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real 
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
 
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes 
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends 
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right 
But I was younger then, take me back to when 
 
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid 
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight 
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown 
But I can't wait to go home 
 
I'm on my way 
Driving at ninety down those country lanes 
Singing to "Tiny Dancer" 
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real 
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
 
One friend left to sell clothes and 
One works down by the coast 
One had two kids but lives alone 
One's brother overdosed 
One's already on his second wife 
One's just barely getting by 
But these people raised me 
And I can't wait to go home 
 
And I'm on my way, I still remember 
These old country lanes 
When we did not know the answers 
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real 
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots 
Drinking fast and then we talk slow 
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me 
And trust me I'll give it a chance now 
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox 
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like 
 
Say, boy, let's not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with your body

One week in we let the story begin 
We're going out on our first date 
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate 
We talk for hours and hours about sweet and sour 
And how your family is doing okay 
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat 
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like 
 
Say, boy, let's not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

            <field name="lyrics">I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill 
I threw the day old tea from the cup 
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made 
Memories of a life that's been loved 
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals 
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink 
Dad always told me, "don't you cry when you're down" 
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink 
 
Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know 
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved 
 
So I'll sing Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum 
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up 
Spread your wings as you go 
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah 
You're home 
 
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up 
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case 
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek 
And wiped a tear from the side of my face 
 
I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know 
A life with love is a life that's been lived 
 
So I'll sing Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum 
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up 
Spread your wings as you go 
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah 
You're home 
 
Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum 
You got to see the person that I have become 
Spread your wing 
And I know that when God took you back he said Hallelujah 
You're home</field>

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys 
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree 
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar 
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know 
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat 
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain 
I tell myself in every way, "I won't be doing this again" 
And tomorrow's a brand new day 
 
Someone told me, "always say what's on your mind" 
And I am only being honest with you, I 
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time 
So no man call ya, bibia be ye ye 
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye ye ye 
Bibia be ye ye 
 
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret 
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met 
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams 
My heart is breaking at the seems and I'm coming apart now 
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree 
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon 
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground 
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day 
 
Someone told me, "always say what's on your mind" 
And I am only being honest with you, I 
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time 
So no men call ya, bibia be ye ye 
My momma (be ye ye)

            <field name="lyrics">I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind 
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine 
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride 
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind 
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life 
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride 
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive 
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride 
You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs 
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun 
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up 
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become 
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me 
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree 
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
Show me the locked doors, I find another use of key 
And you'll see 
 
I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me 
But with that said give me one more, higher 
Another one to take the sting away 
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day 
And I'll find comfort in my pain 
Eraser 
 
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs 
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong 
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell 
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well 
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps 
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun 
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run 
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become 
Our conversations with my father on the A14 
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams 
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me 
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans 
Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou 
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud 
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed 
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now 
Somehow 
 
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me 
But with that said give me one more, higher 
Another one to take the sting away 
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day 
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser 
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser 
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser 
 
Welcome to the new show 
I guess you know I've been away 
But where I'm heading, who knows 
But my heart will stay the same 
Welcome to the new show 
I guess you know I've been away 
But where I'm heading, who knows 
My pain, eraser 
 
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser 
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser 
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser

            <field name="lyrics">She played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "baby, I just want to dance" 
 
I meet her on Grafton street right outside of the bar 
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar 
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm? 
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on? 
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun 
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding as a shotgun 
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar 
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance 
 
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "baby, I just want to dance" 
With my pretty little Galway girl 
You're my pretty little Galway girl 
 
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool 
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room 
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool 
After dancing to Kaleigh,singing to trad tunes 
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet 
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat 
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week 
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me 
 
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "baby, I just want to dance" 
My pretty little Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl 
 
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time 
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine 
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine 
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night 
I walked her home then she took me inside 
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine 
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write 
About a Galway girl and a perfect night 
 
She played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "baby, I just want to dance" 
My pretty little Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl

I saw you in another's arms 
Only a month we've been apart 
You look happier 
 
Saw you walk inside a bar 
He said something to make you laugh 
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours 
Yeah, you look happier, you do 
 
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you 
But ain't nobody love you like I do 
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby 
If you're moving on with someone new 
 
'Cause baby you look happier, you do 
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too 
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth 
But I know I was happier with you 
 
Sat on the corner of the room 
Everything's reminding me of you 
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier 
Aren't you? 
 
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you 
But ain't nobody need you like I do 
I know that there's others that deserve you 
But my darling, I am still in love with you 
 
But I guess you look happier, you do 
My friends told me one day I'd feel it too 
I could try to smile to hide the truth 
I know I was happier with you 
 
Baby, you look happier, you do 
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new 
But if breaks your heart like lovers do 
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you</field>

Took my heart upon a one way trip 
Guess she went wandering off with it 
Unlike most women I know 
This one will bring it back whole 
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead 
Oh my baby, lately I know 
 
That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love aren't we? 
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near 
Love the way that you conquer your fear 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah yeah yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

And tin wind chimes used for doorbells 
Fields and trees and her smell, fill my lungs 
Spent my summer time beside her 
And the rest of the year the same 
She is the flint that sparks the lighter 
And the fuel that will hold the flame 
Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread 
Oh my, hold this, oh this, I know 
 
That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love aren't we? 
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near 
Love the way that you conquer your fear 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah yeah yeah 
 
Well I found love in the inside 
The arms of a woman I know 
She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home 
And I'm not scared of passing over 
Or the thought of growing old 
'Cause from now until I go 
 
Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love aren't we? 
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near 
Love the way that you conquer your fear 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah yeah 
 
Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear 
Oh we're in love aren't we? 
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby 
I feel safe when you're holding me near 
Love the way that you conquer your fear 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Yeah yeah yeah 
You know hearts don't break around here 
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah</field>

And you know that it's true 
I'm feeling younger 
Every time that I'm alone with you 
 
We were sitting in a parked car 
Stealing kisses in the front yard 
We got questions we should not ask but 
 
How would you feel, if I told you I loved you? 
It's just something that I want to do 
I'll be taking my time, spending my life 
Falling deeper in love with you 
So tell me that you love me too 
 
In the summer, as the lilacs bloom 
Love flows deeper than the river 
Every moment that I spend with you 
We were sat upon our best friend's roof 
I had both of my arms round you 
Watching the sunrise replace the moon 
 
How would you feel, if I told you I loved you? 
It's just something that I want to do 
I'll be taking my time, spending my life 
Falling deeper in love with you 
So tell me that you love me too 
 
We were sitting in a parked car 
Stealing kisses in the front yard 
We got questions we shouldn not ask

Falling deeper in love with you

            <field name="lyrics">I was twenty-four years old 
When I met the woman I would call my own 
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old 
In that house that your brother bought ya 
 
On the summer day when I proposed 
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold 
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No 
You can't marry my daughter" 
 
She and I went on the run 
Don't care about religion 
I'm gonna marry the woman I love 
Down by the Wexford border 
 
She was Nancy Mulligan 
And I was William Sheeran 
She took my name and then we were one 
Down by the Wexford border 
 
Well, met her at Guy's in the second world war 
And she was working on a soldier's ward 
Never had I seen such beauty before 
The moment that I saw her 
 
Nancy was my yellow rose 
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes 
We got eight children now growing old 
Five sons and three daughters 
 
She and I went on the run 
Don't care about religion 
I'm gonna marry the woman I love 
Down by the Wexford border 
 
She was Nancy Mulligan 
And I was William Sheeran 
She took my name and then we were one 
Down by the Wexford border 
 
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair 
Over sixty years I've been loving her 
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs 
You know Nancy, I adore ya 
 
From a farm boy born near Belfast town 
I never worried about the king and crown 
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground 
There's no difference, I assure ya 
 
She and I went on the run 
Don't care about religion 
I'm gonna marry the woman I love 
Down by the Wexford border 
 
She was Nancy Mulligan 
And I was William Sheeran 
She took my name and then we were one 
Down by the Wexford border</field>

Darling just dive right in 
And follow my lead 
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet  
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me 
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love 
 
Not knowing what it was 
I will not give you up this time 
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own 
And in your eyes you're holding mine 
 
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song 
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath 
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight 
 
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know 
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home 
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets 
To carry love, to carry children of our own 
We are still kids, but we're so in love 
Fighting against all odds 
I know we'll be alright this time 
Darling, just hold my hand 
Be my girl, I'll be your man 
I see my future in your eyes 
 
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song 
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful 
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight 
 
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song 
I have faith in what I see 
Now I know I have met an angel in person 
And she looks perfect 
I don't deserve this 
You look perfect tonight</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe 
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak 
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me? 
Oh, honestly? 
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon 
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm 
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song 
It goes on and on 
 
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels 
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills 
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf 
No farewell 
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself 
 
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain 
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or dream 
What line do we stand upon 'cause from here looks the same? 
And only scars remain 
 
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels 
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills 
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf 
No farewell 
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself 
 
But if don't 
Then I'll go back 
To where I'm rescuing a stranger 
Just because they needed saving just like that 
Oh, I'm here again 
Between the devil and the danger 
But I guess it's just my nature 
My dad was wrong 
'Cause I'm not like my mum 
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song 
But it helps 
So before I save someone else 
I've got to save myself 
 
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels 
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills 
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf 
No farewell 
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself 
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself 
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself</field>

But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song 
My daddy told me, "son, don't you get involved in 
Politics, religions or other people's quotes" 
 
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
I know when I have children they will know what it means 
And I pass on these things my family's given to me 
Just love and understanding, positivity 
 
We could change this whole world with a piano 
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go 
I'm just a boy with a one-man show 
No university, no degree, but lord knows 
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth 
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios 
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote 
Sing, love could change the world in a moment 
But what do I know? 
Love can change the world in a moment 
But what do I know? 
Love can change the world in a moment 
 
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away 
I saw people marching in the streets today 
You know we are made up of love and hate 
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade 
 
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams 
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans 
It's love and understanding, positivity 
 
We could change this whole world with a piano 
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go

You know, the future's in the hands of you and me 
So let's all get together, we can all be free 
Spread love and understanding, positivity

the boy we won't forget 
the soul you took away from us 
the river flows

missing you 
is all that needs to be said 
more than blue 
the words inside my head 
and i know that you're gone 
and i know that you're gone 
the cheeky smile 
of jokes and laughs 
the memories of times 
we crossed the line 
the stepping stones 
across my mind 
washed away 
we all now feel so blind 
missing you 
is all that needs to be said

the words inside my head

cos you're trying to take this from me 
and it's something that i wanted so bad 
cos you're the definition 
of someone who has to ruin 
the best thing that i ever had 
cos you're a jealous girl 
and all i can say is 
it's your fault but partially mine 
for losing hope 
for not treating you right 
but that will disappear in time 
all i gotta do is pass you by 
never say what's wrong 
whenever i say why? 
standing in the corner 
shadowed by the light 
to you i seem much smaller 
but i know it might be you 
how much better could i do 
to be myself 
not someone else? 
i'm losing sleep 
i live only for the week 
i've grown to ignore you 
cos when i seem to bore you 
you pretend that you're not interested 
your eyes start to twinkle 
your smile starts to widen 
and i just seem to try and forget 
but you pay me no attention 
even though i do 
but i don't care as long as you're mine 
it's happening every time 
all i gotta do is pass you by 
never say what's wrong 
whenever i say why? 
standing in the corner 
shadowed by the light 
to you i seem much smaller 
but i know it might be you 
how much better could i do 
to be myself 
not someone else? 
i'm losing sleep 
i live only for the week 
and i'm falling harder now it seems 
my slip-ups haunt me in my dreams 
and i can't sleep although i think i can 
it's insomnia i think i have 
but who cares when i'm not your man? 
standing in the corner 
shadowed by the light 
to you i seem much smaller 
but i know it might be you 
how much better could i do 
to be myself 
not someone else? 
i'm losing sleep 
i live only for the week</field>

your lies cut me deep

not affected at all

Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine "'Cause real will recognize real" is what my father says And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close. Five o'clock with lights off Interview with a vampire Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying 'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game It's time to wage war Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes, Be wide awake just like your snorting lines Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by [Chorus] I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be, The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... The times I'm living in lately. I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out Deliver the raps how I flow I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die. Never die. Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze, Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do, Driven young gentlemen I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true! I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got, I keep my pupils engaged, Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake. [Chorus] I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be, The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... [x4] The times I'm living in lately.</field>

Human race 
When the lights turned down 
They don't know what they heard 
Strike the match, play it loud 
Giving love to the world 
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn 
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn 
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn 
We don't wanna leave 
No, we just wanna be right now 
And what we see 
Is everybody's on the floor acting crazy 
Getting lurker to the lights out 
Music's on, I'm waking up, we stop the vibe 
And we bump it up 
And it's over now, we got the love 
There's no secret now, no secret now

I had a heart then but the Queen has been overthrown 
And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat 
And I'm not keeping now the strength I need to push me

You shine it when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone 
Home 
Noises, I play within my head 
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing 
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept 
In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong

I take a deep breath everytime I pass your door 
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore 
And that's the reason you're in the dark

And I feel so helpless here 
Watch my eyes are filled with fear 
Tell me do you feel the same 
Hold me in your arms again

Watch my eyes are filled with fear 
Tell me do you feel the same 
Hold me in your arms again

I feel so high

I need to be free with you tonight 
I need your love 
I need your love 
All the years 
All the times 
You have never been to blame 
And now my eyes are open 
And now my heart is closing 
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste 
I've been trying to make a change 
And now my eyes are open 
I need your love 
I need your time

I come alive 
I need to be free</field>

I don't even really know what you intended 
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous 
Poured it down, so I poured it down 
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you 
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you 
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos 
Poured it down, so I poured it down 
And now I don't understand it 
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth 
And I know I shouldn't say it 
But my heart don't understand 
Why I got you on my mind

Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name 
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it 
You didn't love me, no, not really 
Wait 
I could have really liked you 
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you 
It's a shame (shame) , you said I was good 
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

You got yourself in a dangerous zone 
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone

You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth 
And my heart don't understand it 
Understand it, understand it

See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue 
Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words 
How wonderful life is now you're in the world 
If I was a sculptor, but then again no 
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show 
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do 
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

This heartache through and through 
Something in the way you move 
I don't know what it is you do 
Not one bone in your body 
Good enough for me 
But this heart is open 
Bloodstains on my sleeve 
When our eyes meet 
I can only see the end 
But tonight I'm here yours again 
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all 
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall 
Heart is sinking like a cannonball 
Baby, kill it, what you're waiting for? 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move, oh oh 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move, oh oh 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
There's an evil night air 
The stars don't shine tonight, no 
Something in the way you do 
Something in the way you 
Push me closer, further 
Break me just enough 
Yours lies always seem so true 
There's nothing left for me to lose 
There's not one thing I can do 
To change your ways 
But I can't sit back 
And take the lonely days 
When our eyes meet 
I can only see the end 
And tonight the rain pours again 
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all 
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall 
Heart is sinking like a cannonball 
Baby, kill it, what you're waiting for? 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move, oh oh 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move, oh oh 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all 
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall 
Heart is sinking like a cannonball 
Baby, kill it, what you're waiting for? 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move, oh oh 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move, oh oh 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move, oh oh 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move, oh oh</field>

Stand still, falling away from me 
When it takes so long 
Fire's out, what do you want to be? 
Now I'm holding on 
Myself was never enough for me 
Gotta be so strong 
There's a power in what you do 
Now every other day, I'll be watching you 
I'll show you what it feels like 
Now I'm on the outside 
We did everything right 
Now I'm on the outside 
I'll show you what it feels like 
Now I'm on the outside 
We did everything right 
Now I'm on the outside 
So, you give me no reason 
For me to stay close to you 
Tell me what lovers do 
How are we still breathing? 
It's never for us to choose 
I'll be the strength in you 
Now I'm holding on 
Myself was never enough for me 
Gotta be so strong 
There's a power in what you do 
Now every other day, I'll be watching you 
I'll show you what it feels like 
Now I'm on the outside

This love is like fire and ice 
This love is like rain and blue skies 
This love is like sun on the rise 
This love got me rolling the dice 
Don't let me lose 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
Beautiful mind 
Your heart got a story with mine 
Your heart got me hurting at times 
Your heart gave me new kind of highs 
Your heart got me feeling so fine 
So what to do 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
It took us a while 
With every breath a new day 
With love on the line 
We've had our share of mistakes 
But all your flaws and scars are mine 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
I'm in 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do 
I'm still falling for you 
Brighter than gold 
This love shining brighter than gold 
This love is like letters in bold 
This love is like out of control 
This love is never growing old 
You make it new 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
It took us a while 
Because we were young and unsure 
With love on the line 
What if we both would need more 
But all your flaws and scars are mine 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
I'm in 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do 
I'm still falling for you 
Falling, crash into my arms 
Love you like this 
Like a first kiss 
Never let go 
Falling, crash into my arms 
Never breaking what we got 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
I'm in 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
All for me 
And just like that 
All I feel is you 
All I feel is you 
You are all for me 
I'm still falling 
And just like that 
All I feel is you 
All I feel is you 
You are all for me 
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do 
I'm still falling for you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Listen, I can hear a voice 
I need a helping hand 
Just to beat the void 
I need a mission 
A dream to stop me talking to myself 
And now the silence is broken 
And my soul is to sell 
I need to pick up the pieces 
To scatter to the wind 
Hold the city to your ears 
You can hear the wind come in 
But you can't change the world with a 
Song and you can't make it right when it's wrong 
I can't stop this music travelling round with 
Me wherever I go, it's playing for you 
I can't stop the voice unravelling round 
Me whatever I do, it's talking to you 
The world dances to the rhythm of its own 
Heart beating for you, however you lose 
So speak to me - believe me 
Don't let it slip, through your fingertips 
When there's a ghost 
Don't try to reason with it 
Because now I'm tired, I'm wired 
So I won't miss a think 
I rope my words out to dry 
And I've forgotten what to sing 
But you can't change the world 
With a song and you can't make it right 
When it's wrong 
If that's what it was to you 
Then that's what it was to me</field>

You never let me give up 
All the nights and the fights 
And the blood and the breakups 
You always had to call off 
I am pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid 
And yet you understand 
Yeah like no one can 
Know that we don't look like much 
But no one fucks it up like us 
16 and you never even judged me 
Matter of fact I always thought 
You were too cool for me 
Sitting there in the caravan 
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor 
And yet you understand 
Yeah like no one can 
We both know what they say about us 
But they don't stand a chance because 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
I'm standing with an army 
I'm standing with an army 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
I'm standing with an army 
Standing with an army 
Dark times, you could always find the bright side 
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice 
Just to be there for me 
How you cringe when you sing out of tune 
And yet it's everything 
So don't change a thing 
We both know what they say about us 
But they don't stand a chance because 
When I'm with you

Running all the red lights 
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah 
We were sipping on emotions 
Smoking and inhaling every moment 
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah 
We were high and we were sober 
We were under, we were over 
We were young and now I'm older 
But I'd do it all again 
Getting drunk on a train track 
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes 
Ten dollars was a fat stack 
I'd do it all again 
Bought my jacket and a snapback 
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach 
Re: Stacks on the playback 
I'd do it all again 
We were lovers on a wild ride 
Speeding for the finish line 
Come until the end of our time, yeah 
Started off as a wildfire 
Burning down the bridges to our empire 
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah 
We were high and we were sober 
We were under, we were over 
We were young and now I'm older 
But I'd do it all again

Tropical sunrises, never sleeping 
I don't know what changed 
All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night 
You've been running from the dark 
You can't look me in the eyes 
Being called into the heat 
Even if it's burning me 
I just need to dance without you 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss

I go up without you bringing me down

I wait for a word 
Lying next to your frame 
Girl unobserved 
You change your position 
You're changing me 
Casting these shadows 
Where they shouldn't be 
We're interrupted 
By the heat of the sun 
Trying to prevent 
What's already begun 
You're just a body 
I can smell your skin 
And when I feel it 
You're wearing thin 
But I've got a plan 
Why don't you be the artist 
And make me out of clay? 
Why don't you be the writer 
And decide the words I say? 
Cause I'd rather pretend 
I'll still be there at the end 
Only it's too hard to ask 
Won't you try to help me? 
Sat on your sofa 
It's all broken springs 
This isn't the place for 
Those violin strings 
I try out a smile 
And I aim it at you 
You must have missed it 
You always do 
But I've got a plan 
Why don't you be the artist 
And make me out of clay? 
Why don't you be the writer 
And decide the words I say? 
Cause I'd rather pretend 
I'll still be there at the end 
Only it's too hard to ask 
Won't you try to help me?

I wait 
Casting shadows 
Interrupted 
You wait 
I wait 
Casting shadows 
Interrupted 
You wait 
I wait

Part of you, bittersweet 
But now you tell me lies 
Up and down, cold and hot 
Swear to God, got to stop 
Because I can't sleep at night 
If you wanted love like this 
Blowing up with every kiss 
Should've known better 
Because you find yourself alone 
Chilling you right to the bone 
No, should've known better 
You and me just 
Running towards the light 
Giving up the fight 
Hoping we survive 
You and me just 
Strangers in the night 
Giving up the fight 
Waiting to ignite 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Lost in you, lost in me 
Afraid of love, in too deep 
So we just run and hide 
Lightning fast, felt the crash 
Scared to lose, fear attacks 
We only know goodbye 
You and me just 
Running towards the light 
Giving up the fight 
Hoping we survive 
You and me just 
Strangers in the night 
Giving up the fight 
Waiting to ignite

Hopelessly holding on 
To all those perfect nights 
Let's pretend it's not gone

Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there 
I just want to be around you 
Is that too much to ask? 
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there 
Don't tell I'm wrong 
I could be, I could be, I could be there 
If only you'd let me in, I could be there 
Just tell me where and tell me when 
So tired of these roads going nowhere 
But I know your love takes me somewhere 
Still looking up and down 
While you're being mysterious 
I see really big things for us 
We just need to break through, break through 
Everything that you say 
God I wish I had said it first 
And forgetting I had ever hurt 
Your love is pulling me through, me through 
I just want to be around you 
Is that too much to ask? 
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there 
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there 
I just want to be around you 
Is that too much to ask? 
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there 
Don't tell I'm wrong 
You are all I want 
So take me home 
The more you been thinking about us 
Open up, don't let me go 
The more you been thinking about 
I just want to be around you 
Is that too much to ask? 
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there 
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there 
I just want to be around you 
Is that too much to ask? 
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there 
Don't tell I'm wrong

Shouldn't need a riddle 
To unlock your heart 
So, say what's on your mind 
We got other things 
That we could do with our 
Time, we could rule the world 
Know you say you never 
Need another girl 
But, you're not making sense 
Trying to keep it moving 
While you're on the fence 
Tell me black and white 
Why I'm here tonight 
I can't read the signs 
Stop talking in codes, 
Stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, 
Can't do it no more 
I need a love to celebrate 
Stop talking in codes, 
Stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, 
Can't do it no more 
So baby, take it all the way 
Stop talking in codes 
It's a mystery 
I know that something 
Happened in your history 
Oh, it's too much to risk 
You give me some, 
But you've been holding most of it 
Back, so it's no surprise 
Everything you do, I over analyze 
Breathe, in and out 
Baby, give me something new to think about 
Tell me black and white 
Why I'm here tonight 
I can't read the signs 
Stop talking in codes, 
Stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, 
Can't do it no more 
I need a love to celebrate 
Stop talking in codes, 
Stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, 
Can't do it no more

I'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand 
So many casualties of love 
But I've been bulletproof, I'm staring at the sun 
I was the one you took home 
Never a flame to burn slow 
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way 
So many bodies I've touched 
Crashing around me like dust 
You are the realest thing I've ever had to fake 
I don't need nobody, need nobody but 
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you 
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you 
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you 
I'm just so used to emptiness 
Can't feel your heartbeat when I'm lying on your chest 
You're different from the ones before 
I know you don't believe it's you I've waited for 
I was the one you took home 
Never a flame to burn slow 
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way

Even when our bodies are drunk

Take away the sky in our breath 
Remember love is a game, love is a game 
Don't break, don't fade 
While we're not real, we're never too late 
Make time, it won't hurt 
Said I'll go now, but you said it first 
I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay 
But one thing I know that will always remain 
And that's the aftertaste 
The aftertaste 
The aftertaste

In the midst I'm seeing your face 
And I can't believe this is fake 
Blow the blossom into your room 
As you throw me in disarray 
There's a button that I need to press 
There's a face that I need to kiss 
Come on, give me your heart and your head 
Make you conscious never resist, never resist 
Don't break, don't fade

Alone without you by my side

To find somebody, find somebody 
Like you, like you 
Oohh ohh

A part of me I'd never seen 
You took my soul wiped it clean

The one, the one, the one, the one, the one... 
Wake up in the morning, we're paralysed... 
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies 
There will be no blood and there'll be no pain 
I want to fall in love with you again again again 
Again again again again again again 
You have stolen all my senses 
There's a fever in my heart

You are pulling me apart 
Forever we're young and we are dying 
And we will be spilling all our blood 
So I will take away my feelings

I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you 
We'll tell each other lies like we tell the truth

Last year I might have cried, but tonight I'll try to smile 
Are you happy now? 
I let your birthday pass, I met your friends at last 
I didn't even ask if you're happy now 
I barely made each night 
Somehow the days rolled by 
The part that loved you died 
Are you happy now? 
Saw you walking in the rain and holding no one's hand 
I started feeling things that I couldn't understand 
Now you're swinging from my heart 
I'm ringing up my friends 
"Before it all begins," they say, " remember how it ends" 
Are you happy now? 
I let your birthday pass, I met your friends at last 
I didn't even ask if you're happy now

And yet you understand 
Yeah like no one can 
Know that we don't look like much 
But no one fucks it up like us 
16 and you never even judged me 
Matter of fact I always thought 
You were too cool for me 
Sitting there in the caravan 
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor 
And yet you understand 
Yeah like no one can 
We both know what they say about us

            <field name="lyrics">[Ellie Goulding:] 
It's a good thing tears never show in the pouring rain 
As if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain 
There'll be no last chance to promise to never mess it up again 
Just the sweet pain of watching your back as you walk 
As I'm watching you walk away 
And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head 
And I remember every word you said 
[Erik Hassle:] 
It's a cruel thing you'll never know all the ways I tried 
It's a hard thing, faking a smile when I feel 
like I'm falling apart inside 
And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head 
And I remember every word you said 
[Ellie Goulding:] 
And you never were, and you never will be mine 
No, you never were, and you never will be mine 
[Erik Hassle:] 
For the first time, there is no mercy in your eyes 
And the cold wind is hitting my face and you're gone 
And you're walking away (away) 
[Both:] 
And now I'm helpless sometimes 
Wishing's just no good 
'Cause you don't see me like I wish you would 
'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine 
No, you never were, and you never will be mine 
There's a moment to seize everytime that we meet 
But you always keep passing me by 
No, you never were, and you never will be mine</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Eyes make their peace in difficulties 
With wounded lips and salted cheeks 
And finally we step to leave 
To the departure lounge of disbelief 
And I don't know where I'm going 
But I know it's gonna be a long time 
And I'll be leaving in the morning 
Come the white wine bitter sunlight 
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight 
Before that bleeding sun comes alive 
I want to make the best of what is left hold tight 
And hear my beating heart one last time 
Before daylight 
And the canyon underneath the trees 
Behind the dark sky, you looked at me 
I fell for you like autumn leaves 
And never faded ever green 
And I don't know where I'm going 
But I know it's gonna be a long time 
Cause I'll be leaving in the morning 
Come the white wine bitter sunlight 
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight 
Before that bleeding sun comes alive 
I want to make the best of what is left hold tight 
And hear my beating heart one last time 
I can't face this now 
Everything has changed 
I just wanna be by your side 
Heres hoping we collide 
Heres hoping we collide 
Heres hoping we collide 
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight 
Before that bleeding sun comes alive 
I want to make the best of what is left hold tight 
And hear my beating heart one last time 
Wanna hear your beating heart 
Tonight</field>

As you walk in 
I wait for my hairs to rise on my skin 
But they don't 
I'm just numb 
You gimme this small talk 
I couldn't be anyone 
And this Bligh 
And no can 
No can 
No-ah-o-oh 
I should be crying 
There's too much you never said 
The only face I won't forget 
No-ah-o-oh 
I should be be screaming 
But it's so hard to miss 
In an empty space like this 
So I drive away 
Without the brakes 
Beautifully numb

Tell me why 
Did you expect 
Am I in love like you 
I forget 
It's like someone 
Cut the wires 
Putting the stitches there by it faith 
And this Bligh 
And no can 
No can 
No-ah-o-oh 
I should be crying 
There's too much you never said 
The only face I won't forget 
No-ah-o-oh

Where did the love go? 
Where did the love go? 
It was only a heart that was broke 
And No-ah-o-oh 
I should be be crying 
There's too much you never said 
The only face I won't forget 
No-ah-o-oh 
I should be screaming

            <field name="lyrics">Listen, I can hear a voice 
I need a helping hand 
Just to beat the void 
I need a mission 
A dream to stop me talking to myself 
And now the silence is broken 
And my soul is to sell 
I need to pick up the pieces 
To scatter to the wind 
Hold the city to your ears 
You can hear the wind come in 
But you can't change the world with a 
Song and you can't make it right when it's wrong 
I can't stop this music travelling round with 
Me wherever I go, it's playing for you 
I can't stop the voice unravelling round 
Me whatever I do, it's talking to you 
The world dances to the rhythm of its own 
Heart beating for you, however you lose 
So speak to me - believe me 
Don't let it slip, through your fingertips 
When there's a ghost 
Don't try to reason with it 
Because now I'm tired, I'm wired 
So I won't miss a think 
I rope my words out to dry 
And I've forgotten what to sing 
But you can't change the world 
With a song and you can't make it right 
When it's wrong 
If that's what it was to you 
Then that's what it was to me</field>

Makes my heart beat like a drum 
See the panic in my eyes 
Kiss me only when they cry 
Cause you always want what you're running from 
And you know this is more than you can take 
Baby don't forget my name 
When the morning breaks us 
Baby please don't look away 
When the morning breaks us 
Oh your touch, so bittersweet 
Baby don't forget my name 
When the morning breaks us 
Your cheek is softly by the sun 
Makes my heart beat like a drum 
I know it hurts you, I know it burns you 
Hot and cold in a lonely hotel room 
Look into me, tell me why you're crying I need to know 
Cause you always want what you're running from 
It's always been away 
Baby don't forget my name 
When the morning breaks us

            <field name="lyrics">If a fish swam out of the ocean, grew legs and started walking 
And the apes climbed out from the trees, and grew tall and started talking 
And the stars fall out of the sky, and my tears rolled into the ocean 
Now I'm looking for a reason why, you set my world into motion 
'Cause if you're not really here, then the stars don't even matter 
Now I feel too tall, we all fear 
But it's all just a bunch of matter 
'Cause if you're not really here, then I don't want to be either 
I want be next to you 
Black and gold, black and gold, black gold 
I looked up into the night sky and see I saw an eye staring back 
And all around these golden beacons I see nothing but black 
I feel a wave of something beyond though, I don't see what I can feel 
If vision is the only validation, then most of my life isn't real 
'Cause if you're not really here, then the stars don't even matter 
Now I feel too tall, we all fear 
But it's all just a bunch of matter 
'Cause if you're not really here, then I don't want to be either

You only made them fall 
And it's crazy to hold on 
What I'm holding on is gone 
So now I'm closed for love 
Who will kiss my tears away? 
You only ever made them fall 
So now I'm closed for love 
You dropped me 
To the ground 
You stood right by 
Said I should fly 
Always flirting 
Smiles soul 
Those stroke my heart 
It doesn't beat no more 
And who will kiss my tears away? 
You only made them fall 
And it's crazy to hold on 
When you won't open 
So now I'm closed for love 
Who will kiss my tears away? 
You only ever made them fall 
So now I'm closed for love 
Friday morning 
I had no warning 
Friday night 
I lost the fight 
Were you aiming? 
I wasn't sure 
If I had first 
I'm glad my back was turned 
And who kiss my tears away? 
You only made them fall 
And it's crazy to hold on 
When you won't open 
So now I'm closed for love 
Who will kiss my tears away? 
You only ever made them fall 
So now I'm closed for love

But, you're not making sense 
Trying to keep it moving 
While you're on the fence

Oh, it's too much to risk

Don't you know I'm always here for you? 
Cause this is devotion, I am lost 
You're the only one I see 
Our bodies in motion, I am caught 
Floating in your gravity 
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you 
I'm the one who drives to you at night 
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper 
I think our little hearts will be alright 
Cause this is devotion 
Tell me what you dream about 
I lose you in my sleep, somehow 
Let the chaos disappear 
Don't you know I'm always there for you? 
Cause this is devotion, I am lost 
You're the only one I see 
Our bodies in motion, I am caught 
Floating in your gravity 
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you 
I'm the one who drives to you at night 
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper 
I think our little hearts will be alright 
Cause this is devotion 
Cause this is devotion, I am lost 
You're the only one I see 
Our bodies in motion, I am caught 
Floating in your gravity 
Cause this is devotion, I am lost 
You're the only one I see 
Our bodies in motion, I am caught 
Floating in your gravity 
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you 
I'm the one who drives to you at night 
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper

I'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand 
So many casualties of love 
But I've been bulletproof, I'm staring at the sun 
I was the one you took home 
Never a flame to burn slow 
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way 
So many bodies I've touched 
Crashing around me like dust 
You are the realest thing I've ever had to fake 
I don't need nobody, need nobody but 
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you 
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you 
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you 
I'm just so used to emptiness 
Can't feel your heartbeat when I'm lying on your chest 
You're different from the ones before 
I know you don't believe it's you I've waited for 
I was the one you took home 
Never a flame to burn slow

Emergency exit, emergency exit, please..

So why don't I know more.. 
My tunnel's long but now 
I should have seen this come before.. 
Cos the people I converse with 
Don't know what it is to live.. 
So I take away a few facts 
A dragonfly, on the tracks..

Oblivious, oblivious, oh they are cos..

And perhaps when I'm sleeping you'll get back on your feet 
Ooh... 
Maybe we forgot all the thing we are

Stop my fall every time you go 
Tape me up then break me up 
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest

And I felt the rain on your face and the damage you had done 
I know what you're thinking - it will never be the end 
And when the storm is over, you won't see me again 
Ooh... 
Didn't know the price I'd paid for all the times I stayed 
When we were together 
Wake me up, wake me up 
Stop my fall every time you go 
Tape me up then break me up 
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest

And I gave in 
I lack the things you need the most, you said 
Where have you been 
You wasted all that sweetness 
To run and hide 
I wonder why 
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into 
But you never tried 
I've fallen from grace 
Took a blow to my face 
I've loved and I've lost 
I've loved and I've lost 
Explosions 
On the day you wake up 
Needing somebody and you've learned 
It's okay to be afraid 
But it will never be the same 
It will never be the same 
You left my soul bleeding in the dark 
So you could be king 
The rules you set are still untold to me and I 
Lost my faith in everything 
The nights you could cope 
Your intentions were gold 
But the mountains will shake 
I need to know I can still make 
Explosions 
On the day you wake up 
Needing somebody and you've learned 
It's okay to be afraid 
But it will never be the same 
And as the floods move in 
And your body starts to sink 
I was the last thing on your mind 
I know you better than you think 
'Cause it's simple darling, I gave you a warning 
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces 
So watch them fall with you, in slow motion 
I pray that you will find peace of mind 
And I'll find you another time 
I'll love you, another time 
Explosions 
On the day you wake up 
Needing somebody and you've learned 
It's okay to be afraid 
But it will never be the same</field>

Piece of paper or two with my name written on it 
And a question mark 
Who is this girl I have made? 
Cause I've been kept in the dark 
And I've seen you once father 
In the fear of your belts and leather 
And you were just about to tempter 
There was distance 
You're my spout resistance 
I can't believe you still don't know me 
Cause I am a mystery 
So I separated all the things that I have hated 
With the victories I have won 
And the biggest one is you 
You don't know my street or 
The size of my feet or the time it took to grow 
Cause father, these are things you should know 
These are things you should know 
Knocked the breath right out of you 
What's a brown eye girl to do? 
When her future lies and chasing paper 
And, all I get from you is your 
"You're so clever I'll see you later" 
I just cant hide my frustration 
When there's so much more you could have done like 
Given me hope and attention 
Instead of ignored 
But I don't mind, no I don't mind 
Cause he is just a boy 
Cause we are children, we are merely children 
And, he is just a boy 
So I separated all the things that I have hated 
With the victories I've won 
And the biggest one is you 
You don't know my street 
Or the size of my feet or 
Or the time it took to grow

Ten dollars was a fat stack

When you're falling apart you don't even have to think about it, about it. 
Know every station off by heart. 
Never get off just go back to the start of my journey, and I'm never as young as I want to be. 
I'll think I'll never worry if I fly fly fly. 
I'll just fly. 
When things are moving so fast you don't have to take them in. 
When you're falling apart you don't even have to think about it, about it. 
Some day the sky will run out. 
The ground will pull me back down, back down to thinking straight, 
Never being late for love that I haven't found. 
But maybe I should try, maybe I should try. 
My bag is heavy, I feel weak, 
Talk to people but they don't speak. 
Always moving but I still don't know where I'm going. 
But that okay because I'll fly fly fly, I'll just fly fly fly. 
When things are moving so fast you don't have to take them in. 
When you're falling apart you don't even have to think about it, about it. 
I'll just fly, I'll just fly.</field>

Yet they're all around 
Like air, like air, we like 
Not making a sound 
Not making a sound 
Not making a single sound 
Yeah.. 
Dreams.. 
oh oh.. 
So many people are lost 
The signs are pushed 
Down into the ground 
And I am a single dot 
That moves around 
With the others.. 
The people who pretend 
To be real people 
All broken and unreal 
The thing that breaks us 
And things that heal.. 
No..</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Baby you say you have a little song for me 
But you're wearing shades and your eyes look real dark underneath 
Baby I'm worried you'll get it wrong for me 
There's four love songs so which one did you write for me? 
Baby you haven't been getting along with me 
If you play the song, I know whether to stay or cry or leave 
In the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you 
In the second I love you but you leave 
In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free 
On the fourth, someone else is loving me, loving me 
Baby I'm waiting to hear your song for me 
Cuz there's been delays since I asked if you're in love with me 
And baby the songs you write are not happy 
I can't find a line like "I love you" and "you love me" 
Baby I no longer think you belong to me 
So I got the song, but you lost the girl, goodbye from me 
In the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you 
In the second I love you but you leave 
In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free 
On the fourth, someone else is loving me, loving me 
Baby I'm worried you'll get it wrong for me 
There's four love songs, so which one did you write for me? 
And in the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you 
In the second I love you but you leave 
In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free 
On the fourth, someone else is loving me, someone else is loving me</field>

Swore upon my sun I'd save you for a rainy day 
Loosened the noose then let go of the rope 
I know if it's never coming back it has to go 
I keep calling your name 
(I keep calling your name) 
I wanna hold you close 
But I never wanna feel ashamed 
So I keep calling at night 
(I keep calling at night) 
I wanna hold you close 
I just never wanna hold you tight 
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop 
Calling you up 
Calling you up 
Just to keep crawling to your arms 
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop 
Calling you up 
Calling you up 
Just to keep crawling to your arms 
I found the weakness and put it to play 
Swore upon the stars 
I'd keep you till a nightless day 
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know 
You said if you're never coming back 
You have to go 
I keep calling your name

But it doesn't phase me 
You're on time 
You move so fast, makes me feel lazy 
And let's join forces 
We've got our guns and horses 
I know you've been burned but every fire is a lesson learned 
I left my house 
I left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worthy, you are 
But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would 
Let's tie words 
'Cause they amount to nothing 
Play it down 
Pretend you can't take what you've found 
But you found me 
On a screen you sit permanently 
I left my house 
I left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worthy, you are 
But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would 
It's time to come clean 
And make sense of everything 
It's time that we found out who we are 
Cause when I'm standing here in the dark 
I see your face in every star 
But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you

I know you're a fighter

So you're not heading home to me 
We could be closer, we could be closer 
We could be

It's gonna be better 
It's gonna be better 
We'll take a long walk, down the alleys of these houses 
And we'll talk, see what conversation rouses 
When we're alone 
When we're alone, it could be home 
When it's just us 
You show me what it feels like to be lonely 
You show me what it feels like to be lost 
I take your hand for you to let it go 
Let it go, let it go, let it go

Give me the respect, forgive me and forget 
We've got to get a grip, living on the edge 
I barely even know this f-ck-ng woman in my bed 
And if that's too much on my plate 
Then I ain't finishing my bad 
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side 
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life 
You got me wrapped up in your shit 
I'm feeling mamba fight 
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice 
You gave me what I needed 
And I gave her everything she wanted 
Miss something 'bout your cleavage 
Now why can't put my fingers on it 
You're taking me the deepest 
I thought that she was coming for me 
If four women from Venus 
Then I guess I really got a rocket 
You've got a nose around my neck, but I'm still hanging on 
We've nearly reached the finish line 
I bet we're having fun 
I spat a buzz, she sang a song 
She broke my heart, I took some Gaviscon 
I just can't keep hanging on to you and me

You won't let it heal

Let it heal 
it's in your eyes 
I can see that you're broken 
I know you're lost because I am too 
it's in your voice

I think you're in love

You won't let it go

It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love

It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love

With time to kill 
In our hearts without chains 
And if time was still 
We'd have no fear 
Or scars to heal 
In our hearts without chains 
In our hearts without chains 
You left everything behind except yourself 
But all I see is question marks and nothing else 
You must have landed in New York by now 
Please don't bring this love down 
Have you lost the same things I have lost? 
Do you know that panic I know? 
Would I see the terror in your face? 
Do you know that fever I know?

Ironic, I been livin' off what people down to kill for 
And I find no comfort in numbers 
Knowin' there's always a mill more 
Fact was that cat dragged my pretty ass 
Right on the top of that billboard 
And all of my folks who done 
Been here from jump you the ones I'ma cover the bill for 
And as I get ill more 
We gon' triple the order of champagne and spill more 
Let's handle the real score 
Been wonderin' what the public got a feel for 
So let's keep it real, y'all 
You know I'm killing game soon as I step on the field, y'all 
The top where I'm at now, there's no turning back now 
I won't ever back down 
They feel me like they givin' Iggy a pat-down 
I needed a moment I found it 
Lately I've been on my runnin' the town shit 
Especially walkin' around with 
This heavy crown 
You can't always please the crowd 
But I am still not bowing down 
This heavy crown 
It comes and goes around 
And when it's time, I'll pass it proud 
But bitch I got it now 
So keep a cute, chick, and don't be hatin' on the new chick 
Go back and check your stats 
And bet they let you know I do's this 
Glasses full of empty dependent unpoint of view chick 
If you was mad before 
I bet you hate me for this new shit 
Maybe you should watch 
What you've got coming out your two lips 
Get cool with how I kick it or else you gon' get the boot, bitch 
Iggy A-Z-A a 
k 
a 
captain of the crew ship 
Don't penny pinch I promise babe 
I don't need your two cents 
Get rid of the makeup let us see just who you is 
But if you feel like that girl bless your heart 
Go get it how you live 
When you hear my name 
You gotta know that she's something regal 
I'm one of one ain't no sequels 
I'm wearing 
This heavy crown 
You can't always please the crowd 
But I am still not bowing down 
This heavy crown 
It comes and goes around 
And when it's time, I'll pass it proud 
But bitch I got it now

Oh Lord, weren't you mistaken 
I got a dinner date with greatness 
Iggy Igg ain't never been nothin' to play wit, hol' up 
To everyone who said I'd never make 
I'm at the top laughin' at you faces 
I've been practising my patience 
But I switch back quick if you play with 
This heavy crown 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
This heavy crown 
Oh Lord weren't you mistaken 
This heavy crown 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
This heavy crown 
Oh Lord weren't you mistaken 
This heavy crown 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
This heavy crown 
Oh Lord weren't you mistaken 
This heavy crown 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
This heavy crown 
Oh Lord weren't you mistaken</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You're falling at your feet, giving everything up 
There's something in the way, love is never enough 
I see you're sorry how I'm burning down the gun 
With a war in your mind that never wants to be won 
I catch you in a light no one else can see 
I know you see her, and you'll never see me 
She makes you feel the most, keep your souls alive 
But what we had, it never really died 
And this is what I'll say if I had any words 
Wish we hadn't messed up 
Now your heart is with hers 
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay 
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away 
And now you're the one who hurts 
You had to love someone else just to know your worth 
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to us 
Yeah, this is just a phase, pretty sure of that 
And one day, you and I, we will never look back 
You kept me in the flames 
But the fire was out, the fire was out 
And this is what I'll say if I had any words 
Wish we hadn't messed up 
Now your heart is with hers 
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay 
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away 
And now you're the one who hurts 
You had to love someone else just to know your worth 
And this is what I'll say if I had any words 
Wish we hadn't messed up 
Now your heart is with hers 
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay 
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away 
And now you're the one who hurts 
You had to love someone else just to know your worth 
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to us</field>

We don't need attention 
Open your hand 
Take a glass 
Don't be scared 
I'm right here 
Even though you don't roll 
Trust me boy 
You wanna be high for this 
Take it off 
You want it off 
'Cause I know what you're feeling 
It's okay boy I feel it too 
Let it be, baby breathe 
I swear I'm right here 
We'll be good 
I promise we'll be so good

Part of you, bittersweet 
But now you tell me lies 
Up and down, cold and hot 
Swear to God, got to stop 
Because I can't sleep at night 
If you wanted love like this 
Blowing up with every kiss 
Should've known better 
Because you find yourself alone 
Chilling you right to the bone 
No, should've known better 
You and me just 
Running towards the light 
Giving up the fight 
Hoping we survive 
You and me just 
Strangers in the night 
Giving up the fight 
Waiting to ignite 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Lost in you, lost in me 
Afraid of love, in too deep 
So we just run and hide 
Lightning fast, felt the crash 
Scared to lose, fear attacks 
We only know goodbye 
You and me just 
Running towards the light 
Giving up the fight 
Hoping we survive 
You and me just 
Strangers in the night 
Giving up the fight 
Waiting to ignite 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
If you wanted love like this 
Blowing up with every kiss 
Should've known better 
Because you find yourself alone 
Chilling you right to the bone 
No, should've known better 
Hopelessly holding on 
To all those perfect nights 
Let's pretend it's not gone 
And say we'll never die 
You and me just 
Running towards the light 
Giving up the fight 
Hoping we survive 
You and me just 
Strangers in the night 
Giving up the fight 
Waiting to ignite 
Holding on for life

My home 
This will always be my home 
I work until it's late 
Walk in and close the gate 
I look in the window 
And I gaze at my face 
Every line and every abrasion 
This took my life to make 
This took my life to make

No poison in my bones 
On my own, this is where I build my home 
My home

Get the chance to be someone, to be

I would give my life, to be human 
I would give my life, to be human

A better me, I will not drink until I'm dead 
I'll make the most of it 
I don't know what 
It's like to be alive, to say goodbye, to 
Cry a thousand tears because my ears 
Won't listen 
Human I'm trying not to lose my faith in 
You, I've sussed out all that I've seen 
Through, I've sailed an ocean 
I am so scared of what I'll look like in the 
End for I am not prepared, I hope I will 
Get the chance to be someone 
To be human, look what we've done, look

My heart breaking

Be found, I trust that I will take it

Don't know where to look without them 
Outside the cars speed by 
I never heard them until now 
I know you care 
I know it's always been there 
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it 
You are just saving yourself when you hide it 
Yeah, I know you care 
I see it in the way you stare 
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it 
I'll be saving myself from the ruin 
And I know you care 
I used to run down the stairs 
To the door and I thought you were there 
To shape to the comfort of us 
Two lovers loved out of love 
Oh, but I know you care 
I know it is always been there 
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it 
You are just saving yourself when you hide it 
Yeah, I know you care 
I see it in the way that you stare 
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it 
I'll be saving myself from the ruin 
I know it wasn't always wrong 
But I've never known a winter so cold 
No, I don't want my hands in a coat 
But I still hope 
'Cause this is how things ought to have been 
And I know the words of it 
Wasn't all that it seemed 
Why can't I dream? 
Do I care to dream? 
'Cause I know you care

Reassure me that you'll wait for me, wait for me as long as it takes! 
And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath 
Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us 
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears we'll blow them all way 
Fight fires in your best clothes, touch skin with your eyes closed 
Chase thunder... 
With the volume down 
Pack a suitcase, wonder to the next town 
Force quit, on your losing streak 
Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek 
Tell me that we're still too young, that we're still too young and I'll my tongue

In the fields where I was in their company

I used them, I used them on my youth 
And you gave me wings and I used them 
I used them, and I won't lose them 
Now I found my feet count to 1, 2, 3 
And I'm taking off tonight, now I'm free 
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete 
And I and I and I 
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city 
I follow my needs for my, for my city 
We're going off the dream in my, in my city 
And that's where I'll stay 
And that's where I'll stay 
In my city 
Rolling down the streets in my new town 
With the lights blinding and my heart played down 
I think I'm glad that you'll receive people's thunder 
But the folks back home I'll make them vouch 
You gave me wings and I used them 
I used them, I used them on my youth 
Yea You gave me wings and I used them 
I used them, I don't wanna lose them 
I don't wanna lose them 
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city 
I follow my needs for my, for my city 
We're going off the dream in my, in my city 
And that's where I'll stay 
And that's where I'll stay 
In my city 
Shoulders end for wanting wings 
My city shakes, the feel in me 
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city 
I follow my needs for my, for my city 
We're going off the dream in my, in my city 
And that's where I'll stay 
And that's where I'll stay 
In my city</field>

I feel a lump in my throat 
And this is far from joy 
I never seemed to learn 
That high makes things harder 
That high I get from you 
I've figured out that joy is not in your arms 
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart 
I think it's time to run cause I'm seeing stars 
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart 
I think of dying all the time 
But I've got joy to take my side 
Fear is my favorite ride ooh hey hoh 
I've figured out that joy is not in your arms 
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart 
I think it's time to run cause i'm seeing stars 
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart 
And then you see, ooh 
I've figured out that joy is not in your arms 
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart 
I think it's time to run cause i'm seeing stars 
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart</field>

Got you living lavish 
Anything I've got, you can have it 
Baby I'll do magic 
I'll do all I can, to keep you satisfied 
So just in case I don't make it home tonight, baby 
Just in case I don't make it home tonight 
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby

Wanna cherish each moment like the last

And I don't recognise what you said, how you said it 
Words just terrorize 
And my heart radiates but with you, froze to ice 
Empty in disguise 
Keep singing it louder, louder 
Break the hearts to win 
Just bring yourself higher, higher 
Hanging by a string 
And there was no love here to save 
So be a king now for a day 
And I'll be a queen of my mistakes 
And when you sing out all your pain 
You wear the crown 
Feel no shame in your, your, your, your kingdom 
Don't, don't, don't, hide in your kingdom 
Your, your, your, your kingdom 
Don't, don't, don't, woah 
Did you think you were fair 
To say you never cared 
Now you sit on your throne 
A lonely love affair 
Keep singing it louder, louder 
To break the hearts you lose 
Just build yourself higher 
I got nothing to prove 
And there was no love here to save 
So be a king now for a day 
And I'll be a queen of my mistakes 
And when you sing out all your pain 
You wear the crown 
Feel no shame in your, your, your, your kingdom

Know your bullets fly through the night 
Broken doors falling, and hotel floors 
I was never yours, never mine 
All I said was "Hello, hello" 
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time 
And all I said was "Hello, hello" 
Tell me how to say "goodbye, " cause it's goodbye 
I can't stay on my knees 
Give me some mercy, please 
It's alright, let it die 
I wanted everything 
More than your love could give 
It's alright, let it die 
See change whispers in the waves 
Watch my sorrows drown peacefully 
And empires crumble to the shores 
I was never yours, never mine 
All I said was "Hello, hello" 
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time

I wonder how you feel 
To be well locked in my mind 
So you barely understand my thoughts sometimes 
Little bit of death and a little bit of God 
Cause I swear that I be livin' in the dark sometimes 
And it sets in here, nobody gets let in 
Til I let my emotions out on every single page 
And instrumental that I'm left with 
Shit, I wonder 
Will I ever really feel shit? 
And if it all takes time and I ask why 
Will time eventually reveal this? 
Cause 
The remedy, I'm searching for the remedy 
Cus I'm fucked up and my heart's just 
Another ghost in my memory 
Knock real hard on real real wood 
Things still feel bad when it real real good 
And my brain just a vessel and I just feel the hell 
But the more you fuckin know less things feel real 
Less things feel real 
Then the time shifts and my mind shifts 
It ain't really anyone or anything 
I can really vibe with 
Cus I'm searching but I'm terrified 
Then bout the time I find what I'm lookin for 
I'll be dead inside 
Cause part time love is the life round here 
We're never done 
Never done 
We're never done</field>

You shine it when I'm alone

Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone 
Home 
Noises, I play within my head 
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing 
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept 
In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine it when I'm alone

I wouldn't even flinch 
I couldnt try to move 
My mind is on you 
My mind is on you 
If the streetlight smashed above me 
I wouldn't move an inch 
Turn the glass into stars 
And your face is the moon 
And the night turns to you 
Cos my mind is on you 
You've got me caught in a place 
Panic for a minute 
Got my brain in a daze 
I wish you weren't in it 
There are so many ways 
To lose your attention 
You can break everything 
But so I can take anything 
I can take anything 
I can take anything 
If electric charges shock me 
I smile and fold my arms 
I feel nothing new 
Because my mind is on you 
My mind is on you 
And if the floor gives way to my shoes 
I wouldn't try to fly 
I can't explain why I feel 
I always feel you 
I always feel, always feel you 
You've got my caught in a place 
Panic for a minute 
Got my brain in a daze 
I wish you weren't in it 
There are so many ways 
To lose your attention 
You can break everything 
But so I can take anything 
You're the heat in my bones 
But you break me with stones 
You're the heat in my bones 
But you break me with your stones 
If a plane crashed into my room 
I wouldn't even flinch 
I couldn't try to move 
My mind is always on you 
My mind is always on you

Under blossom clouds 
Though it's a strange lie 
You don't even try still you look so cool 
Like a cover boy when you like the moon 
Near the countryside but I just forgot 
All the things that matter I forget alot 
I get so caught up in the city cloud 
But this place is still my first love 
Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way 
If that somebody is you then baby I just wanna say 
Tonight, nothing will bring us down 
Tonight, we're at the lost and found 
Guess I need to run, take me to the bus 
But don't let me go, no don't let me on 
Gotta hold me tight, won't put up a fight 
Of course I'll stay, I'll stay the night 
Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way 
If that somebody is you then baby I just wanna say 
Tonight, nothing will bring us down 
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

            <field name="lyrics">You say you're going through changes 
Every day it seems your life is up and down 
And you say that you're looking for an answer 
Everywhere you look it seems 
You can't be found 
Like searching, trying to find the rainbow 
No ones ever found it, yet it's told to be 
But if you're looking for a lover 
Everything you need, you can find 
right here with me 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul 
Now you've been trapped by love 
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye 
So you say that you'll never love another 
Tired of playing games and that's the reason why 
But now whenever were together 
There's a certain feeling, that we both agree 
And it's time that you've opened up to love 
'Cause if you don't ever try, 
then baby, you may never see 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul 
Together you and I were meant to be 
I'll be right beside whenever you need me 
This love we have will never fade away 
You can count on me 'cause I'm here to stay 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar 
I've got the Midas Touch 
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul</field>

I look in the mirror 
I can't get over you 
Is this our world? 
Is it someone else? 
Is it someone else? 
I look in the mirror 
And I try to see myself 
Wherever look terror 
From the games I played so well 
I try to see clearer 
I try to forget the thoughts I started 
I try to be nearer 
To where you are 
To where you are 
Are we star crossed lovers? 
Did I really want you gone? 
If I'm really a winner 
Where do these demons come from? 
I was the girl who was on fire 
I was the girl who was on fire 
Only a bird could get much higher 
(I look in the mirror) 
'Cuz I was the girl who was on fire 
I look in the mirror 
And I try to understand 
And piece it together 
Watch the blood from both my hands 
I can't see the ending 
There are people who know my every secret 
I'm tired of pretending 
You read my heart 
You read my heart 
Are we star crossed lovers? 
Did I really want you gone? 
If I'm really a winner 
Where do these demons come from? 
I was the girl who was on fire 
I was the girl who was on fire 
Only a bird could get much higher

Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror 
And I can't help but notice 
You reflect in this heart of mine 
If you ever feel alone and 
The glare makes me hard to find 
Just know that I'm always 
Parallel on the other side 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
Aren't you somethin', an original 
Cause it doesn't seem really as simple 
And I can't help but stare, cause 
I see truth somewhere in your eyes 
I can't ever change without you 
You reflect me, I love that about you 
And if I could, I 
Would look at us all the time 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through

Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
Yesterday is history 
And tomorrow's a mystery 
I can see you lookin' back at me 
Keep your eyes on me 
Baby, keep your eyes on me 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart

That was found at 
The bottom of your garden 
I'm just wondering but the crack begin to show 
Look closely and then you'll know 
Then you'll know 
I am a beauty that once was 
Tell the country nothing something special 
But never out of your league of 
Battle with this twice now 
He came to me said 
"heres how" 
Spoke a single line 
And we dance in our scene 
I'll just die in your arms 
And my life is complete 
I am a mosaic 
That was found when you didn't know any better 
I am broken now (x3) 
And image that is scattered 
Around and (x5) 
A million ways I, I 
Didn't have to hurt (x3) 
Fought away this twice 
And now all we came to reason 
"heres how" 
Spoke a single line 
We danced in our scene 
I could just die in your arms and my life is complete 
Craddled your legs 
And took to your feet 
You're the strongest love 
I ever did meet 
Spoke a single line 
While we danced in our scene 
Just die in your arms and my life is complete</field>

And I walked a thousand miles to prove it 
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts

As you sail from me 
Alarms will ring for eternity 
The waves will break every chain on me 
My bones will bleach.. 
my flesh will flee 
So help my lifeless frame to breathe 
And god knows I'm not dying but I breathe now 
And god knows it's the only way to heal now 
With all the blood I lost with you 
It drowns the love I thought I knew 
The lost dreams I buried in my sleep for him 
And this was the ecstacy of love forgotten 
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets 
And my blood is all I see 
As you steal my soul from me 
Alarms will ring for eternity 
The waves will break every chain on me 
And god knows I'm not dying but I breathe now 
And god knows it's the only way to heal now

I'll sit there alone again

Hunt you down 
Hunt you down 
Promise we'll get along 
If you talk to me 
We'll tell eachother our stories imperfectly 
Imperfectly

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth 
Long lay the world 
In sin and error pining 
Till He appeared and the spirit felt its worth 
A thrill of hope 
The weary world rejoices 
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn 
Fall on your knees 
O hear the angel voices 
O night divine 
O the night when Christ was born 
Truly He taught us 
To love one another 
His law is love and His gospel is peace 
Chains He shall break 
For the slave is our brother 
And in His name all oppression shall cease 
O the world 
A star is sweetly gleaming 
Sweet hymns of joy 
In grateful chorus raise we 
Fall on your knees 
O hear the angel voices 
O night divine 
O the night when Christ was born 
Night divine 
O the night when Christ was born 
When Christ was born

I don't even really know what you intended 
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous 
Poured it down, so I poured it down 
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you 
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you 
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos 
Poured it down, so I poured it down 
And now I don't understand it 
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth 
And I know I shouldn't say it 
But my heart don't understand 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
But my heart don't understand 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
I always hear, always hear them talking 
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name 
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it 
You didn't love me, no, not really 
Wait 
I could have really liked you 
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you 
It's a shame (shame) , you said I was good 
So I poured it down, so I poured it down 
And now I don't understand it 
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth 
And I know I shouldn't say it 
But my heart don't understand 
Why I got you on my mind

Why I got you on my mind 
You think you know somebody 
Why I got you on my mind 
You think you know somebody 
Why I got you on my mind 
You got yourself in a dangerous zone 
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone 
And I still don't understand it 
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth 
And my heart don't understand it 
Understand it, understand it 
Why I got you on my mind 
You think you know somebody 
Why I got you on my mind 
You think you know somebody 
Why I got you on my mind

Our faith he'll hear our cries a ghost 
And he won't stop here, acting with my fear 
There's a raging fire and it burns so mean

On the roof leaks they got started 
And now when the rain comes we can be thankful 
When the mountaineers saw that everything fit 
They were glad and so they took off 
Thought we were due for a change 
Or two around this place 
When they got back they're all mixed up 
With no one to stay with 
The village used to be all one really needs 
Now it's filled with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals 
That mostly surround you, you wish to flee 
But it's not like you so listen to me listen to me 
Oh and when the morning comes 
We will step outside 
We will not find another man in sight 
We like the newness the newness of all 
That has grown in our garden 
Struggling for so long 
Whenever I was a child 
I wonder what if my name had changed 
Into something more productive 
Like Roscoe been born in 1891 
Waiting with my aunt Roslein 
Thought we were due for a change 
Or two around this place 
When they got back they're all mixed up 
With no one to stay with 
1891 they roamed around and foraged 
They made their house from cedars 
They made their house from stone 
Well they're a little like you 
Adn they're a little like me 
We have all we need 
Thought we were due for a change 
Or two around this place 
This place 
This place 
When they got back they're all mixed up 
With no one to stay with 
When they got back they're all mixed up 
With no one to stay with</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You're as sharp as a knife 
and you fit like a glove 
That is no way to live 
that is no way to love 
Full of fear in your skin 
and the weakness in giving in 
Stabbed in the back but youi feel no pain 
Push the heaviest doors 
that you can't open 
Yeah they tied me up 
and my body lies still, again 
You're as bright as the sun 
and as calm as the moon 
I don't know when you'll break 
but it's going be soon 
If my will caves in 
I'll be in the same 
boat as you 
I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 
He's steealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm wiinning wars they created 
just understand the .."the meaning of" 
Hands on strings and my mouth open 
Find the perfect words 
that i've not spoken 
And I won't tell the turth 
unless you want me to 
For all of the times that I lost my head 
When it rolled to the floor 
and I found it again 
But when it come back 
I didn't know my own name 
I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 
He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they created 
just to understand..."the meaning of" 
I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 
He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they created

But lately I just need a voice I recognise 
Baby, it's perfect timing now to 
Scream it out, out 
I won't let you down, down 
So scream it out, out 
I won't let you down, down 
Have you found peace with your mistakes? 
Breathing on the glass as it breaks 
Have you found the words to save her 
And keep your heart out of danger? 
I don't think I can take the violence 
And lately I just need a voice I recognise 
Baby, it's perfect timing now to 
Scream it out, out

That's all I ever wanted 
Wishing you were closer

This feels different 
With you I've never been so sure 
You reel me in 
I'd never been that far before 
That's what I found 
That's what I found 
That's what I found 
These days slow down 
Nothing but air and oceans between us 
Weighing me down 
I wish that we had nothing in common 
Then there would be no distance to dwell on 
I am waiting but what good is another day 
I've got too much time 
But never time enough to say 
You're all I wanted 
You are all I wanted 
You're all I found 
You're what I found 
These days slow down 
Nothing but air and oceans between us 
Weighing me down 
I wish that we had nothing in common 
And I wouldn't feel so distant 
You give me all 
The time that you have 
But you're still away 
In no way I'm glad 
Cuz I've got more time 
So I can work out 
All the places we'll go 
And what we'll talk about 
Oohh when you're back 
These days slow down 
Nothing but air and oceans between us 
Weighing me down 
I wish that we had nothing in common 
And I wouldn't feel so distant

Some nights, I call it a draw 
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle 
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off 
But I still wake up and I still see your ghost 
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for 
What do I stand for? 
What do I stand for? 
Most nights, I don't know... 
So come on 
This is it, boys, this is war 
What are we waiting for? 
Why don't we break the rules already? 
I was never one to believe the hype 
Save that for the black and white 
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked 
But here they go again to jack my style 
That's alright 
I found a martyr in my bed tonight 
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am 
Who I am 
Who I am 
Oh, who am I? 
Who am I? 
Who am I? 
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end 
Cause I could use some friends for a change 
And some nights 
I'm scared you'll forget me again 
Some nights, I always win, I always win 
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost 
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for 
What do I stand for? 
What do I stand for? 
Most nights, I don't know 
My heart is breaking for my sister 
And the con that she called "love" 
But when I look into my nephew's eyes 
Man, you wouldn't believe 
The most amazing things 
That can come from 
That can come from 
Some terrible nights 
Some terrible nights 
It's for the best you didn't listen 
It's for the best we get our distance</field>

Bring me down, side by side 
While our reflections pick up all this collide 
So full of energy, nothing to hide 
No need to sleep, we come alive

We can go wherever we like

I flash before our dreams 
Like a flash before our eyes 
Running through the night 
And if it feels like you're dreaming 
Believe it, believe it 
We'll have to wait to the morning 
The sun will never go down

This love is like fire and ice 
This love is like rain and blue skies 
This love is like sun on the rise 
This love got me rolling the dice 
Don't let me lose 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
Beautiful mind 
Your heart got a story with mine 
Your heart got me hurting at times 
Your heart gave me new kind of highs 
Your heart got me feeling so fine 
So what to do 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
It took us a while 
With every breath a new day 
With love on the line 
We've had our share of mistakes 
But all your flaws and scars are mine 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
I'm in 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do 
I'm still falling for you 
Brighter than gold 
This love shining brighter than gold 
This love is like letters in bold 
This love is like out of control 
This love is never growing old 
You make it new 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
It took us a while 
Because we were young and unsure 
With love on the line 
What if we both would need more 
But all your flaws and scars are mine 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
I'm in 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do 
I'm still falling for you 
Falling, crash into my arms 
Love you like this 
Like a first kiss 
Never let go 
Falling, crash into my arms 
Never breaking what we got 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
I'm in 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
All for me

Won't stop to surrender. 
Songs of desperation

Waste days, in foreign places 
Shed light, on your better side 
Reassure me, that you'll wait for me 
Wait for me, as long as it takes 
And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath 
Between me leaving and the news 
We'll dance alone between the trees 
We go, the buildings turn to dust 
Full of diamonds just for us 
You are the shifter of my shape 
We're making sense of our escape 
We'll dance, we'll blow them all away 
We'll blow them all away 
Fight fires in your best clothes 
Touch skin with your eyes closed 
Chase thunder with the volume down 
Pack a suitcase one into the next town 
Force quit on your losing streak 
Solve a riddle in the magazine, be tongue in cheek 
Tell me that we're still too young 
That we're still too young and 
I'll hold my tongue

She's the giggle at a funeral 
Knows everybody's disapproval 
I should've worshipped her sooner 
If the Heavens ever did speak 
She is the last true mouthpiece 
Every Sunday's getting more bleak 
A fresh poison each week 
We were born sick 
you heard them say it 
My church offers no absolutes 
She tells me "worship in the bedroom" 
The only heaven I'll be sent to 
Is when I'm alone with you 
I was born sick, but I love it 
Command me to be well 
Amen 
Amen 
Amen 
Take me to church 
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies 
I'll tell you my sins 
So you can sharpen your knife 
Offer me that deathless death 
Good God, let me give you my life 
Take me to church 
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies 
I'll tell you my sins 
So you can sharpen your knife 
Offer me that deathless death 
Good God, let me give you my life 
If I'm a pagan of the good times 
My lover's the sunlight 
To keep the Goddess on my side 
She demands a sacrifice 
To drain the whole sea get something shiny 
Something meaty for the main course 
That's a fine looking high horse 
What you got in the stable? 
We've a lot of starving faithful 
That looks tasty 
That looks plenty 
This is hungry work 
Take me to church 
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies 
I'll tell you my sins 
so you can sharpen your knife 
Offer me my deathless death 
Good God, let me give you my life 
Take me to church 
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies 
I'll tell you my sins 
So you can sharpen your knife 
Offer me my deathless death 
Good God, let me give you my life 
No masters or kings when the ritual begins 
There is no sweeter innocence 
Than our gentle sin 
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene 
Only then I am human, only then I am clean 
Amen 
Amen 
Amen 
Take me to church 
I'll worship like a dog 
At the shrine of your lies 
I'll tell you my sins 
So you can sharpen your knife 
Offer me that deathless death 
Good God, let me give you my life 
Take me to church 
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies 
I'll tell you my sins 
So you can sharpen your knife 
Offer me that deathless death 
Good God, let me give you my life</field>

You're a shark and I'm swimming 
My heart still thumps as I bleed 
And all your friends come sniffing 
Triangles are my favorite shape 
Three points where two lines meet 
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love; it's very late 
'Til morning comes, let's tessellate 
Go alone my flower 
And keep my whole lovely you 
Wild green stones alone my lover 
And keep us on my heart 
Three guns and one goes off 
One's empty, one's not quick enough 
One burn, one red, one grin 
Search the graves while the camera spins 
Chunks of you will sink down to seals 
Blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up 
Yes, they'll nosh the love away but it's fair to say 
You will still haunt me 
Triangles are my favorite shape 
Three points where two lines meet 
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go my love; it's very late 
'Til morning comes 
Wild green stones alone my lover 
And keep us on my heart</field>

We've only ever touched 
When there's no one else around 
I can be elusive if you want me to 
I'm not being intrusive 
I just wish I knew the truth 
As to why 
I wait for you 
Longer than the average person would 
And why 
I think about you 
More than I think one should 
Our body's fit together like a makeshift puzzle 
And it's clear to see why you puzzle me 
When you turn your frame 
And you whisper my name 
As though I am a burden 
And I know 
And I know 
This will happen again and again 
So don't let us pretend that this is the end 
This is the end 
This is the end 
I am at your house 
So I belong to you for now 
Trying to impress you 
But lord I don't know how 
I can be a statue if you want me to 
I'm not being difficult I just need to know the truth 
As to why 
I'm wanting you 
And I would take you away if I could 
And why I'm still here 
It's something I still haven't understood 
Our hands press together like pieces of paper 
But they're always blank when I hold your hand 
And it gave you a fright 
When I stayed the night 
Cus you gave yourself to me 
And I'm making up for last time 
And I'm making up for you 
And I'm waking up from last night 
And I'm waking up with you 
So what's new 
So what's new 
So what's new 
Our hands press together like pieces of paper 
But they're always blank when I hold your hand 
And it gave you a fright 
When I stayed the night 
Cus you gave yourself to me 
And I'm making up for last time 
And I'm making up for you 
And I'm waking up from last night 
And I'm waking up with you

That true love, it was taken away 
from us so young 
we're summer kids 
Without a song, 
we're fading in to oblivion 
But we're still the one 
We got our guard up 
and we're hung up on another loss 
I need to summon all these demons 
keeping me on the floor 
But now we're here 
and I am giving everything to you 
Just say you need this, 
say you need me 
say you want this too 
Say you want this too 
Say you need this too 
we're the greatest 
No one gets it like we do 
Gets it like we do 
Kills it like we do 
we're the greatest 
No one does it like we do 
That sadness kills 
don't let the past dictate 
the way you play it now 
don't play it down 
The time is now 
I know you're feeling what I feel, 
just let it show 
don't let it go 
Somebody somewhere driving in their car 
is crying out 
Forever running from the truth 
sometimes all we have is doubt 
But now we're here 
and I am giving all I can to you 
Just say you love me, say you love me 
say you want this too 
Say you want this too 
Say you need this too

Swing wide your crane, 
Swing wide your crane 
And run me through. 
And the story's all over you 
In the morning I'll call you 
Can't you find a clue when 
Your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue.

I wait for a word 
Lying next to your frame 
Girl unobserved 
You change your position 
You're changing me 
Casting these shadows 
Where they shouldn't be 
We're interrupted 
By the heat of the sun 
Trying to prevent 
What's already begun 
You're just a body 
I can smell your skin 
And when I feel it 
You're wearing thin 
But I've got a plan 
Why don't you be the artist 
And make me out of clay? 
Why don't you be the writer 
And decide the words I say? 
Cause I'd rather pretend 
I'll still be there at the end 
Only it's too hard to ask 
Won't you try to help me? 
Sat on your sofa 
It's all broken springs 
This isn't the place for 
Those violin strings 
I try out a smile 
And I aim it at you 
You must have missed it 
You always do 
But I've got a plan 
Why don't you be the artist 
And make me out of clay? 
Why don't you be the writer

Where's that valentine, be honest,

The letter that you loved her better, 
Made me want you even, more 
And too much love's not good for you 
Your heart can get too full 
And too much love's an IOU 
And if I give you that, you'll 
Send me the blues. 
Ooohhhh, yeah 
Where is all that time you promised? 
The first hand's on the three 
Where's the second hand, I'm bothered 
To see it stroking on her knee 
The thing I wasn't looking for 
I found in your bedroom drawer 
The letter that you loved her better, 
Made me want you even, more

Reaching higher than towers 
Wasn't anywhere we couldn't went 
We had unbreakable powers 
When our bodies meet, it's everything 
This is was a beautiful vision 
Even love was not a way you could describe it 
And then there comes a collision 
Nothing ever goes in the night 
[Pre-Chorus 1] 
And they're not lost forever 
Lost what once was here 
It's now just spots 
Now the fireworks are fading 
Is it over? 
Lost you in the summer two years ago 
[Chorus] 
You, you, you 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
Two years ago 
You, you, you 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
Two years ago 
[Verse 2] 
If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck? 
Thought our love is insurmountable 
He knows my heart is still aching 
Never thought it would be caused by you 
[Pre-Chorus 2] 
We're not lost forever 
Lost what once was here 
It's now just spots 
Now the fireworks are fading 
Is it over? 
Lost you in the summer two years ago

You, you, you 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
Two years ago 
You, you, you 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
Two years ago

I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on 
Two years ago 
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong 
Two years ago 
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on 
Moving on, moving on, moving on 
[Bridge] 
And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too 
I know you think of me, too 
I'll use this moment to really forget 
I will soon, but for now 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
[Chorus 2] 
Two years ago 
About you, about you 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
Two years ago 
About you, about you 
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you 
Two years ago 
[Post-Chorus] 
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on 
Two years ago 
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong 
Two years ago 
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on 
Moving on, moving on, moving on 
Two years ago 
[Outro] 
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on 
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong

You set your sights on him 
You left a hand print on the door,

This is our luck, baby, running out 
Her clothes were never off 
We still have hours to run about 
To scale the map, scale the map, 
To get us back on track 
I've seen you in a fight you lost, 
I've seen you in a fight 
We're under the sheets and you're killing me 
In our house made of paper, your words all over me 
We're under the sheets and you're killing me

In here we're frozen

My hands are empty 
You're not the answer I should know

Paint your palette blue and grey 
Look out on a summer's day 
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul 
Shadows on the hills 
Sketch the trees and the daffodils 
Catch the breeze and the winter chills 
In colors on the snowy linen land 
Now I understand 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen, they did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now 
Starry, starry night 
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 
Swirling clouds in a violet haze 
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue 
Colors changing hue 
Morning fields of amber grain 
Weathered faces lined in pain 
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand 
Now I understand 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen, they did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now 
For they could not love you 
But still your love was true 
And when no hope was left in sight 
On that starry, starry night 
You took your life, as lovers often do 
But I could've told you, Vincent 
This world was never meant 
for one as beautiful as you 
Starry, starry night 
Portraits hung in empty halls 
Frameless heads on nameless walls 
With eyes that watch the world 
and can't forget 
Like the strangers that you've met 
The ragged men in ragged clothes 
The silver thorn on the bloody rose 
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow 
Now I think I know 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen, they're not listening still 
Perhaps they never will</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Used to roll in perfect motion, easy 
Lips like Tanqueray 
Tropical sunrises, never sleeping 
I don't know what changed 
All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night 
You've been running from the dark 
You can't look me in the eyes 
Being called into the heat 
Even if it's burning me 
I just need to dance without you 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
You're not in love 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
Through the streets and all the places I've been 
I can see we never had harmony 
I won't go even though I'm alone and I know I want out 
I go up without you bringing me down 
Such a rush 
So now I'm staying to dance on my own 
On my own 
And all I know is 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
You're not in love 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
You're not in love 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
And I'm dancing on my own because 
We can't move together 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
And I'm dancing on my own because 
We can't move together 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
And I'm dancing on my own because 
We can't move together 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
And I'm dancing on my own because 
We can't move to 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
And all I know is 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss

            <field name="lyrics">When did life become so complicated? 
Years of too much thought and time I wasted 
And in each line upon my face 
Is proof I fought and lived another day 
When did life become this place of madness? 
Drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness? 
I make believe I'm in control 
And dream it wasn't all my fault 
When your feet don't touch the ground 
When your voice won't make a sound 
Here, it's safe, in this place 
Up off the clouds 
When your feet don't touch the earth 
You can't feel the fates that hurt 
And you're free, there's no need to come down 
When your feet don't touch the ground 
Everyday just feels a little longer 
Why am I the only one not getting stronger? 
Running around pretending life's a play 
It doesn't make the darkness go away 
I may be young but I can still remember 
Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter 
Now all my tears are all cried out 
Make-believe, but count me out 
Cause my feet are on the ground 
And the inner voice I found 
Tells the truth 
"There's no use if your head's in the clouds" 
With my feet on solid earth 
I can face the fates that hurt 
And in time, I'll be fine 
I'll come 'round 
I was once like you 
Life was a maze 
I couldn't find my way out 
But what I say is true 
You will be amazed 
Make-believe and you will find out that it's time 
When your feet don't touch the ground 
When your voice won't make a sound 
Here, it's safe 
In this place 
Up off the clouds 
When your feet don't touch the earth 
You can't feel the fates that hurt 
And you're free, there's no need, to come down 
When your feet don't touch the ground</field>

I think I know what you're trying to say 
Honey, it's fair play 
Why try to win when I know I've lost 
We don't have to spell it 
I think I know what you're trying to say 
Just because I think this could break me 
It doesn't mean that it will at all 
Love to the lovers 
Hate to the haters 
Love to you, babe 
Do what you have to 
What a shame

The winner takes 
She takes it all 
What a shame 
What a loss 
But I can see why, because she's beautiful 
What a defeat 
To say the least 
But thank god 
The love is free 
And maybe it's good for you 
It's good for me 
Let's call it a day, babe 
I think I know what you're trying to say 
And honey you're so right 
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn 
Let's call it a maybe 
But we both know you're already gone 
And just because it feels like I'm breaking 
It doesn't mean I will fall apart 
Love to the lovers 
Hate to the haters 
Love to you, babe 
Do what you have to

            <field name="lyrics">Why can't we speak another language, one we all agree on 
When when men look outside, do they see houses 
Instead of the fields they grew from 
We are Constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful 
Can you get up right now, endeavor to freefall (Off) 
You can fall if you want to It's just a matter of how far 
You've treasured our home town 
But you've forgotten where you are 
And it will stay with you until you're mind's been found 
and it has been found wondering around 
With that skipping rope, the trampoline 
The crafty smoke that made us choke 
But we didn't give up hope 
It's just the simple ways, of getting paid 
The carelessnes of running away 
I wish I stayed 
I wish I stayed 
I wish I stayed 
Patterns all aranged in my background 
It's pillars and posts keeping this country on form 
Letters were all sent with no addresses 
So that people can't discover 
Always undercover 
Why do i always draw triangles 
Instead of words this paper so deserves 
You see 
I don't own my clothes but i own my mind 
And it's not what you've lost 
But it's what you find. 
I don't own my clothes but i own my mind 
And it's not what you've lost 
But it's what you find. 
With that skipping rope, the trampoline 
The crafty smoke that made us choke 
But we didn't give up hope 
It's just the simple ways, of getting paid 
The carelessnes of running away 
I wish I stayed 
I wish I stayed 
I wish I stayed 
cos you can fall if you want to 
It's just a matter of how far

And then we wandered through the streets of London Town 
You 
You and me 
You 
You and me 
Sometimes the distance has been hard to bear 
I lay awake in hotels wishing you were there 
I slowly drift off, trying to find your beating heart 
You 
You and me 
You 
You and me 
We are the crosswords, since you're away 
There will be sparks and splinters 
Still are the crosswords, every day 
But it doesn't really matter just as long as there is you and me 
Ooh, ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh, ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh 
You and me

You and me 
It's take a risk some, everything we go 
Buy ourselves a caravan, make it down to space 
And every evening, we'll sit and count the stars</field>

Signs don't show 
You drove me off the road 
But you let go 
Cos your hope is gone 
And every question fades away 
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from 
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off? 
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's 
False start? 
You know this is your biggest mistake 
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste 
And of all the things you never explained 
You know this is your biggest mistake 
You tread water 
Fighting for the air in your lungs 
Move, move closer 
Maybe you can right all your wrongs 
But you let go 
Cos your hope is gone 
And every answer fades away 
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from 
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off? 
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's 
False start? 
You know this is your biggest mistake 
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste 
And of all the things you never explained 
You know this is your biggest mistake 
Wipe the mud stains from the face, stop the engine 
Stop pretending 
Wipe the mud spray from your face, stop the engine 
Stop pretending that you're still breathing 
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from 
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off? 
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's 
False start?

Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words 
How wonderful life is now you're in the world 
If I was a sculptor, but then again no 
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show 
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do 
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

Lie next to your frame 
Girl unobserved 
 
You change your position 
And you are changing me 
Casting these shadows 
Where they shouldn't be 
 
We're interrupted 
By the heat of the sun 
Trying to prevent 
What's already begun 
 
You're just a body 
I can smell your skin 
And when I feel it 
You're wearing thin 
 
But I've got a plan 
Why don't you be the artist 
And make me out of clay 
Why don't you be the writer 
And decide the words I say 
 
Because I'd rather pretend 
I'll still be there at the end 
Only it's too hard to ask 
Won't you try to help me 
 
Sat on your sofa, it's all broken springs 
This isn't the place for those violin strings 
I try out a smile and I aim it at you 
You must have missed it, you always do

You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted 
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted 
You wait, I wait, casting shadows

Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone 
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one 
 
Next thing we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 
Ah 
 
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And everybody goes 
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And my body goes 
Whoa oh oh ah ah 
Whoa oh oh ah ah 
Whoa oh oh 
 
So we burst into colors, colors and carousels, 
Fall head first like paper planes in playground games 
 
Next thing we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 
Ah 
 
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And everybody goes 
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And my body goes 
Whoa oh oh ah ah 
Whoa oh oh ah ah 
Whoa oh oh 
 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
 
Hit me with lightning 
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And everybody goes 
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And my body goes oh 
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And everybody goes 
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And my body goes 
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
(And my body goes) 
Whoa oh oh ah ah</field>

I'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun 
We are seventeen, we have just begun 
I have loved to fight for and then some 
You are the one, the one, the one, the one, 
The one, the one, the one, the one 
 
Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed 
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies 
There will be no blood and there will be no pain 
I want to fall in love with you again, again, 
Again, again, again, again, again, again 
Again, again 
 
You have stolen all my senses 
There's a fever in my heart 
And you are taking my defenses 
You are pulling me apart 
Forever we are and we are dying 
And we still be standing on our ground 
So I will take away my feeling 
I will be an animal 
An animal 
 
I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you 
We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth 
I'll color in the sky, and I'll color you 
I want to join your skin again, again, 
Again, again, again, again, again, again 
Again 
 
You have stolen all my senses 
There's a fever in my heart 
And you are taking my defenses 
You are pulling me apart 
Forever we are and we are dying 
And we still be standing on our ground 
So I will take away my feeling 
I will be an animal 
An animal 
 
We will run away from danger 
We will run away 
 
I-I-I-I-I will fight for 
 
You have stolen all my senses 
There's a fever in my heart 
And you are taking my defenses 
You are pulling me apart 
Forever we are and we are dying 
And we still be standing on our ground 
So I will take away my feeling 
I will be an animal

            <field name="lyrics">Listen 
I can hear a voice 
I need a helping hand 
Just to beat the void 
I need a mission 
A dream to stop me talking to myself 
 
And now the silence is broken 
And my soul is to sell 
I need to pick up the pieces 
To scatter to the wind 
Hold the city to your ears 
You can hear the wind come in 
 
But you can't change the world with a song 
And you can't make it right when it's wrong 
 
I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go 
It's playing for you 
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do 
It's talking to you 
The world dances to the rhythm of its own 
Heart beating for you, however you lose 
So speak to me 
Believe, believe, believe me 
 
Don't let it slip, through your fingertips 
When there's a ghost 
Don't try to reason with it 
Because now I'm tired 
I'm wired 
So I won't miss a think 
I rope my words out to dry 
And I've forgotten what to sing 
But you can't change the world 
With a song and you can't make it right when it's wrong 
 
I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go 
It's playing for you 
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do 
It's talking to you 
The world dances to the rhythm of its own 
Heart beating for you, however you lose 
So speak to me 
Believe, believe, believe me. 
 
If that's what it was to you, 
Then that's what it was to me. 
If that's what it was to you, 
Then that's what it was to me. 
If that's what it was to you, 
Then that's what it was to me. 
 
But you can't change the world 
With a song and you can't make it right when it's wrong 
 
I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go 
It's playing for you 
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do 
It's talking to you 
The world dances to the rhythm of its own 
Heart beating for you, however you lose

And we part with a letter

It starts with forever 
And it ends with a touch 
And I know that you're clever 
And I don't ask for much oh 
 
Maybe we forgot all the things we are 
When we are together 
 
You said I'm arresting 
You said I had heat 
I really thought that we would go further 
The second time we'd meet 
'Cause I'm tired of trying to keep you 
All I want to do is sleep 
But perhaps when I'm sleeping 
You'll get back on your feet 
 
Maybe we forgot all the things we are 
When we are together 
 
Wake me up 
Wake me up 
Stop my fall 
Every time you go 
Tape me up 
Then break me up 
Ever so gently 
When I'm at my weakest 
It's not so hard 
Every time you go 
 
I run out to meet you 
When I knew the storm had come 
And I felt the rain on your face 
And the damage you have done 
And I know what you're thinking 
It will never be the end 
And when the storm is over 
You won't see me again 
Do know all the regrets I paid 
For all the times I saved we were together 
 
Wake me up 
Stop my fall 
Every time you go 
Tape me up 
Then break me up 
Ever so gently 
When I'm my weakest 
It's not so hard 
 
Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not? 
Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not? 
Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not? 
Maybe we forgot

Wake me up 
Stop my fall 
Every time you go 
Tape me up 
Then break me up 
Ever so gently 
When I'm at my weakest 
 
Wake me up 
Wake me up 
Stop my fall 
Every time you go 
Tape me up 
Then break me up 
Ever so gently 
When I'm at my weakest 
It's not so hard

Will again close the gates

Every line and every abrasion 
This took my life to make 
This took my life to make

No poison in my bones

Let it all fall out open your mouth 
Often I lie wide awake, 
Think of things I can make 
But I don't seem to have the parts to build them 
Human I wonder why you're a better make 
Than I could ever build or create, 
You know not love or hate 
I am so scared of what will kill me 
In the end for I am not prepared, 
I hope I will get the chance to be someone, 
To be human, 
Look what we've done, 
Look what we've done 
 
I would give my life, to be human 
I would give my life, to be human 
I would give my life, to be human 
I would give my life, to be. 
 
Human I'm trying to come clean, 
I will be a better me, 
I will not drink until I'm dead 
I'll make the most of it. 
I don't know what it's like to be alive, 
To say goodbye, 
To cry a thousand tears 
Because my ears won't listen 
 
Human I'm trying not to lose my faith in you, 
I've sussed out all that I've seen through, 
I've sailed an ocean 
 
I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end 
For I am not prepared, 
I hope I will get the chance to be someone 
To be human, 
Look what we've done, 
Look what we've done 
 
I used to hear it all so loud, 
The sound of my heart breaking. 
The truth is waiting to be found, 
I trust that I will take it 
 
I would give my life, 
I would give my life, 
I would give my life, 
I would give my life, 
I would give my life, to be 
I would give my life, to be

I wouldn't even flinch 
I couldn't try to move 
My mind is on you 
My mind is on you 
 
If the streetlight smashed above me 
I wouldn't move an inch 
Turn the glass into stars 
And your face is the moon 
And the night turns to you 
Cos my mind is on you 
 
You've got me caught in a place 
Panic for a minute 
Got my brain in a daze 
I wish you weren't in it 
There are so many ways 
To lose your attention 
You can break everything 
But so I can take anything 
 
I can take anything 
I can take anything 
 
If electric charges shock me 
I smile and fold my arms 
I feel nothing new 
Because my mind is on you 
 
My mind is on you 
 
And if the floor gives way to my shoes 
I wouldn't try to fly 
I cant explain why I feel 
I always feel you 
 
I always feel, always feel you 
 
You've got my caught in a place 
Panic for a minute 
Got my brain in a daze 
I wish you weren't in it

You can break everything 
But so I can take anything 
 
Your the heat in my bones 
But you break me with stones 
 
You're the heat in my bones 
But you break me with your stones 
 
If a plane crashed into my room

Even when I'm caught in a place 
Panic for a minute 
Got my brain in a daze

We both could live. 
 
So excuse me forgetting

See I've forgotten if 
They're green or they're blue 
 
Anyway the thing is, 
What I really mean, 
Yours are the sweetest eyes 
I've ever seen 
 
And you can tell everybody 
This is your song 
It maybe quite simple but 
Now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life is 
Now you're in the world 
 
If I was a sculptor 
But then again no 
Or a girl who makes potions in 
A traveling show 
I know it's not much but 
It's the best I can do. 
My gift is my song and 
This one's for you. 
 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

That is no way to live that is no way to love 
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in 
Your stabbed in the back but you feel no pain 
Push the heaviest doors that you can't open 
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again 
 
You're as bright as the sun and as calm as the wind 
I don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon 
If my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you 
 
I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 
He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning 
Wars they created 
Just to understand 
The meaning (of) 
 
Hands on strings and my mouth open 
Find the perfect words that I've not spoken 
And I won't tell the truth unless you want me to 
 
For all of the times that I lost my head 
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again 
But when it came back, 
I didn't know my own name 
 
I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 
He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning 
Wars they created

Of, of

Oh who am I to say I'm always yours 
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores 
Oh I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart 
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark 
Oh I don't think you warned me much at all 
 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
 
This love is not what you want 
This heart will never be yours 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall</field>

One we all agree on 
When men look outside, they see houses 
Instead of the fields they grew from 
We are constantly uprooted from them 
Making us tiresome (and fearful) 
Can you get up right now 
Endeavor to free fall? 
 
You can fall if you want to! 
It's just a matter of how far 
You've treasured our hometown, 
But you've forgotten where you are 
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found, 
And it has been found wondering around 
 
With that skipping rope, the trampoline, 
The crafty smoke that made us choke 
But we didn't give up hope 
It's just the simple ways of getting paid, 
The carelessness of running away 
I wish I stayed 
I wish I stayed 
 
Patterns all arranged in my background 
Pillars and posts keeping this country on form 
Letters were all sent 
With no addresses so that people can't discover 
That we're always under cover 
Why do I always draw triangles? 
Instead of words this paper deserves 
 
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind, 
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find 
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind, 
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find 
 
With that skipping rope, the trampoline, 
The crafty smoke that made us choke 
But we didn't give up hope 
It's just the simple ways of getting paid, 
The carelessness of running away 
I wish I stayed 
I wish I stayed 
 
You can fall if you want to! 
It's just a matter of how far 
You've treasured our hometown, 
But you've forgotten where you are 
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found, 
And it has been found wondering around 
 
With that skipping rope, the trampoline, 
The crafty smoke that made us choke 
But we didn't give up hope 
It's just the simple ways of getting paid, 
The carelessness of running away

I wait for a word 
Lie next to your frame 
Girl unobserved 
You change your position 
And you are changing me 
Casting these shadows 
Where they shouldn't be 
 
We're interrupted by the heat of the sun 
Trying to prevent what's already begun 
You're just a body 
I can smell your skin 
And when I feel it, you're wearing thin 
 
But I've got a plan 
Why don't you be the artist, and make me out of clay? 
Why don't you be the writer and decide the words I say? 
'Cause I'd rather pretend 
I'll still be there at the end 
Only it's too hard to ask, won't you try to help me 
 
Sat on your sofa, it's all broken springs 
This isn't the place for those violin strings 
I try out a smile and I aim it at you 
You must have missed it 
You always do 
 
But I've got a plan 
Why don't you be the artist, and make me out of clay? 
Why don't you be the writer and decide the words I say? 
'Cause I'd rather pretend 
I'll still be there at the end 
Only it's too hard to ask, won't you try to help me 
 
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted 
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted 
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted 
You wait, I wait, casting shadows 
 
Why don't you be the artist, and make me out of clay? 
Why don't you be the writer and decide the words I say? 
'Cause I'd rather pretend 
I'll still be there at the end 
Only it's too hard to ask, won't you try to help me

Signs don't show 
You drove me 
Off the road 
 
But you let go 
'Cause your hope is gone 
And every question fades away 
 
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from 
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off 
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start? 
 
You know this is your biggest mistake 
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste 
And of all the things you never explained 
Well you know this is your biggest mistake 
 
You tread water 
Fighting for the air in your lungs 
Move 
Move closer 
Maybe you can right all your wrongs 
 
But you let go 
'Cause your hope is gone 
And every answer fades away 
 
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from 
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off 
Would it take the end of time to hear your hearts false start? 
 
You know this is your biggest mistake 
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste 
And of all the things you never explained 
Well you know this is your biggest mistake 
 
Wipe the mud spray from the face stop the engine 
Stop pretending 
Wipe the mud spray from your face stop the engine, 
Stop pretending, that you're still breathing 
 
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from 
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off 
Would it take the end of time to hear your hearts false start? 
 
You know this is your biggest mistake 
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste 
And of all the things you never explained

To see our names are written 
On the wreck of '86 
That was the year 
I knew the panic was over 
 
Yes since we found out 
Since we found out 
That anything could happen 
Anything could happen 
Anything could happen 
Anything could happen 
Anything could happen 
Anything could happen 
Anything could 
 
After the war we said we'd fight together 
I guess we thought that's just what humans do 
Letting darkness grow 
As if we need it's palette and we need it's color 
But now I've seen it through 
And now I know the truth 
 
That anything could happen 
Anything could happen 
Anything could happen 
Anything could happen 
Anything could happen 
Anything could happen

Baby, I'll give you everything you need 
I'll give you everything you need, oh 
I'll give you everything you need 
But I don't think I need you 
 
Stripped to the waist 
We fall into the river 
Cover your eyes 
So you don't know the secret 
I've been trying to hide

And I gave in 
I lack the things you need the most 
You said where have you been 
You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide 
I wonder why 
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into 
But you never tried 
I've fallen from grace 
Took a blow to my face 
I've loved and I've lost 
I've loved and I've lost 
 
Explosions on the day you wake up 
Needing somebody and you've learned 
It's okay to be afraid 
But it will never be the same 
It will never be the same 
 
You left my soul bleeding in the dark 
So you could be king 
The rules you set are still untold to me and I 
Lost my faith in everything 
The nights you could cope, your intentions were gold 
But the mountains will shake 
I need to know I can still make 
 
Explosions on the day you wake up 
Needing somebody and you've learned 
It's okay to be afraid 
But it will never be the same 
 
And as the floods move in 
And your body starts to sink 
I was the last thing on your mind 
I know you better than you think 
'Cause it's simple darling, I gave you a warning 
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces 
So watch them fall with you, in slow motion 
I pray that you will find peace of mind 
And I'll find you another time 
I'll love you, another time 
 
Explosions on the day you wake up 
Needing somebody and you've learned 
It's okay to be afraid 
But it will never be the same</field>

I'm buried in the snow

Like a last breath you would breathe 
You were like home to me 
I don't recognize the street 
 
Please don't close your eyes 
Don't know where to look without them 
Outside the cars speed by 
I never heard them until now 
 
I know you care, I know it is always been there 
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it 
You are just saving yourself when you hide it 
Yeah, I know you care 
I see it in the way that you stare 
As if there was trouble ahead, and you knew it 
I'll be saving myself from the ruin 
And I know you care 
 
I use to run down the stairs, to the door 
And I thought you were there 
To shape to the comfort of us 
Two lovers loved out of love 
 
Oh, but I know you care 
I know it is always been there 
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it 
You are just saving yourself when you hide it 
Yeah, I know you care 
I see it in the way that you stare 
As if there was trouble ahead, and you knew it 
I'll be saving myself from the ruin 
 
I know it wasn't always wrong 
But I've never known a winter so cold 
Now I don't want my hands in a coat 
But I still hope 
'Cause this is how things ought to have been 
And I know the worst of it wasn't all that it seemed 
Why can't I dream? 
Do I care to dream? 
 
'Cause I know you care 
And I know you care 
I know you care 
I know you care 
I know it's always been there</field>

I would've listened to my brother when he spoke to me 
And I never would've played with my conscience 
In the fields where I was in their company 
 
But You gave me wings and I used them 
I used them, I used them on my youth 
And You gave me wings and I used them 
I used them, and I won't lose them 
 
Now I found my feet count to 1, 2, 3 
And I'm taking off tonight, now I'm free 
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete 
And I and I and I 
 
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city 
I follow my needs for my, for my city 
We're going off the dream in my, in my city 
And that's where I'll stay 
And that's where I'll stay 
In my city 
 
Rolling down the streets in my new town 
With the lights blinding and my heart played down 
I think I'll get a job receive people's thunder 
But the folks back home I'll make them vouch 
 
You gave me wings and I used them 
I used them, I used them on my youth 
Yeah You gave me wings and I used them 
I used them, I don't wanna lose them 
I don't wanna lose them 
 
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city 
I follow my needs for my, for my city 
We're going off the dream in my, in my city 
And that's where I'll stay 
And that's where I'll stay 
In my city 
 
Shoulders ache for wanted wings 
My city shakes, the fear in me 
 
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city 
I follow my needs for my, for my city 
We're going off the dream in my, in my city 
And that's where I'll stay

I've figured out that joy is not in your arms

I think it's time to run 'cos I'm seeing stars 
I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart 
 
I think of dying all the time 
But I've got joy to take my side 
Fear is my favorite ride

As you sail from me 
 
Alarms will ring for eternity 
The waves will break every chain on me 
My bones will bleach 
My flesh will flee 
So help my lifeless frame to breathe 
 
And God knows, I'm not dying but I breathe now 
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now 
With all the blood I lost with you 
It drowns the love I thought I knew 
 
The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him 
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten 
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets 
And my blood is all I see 
As you steal my soul from me 
 
Alarms will ring for eternity 
The waves will break every chain on me 
 
And God knows, I'm not dying but I breathe now 
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now

There's a raging fire and it burns so mean

Gonna let it burn burn burn burn 
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn 
 
We don't wanna leave, no, we just gonna be right now 
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor 
Acting crazy getting loco to the lights out 
Music's on, I'm waking up, we stop the vibe, and we bump it up 
And it's over now, we got the love, there's no secret now, no secret now 
 
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard 
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world 
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky 
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire, yeah we got the fire fire fire 
 
And we gonna let it burn burn burn burn 
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn 
Gonna let it burn burn burn burn 
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn 
 
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard 
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world 
 
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn 
Burn burn burn burn 
 
We can light it up up up 
So they can put it out out out 
We can light it up up up 
So they can put it out out out 
We can light it up up up 
So they can put it out out out 
We can light it up up up

Swore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day 
Loosen the noose and let go of the rope 
I know if it's never coming back it has to go 
 
I keep callin' your name, keep callin' your name 
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed 
So I keep callin' at night, keep callin' at night 
I wanna hold you close I just never I wanna hold you tight 
 
Goodness gracious I can see the stars 
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms 
Goodness gracious I can see the stars 
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms 
 
I found the weakness and put it to play 
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you til the night was day 
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know 
You said if you're never comin' back you have to go 
 
I keep callin' your name, keep callin' your name 
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed 
So I keep callin' at night, keep callin' at night 
I wanna hold you close I just never wanna hold you tight

Ah, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms 
Callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms 
 
Oh my goodness, here I go again 
Pullin' you back to me, pullin' you back into my arms so selfishly 
I don't think I understand 'cause I don't really know myself 
I keep callin' you callin' you out 
Callin' you out, callin' you out, callin' you out

With a spinning head I lie and watch you smoke 
Change the hands on my watch and hold you close 
This misery is weightless as a stone 
 
Have you lost the same things I have lost? 
Do you know that panic I know? 
Would I see the terror in your face? 
Do you know that fever I know? 
I wish time was still 
We'd stay right here 
With time to kill in our hearts without chains 
 
And if time was still 
We'd have no fear or scars to heal 
In our hearts without chains 
In our hearts without chains 
 
You left everything behind except yourself 
All I see is question marks and nothing else 
You must've landed in New York by now 
Please don't bring this love down 
 
And have you lost the same things I have lost? 
And do you know that panic I know? 
And would I see the terror in your face? 
Do you know that fever I know? 
 
I wish time was still 
We'd stay right here 
With time to kill 
In our hearts without chains 
 
And if time was still

In our hearts without chains 
 
Don't bring this love down 
Don't bring this love down 
Don't bring this love down 
Don't bring this love down 
 
I wish time was still 
We'd stay right here 
With time to kill 
In our hearts without chains

I had a heart then 
But the queen has been overthrown 
And I'm not sleeping now 
The dark is too hard to beat 
And I'm not keeping up 
The strength I need to push me 
 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
 
Noises, I play within my head 
Touch my own skin 
And hope they'll still be there 
And I think back to when 
My brother and my sister slept 
In another place 
The only time I feel safe 
 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home

There's a sound of him in the darkest words

And he won't stop here, acting with my fear 
There's a raging fire and it burns so mean 
But I'm ready now, but I'm ready now

You never let me give up 
All the nights and the fights 
And the blood and the breakups 
You always had to call off 
I am pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid 
Yet you understand 
Yeah like no one can 
Know that we don't look like much 
But no one fucks it up like us 
 
Sixteen and you never even judged me 
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me 
Sitting there in the caravan 
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor 
Yet you understand 
Yeah like no one can 
We both know what they say about us 
But they don't stand a chance because 
 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
I'm standing with an army 
I'm standing with an army 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
I'm standing with an army 
Standing with an army 
 
Dark times, you could always find the bright side 
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice 
Just to be there for me 
How you cringe when you sing out of tune 
Yet it's everything 
So don't change a thing 
We both know what they say about us 
But they don't stand a chance because 
 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you

I can't read the signs 
 
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more 
I need a love to celebrate 
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more 
So baby, take it all the way 
Stop talking in codes 
 
It's a mystery 
I know that something happened in your history 
Oh, it's too much to risk 
You give me some, but you've been holding most of it 
Back, so it's no surprise 
Everything you do, I over analyze 
Breathe, in and out 
Baby, give me something new to think about 
 
Tell me black and white 
Why I'm here tonight 
I can't read the signs 
 
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more 
I need a love to celebrate 
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more 
So baby, take it all the way 
Stop talking in codes 
 
So tell me black and white 
Why I'm here tonight 
I can't read the signs 
 
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more 
I need a love to celebrate 
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more 
So baby, take it all the way 
Stop talking in codes 
Stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more 
I need a love to celebrate 
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes 
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more 
So baby, take it all the way 
Stop talking in codes</field>

Show the bruises on your skin 
Let the fires all burn out 
I can hear the silent shout in you 
Let it go don't be so scared 
Find the love you lost again 
Let the chaos disappear 
Don't you know I'm always here for you? 
 
'Cause this is devotion, I am lost 
You're the only one I see 
Our bodies in motion, I am caught 
Floating in your gravity 
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you 
I'm the one who drives to you at night 
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper 
I think our little hearts will be alright 
'Cause this is devotion 
 
Tell me what you dream about 
I lose you in my sleep, somehow 
Let the chaos disappear 
Don't you know I'm always there for you?

Just you and me 
That true love, it was taken away from us so young 
We're summer kids 
Without a song, we're fading in to oblivion 
But we're still the one 
 
We got our guard up and we're hung up on another loss 
I need to summon all these demons keeping me on the floor 
But now we're here and I am giving everything to you 
Just say you need this, say you need me, say you want this too 
 
Say you want this too 
Say you need this too 
We're the greatest 
No one get's it like we do 
Get's it like we do 
Kills it like we do 
We're the greatest 
No one does it like we do 
 
That sadness kills 
Don't let the past dictate the way you play it now 
Don't play it down 
The time is now 
I know you're feeling what I feel, just let it show 
Don't let it go 
 
Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out 
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt 
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you 
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too 
 
Say you want this too 
Say you need this too 
We're the greatest 
No one get's it like we do 
Gets it like we do 
Kills it like we do 
We're the greatest 
No one does it like we do 
No one does it like we do 
No one does it like we do

I was just lonely 
I was just in need of a friend 
Spend your days 
Thinking if only 
Thinking if only we made sense 
For any love quit the pain you feel 
You won't let it go 
You won't let it heal 
Baby, it's clear 
You don't know me 
You don't know me 
 
And I don't have the heart that you think I do 
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose 
You know I'm not the one 
Baby, I'm not the one 
I can't show you my love that you showed to me 
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe 
You know I'm not the one 
Baby, leave love alone 
Let it heal (heal) 
Let it heal (heal) 
 
It's in your eyes 
I can see that you're broken 
I know you're lost because I am too 
It's in your voice 
I hear you choking 
When did the illusion take the truth 
I think you're in love 
With the pain you feel 
You won't let it go 
You won't let it heal 
Baby it's clear 
You don't even know me 
You don't even know me 
 
And I don't have the heart that you think I do 
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose 
You know I'm not the one 
Baby, I'm not the one 
I can't show you my love that you showed to me 
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe 
You know I'm not the one 
Baby, leave love alone 
And let it heal (heal) 
Let it heal (heal) 
 
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out 
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now 
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out 
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now 
 
And I don't have the heart that you think I do 
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose 
You know I'm not the one 
Baby, I'm not the one 
I can't show you my love that you showed to me 
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe 
You know I'm not the one

Part of you, bittersweet 
But now you tell me lies 
Up and down, cold and hot 
Swear to God, got to stop 
'Cause I can't sleep at night 
 
If you wanted love like this 
Blowing up with every kiss 
Should've known better 
'Cause you find yourself alone 
Chilling you right to the bone 
No, should've known better 
 
You and me just 
Running towards the light 
Giving up the fight 
Hoping we survive 
You and me just 
Strangers in the night 
Giving up the fight 
Waiting to ignite 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
 
Lost in you, lost in me 
Afraid of love, in too deep 
So we just run and hide 
Lightning fast, felt the crash 
Scared to lose, fear attacks 
We only know goodbye 
 
You and me just 
Running towards the light 
Giving up the fight 
Hoping we survive 
You and me just 
Strangers in the night 
Giving up the fight 
Waiting to ignite 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life 
Holding on for life

Holding on for life 
 
If you wanted love like this 
Blowing up with every kiss

You find yourself alone 
Chilling you right to the bone 
No, should've known better 
 
Hopelessly holding on 
To all those perfect nights 
Let's pretend it's not gone 
And say we'll never die

Under blossom clouds though it's late July 
You don't even try, still, you look so cool 
Like a cover boy when you light the moon 
 
Near the countryside but I just forgot 
All the things that matter I forget a lot 
I get so caught up in the city cloud 
But this place is still my first love 
 
Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way? 
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say 
Tonight, nothing will bring us down 
Tonight, we're at the lost and found 
 
Guess I need to run, take me to the bus 
But don't let me go, no, don't let me on 
Gotta hold me tight, won't put up a fight 
Of course I'll stay, I'll stay the night 
 
Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way? 
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say

Tonight, we're at the lost and found 
 
We're at the lost and found

It's a little dirty how the whole thing started 
I don't even really know what you intended 
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous 
Poured it down, so I poured it down 
Next thing that I know I'm in the hotel with you 
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you 
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos 
Poured it down, so I poured it down 
 
And now I don't understand it 
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth 
And I know I shouldn't say it 
But my heart don't understand 
 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind (but my heart don't understand) 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh 
 
I always hear, always hear them talking 
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name 
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it 
You didn't love me, no, not really 
Wait, I could have really liked you 
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you 
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good 
So I poured it down, so I poured it down 
 
And now I don't understand it 
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth 
And I know I shouldn't say it 
But my heart don't understand 
 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind 
Why I got you on my mind (but my heart don't understand) 
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody) 
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody 
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody) 
Why I got you on my mind 
 
You got yourself in a dangerous zone 
'Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone 
 
And I still don't understand it 
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth 
And my heart don't understand it, understand it, understand it 
 
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody) 
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody) 
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody) 
Why I got you on my mind (but my heart don't understand)

We're always chasing that paradise 
Paradise, paradise, paradise 
 
There's a place we try to reach 
Impossible as it would seem 
I heard you crying out in your sleep 
I see that look you save for me 
I pull you back upon your feet 
I know you always need something more, more

We made sense of it 
I know I struck you so reckless, honey 
We gave into it 
Paradise, I know we're headed for a moment, baby 
We made sense of it 
Paradise, I know I struck you so reckless, honey 
We gave in

You've been running from the dark 
You can't look me in the eyes 
Being called into the heat 
Even if it's burning me 
I just need to dance without you 
 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
You're not in love 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
 
Through the streets and all the places I've been 
I can see we never had harmony 
I won't go even though I'm alone and I know I want out 
I go up without you bringing me down 
Such a rush 
So now I'm staying to dance on my own 
On my own 
Oh, and all I know is 
 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
You're not in love 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
You're not in love 
 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
And I'm dancing on my own because 
We can't move together 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
And I'm dancing on my own because 
We can't move together 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
And I'm dancing on my own because 
We can't move together 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
Now I'm giving you up tonight 
And I'm dancing on my own because 
We can't move to 
 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
And all I know is 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy 
We don't even kiss 
It never works 
We can't move to this 
We can't even talk, boy

I think I know what you're trying to say 
Honey, it's fair play 
Why try to win when I know I've lost? 
We don't have to spell it 
I think I know what you're trying to say 
Just 'cause I think this could break me 
It doesn't mean that it will at all 
 
Love to the lovers 
Hate to the haters 
Love to you, babe 
Do what you have to 
 
What a shame 
What a loss 
The winner takes 
She takes it all 
What a shame 
What a loss 
But I can see why 
'Cause she's beautiful 
What a defeat 
To say the least 
But thank God 
The love is free 
And maybe it's good for you 
It's good for me 
 
Let's call it a day, babe 
I think I know what you're trying to say 
And honey you're so right 
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn 
Let's call it a maybe 
But we both know you're already gone 
And just because it feels like I'm breaking 
It doesn't mean I will fall apart 
 
Love to the lovers 
Hate to the haters 
Love to you, babe 
Do what you have to 
 
What a shame 
What a loss 
The winner takes 
She takes it all 
What a shame 
What a loss

Feeling this way for you 
There's something in the way you move 
Something in the way you move 
With you I'm never healing 
It's heartache through and through 
There's something in the way you move 
I don't know what it is you do 
Not one bone in your body good enough for me 
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve 
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end 
But tonight I'm here, yours again 
 
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all 
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall 
Heart is sinking like a cannonball 
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for? 
 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move 
Oh 
Something in the way you move 
Something in the way you do it 
Something in the way you move 
Oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
 
There's an evil night air 
The stars don't shine tonight (night) 
There's something in the way you do 
There's something in the way you 
Push me closer, further 
Break me just enough 
Your lies always seem so true 
There's nothing left for me to lose 
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways 
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days 
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end 
And tonight the rain pours again 
 
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all 
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall 
Heart is sinking like a cannonball 
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for? 
 
Something in the way you move

This love is like fire and ice 
This love is like rain and blue skies 
This love is like sun on the rise 
This love got me rolling the dice 
Don't let me lose 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
 
Beautiful mind 
Your heart got a story with mine 
Your heart got me hurting at times 
Your heart gave me new kind of highs 
Your heart got me feeling so fine 
So what to do 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
 
It took us a while 
With every breath a new day 
With love on the line 
We've had our share of mistakes 
But all your flaws and scars are mine 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
I'm in 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do 
I'm still falling for you 
 
Still falling for you 
 
Falling, crashing 
Falling, crashing 
 
Oh! 
Still falling 
 
Oh! 
Falling, crashing 
Falling, crashing

Still falling for you 
 
Brighter than gold 
This love shining brighter than gold 
This love is like letters in bold 
This love is like out of control 
This love's never growing old 
You make it new 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
 
It took us a while 
'Cause we were young and unsure 
With love on the line 
What if we both would need more 
But all your flaws and scars are mine 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
Still falling for you 
 
And just like that 
All I breathe 
All I feel 
You are all for me 
I'm in

All I breathe 
All I feel

I'm still falling for you 
 
I'm still falling for you 
 
I'm still falling for you

And you didn't think that I would hear it 
People hear you talking like that,

So I'm ready to attack, gonna lead the pack 
Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out 
That's right, put your pom-poms downs,

No principals,no student-teachers 
Both of us want to be the winner, but there can only be one 
So I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all 
Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you 
That's right I'm the last one standing, 
another one bites the dust

First of all, let me say 
I must apologize for acting stank 
And treating you this way 
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold? 
If I could escape and recreate 
A place thats my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl (forever) 
Perfectly together 
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape) 
If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
(I'll try to change) 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(whatsoever) 
We can make it better 
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape) 
Akon: 
I want to get away to our sweet escape 
I want to get away, yeah 
You held me down, 
I'm at my lowest boiling point 
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint 
Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around 
Instead of clowning around, 
Lets look for some common ground 
So baby, times get a little crazy, 
I've been gettin' a little lazy 
Waitin' on you to come save me 
I can see that your angry 
By the way that you treat me 
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanted you with me 
If I could escape and recreate 
A place that's my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl (forever) 
Perfectly together 
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

Come together all over the world 
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku girls 
What, it's all love 
What, give it up

If I was a rich girl (na, na...) 
See, I'd have all the money in the world 
If I was a wealthy girl 
No man could test me, impress me 
My cash flow would never ever end 
Cause I'd have all the money in the world 
If I was a wealthy girl 
Think what that money could bring 
I'd buy everything 
Clean out Vivienne Westwood 
In my Galliano gown 
No, wouldn't just have one hood 
A Hollywood mansion if I could 
Please book me first-class 
To my fancy house in London town 
All the riches baby, won't mean anything 
All the riches baby, won't bring what your love can bring 
All the riches baby, won't mean anything 
Don't need no other baby 
Your lovin' is better than gold, and I know

See, I'd have all the money in the world 
If I was a wealthy girl 
No man could test me, impress me 
My cash flow would never ever end 
Cause I'd have all the money in the world 
If I was a wealthy girl 
I'd get me four Harajuku girls to (uh huh) 
Inspire me and they'd come to my rescue 
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names (yeah) 
Love, Angel, Music, Baby 
Hurry up and come and save me 
All the riches baby, won't mean anything 
All the riches baby, won't bring 
What your love can bring 
All the riches baby, won't mean anything 
Don't need no other baby

Passes things get more comfortable 
Everything is going right 
And after all the obstacles 
It's good to see you now with someone else 
And it's such a miracle that 
You and me are still good friends 
After all that we've been through 
I know we're cool 
We used to think it was impossible 
Now you call me by my new last name 
Memories seem like so long ago 
Time always kills the pain 
Remember Harbor Boulevard 
The dreaming days, where the mess was made 
Look how all the kids have grown 
We have changed but we're still the same 
After all that we've been through 
I know we're cool 
And I'll be happy for you 
If you can be happy for me 
Circles and triangles 
And now we're hanging out 
With your new girlfriend 
So far from where we've been 
I know we're cool</field>

You go, I'll stay 
You can keep all the memories

I thought you loved me the most

Now the ground is white 
Go it while you're young 
Take the girls tonight 
And sing this sleighing song 
Just get a bobtailed bay 
Two forty as his speed 
Hitch him to an open sleigh 
And crack! You'll take the lead

The moon got lost again last night 
But now the sun has finally had its say 
I guess I feel alright 
But it hurts when I think 
When I let it sink in 
It’s all over me 
I’m lying here in the dark 
Watching you sleep, it hurts a lot 
And all I know is 
You’ve got to give me everything 
Nothing less cause 
You know I give you all of me 
I give you everything that I am 
I’m handin’ over everything that I’ve got 
Cause I wanna have a really true love 
Don’t ever wanna have to go and give you up 
Stay up till four in the morning 
And the tears are pouring 
And I want to make it worth the fight 
What have we been doing for all this time? 
Baby if we’re gonna do it, come on do it right 
All I wanted was to know I’m safe 
Don’t want to lose the love I’ve found 
Remember when you said that you would change 
Don’t let me down 
It’s not fair how you are 
I can’t be complete 
Can you give me more? 
And all I know is 
You’ve got to give me everything 
Nothing less cause 
You know I give you all of me 
I give you everything that I am

Don’t ever wanna have to go and give you up 
Stay up till four in the morning 
And the tears are pouring 
And I want to make it worth the fight 
What have we been doing for all this time? 
Baby if we’re gonna do it, come on do it right 
Give you everything 
Give you all of me</field>

My heart had a crash when we spoke 
I can’t fix what you broke 
And you, you always have a reason 
Again and again this feelin 
Why do I give in 
And I always was, always was one for cryin 
I always was one for tears 
[Chorus] 
The sun’s getting cold, it’s snowin 
Looks like an early winter for us 
Looks like an early winter for us 
An early winter, oh I need you to turn me over. 
Its sad the map of the world is on you 
The moon gravitates around you 
The seasons escape you 
And I always was, always was one for cryin 
I always was one for tears 
No I never was, I never was one for lyin 
You lied to me all these years 
[Chorus] 
Why, why do you act so stupid 
Why, you know I’m always right 
Looks like an early winter for us 
It hurts and I can’t remember sunlight 
An early winter for us 
The leaves are changing colors 
Starting over and over and over again 
Starting over and over and over again 
Well it looks like an early winter for us 
It looks like an early winter for us</field>

And now we get the pay back, trying so hard 
Saving up the paper 
Now we get to lay back 
Working so hard every night and day 
And now we get the pay back, the pay back, the pay back 
Champagne kisses 
Hold me in your lap of luxury 
I only want to fly first class desires 
You're my limousine 
So elegant the way we ride 
Our passion, it just multiplies 
There's platinum lightning in the sky 
Look I'm livin' like a queen 
This kind of love is getting expensive 
We know how to live, baby 
We're luxurious like Egyptian cotton 
We're so rich in love we're rollin' in cashmere 
Got it in fifth gear, baby 
Diamond in the rough is lookin's so sparkly 
Working so hard every night and day 
And now we get the pay back 
Trying so hard, saving up the paper 
Now we get to lay back 
Working so hard every night and day 
And now we get the pay back, the pay back 
Sugar, honey, sexy baby 
When we touch it turns to gold 
Sensitive and delicate 
Kinda like a tuberose 
You know you are my treasure chest 
It's pure perfection when we kiss and 
You're my Mr., I'm your Miss 
Gonna be until we're old 
This kind of love is getting expensive 
We know how to live baby 
We're luxurious like Egyptian cotton 
Working so hard every night and day 
And now we get the pay back 
Trying so hard, saving up the paper

Cha-ching, cha-ching 
We're loaded and we're not gonna blow it 
Cha-ching, cha-ching 
We're hooked up with the love cause we grow it 
Cha-ching, cha-ching 
We got hydroponic love and we're smokin' 
Cha-ching, cha-ching 
We burn it you and I 
We are so lit 
We're so rich in love were rollin' in cashmere 
Got it in fifth gear baby 
Diamond in the rough is lookin' so sparkly 
Working so hard every night and day

Take two of these and call me in the mornin 
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and 
Fly I'm "Like a Bird" like Nelly Furtado 
S***, pop your bottles, toast and scream cheers 
Get your two step cause this the record of the year 
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, to for a pair 
Officially announcing this is Warfare cuz 
Back in the day, my clouds was Grey 
And it seem liked my angels couldn't blow them away 
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX 
But I was still ridin in them dead ass jets but now 
Man my vision so clear out the window of the Leer and I'm 
Talkin on my celly all the s*** that you should hear 
Listen clearly now... 
Hello? Can you hear me now?

And never get addicted unless that heady-wop is serious 
(Yes'ir)From Louisville to Jimmy Choos he's real 
She know the time, she see the Richard Meale 
Flat double skeletal, Turbion 
It just like her body move, it turns her on 
She like the my hands use her body for hand warmers 
And all the car doors go up like +Transformers+ 
She I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way 
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway 
So (WOO!) cool it like New Edition unless you hot in December 
I get it ok, let it ball away 
But PLEASE run along, because LADIES is feelin' grown 
And I got something right for them right after this song 
My name is Skate...Board...P

On and on and, the temperature is warm and 
I spit hear flashes, niggaz get nauseous 
Right as a bitch, so analyze precaution

And should I mention the fact my Transition is attract 
New accession to the vision just to get me where I'm at? 
Huh

Ridin' up and down Collins in that that new Two Tone

Just stand back and look at the grill of it(Uh)

Totally intensifies the vivid ass appeal of it 
You can be jealous, and grit you teeth (Uh huh) 
But all these little niggaz got somethin in reach 
So...You want heat? These niggaz front heat 
While I'm on my boat party, tryin' to Sunseat

When it's cold outside put your arms around me 
And we'll count down to december 25 
I thank god I got you 
'cause you're all that I need 
Under the christmas lights 
Baby you and I 
Under the christmas lights 
Don't need mistletoe for kissing 
Get over here and play 
Let's start making some traditions 
And be my holiday 
When it's cold outside put your arms around me 
And we'll count down to december 25

Take me out of my body, something spiritual

What a family 
How did the years go by 
Now it's only me 
Tick-tack, tick-tack 
Tick-tack, tick-tack 
Tick-tack, tick-tack 
Tick-tack, tick-tack 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la 
Like a cat in heat, stuck in a moving car 
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake 
What if they say that you're a clonner 
Naturally, I'm worried if I do it alone 
Who really cares, cause it's your life 
You never know, it could be great 
Take a chance cause you might grow 
Oh, ah, oh 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting for 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting for 
Tick-tack, tick-tack 
Tick-tack, tick-tack 
Take a chance you stupid ho 
Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself 
You know it all by heart 
Why are you standing in one place 
Born to blossom, bloom to perish 
You know you're (wigging out) cause of your sex chromosome 
I know it's so messed up our society all thinks (for sure) 
Life is short, you're capable (uh-huh) 
Oh, ah, oh 
Look at your watch now 
You're still a super hot female 
You got your million-dollar contract 
And they're all waiting for your hot track 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting for 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting for 
I can't wait to go back into Japan 
Gimme lots of brand new fans 
Osaka, Tokyo 
You Harajuku girls 
Damn, you've got some wicked style 
Go 
Look at your watch now 
You're still a super hot female 
You got your million dollar contract 
And they're all waiting for your hot track 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting 
What you waiting for

Been an awful good girl 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 
Santa baby, a 54 convertible too, light blue 
I'll wait up for you, dear 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 
Think of all the fun I've missed 
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed 
Next year I could be as good 
If you'll check off my christmas list 
Santa baby, I want a yacht 
And really that's not a lot 
Been an angel all year 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 
Santa honey 
One little thing I really need, the deed 
To a platinum mine 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 
Come and trim my christmas tree 
With some decorations bought at tiffany 
I really do believe in you 
Let's see if you believe in me 
Santa baby 
Forgot to mention one little thing, a ring 
I don't mean on the phone 
Santa cutie, hurry down the chimney tonight

Was always meant to be 
Sent down by the angels 
Heartbreak can't fade 
All the plans that were made 
By a baby in a manger 
Bright light so bright 
It was shining like a north star 
Answer to a prayer 
How could I have known 
That you would come along 
When I was a little girl 
I wondered who I'd give all my love to 
I asked santa who he'd recommend 
It's hard to believe I was so innocent 
As a little girl looking at the world 
Didn't know that love could break me 
I was lying in my tears on the ground 
Couldn't see where god would take me 
Here I am now looking at you 
Got me thinking that love could save me 
How could I have known 
That you would come along 
When I was a little girl 
I wondered who I'd give all my love to 
I asked santa who he'd recommend 
It's hard to believe I was so innocent 
When I was a little girl 
I had love at the top of my wish list 
All my dreams were so unlimited 
It's hard to believe I was so innocent 
Why do you feel so much like home to me 
(home to me) 
Why do you feel so much like home to me 
When I was a little girl 
I wondered who I'd give all my love to 
I asked santa who he'd recommend 
It's hard to believe I was so innocent

The moon got lost again last night 
But now the sun has finally had its say 
I guess I feel alright 
But it hurts when I think 
When I let it sink in 
It’s all over me 
I’m lying here in the dark 
Watching you sleep, it hurts a lot 
And all I know is 
You’ve got to give me everything 
Nothing less cause 
You know I give you all of me 
I give you everything that I am 
I’m handin’ over everything that I’ve got 
Cause I wanna have a really true love 
Don’t ever wanna have to go and give you up 
Stay up till four in the morning 
And the tears are pouring 
And I want to make it worth the fight 
What have we been doing for all this time? 
Baby if we’re gonna do it, come on do it right 
All I wanted was to know I’m safe 
Don’t want to lose the love I’ve found 
Remember when you said that you would change 
Don’t let me down 
It’s not fair how you are 
I can’t be complete 
Can you give me more? 
And all I know is 
You’ve got to give me everything 
Nothing less cause 
You know I give you all of me 
I give you everything that I am 
I’m handing over everything that I’ve got

And I want to make it worth the fight 
What have we been doing for all this time? 
Baby if we’re gonna do it, come on do it right 
Oh please, you know what I need 
Save all your love up for me 
We can’t escape the love 
Give me everything that you have 
And all I know is 
You’ve got to give me everything 
Nothing less cause 
You know I give you all of me

Alright, hold your pretty horses 
I'll be there in a minute 
You just get yourself dolled up alright toots 
And you pick a place, you just pick a place 
Umm, Johnny? 
Yeah, Gwenie, Gwen, Gwen? 
You might want to hurrry 
Because tonight is the night 
I'm empty, I need fulfilling, yes I do love 
To the ceiling, when I do love 
I get this feeling when I'm in love 
I'm restless, can't you see I try my bestest 
To be good girl, because it's just us 
So take me now and do me justice 
I'm waiting patiently 
Anticipating your arrival 
And I'm hating 
It takes so long to get to my house 
To take me out 
Tonight 
I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric 
Gonna speed it down 
And slow it up in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric 
Uh-oh, in the back seat 
Ok now, I understand he's on his way now 
But jeez Louise, I mean today now 
I can't wait, I want to play now 
I'm antsy 
Bubble pop electric pansies 
My sweet tooth, I want your candy 
The Queen of Eng would say it randy 
I'm itchy 
I wish you would come and scratch me 
Tonight I'm falling, won't you catch me 
Swoop on by, so you can snatch me 
And take me out 
Tonight 
I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric 
Gonna speed it down 
And slow it up in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric 
Uh-oh, in the back seat 
The need to be satisfied 
Come pick me up, I want a ride 
Hurry, hurry, come to me 
Drive in movie 
Drive in, move me 
Drive into me 
Bubble pop electric 
You've gotta get it 
(Straight to me, drive in movie) 
Take it to the back seat 
Run it like a track meet 
(Come to me, drive in movie) 
Tonight 
I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric 
Gonna speed it down 
And slow it up in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric 
Uh-oh, in the back seat 
Yeah, tell your father I said hello 
Johnny, get out of here</field>

Hot...Yo 
[Verse 1] 
On and on and my nuts I'm palmin' 
Take two of these and call me in the mornin 
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and 
Fly I'm "Like a Bird" like Nelly Furtado 
S***, pop your bottles, toast and scream cheers 
Get your two step cause this the record of the year 
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, to for a pair 
Officially announcing this is Warfare cuz 
Back in the day, my clouds was Grey 
And it seem liked my angels couldn't blow them away 
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX 
But I was still ridin in them dead ass jets but now 
Man my vision so clear out the window of the Leer and I'm 
Talkin on my celly all the s*** that you should hear 
Listen clearly now... 
Hello? Can you hear me now? 
[Chorus] 
Can I have it like that? 
(You got it like that) 
Can I have it like that?

Can I have it like that? 
(You got it like that) 
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh) 
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick 
So Can I have it like that? 
(You got it like that) 
Can I have it like that? 
(You got it like that) 
[Verse 2] 
On and on and this be zone and 
I control their mind from straight over the phone 
Let 'em explore the words, something like a tourist 
And never get addicted unless that heady-wop is serious 
(Yes'ir)From Louisville to Jimmy Choos he's real 
She know the time, she see the Richard Meale 
Flat double skeletal, Turbion 
It just like her body move, it turns her on 
She like the my hands use her body for hand warmers 
And all the car doors go up like +Transformers+ 
She I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way 
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway 
So (WOO!) cool it like New Edition unless you hot in December 
I get it ok, let it ball away 
But PLEASE run along, because LADIES is feelin' grown 
And I got something right for them right after this song 
My name is Skate...Board...P 
Ladies and Gentlemen.. 
[Chorus] 
Can I have it like that? 
(You got it like that) 
Can I have it like that?

Can I have it like that? 
(You got it like that) 
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh) 
And act like you tryin to get this money right quick 
So Can I have it like that? 
(You got it like that)

[Verse 3] 
On and on and, the temperature is warm and 
I spit hear flashes, niggaz get nauseous 
Right as a bitch, so analyze precaution 
When the light hit the ice, bet 100 that you vomit 
And should I mention the fact my Transition is attract 
New accession to the vision just to get me where I'm at? 
Huh 
Little Skateboard, (Come on)he too grown 
Ridin' up and down Collins in that that new Two Tone 
It's so cold, you don't wanna feel the chill of it(Uh) 
Just stand back and look at the grill of it(Uh) 
I don't smoke but I bet the sinsemilla of it 
Totally intensifies the vivid ass appeal of it 
You can be jealous, and grit you teeth (Uh huh) 
But all these little niggaz got somethin in reach 
So...You want heat? These niggaz front heat 
While I'm on my boat party, tryin' to Sunseat 
My name is Skate...Board...P

With a burning desire 
To work hard 
They don't even get tired 
Never try to get a taste of the spotlight 
No, they only wanna make Santa shine bright 
In the workshop 
Making cookies and candy 
With Mrs Claus 
While Santas sippin brandy 
And they dont even mind that it's so cold 
Cos they love living life in the North Pole 
Let's give a cheer for the elves 
They do like nobody else 
Working all day and all night 
To make your wish come alive 
Making dolls, making trains 
making model airplanes 
Helping Santa with a smile on their face 
Let's give a cheer for the elves 
A cheer for the elves 
In the mailroom 
They read every letter 
That was sent through 
And no matter the weather 
They always make sure Santa gets out 
And he gets every single last gift out 
Let's give a cheer for the elves 
They do like nobody else 
Working all day and all night

And it's such a miracle that 
You and me are still good friends 
After all that we've been through 
I know we're cool 
We used to think it was impossible 
Now you call me by my new last name 
Memories seem like so long ago 
Time always kills the pain 
Remember Harbor Boulevard 
The dreaming days, where the mess was made 
Look how all the kids have grown 
We have changed but we're still the same 
After all that we've been through 
I know we're cool 
And I'll be happy for you 
If you can be happy for me 
Circles and triangles 
And now we're hanging out 
With your new girlfriend 
So far from where we've been 
I know we're cool</field>

I got the cush, Kettle One, waiting for your engine 
Your Grand Prix attention

Pride and dignity 
Have got you in September 
By the time we make it 
Denny's (?) will remember 
Well, air conditioned rooms 
Will make this feeling better 
What's between my legs 
I know is even wetter 
Yeah 
Cuz dafodils and roses 
Are all very nice 
But they won't tell you 
Where I am 
They won't get 
In between my 
Red fire 
And a magnetic force 
I need to be 
I need to be 
Uncontrollably torn 
Uncontrollably torn 
Uncontrollably 
We'll settle in your couch 
You know I got some questions 
About some dreams you had 
I think you forgot to mention 
A lemonade you hold (?) 
And now 
There's no one listening 
Well, just a vacant space 
With wall 
And paint that's chipping 
The clock's a-striking three 
And there's no way I'm proving 
That doesn't falls on you 
And all that you have moving (?) 
Little me with all 
Of all your expectations 
Well, just remember now 
I got your emancipation 
Yeah 
Cuz dafodils and roses 
Are all very nice 
But they won't tell you 
Where I am 
They won't get 
In between my red fire 
And a magnetic force 
I need to be 
I need to be 
Uncontrollably 
Cuz dafodils and roses 
Are all very nice 
But bring them 
In to your insides 
And they'll show you some 
Better eat (?) 
Teliable source 
Let's you know 
That you're 
Uncontrollably torn 
Uncontrollably torn 
Uncontrollably torn 
Uncontrollably torn 
Cuz dafodils and roses 
Are all very nice 
But what's inside me 
You want 
Be able to pay my price 
See me erupt in fire 
The earth 
That's my source 
Is what I need 
To make me 
Uncontrollably torn 
Sarah (?) 
Did the fairies tell you 
How to please your prince? 
Just a dash of pixie dust 
You've been fucking him 
Ever since 
Well, you know 
You've been domesticated 
Yeah, I wanna do this 
The keys in the house 
The picket fence of bliss 
You know 
Everybody loves you 
When you're beautiful 
Hard to open up (?) 
Even when you know 
She'll give all (?) 
Well, if it's so dramatic 
Why do I feel reborn? 
Why do I feel like I'm 
Uncontrollably torn? 
So uncontrollably torn

            <field name="lyrics">You, you know how to get me solo 
My heart had a crash when we spoke 
I can’t fix what you broke 
And you, you always have a reason 
Again and again this feelin 
Why do I give in 
And I always was, always was one for cryin 
I always was one for tears 
[Chorus] 
The sun’s getting cold, it’s snowin 
Looks like an early winter for us 
Looks like an early winter for us 
An early winter, oh I need you to turn me over. 
Its sad the map of the world is on you 
The moon gravitates around you 
The seasons escape you 
And I always was, always was one for cryin 
I always was one for tears 
No I never was, I never was one for lyin 
You lied to me all these years 
[Chorus] 
Why, why do you act so stupid 
Why, you know I’m always right 
Looks like an early winter for us 
It hurts and I can’t remember sunlight 
An early winter for us 
The leaves are changing colors 
Starting over and over and over again 
Starting over and over and over again 
Well it looks like an early winter for us 
It looks like an early winter for us</field>

You know you're too delicious 
More than I can ever know 
Lyin around late at night 
So luscious that I ache 
Baby why'd you fall asleep 
I'm still awake 
I'm in love (uh, uh) 
In love with a dream 
My valentines gone and broke my wings 
I see in time, I seem to be weak 
You better be right, cause you promised me 
I must have lost my mind 
I can't believe you're still inside my bed 
I nearly walked away 
I didn't think we'd still be rollin 
Dressin up in your love is a dangerous thing 
My sexy, super lover has a real bad sting 
Baby I don't want no trouble 
This is more than I can afford 
I can't help myself keep coming back for more 
For more, 
can't help coming back for more 
I'm in love (uh, uh) 
In love with a dream 
My valentines gone and broke my wings 
I see in time, I seem to be weak 
You better be right, cause you promised me 
I must have lost my mind 
I can't believe you're still inside my bed 
I nearly walked away 
I didn't think we'd still be rollin 
And as I watch you sleep in the dim light 
I close my eyes and pray 
Another flourescent night 
Yeah, you and I 
Late night lovers 
Kickin in the covers 
Don't need no one but you and I 
Cause every day's a weekend 
Forget what we were thinking 
Another sweet flourescent night 
I must have lost my mind 
I can't believe you're still inside my bed 
I nearly walked away 
I didn't think we'd still be rollin 
And as I watch you sleep in the dim light 
I close my eyes and pray 
Another flourescent night 
Yeah, you and I</field>

Love, Angel, Music, Baby, 2004 
Producer: Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis 
 
Wa-mono 
There's me, there's you (hoko-ten) 
In a pedestrian paradise 
Where the catwalk got its claws (meow) 
A subculture, in a kaleidoscope of fashion 
Prowl the streets of Harajuku (irasshaimase) 
Super lovers 
Tell me where you got yours 
(At the super lovers store) 
Yoji Yamamoto 
I'm hanging with the locals 
Where the catwalk got its claws 
All you fashion know-it-alls 
With your underground malls 
In the world of Harajuku 
Putting on a show 
When you dress up in your clothes 
Wild hair color and cell phones 
Your accessories are dead on 
Harajuku Girls 
You got the wicked style 
I like the way that you are 
I am your biggest fan 
Harajuku Girls 
You got the wicked style 
I like the way that you are 
I am your biggest fan 
Harajuku girls 
I'm looking at you girls 
You're so original girls 
You got the look that makes you stand out 
Harajuku Girls 
I'm looking at you girls 
You mix and match it girls 
You dress so fly and just parade around (arigato) 
I'm fascinated by the Japanese fashion scene 
Just an American girl 
In the Tokyo streets 
My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt 
They're hard to find in the states 
Got me feeling couture 
What's that you got on? Is it Comme des Garcons? 
Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong 
Mixed up with second hand clothes 
(Let's not forget about John Galliano) (no) 
Flipped the landscape 
When Nigo made A Bathing Ape 
I got expensive taste (oh, well) 
Guess I better save up (cho takai) 
Harajuku Girls 
You got the wicked style 
I like the way that you are 
I am your biggest fan 
Harajuku Girls 
You got the wicked style 
I like the way that you are 
I am your biggest fan 
Work it, express it, live it 
Command your style 
Create it, design it 
Now let me see you work it 
Create it, design it 
Now let me see you work it 
You bring style and color all around the world 
(You Harajuku Girls) 
You bring style and color all around the world 
(You Harajuku Girls) 
You're looking so distinctive like D.N.A. 
Like nothing I've ever seen in the U.S.A. 
Your underground culture, visual grammar 
The language of your clothing 
Is something to encounter 
A Ping-Pong match 
Between eastern and western 
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection? 
Just wait 'til you get your little hands on L.A.M.B. 
'Cause it's super kawaii 
That means (super cute in Japanese) 
The streets of Harajuku are your catwalk 
(Bishoujo, you're so vogue) 
That's what you drop 
Cho saikou 
Harajuku Girls 
And that's what you drop 
That's what you drop 
Cho saikou 
Harajuku Girls 
And that's what you drop 
That's what you drop 
(I don't think you understand I'm your biggest fan)

Got me trippin', tearin' straight through the sky 
I never really found what I was lookin' for 
Until you and I, oh 
And you are the lightnin', I am the storm 
Caught in the rain, your heart got torn 
Making an earthquake, it's hard to ignore 
Still you love me more and more 
I know that I'm hard to love 
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better 
But the ride is worth the rush 
When we're together, when we're together 
And it hurts to know I hurt you so 
Been down this road, let's turn it back around 
You say you're fine, I know you lie 
You'll make this right 
We'll turn it back around, and I'll try 
Yeah, I'll try 
Matches to the map 
I kept it burnin' 
now there's smoke in my eyes 
I never meant to hurt you 
Flip the hourglass, and try to rewind, oh, oh 
I'm a volcano, and you are the cold 
Under the ocean, blue and gold 
Givin' you roses, your blood on the thorns 
Makes you love me more and more 
I know that I'm hard to love 
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better 
But the ride is worth the rush 
When we're together, when we're together 
And it hurts to know I hurt you so 
Been down this road, let's turn it back around 
You say you're fine, I know you lie 
You'll make this right 
We'll turn it back around, and I'll try 
Yeah, I'll try 
I'll try 
Yeah, I'll try 
I'll try 
I might speak before I think 
I might jump straight through the fire 
And you might think I'm crazy 
But I'm crazy for you 
When I look in your eyes 
I know it's my fault that you don't trust me 
But you've got to trust me 
When I tell you, I'll try (try, try, try) 
I'll try (try, try, try) 
I'll try (try, try, try) 
I'll try (try, try, try, I) 
I know that I'm hard to love 
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better 
But the ride is worth the rush 
When we're together, when we're together 
And it hurts to know I hurt you so 
Been down this road, let's turn it back around 
You say you're fine, I know you lie 
You'll make this right 
We'll turn it back around, and I'll try 
Yeah, I'll try

Last christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
Once bitten and twice shy 
I keep my distance 
But you still catch my eye 
Tell me, baby 
Do you recognize me? 
Well 
It's been a year 
It doesn't surprise me 
(merry christmas) 
I wrapped it up and sent it 
With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it 
Now I know what a fool I've been 
But if you kissed me now 
I know you'd fool me again 
Last christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
Last christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
A crowded room 
Friends with tired eyes 
I'm hiding from you 
And your soul of ice 
My god I thought you were someone to rely on 
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on 
A face on a lover with a fire in her heart 
A girl under cover but you tore me apart 
Ooh-hoo 
Now I've found a real love 
You'll never fool me again 
Last christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
Last christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
A face on a lover with a fire in her heart 
(I gave you my heart) 
A girl under cover but you tore me apart 
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone 
I'll give it to someone special</field>

But the fire is so delightful 
And since we've no place to go 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
It doesn't show signs of stopping 
And I brought some corn for popping 
The lights are turned way down low 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
When we finally kiss good night 
How I'll hate going out in the storm 
But if you really hold me tight 
All the way home I'll be warm 
The fire is slowly dying 
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing 
But as long as you love me so 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow</field>

When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come 
We've got a long way to go 
It's beyond Martin Luther, upgrade computer 
Her/His skin wasn't the same color as mine 
But she/he was fine, she/he was fine 
If all men are made equal 
Then she/he was fine, she/he was fine 
Up until the time we went out on a date 
I was fine, I was fine 
Now I'm getting dirty looks, I wonder what they'd say 
If we were blind, we were blind people 
We've got a long way to go 
When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come 
We've got a long way to go 
It's beyond Martin Luther, upgrade computer 
We've got a long way to go 
When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come 
We've got a long way to go 
It's beyond Martin Luther, upgrade computer 
Beauty is beauty, whether it's black or white 
Yellow or green baby, you know what I mean 
What if Picasso only used one color 
There shouldn't be a rule, how to choose your lover 
Lovers in love is such a wonderful thing 
Maybe in time, we'll get together and sing 
I really hope so, there's nothing wrong with this picture 
We got a long way to go, we gotta get there quicker 
We've got a long way to go 
When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come 
We've got a long way to go 
It's beyond Martin Luther, upgrade computer 
We've got a long way to go 
When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come 
We've got a long way to go 
It's beyond Martin Luther, upgrade computer 
What color is love [3x] 
We've got a long way to go 
When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come 
We've got a long way to go 
It's beyond Martin Luther, upgrade computer 
We've got a long way to go

...that all men are created equal... 
...children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by...

Now I'm covered in the rubble 
of your selfish con-concrete 
All of it's been recorded forever in my mind 
In a way it's all permanent and frozen for all-time 
Don't you dare try to rush me, I'm not ready for the fade 
I'm washing in the sorrow 
yeah that's where I wanna bathe 
I'm practicing my problems, I'm worshiping the pain 
Memorizing, agonizing 
This is crazy, I knew it, knew it, knew it 
This is crazy, I knew it all along 
And no you can't undo it, do it, do it 
You're gon' miss me when I'm gone 
Watch what I'ma do 
I'ma go and prove 
With somebody new 
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable 
Watch what I'ma do 
I'ma go and prove 
With somebody new 
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable 
Can't even miss you 
cause you're not the person that I thought you were 
On the top it's at that mountain 
and I'm mining through the hurt 
You're so guilty, come on, just surrender 
talking in circles 
Did I love you? I can't remember 
This is crazy, I knew it, knew it, knew it 
This is crazy, I knew it all along 
And no you can't undo it, do it, do it 
You're gon' miss me when I'm gone 
Watch what I'ma do 
I'ma go and prove 
With somebody new 
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable 
Watch what I'ma do 
I'ma go and prove 
With somebody new 
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable 
Can you handle it? Someone else on my lips 
Can you handle it? Aye 
Can you handle it? Someone else on my lips 
Can you handle it? Aye 
Can't even miss you 
cause you're not the person that I thought you were 
Never thought you were 
Never thought you were 
Watch what I'ma do 
I'ma go and prove 
With somebody new 
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable 
Watch what I'ma do 
I'ma go and prove

Now we get to lay back 
Working so hard every night and day 
And now we get the pay back, the pay back, the pay back 
Champagne kisses 
Hold me in your lap of luxury 
I only want to fly first class desires 
You're my limousine 
So elegant the way we ride 
Our passion, it just multiplies 
There's platinum lightning in the sky 
Look I'm livin' like a queen 
This kind of love is getting expensive 
We know how to live, baby 
We're luxurious like Egyptian cotton 
We're so rich in love we're rollin' in cashmere 
Got it in fifth gear, baby 
Diamond in the rough is lookin's so sparkly 
Working so hard every night and day 
And now we get the pay back 
Trying so hard, saving up the paper 
Now we get to lay back 
Working so hard every night and day 
And now we get the pay back, the pay back 
Sugar, honey, sexy baby 
When we touch it turns to gold 
Sensitive and delicate 
Kinda like a tuberose 
You know you are my treasure chest 
It's pure perfection when we kiss and 
You're my Mr., I'm your Miss 
Gonna be until we're old

Got me so thankful 
But I really need you there 
when I get home 
(ooh-ooh-ooh) 
I can't wait to give all my loving 
To my best friend 
(ooh-ooh-ooh) 
All I want is you to take my love 
And give it back again 
Don't need no money, don't need a thing 
I don't even need a wedding ring 
All I need is love and the truth 
And I got it, my gift is you 
I don't need nothing right for me to realize 
(ooh-ahh-ooh) 
And every moment you're away 
Feels like a waste of time 
So get back to me, back to mine 
(ooh-ooh-ooh) 
I can't wait to give all my loving 
To my best friend 
(ooh-ooh-ooh) 
All I want is you to take my love 
And give it back again 
Don't need no money, don't need a thing 
I don't even need a wedding ring 
All I need is love and the truth 
And I got it, my gift is you 
(ahh-ooh) x8 
Don't need no money, don't need a thing 
I don't even need a wedding ring 
All I need is love and the truth 
And I got it, my gift is you 
(ooh) my gift is you</field>

Uh oh, I see you hide behind your glasses 
see you love the shade 
Shady so long that Mister Shady is your name 
Shipping it off, contain it, seal it, rip up the receipt 
But somehow it always finds its way right back to me 
[Pre-Chorus] 
Thinking that nobody, nobody knows 
But I got your number, I got your codes 
This ain't the first time at the rodeo, hello 
You're sliding, you slide on a slippery slope 
Karma police, I'm on patrol 
Got my gun loaded, I'm ready to go, I'm dope 
[Chorus] 
You see this finger wagging, wagging at you 
The naughty, naughty things you do 
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, hid it 
You see this finger wagging, wagging at you 
The naughty, naughty things you do 
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, admit it 
[Post-Chorus] 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh 
[Verse 2] 
I think there's something 
that you might perhaps forgot to say 
Locked in the closet but it never goes away 
No matter how hard you try 
you're never washing out the stain 
Because you're addicted, so addicted to the shame 
[Pre-Chorus] 
Thinking that nobody, nobody knows 
But I got your number, I got your codes 
This ain't the first time at the rodeo, hello 
You're sliding, you slide on a slippery slope 
Karma police, I'm on patrol 
Got my gun loaded, I'm ready to go, I'm dope

You see this finger wagging, wagging at you 
The naughty, naughty things you do 
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, hid it 
You see this finger wagging, wagging at you 
The naughty, naughty things you do 
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, admit it 
[Post-Chorus] 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh 
[Bridge] 
You try to sneak it, hide it and seek it 
Put it in the past, try to antique it 
Dirty secrets, you tried to clean it 
Put one over fast but you can't bleach it 
[Chorus] 
You see this finger wagging, wagging at you 
The naughty, naughty things you do 
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, hid it 
You see this finger wagging, wagging at you 
The naughty, naughty things you do 
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, admit it 
[Post-Chorus] 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh

(Gwen Stefani, Pharrell Williams) 
Unreleased 
Producer: Pharrell Williams 
 
Don't know what im doing back in the studio 
Getting greedy cause he said he had another sick flow 
So I had to hollaback, guess I didn't get enough 
Still be the one to land and I send my "tick-tock" 
If you give me a clap, im gonna give an encore 
Don't want it to end, I wanna skank some more 
Im tripping on the best dream that I never had 
I guess behind the orange curtain is not so bad 
From the West Side of Anaheim, a small world after all 
Hanging out at the hotel, selling makeup at the mall 
Making out to "Purple Rain", just like everybody else 
Dame un beso, now stop, im trying to save myself 
In the ordinary calling girl way 
Back in the 714 days 
Trying to figure what I wanna be 
Hanging in the garage, me and ND 
Im just an Orange County girl 
Living in an extraordinary world 
Im just an Orange County girl 
Living in an extraordinary world 
Sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
And the girls sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
And the guys sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
And the girls sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
Alot of things have changed, but im mostly the same 
These are a few of my favorite things 
Still rollin' cause the "Sound Of Music" 
Im nothing better than a great big huge hit 
You know I'd pay you just to let me run, dance, and sing 
I know im living the "E" ticket dream 
For a girl from O.C., it's almost unheard of 
So I wanna thank you all so much for the love (especially my girlfriends) 
Pharrell on repeat, make a hurricane in Miami 
Working with him, im gonna get myself another Grammy 
I got the L.A.M.B., and he's rocking the Ice Creams 
Blend it together, something fresh and kinda inbetween 
Remember music is something that I love 
And I don't really give a fuck 
The music don't come in no color 
And the time has come to hit you with the chorus 
Im just an Orange County girl 
Living in an extraordinary world 
Im just an Orange County girl 
Living in an extraordinary world 
Sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
And the girls sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
And the guys sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
And the girls sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
And the dream goes... 
On and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on 
And the dream goes... 
Im just an Orange County girl 
Living in an extraordinary world 
Im just an Orange County girl

It's you doing it, choosing it, no excuse (no excuse) 
How you doing it, ruins it, now you lose (now you lose)

A little late warning signs 
Right there, but I close my eyes 
Punish me, I let it slide 
You know how to spend it 
You know how to blow it up, blow it up, blow it up 
It's getting so expensive 
You know how to screw it up, screw it up, screw it up 
Up, up, up, up 
Screw it up, up, up, up, up 
Look at you 
I'm putting my money on you, I don't underestimate 
I'm not a rookie, I'm so used to getting played 
What do I do, I'm not a typical or classic case 
I try, I try, I try 
How I'm doing it choosing it, no excuse 
How I'm doing it, ruins it, now I lose 
This is what happens when you don't have any common sense

If I was a rich girl (na, na...)

If I was a wealthy girl 
No man could test me, impress me 
My cash flow would never ever end 
Cause I'd have all the money in the world 
If I was a wealthy girl 
Think what that money could bring 
I'd buy everything 
Clean out Vivienne Westwood 
In my Galliano gown 
No, wouldn't just have one hood 
A Hollywood mansion if I could 
Please book me first-class 
To my fancy house in London town 
All the riches baby, won't mean anything 
All the riches baby, won't bring what your love can bring 
All the riches baby, won't mean anything 
Don't need no other baby 
Your lovin' is better than gold, and I know

My cash flow would never ever end 
Cause I'd have all the money in the world 
If I was a wealthy girl 
I'd get me four Harajuku girls to (uh huh) 
Inspire me and they'd come to my rescue 
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names (yeah) 
Love, Angel, Music, Baby 
Hurry up and come and save me 
All the riches baby, won't mean anything 
All the riches baby, won't bring 
What your love can bring

, I rock the Fetish 
People, you know who I am 
Yes ma'am, we got the style that's wicked 
I hope you can all keep up 
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top 
Now we ain't gettin' nothin' but love 
If I was rich girl (na, na...) 
See, I'd have all the money in the world 
If I was a wealthy girl 
No man could test me, impress me 
My cash flow would never ever end 
Cause I'd have all the money in the world 
If I was a wealthy girl 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na</field>

You've been wrapping these chains all around me 
On a leash, thinking I'd obey 
I know exactly what you think about me 
That I wouldn't, that I couldn't escape 
Just like helium in my body 
To the top, I'mma elevate 
I know exactly what you've heard about me 
That I wouldn't, that I couldn't escape 
But 
I'm taking this rocket ship to the moon 
And then my whole crew coming with me (coming with me) 
We're getting so high up here from the fumes 
And then my whole crew coming with me (coming with me) 
Here in this rocket ship, here in my rocket ship, uh huh 
Here in my rocket ship, here in my rocket ship, uh huh 
Look at me rising, I'm not even trying 
like woah-woah-woah 
Look at me rising, I'm not even trying 
like woah-woah-woah 
Looking down to the ground from a distance 
I think I made a clean getaway 
Waving goodbye, blowing kisses 
While we sipping, while we sipping champagne 
Watch me going up, I'm out of sight 
Get out my way! 
I'm taking this rocket ship to the moon 
And then my whole crew coming with me 
(coming with me) 
We're getting so high up here from the fumes 
And then my whole crew coming with me 
(coming with me) 
Here in this rocket ship, here in my rocket ship, uh huh 
Here in my rocket ship, here in my rocket ship, uh huh 
Look at me rising, I'm not even trying 
like woah-woah-woah 
Look at me rising, I'm not even trying 
like woah-woah-woah 
I know you want some of this 
I know you want some of this right now 
I know you want some of this 
So come and get it, come and get it 
come and get it, get it 
I know you want some of this 
I know you want some of this right now 
I know you want some of this 
So come and get it, come and get it 
come and get it, get it 
I'm taking this rocket ship to the moon 
And then my whole crew coming with me

We're getting so high up here from the fumes 
And then my whole crew coming with me

Here in this rocket ship, here in my rocket ship, uh huh 
Here in my rocket ship, here in my rocket ship, whoa! 
Look at me rising, I'm not even trying

Look at me rising, I'm not even trying 
like woah-woah-woah 
Look at me rising, I'm not even trying

Been an awful good girl 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 
Santa baby, a 54 convertible too, light blue 
I'll wait up for you, dear 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 
Think of all the fun I've missed 
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed 
Next year I could be as good 
If you'll check off my christmas list 
Santa baby, I want a yacht 
And really that's not a lot 
Been an angel all year 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 
Santa honey 
One little thing I really need, the deed 
To a platinum mine 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 
Come and trim my christmas tree 
With some decorations bought at tiffany 
I really do believe in you 
Let's see if you believe in me 
Santa baby 
Forgot to mention one little thing, a ring 
I don't mean on the phone 
Santa cutie, hurry down the chimney tonight

You don't even have to Rsvp back to me 
Get over here and hold me tight 
Don't need a wish list

Just keep me up til dawn 
Wrap me in kisses

One thing about me 
I'll be there for the team 
I'll do anything to protect my people's dreams 
And if the earth just finds me wandering 'round 
You know my soul will rise up and keep on shining 
Imagine you're a bear 
You know we're inside 
You disappear into thin air 
I saw they put up the missing sign 
Reason they go through 
That only shows you how much they really care 
How I wish I was that bear 
So I could feel the same inside 
Just shine 
Shine, shine 
So we're in a strange new land 
In Paddington station 
But you end up in good hands 
In the fancy British nation 
You were the chosen 
You're not imposing 
The Browns want you there 
Don't you want to be that bear 
With the red hat he wears that makes him shine 
One thing about me 
I'll be there for the team 
I'll do anything to protect my people's dreams 
And if the earth just finds me wandering 'round 
You know my soul will rise up and keep on shining 
[Pharrell Williams] 
(Shine!) 
When you were trying to get home 
(Shine!) 
When you don't want to be alone 
(Shine!) 
Look at yourself in the mirror 
That's your way home 
(Shine! Shine! Shine! Shine! Shine!) 
(Shine!) 
When you were trying to get home 
(Shine!) 
And all your friends at home 
(Shine!) 
Look at yourself in the mirror 
That's your way home 
Now go! 
Everybody is the same inside 
But you don't wanna go home 
Just like a little bear was alone 
Hey if he feel right it ain't wrong 
You just want to shine 
You just want to shine 
You just want to shine 
You just want to shine</field>

Love, Angel, Music, Baby, 2004 
Producer: Unknown 
 
I've seen your face a thousand times 
Have all your stories memorized 
I've kissed your lips a million ways 
But I still love to have you around 
I've held you too many times to count 
I thinkI know you inside out 
And we're together most days 
But I still love to have you around 
You're the one I want, 
And it's not just phase 
You're the one I trust 
Our love is the real thing 
Don't go away 
My love (my love) 
I want you to stay 
In my life 
Don't go away 
My lover (my love) 
I'm happiest when we spend time 
You're a salty water ocean wave 
You knock me down 
You kiss my face 
I know the storms will always come 
But I still love to have you around 
Heaven knows what will come next 
So emotional 
You're so complex 
A rollercoaster built to crash 
But I still love to have you around 
You're the one I want, 
And it's not just phase 
You're the one I trust 
Our love is the real thing 
Don't go away 
My love (my love) 
I want you to stay 
In my life 
Don't go away 
My lover (my love) 
I'm happiest when we spend time It's only you and I 
It's you there when I close my eyes 
And you in the morning 
I never thought you'd still be mine 
Or I'd really need to have you around 
Don't go away 
My love (my love) 
I want you to stay 
In my life 
Don't go away 
My lover (my love) 
I need you 
You're my love supply 
Don't go away 
My love (you're my love supply) 
I want you to stay 
In my life (every day, every night) 
Don't go away 
My love (you're my love supply)

First of all, let me say 
I must apologize for acting stank

Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold? 
If I could escape and recreate 
A place thats my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl (forever) 
Perfectly together 
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape) 
If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
(I'll try to change) 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(whatsoever) 
We can make it better

I want to get away, yeah

I'm at my lowest boiling point 
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint 
Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around 
Instead of clowning around, 
Lets look for some common ground 
So baby, times get a little crazy, 
I've been gettin' a little lazy 
Waitin' on you to come save me 
I can see that your angry 
By the way that you treat me 
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanted you with me 
If I could escape and recreate 
A place that's my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl (forever) 
Perfectly together 
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape) 
If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
(I'll try to change) 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(whatsoever) 
We can make it better 
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape) 
If I could escape 
If I could escape 
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold 
If I could escape and recreate 
A place that's my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl (forever) 
Perfectly together 
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? 
(the sweet escape) 
If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
(I'll try to change) 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(whatsoever) 
We can make it better 
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?

When it's cold outside put your arms around me 
And we'll count down to december 25 
I thank god I got you 
'cause you're all that I need 
Under the christmas lights 
Baby you and I 
Under the christmas lights 
Don't need mistletoe for kissing 
Get over here and play 
Let's start making some traditions 
And be my holiday 
When it's cold outside put your arms around me 
And we'll count down to december 25

Seeing things I never saw before 
Reformation to get clear, 'bout to take on that new frontier 
Leave it here, don't need no souvenir 
Decorate my skin 
Some scars you just can't cover up 
Here I am again 
This time I just have had enough 
I'm runnin' late, put on my war paint 
Cause I'm getting ready for the combat 
Get out my way, got on my war paint 
Cause I'm getting ready for the combat 
With each stroke I take, I put on my face 
I make a mistake then I Q-tip, erase 
It's not that I'm fake, it's just my war paint, yeah 
I'm getting ready for the combat 
I'm goin' tribal 
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya 
I'm goin' tribal 
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya 
I've had my share of tragedies 
Watching my mascara bleed 
But I got some tricks way up my sleeve 
Tip-toeing through the minefields 
I'm so scared of how this feels 
I'm so scared of how I feel 
Decorate my skin 
I decorate my face

A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake 
What if they say that you're a clonner 
Naturally, I'm worried if I do it alone 
Who really cares, cause it's your life 
You never know, it could be great 
Take a chance cause you might grow

You know it all by heart 
Why are you standing in one place 
Born to blossom, bloom to perish 
You know you're (wigging out) cause of your sex chromosome 
I know it's so messed up our society all thinks (for sure) 
Life is short, you're capable (uh-huh) 
Oh, ah, oh

Was always meant to be 
Sent down by the angels 
Heartbreak can't fade 
All the plans that were made 
By a baby in a manger 
Bright light so bright 
It was shining like a north star 
Answer to a prayer 
How could I have known 
That you would come along 
When I was a little girl 
I wondered who I'd give all my love to 
I asked santa who he'd recommend 
It's hard to believe I was so innocent 
As a little girl looking at the world 
Didn't know that love could break me 
I was lying in my tears on the ground 
Couldn't see where god would take me 
Here I am now looking at you 
Got me thinking that love could save me 
How could I have known 
That you would come along 
When I was a little girl 
I wondered who I'd give all my love to 
I asked santa who he'd recommend 
It's hard to believe I was so innocent 
When I was a little girl 
I had love at the top of my wish list 
All my dreams were so unlimited 
It's hard to believe I was so innocent 
Why do you feel so much like home to me 
(home to me) 
Why do you feel so much like home to me 
When I was a little girl 
I wondered who I'd give all my love to 
I asked santa who he'd recommend 
It's hard to believe I was so innocent

Lightning on my skin, oh 
Turn me on just like a switch, now you got me lit 
Oh no you didn't 
Just so you know though 
I want a shot of your vitamin 
Fill up my solo 
Cup when I'm feeling so lonely 
I'm losing my control 
I need some water so water me 
I need some water so water me

There's nothing I can do 
I just can't resist 
You've got the perfect kiss, whoa

Lay-od-lay-od-lay-he-hoo 
Yodell back with the girl and goatherd 
Lay-od-lay-od-low 
Wind it up 
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Yodellay, yodallay, yodal-low 
(Yeah) 
This is the key that makes us wind up 
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up 
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch 
But the girls want to know 
Why the boys like us so much 
They like way we dance 
They like the way we work 
They like the way the L.A.M.B. 
Is going 'cross my shirt 
They like the way my pants 
It compliments my shape (She's crazy, right?) 
They like the way we react 
Everytime we dance 
Everytime the bass bangs 
Realize it calls your name 
Let the beat wind you up 
And don't stop till your time is up 
Get in line now 
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Yodellay, yodallay, yodal-low 
You've got to let the beat get under your skin 
You've got to open up, and let it all in 
But see, once it gets in, the poppin' begins 
And then you find out, why all the boys stare 
They're trying to bite our style 
Trying to study our approach 
They like the way we do it, so original 
I guess that they are slow 
So they should leave the room 
This beat is for the clubs, and cars that go 
Everytime the bass bangs 
Realize it calls your name 
Let the beat wind you up 
And don't stop till your time is up 
Get in line now 
Uh, uh, uh, wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh 
(Ya'll ready) 
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Yodellay, yodallay, yodal-low 
Uh huh, it's your moment 
Uh huh, come on girl, you know you own it 
Uh huh, you know your key is still tick-tockin' 
Hell yeah, and you know they're watchin' 
Get it girl, get it, get it girl 
Get it girl, get it, get it girl 
To the front, to the side, 
To the back, but don't let him ride 
Keep goin' girl, it's your night 
Don't let him steal your light 
I know he thinks you're fine and stuff 
But does he know how to wind you up? 
(Come on) 
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Yodellay, yodallay, yodal-low, hey!</field>

In the lane, snow is glistening 
A beautiful sight 
We're happy tonight 
Walking in a winter wonderland 
Gone away is the bluebird 
Here to stay is a new bird 
He sings a love song 
As we go along 
Walking in a winter wonderland 
In the meadow we can build a snowman 
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 
He'll say, Are you married? 
We'll say, No man 
But you can do the job 
When you're in town 
Later on, we'll conspire 
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid 
The plans that we've made 
Walking in a winter wonderland 
In the meadow we can build a snowman 
And pretend that he's a circus clown 
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman 
Until the other kids knock him down 
When it snows, ain't it thrilling 
Though your nose gets a chilling 
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way 
Walking in a winter wonderland 
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way 
Walking in a winter wonderland 
We'll be walking 
We'll be talking 
In a winter wonderland</field>

Your memory seems to come and go 
Our time meant so much to me 
Now you can’t be found 
You were the first to want me 
The first to love me 
The first to need me 
Who was the last to know you? 
The last to love you? 
The last to hold you? 
It’s a wonderful wonderful life 
It’s a wonderful wonderful life 
It’s a wonderful wonderful life 
Such a wonderful wonderful life 
I thought of you again today 
Reminded me how with time I’ve changed 
If you only knew what you gave to me 
Now you can’t be found 
You were the first I trusted 
I learned what love is 
When we were just kids 
When did you get so lost? 
And how could you think you’d be better off? 
It’s a wonderful wonderful life 
Why’d you have to say goodbye? 
It’s a wonderful wonderful life 
Such a wonderful wonderful life 
Thank you for those special moments 
You will always be here in my mind 
Did you know you changed my life? 
I’m thankful for that time 
I’m thankful for that time 
I’m thankful for that time 
It’s a wonderful wonderful life 
Why’d you have to say goodbye? 
It’s a wonderful wonderful life 
I’m asking why but I’ll never know 
It’s a wonderful wonderful life 
Why’d you have to say goodbye? 
It’s a wonderful wonderful life

Sleigh bells singing hallelujah

Thought I had found it but I wasn't sure 
Always a feeling that there could be more 
(could be more) 
But I've been there, done that, buyed it, tried it 
More than I can count 
Shook it, stirred it, broke it, smoked it 
More than I can count 
Oh, but out of everything, you're my favorite 
I tried a lot of things, but you're my favorite 
Oh, I think I worked this out 
Finally worked this out 
Cause out of everything, you're my favorite 
The way you kissed me wasn't typical 
Take me out of my body, something spiritual 
Think I need seconds, maybe thirds or fourths, oh 
But I've been there, done that, buyed it, tried it 
More than I can count 
Shook it, stirred it, broke it, smoked it 
More than I can count 
Oh, but out of everything, you're my favorite 
I tried a lot of things, but you're my favorite 
Oh, I think I worked this out 
Finally worked this out 
Cause out of everything, you're my favorite 
Momma can I keep him? 
I promise I'll take care of him 
Momma can I keep him? 
I promise I'll take care of him

Don't bring pajamas 
Man there's so much heat beneath these clothes 
(you see me) 
Walk in the place they know my face 
Encore, sophomore, only one solo I swore 
Big mouth, applause, oh please one more 
Wanna hear it before 
I say now let me check my itinerary, umm alright 
Presto, skintight, escaped and I risked my life 
For what? 
So I can watch them bite only one 
Gwen you can find like this 
I mean blow your mind like this 
Your key won't shine like this 
If its yours then you know it won't wind like this 
Wind it up! 
I'm feeling yummy head to toe (you see me)

But I've been off making babies 
And like a chef making donuts and pastries 
Its time to make you sweat 
Sex and sugar is the flavor 
Ovens and beaters and graters 
Beats made of bongos and shakers

Now sweat baby, get stupid, jump up, go crazy 
L.a.m.b 
in 3d, worldwide across your Tv K 
P, you crazy, how'd you get this? 
This sounds like disco Tetris 
Do I have time to connect this? 
Let me check my itinerary, umm 
I came back for my spotlight(for her spotlight) 
I disappeared like Houdini (where Houdini?) 
If yours didn't come out right (if its not right) 
Go to kinkos and xerox me 
I'm feeling yummy head to toe (you see me) 
Ain't got no patience

Now you call me by my new last name 
Memories seem like so long ago 
Time always kills the pain 
 
Remember Harbor Boulevard 
The dreaming days where the mess was made 
Look how all the kids have grown, 
We have changed but we're still the same 
After all that we've been through 
I know we're cool I know we're cool 
 
Yeah, I know we're cool

Have all your stories memorized 
I've kissed your lips a million ways 
But I still love to have you around 
 
I've held you too many times to count 
I think I know you inside out 
And we're together most days 
But I still love to have you around 
 
And you're the one I want and it's not just a phase 
And you're the one I trust, our love is the real thing 
 
Don't go away 
My love (my love) 
I want you to stay 
In my life 
Don't go away  
My lover (my love) 
I'm happiest when we spend time 
 
You're a salty water, ocean wave 
You knock me down, you kiss my face 
I know the storms will always come 
But I still love to have you around 
 
Heavens knows what will come next 
So emotional, you're so complex 
A roller coaster, built to crash 
But I still love to have you around 
 
You're the one I want and it's not just a phase 
You're the one I trust, our love is the real thing 
 
Don't go away 
My love (my love) 
I want you to stay 
In my life 
Don't go away  
My lover (my love) 
I'm happiest when we spend time (it's only you and I) 
 
It's you there when I close my eyes 
And you in the morning 
I never thought you'd still be mine 
Or I'd really need to have you around 
 
Don't go away 
My love (my love) 
I want you to stay 
In my life 
Don't go away  
My lover (my love) 
I need you, you're my love supply 
 
Don't go away 
My love (you're my love supply) 
I want you to stay 
In my life (every day, every night) 
Don't go away  
My lover (you're my love supply) 
I need you, you're my love supply</field>

Alright, hold your pretty horses. I'll be there in a minute 
You just get yourself dolled up alright toots 
And you pick a place, you just pick a place 
 
Umm, Johnny? 
 
Yeah, Gwenie, Gwen, Gwen? 
 
You might want to hurrry, because tonight is the night 
 
I'm empty, I need fulfilling, yes I do love 
To the ceiling, when I do love 
I get this feeling when I'm in love 
 
I'm restless, can't you see I try my bestest 
To be good girl, because it's just us 
So take me now and do me justice 
 
I'm waiting patiently 
Anticipating your arrival 
And I'm hating 
It takes so long to get to my house 
To take me out 
 
Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric 
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric 
Uh-oh, in the back seat 
 
Ok now, I understand he's on his way now 
But jeez Louise, I mean today now 
I can't wait, I want to play now 
 
I'm antsy 
Bubble pop electric pansies 
My sweet tooth, I want your candy 
The Queen of Eng would say it randy 
 
I'm itchy 
I wish you would come and scratch me 
Tonight I'm falling, won't you catch me 
Swoop on by, so you can snatch me 
And take me out 
 
Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric 
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric 
Uh-oh, in the back seat 
 
The need to be satisfied 
Come pick me up, I want a ride 
Hurry, hurry, come to me 
Drive in movie 
Drive in, move me 
Drive into me 
 
Bubble pop electric 
You've gotta get it 
(Straight to me, drive in movie) 
Take it to the back seat 
Run it like a track meet 
(Come to me, drive in movie) 
 
Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric 
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the back seat 
Bubble pop electric 
Uh-oh, in the back seat 
 
Yeah, tell your father I said hello 
 
Johnny, get out of here</field>

Now I found the love of my life 
Passes things, get more comfortable 
Everything is going right 
 
And after all the obstacles 
It's good to see you now with someone else 
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends 
After all that we've been through 
I know we're cool 
I know we're cool 
 
We used to think it was impossible 
Now you call me by my new last name 
Memories seem like so long ago 
Time always kills the pain 
 
Remember Harbor Boulevard 
The dreaming days where the mess was made 
Look how all the kids have grown, oh 
We have changed but we're still the same 
After all that we've been through 
I know we're cool 
I know we're cool 
 
Yeah, I know we're cool 
 
And I'll be happy for you 
If you can be happy for me 
Circles and triangles 
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend 
So far from where we've been 
I know we're cool

Ah ah I know we're cool

Drive back baby to me, fast in your car 
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard 
 
I wander round the room and I'm getting things ready 
I picture you driving, just like Mario Andretti 
I got the cush, Kettle One, waiting for your engine 
Your Grand Prix attention, it's gonna be a party 
 
Don't forget to make a you-turn 
I see you left your blinker on 
I got it rolled and ready here to burn 
Meet me back at home (a-oh, a-oh) 
 
Drive back baby to me, fast in your car 
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard 
 
Drive back baby to me, fast in your car 
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard 
 
Driving fast in your car 
I've got you tracked on my radar, oh 
 
It's just such a trip, how you're still my speed racer 
You got me so addicted, just like a free-baser 
I want you all over me like L.A.M.B. 
So get here A.S.A.P., it's gonna be a party 
 
Don't forget to make a you-turn (don't forget to get here) 
I see you left your blinker on (you see, I want to get it on)

You're in the pole position 
Put it in first gear, step on the pedal and drive fast

Drive back baby to me, fast in your car

Adopting all your history, it's hard being me too

And you should have told me when you met me 
All these things I should know 
I should have asked, we should have talked 
About this so long ago 
 
It's not fair, it's not fair 
And don't leave me here 
How's this happening to me 
It feels so lonely here 
 
We are in a mess, a danger zone 
What will happen next, you never know 
We are in a mess, a danger zone 
What will happen next, you never know 
 
Now we share the closet, now you've let me come inside 
And now you're finally undressing, and I feel like I might die 
The damage is infectious, the confession is too late 
And how can I accept this 
How is this happening to me 
 
It's not fair, it's not fair 
And I come up for air 
How's this happening to me

When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come 
We've got a long way to go 
It's beyond Martin Luther, upgrade computer 
 
Her/His skin wasn't the same color as mine 
But she/he was fine, she/he was fine 
If all men are made equal 
Then she/he was fine, she/he was fine 
Up until the time we went out on a date 
I was fine, I was fine 
Now I'm getting dirty looks, I wonder what they'd say 
If we were blind, we were blind people 
 
We've got a long way to go

Beauty is beauty, whether it's black or white 
Yellow or green baby, you know what I mean 
What if Picasso only used one color 
There shouldn't be a rule, how to choose your lover 
 
Lovers in love is such a wonderful thing 
Maybe in time, we'll get together and sing 
I really hope so, there's nothing wrong with this picture 
We got a long way to go, we gotta get there quicker 
 
We've got a long way to go

What color is love [3x] 
 
We've got a long way to go 
When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come 
We've got a long way to go 
It's beyond Martin Luther, upgrade computer 
We've got a long way to go 
When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come

...that all men are created equal... 
...children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by...

Champagne kisses, hold me in your lap of luxury 
I only want to fly first-class desires, you're my limousine 
So eloquent, the way we ride, our passion, it just multiplies 
There's platinum lightning in the sky 
Look I'm livin' like a queen 
 
This kind of love is getting expensive 
We know how to live, baby 
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton 
We're so rich in love, we're rollin' in cashmere 
Got it in fifth gear, baby 
Diamond in the rough is lookin' so sparkly

Cause I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl 
 
I'd get me four Harajuku girls to (uh huh) 
Inspire me and they'd come to my rescue 
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names (yeah) 
Love, angel, music, baby 
Hurry up and come and save me 
 
All the riches baby, won't mean anything 
All the riches baby, won't bring what your love can bring 
All the riches baby, won't mean anything 
Don't need no other baby 
Your lovin' is better than gold, and I know 
 
Come together all over the world 
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku girls 
What, it's all love 
What, give it up 
What (shouldn't matter [Repeat x4]), what 
Come together all over the world 
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku girls 
What, it's all love 
What, give it up 
What (shouldn't matter [Repeat x4]) 
What happened to my life 
Turned upside down 
Chicks dat blew ya mind, ding, it's the second round 
(Original track and ting, mmm) 
You know you can't buy these things (no) 
See Stefani and her L.A.M.B., I rock the fetish 
People, you know who I am 
 
Yes ma'am, we got the style that's wicked 
I hope you can all keep up 
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top 
Now we ain't gettin' nothin' but love 
 
If I was rich girl (na, na) 
See, I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl 
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never ever end 
Cause I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl 
 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

There's me, there's you (hoko-ten) 
In a pedestrian paradise  
Where the catwalk got its claws (meow)  
A subculture, in a kaleidoscope of fashion  
Prowl the streets of Harajuku (irasshaimase) 
 
Super lovers, tell me where you got yours  
(At the super lovers store) 
Yochi Yamamoto  
I'm hanging with the locals  
 
Where the catwalk got its claws  
All you fashion know-it-alls  
With your underground malls  
In the world of Harajuku  
Putting on a show, when you dress up in your clothes  
Wild hair color and cell phones  
Your accessories are dead on  
 
[Chorus: x 2] 
Harajuku girls, you got the wicked style  
I like the way that you are  
I am your biggest fan, oh 
 
Harajuku girls  
I'm looking at you girls  
You're so original girls  
You got the look that makes you stand out  
Juku girls, I'm looking at you girls  
You mix and match it girls  
You dress so fly and just parade around (arigato) 
 
I'm fascinated by the Japanese fashion scene  
Just an American girl in the Tokyo streets  
My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt  
they're hard to find in the States, got me feeling couture  
 
what's that you got on 
Is it Comme Des Garcons  
A Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong  
Mixed up with second-hand clothes  
(Let's not forget about John Galliano, no) 
Flip the landscape when Nigo made A Bathing Ape 
I've got expensive taste (oh well) 
Guess I'd better save up (cho takai) 
 
[Chorus: x 2] 
Work it, express it  
Live it, command your style  
Create it, design it  
Now let me see you work it [repeat] 
 
You bring style and color all around the world (you harajuku girls)  
You bring style and color all around the world (you harajuku girls)  
 
Your look is so distinctive, like DNA  
Like nothing I've ever seen in the USA  
Your underground culture, visual grammar  
The language of your clothing, is something to encounter  
A ping-pong match between eastern and western  
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection 
Just wait til you get your little hands on L.A.M.B.  
Cause it's (super kawaii), that means (super cute in Japanese)  
The streets of Harajuku are your catwalk  
Bishoujo, you're so vogue 
That's what you drop  
 
Cho saikou, Harajuku girls  
(And that's what you drop, and that's what you drop)  
Cho saikou, Harajuku girls  
 
Harajuku girls [chorus in background] 
Harajuku girls  
 
Style detached from content  
A fatal attraction to cuteness  
Style is style  
Fashion is fashion  
Girl, you got style</field>

Have all your stories memorized 
I've kissed your lips a million ways 
But I still love to have you around 
 
I've held you too many times to count 
I think I know you inside out 
And we're together most days 
But I still love to have you around 
 
You're the one I want and it's not just phase 
You're the one I trust, our love is the real thing 
 
Don't go away 
My love (my love) 
I want you to stay 
In my life 
Don't go away 
My lover (my love) 
I'm happiest when we spend time 
 
You're a salty water ocean wave 
You knock me down, you kiss my face 
I know the storms will always come 
But I still love to have you around 
 
Heaven knows what will come next 
So emotional, you're so complex 
A rollercoaster built to crash 
But I still love to have you around 
 
You're the one I want and it's not just phase 
You're the one I trust, our love is the real thing

My love (my love) 
I want you to stay

Don't go away 
My lover (my love) 
I'm happiest when we spend time (it's only you and I) 
 
It's you there when I close my eyes 
And you in the morning 
I never thought you'd still be mine 
Or I'd really need to have you around 
 
Don't go away 
My love (my love) 
I want you to stay 
In my life 
Don't go away

Come on, give a little love 
Why aren't you calling me back?

Got your voice mail on, I'm so frustrated

My heart had a crash when we spoke 
I can't fix what you broke 
And you, you always have a reason 
Again and again this feelin' 
Why do I give in? 
 
And I always was, always was one for cryin' 
I always was one for tears 
 
The sun's getting cold; it's snowin' 
Looks like an early winter 
For us 
Looks like an early winter 
For us 
An early winter 
Oh, I need you to turn me over 
 
It's said the map of the world is on you 
The moon gravitates around you 
The seasons escape you 
 
And I always was, always was one for cryin' 
I always was one for tears 
No, I never was, I never was one for lyin' 
You lied to me all these years 
 
The sun's getting cold; it's snowin'

Looks like an early winter

Oh, I need you to turn me over 
 
Why? Why do you act so stupid? 
Why? You know that I'm always right 
 
It looks like an early winter 
For us 
It hurts, and I can't remember sunlight 
An early winter 
For us 
The leaves are changing color 
For us 
(It gets too much, it gets so much) 
Starting over and over, and over again 
(It gets too much, it gets so much) 
Starting over and over, and over again

Well, it looks like an early winter

Getting greedy 'cause he said he had another sick flow 
So I had to holla back; guess I didn't get enough 
Still be the one to land, and I send the tick-tock 
If you give me a clap, I'm gonna give an encore 
Don't want it to end; I wanna skank some more  
I'm tripping on the best dream that I never had 
I guess behind the orange curtain is not so bad 
 
From the West Side of Anaheim, a small world after all 
Hanging out at the hotel, selling makeup at the mall 
Making out to "Purple Rain" just like everybody else 
Dame un beso, now stop, I'm trying to save myself 
In the ordinary calling girl way 
Back in the seven-one-four days 
Trying to figure what I wanna be 
Hanging in the garage, me and ND 
 
I'm just an Orange County girl 
Living in an extraordinary world  
I'm just an Orange County girl 
Living in an extraordinary world 
Sing

La la la la la la la la la 
And the guys sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
And the girls sing 
La la la la la la la la la 
 
A lot of things have changed, but I'm mostly the same 
These are a few of my favorite things 
Still rollin' 'cause the 'Sound Of Music'  
Ain't nothing better than a great, big, huge hit 
You know, I'd pay you just to let me run, dance, and sing 
I know I'm living the E-ticket dream 
For a girl from O.C., it's almost unheard of 
So I wanna thank you all so much for the love (especially my girlfriends) 
 
Pharrell on repeat, make a hurricane in Miami 
Working with him, I'm gonna get myself another Grammy 
I got the L.A.M.B., and he's rocking the Ice Creams 
Blend it together, something fresh and kinda in between 
Remember music is something that I love 
So I don't really give a fuck 
The music don't come in no color 
It's time to move on hit you with the chorus 
 
I'm just an Orange County girl 
Living in an extraordinary world  
I'm just an Orange County girl 
Living in an extraordinary world

I must apologize for acting, stinking, treating you this way 
Cause I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold 
 
If I could escape 
And recreate a place as my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl 
Forever, perfectly together 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?

I know I've been a real bad girl 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt

I'm at my lowest boiling point 
Come help me out 
I need to get me out of this joint 
Come on, let's bounce 
Counting on you to turn me around 
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground 
 
So, baby, times getting a little crazy 
I've been getting a little lazy 
Waiting for you to come save me 
I can see that you're angry 
By the way the you treat me 
Hopefully you don't leave me 
Want to take you with me 
 
If I could escape 
And recreate a place as my own world

This is the key that makes us wind up 
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up

But the girls want to know why boys like us so much 
They like way we dance, they like the way we work 
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt 
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (she's crazy, right?) 
They like the way we react every time we hear the 
 
Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name 
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up

Wind it up 
Wind it up (c'mon) 
Wind it up

You've got to let the beat get under your skin 
You've got to open up and let it all in 
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins 
Then you find out why all the boys stare 
See, they're trying to bite our style 
Trying to study our approach 
They like the way we do it, so original 
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room 
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go 
 
Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name 
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up 
(Get in line now) 
 
Wind it up (whenever you're ready) 
Wind it up 
Wind it up 
Wind it up 
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low 
 
(Uh huh) this is your moment 
(Uh huh) come on girl, you know you own it 
(Uh huh) you know your key is still tick-tocking 
(Hell yeah) but you know they're watching 
Get it girl, get it, get it girl 
Get it girl, get it, get it girl 
To the front, to the side, to the back, but don't let him ride 
Keep going girl, it's your night 
Don't let him steal your light 
I know he thinks you're fine and stuff 
But does he know how to wind you up? (c'mon) 
 
Wind it up 
Wind it up 
Wind it up 
Wind it up 
Yodelay, yodelay, yodelay, hey!</field>

For years, you know? 
Your memory seems to come and go 
Our time meant so much to me 
Now you can't be found 
 
You were the first to want me 
The first to love me 
The first to need me 
Who was the last to know you 
The last to love you 
The last to hold you? 
 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life (so wonderful) 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life (so wonderful) 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life (so wonderful) 
Such a wonderful, wonderful life 
 
I thought of you again today 
Reminded me how with time I've changed 
If you only knew what you gave to me 
Now you can't be found 
 
And you were the first I trusted 
I learned what love is 
When we were just kids 
When did you get so lost 
And how could you think you'd be better off? 
 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life (so wonderful) 
Why'd you have to say goodbye? 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life (so wonderful) 
Such a wonderful, wonderful life  
 
Thank you for those special moments 
You will always be here, in my mind 
Did you know you changed my life? 
I'm thankful for that time 
I'm thankful for that time 
I'm thankful for that time 
 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life 
Why'd you have to say goodbye? 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life (so wonderful) 
I'm asking why, but I'll never know 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life (so wonderful) 
Why'd you have to say goodbye? 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life (so wonderful) 
Such a wonderful, wonderful life 
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
Such a wonderful, wonderful life</field>

Ain't got no patience, so let's go

Look, I'm dyin' of drama 
I wanna spend the night 
Don't bring pajamas 
Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes 
You see me 
 
Walk in the place 
They know my face 
Encore sophomore 
Only one solo, I swore 
Big mouth, applause 
Oh please, one more 
Wanna hear it before I say naw? 
Let me check my itinerary 
Mmm, all right 
Presto, skin tight 
Escape and I risked my life 
For what, so I can watch them bite 
Only one Gwen you can find like this 
I mean blow your mind like this 
Your key won't shine like this 
If it's yours, then you know it won't wind like this 
Wind it up 
 
I'm feelin' yummy head to toe

You see me 
 
I know you've been waiting 
But I've been out making babies 
And like a chef making donuts and pastries 
(It's time to make you sweat) 
Sex and sugar is the flavor 
Ovens and beaters and graters 
Beats made of bongos and shakers 
(It's time to make you sweat) 
 
Walk in the place 
They know my face 
Billionaire boys 
Ice cream drippin' 'cross the floor 
Big house, garage 
Bentleys, Ferrari 
Wanna go before I say naw? 
Let met check my itinerary 
Mmm, all right 
G four, G flight 
Bed in the back, so I have a G night 
Goodnight, hood right 
Ain't no nigga you can find like this 
I mean blow your mind like this 
Nigga's watch don't shine like this 
If it's ticking, then it don't tell time like this 
 
I'm feelin' yummy head to toe 
You see me 
Ain't got no patience, so let's go

Look, I'm dyin' of drama

Now sweat, baby 
Get stupid, jump up, go crazy 
L.A.M.B. in 3-D 
Worldwide across your T.V. 
P, you crazy; how'd you get this? 
This sounds like disco Tetris 
Do I have time to connect this? 
Let me check my itinerary 
Mmm 
 
I came back for my spotlight 
(For her spotlight) 
I disappeared like Houdini 
(Where? Houdini) 
If yours didn't come out right 
(If it's not right...) 
Go to Kinko's and Xerox me 
 
I'm feelin' yummy head to toe 
You see me 
Ain't got no patience, so let's go

The naughty, naughty things you do 
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, hid it 
You see this finger wagging, wagging at you 
The naughty, naughty things you do 
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, admit it 
 
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh

You're a sparkle in a deep black hole 
You're like moon shine, when the curtains close 
You're my answer, one that no one knows 
 
And I can't believe it, that you even exist 
You know I would be dumb to give perfection up 
How can I accept it, that this is so precious? 
You know I would be dumb to give perfection up 
 
You're rare 
And I'm loving every second of it, don't you know? 
You're rare 
And only a stupid girl would let it go 
You're so good and you don't even know it 
You're so good and you don't even know 
You're rare 
And only a stupid girl would let it go, don't you know? 
 
I am broken, I am insecure 
Complicated, oh yeah that's for sure 
I feel worthless, I've been hurt so bad 
I get nervous you won't love me back 
 
And I can't believe it, that you even exist 
You know I would be dumb to give perfection up 
How can I accept it, that this is so precious? 
You know I would be dumb to give perfection up

Do you really think you wanna make some new memories? 
With me?

Look at you 
Big boy 
 
I'm making it easy for you to go give my love away 
Spend the check before it even hits the bank 
This is what happens when you don't hear what your mother say 
 
The signs, the signs, the signs, the signs 
It's you doing it, choosing it, no excuse (no excuse) 
How you doing it, ruins it, now you lose (now you lose) 
This is what happens when you living with no consequence 
The signs, the signs, the signs, the signs 
 
Big mistake, red flags cry 
Right there, but I close my eyes 
Carelessly, I let it slide 
A little late warning signs 
Right there, but I close my eyes 
Punish me, I let it slide 
 
You know how to spend it 
You know how to blow it up, blow it up, blow it up 
It's getting so expensive 
You know how to screw it up, screw it up, screw it up 
Up, up, up, up 
Screw it up, up, up, up, up 
Look at you 
 
I'm putting my money on you, I don't underestimate 
I'm not a rookie, I'm so used to getting played 
What do I do, I'm not a typical or classic case 
I try, I try, I try 
 
How I'm doing it choosing it, no excuse 
How I'm doing it, ruins it, now I lose 
This is what happens when you don't have any common sense 
The signs, the signs, the signs, the signs 
 
Big mistake, red flags cry 
Right there, but I close my eyes 
Carelessly, I let it slide 
 
You know how to spend it 
You know how to blow it up, blow it up, blow it up 
It's getting so expensive 
You know how to screw it up, screw it up, screw it up 
Up, up, up, up, up 
Screw it up, up, up, up 
 
Woah 
Hey, look at you 
Woah-woah 
Okay 
Hey 
Woah 
Look at you 
(This is your punishment) 
Woah-woah 
(This is your punishment) 
Okay 
 
Big mistake, red flags cry 
Right here, but I close my eyes 
Carelessly, I let it slide 
You know how to spend it 
You know how to blow it up, blow it up, blow it up 
It's getting so expensive 
You know how to screw it up, screw it up, screw it up 
Up, up, up, up, up 
 
Screw it up, up, up, up (look at you)

Has come and gone away 
In Paris and Rome 
But I wanna go home 
Maybe surrounded by 
A million people I 
Still feel all alone 
I just wanna go home 
Baby I miss you, you know 
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you 
Each one a line or two 
"I'm fine baby, how are you?" 
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough 
My words were cold and flat 
And you deserve more than that 
Another aeroplane 
Another sunny place 
I'm lucky I know 
But I wanna go home 
I've got to go home 
Let me go home 
'Cause I'm just too far 
From where you are 
I wanna come home 
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life 
It's like I just stepped outside 
When everything was going right 
And I know just why you could not 
Come along with me 
'Cause this was not your dream 
But you always believed in me 
Another winter day has come 
And gone away 
And even Paris and Rome 
And I wanna go home 
Let me go home 
And I'm surrounded by 
A million people I 
Still feel alone 
Let me go home 
I miss you, you know 
Let me go home 
I've had my run 
Baby, I'm done 
I gotta go home 
Let me go home 
It all will be alright 
I'll be home tonight

I've broken my heart so many times,

I tried so very hard not to lose it 
I came up with a million excuses 
I thought, I thought of every possibility 
And I know someday that it'll all turn out 
You'll make me work 
So we can work to work it out 
And I promise you kid that I give 
So much more than I get 
I just haven't met you yet 
I might have to wait 
I'll never give up 
I guess it's half timing 
And the other half's luck 
Wherever you are 
Whenever it's right 
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life 
And I know that we can be so amazing 
And baby your love is gonna change me

In love and war 
But I won't need to fight it 
We'll get it right and 
We'll be united

I don't care if it's cloudy or bright 
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear 
Now the moon may be high 
But I can't see a thing in the sky 
'Cause I only have eyes for you 
I don't know if we're in a garden 
Or on a crowded avenue 
You are here, so am I 
Maybe millions of people go by 
But they all disappear from view 
And I only have eyes for you 
How can I live a day without you? 
I need your love to see me through 
But you're not here by my side 
Maybe millions of people go by 
But they all disappear from view 
And I only have eyes 
I only have eyes 
Only have eyes for you 
Only have eyes for you 
Are the stars up tonight? 
It could be cloudy or bright 
Eyes so blue, kisses true 
I never knew what they could do</field>

I say a little pray for you 
Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you 
Forever, and ever, we never will part 
How I love you 
Together,Forever, that's how it must be 
To live without you 
Would only meen heartbreak for me. 
I run for the bus, dear, 
While riding I think of us, dear, 
I say a little pray for you. 
At work I just take time 
And all through my coffee break time, 
I say a little pray for you. 
Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you 
Forever, and ever we never will part 
Oh, how I'll love you 
Together, forever, that's how it must be 
To live without you 
Would only mean heartbreak for me. 
My darling believe me, ( believe me) 
For me there is no one but you! 
Please, love me too 
Answer my pray 
Say love me too 
Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you 
Forever, and ever we never will part 
How I love you 
Together, forever, that's how it must be 
To live without you 
Would only mean heartbreak for me (oooooooooh)</field>

Always do what you got to do

Thank God you're mine 
You're an angel dressed in armor 
You're the fair in every fight 
You're my life and my safe harbor 
Where the sun sets every night 
And if my love is blind I don't want to see the light 
It's your beauty that betrays you 
Your smile gives you away 
Cause you're made of strength and mercy 
And my soul is yours to save 
I know this much it's true 
When my world was dark and blue 
I know the only one who'll rescue me is you 
Close your eyes 
Let me tell you all the reasons why 
You'll never gonna have to cry 
Because you're one of a kind 
Yeah, here's to you 
The one that always pulls us through 
You always do what you got to do, baby 
Because you're one of a kind 
When your love pours down on me 
I know I'm finally free 
So I tell you gratefully 
Every single beat in my heart 
Is yours to keep 
Close your eyes 
Let me tell you all the reasons why 
You'll never gonna have to cry 
Because you're one of a kind 
Yeah, here's to you 
The one that always pulls us through 
You always do what you got to do, baby 
Because you're one of a kind 
You're the reason why I'm breathing 
With a little look my way 
You're the reason that I'm feeling

We got a thing going on 
We both know that it's wrong 
But it's much too strong to let it go now 
We meet everyday at the same café

Holding hands, making all kinds of plans 
While the jukebox plays our favorite song 
Me and Mrs

Jones, Mrs

Jones 
We got a thing going on 
Both know that it's wrong 
But it's much too strong to let it go now

That we don't build our hopes up too high 
'Cause she's got her own obligations 
And so do I 
Me and Mrs

Mrs 
Jones, Mrs 
Jones, Mrs 
Jones 
Well, it's time for us to be leaving 
And it hurts so much, it hurts so much inside 
And now she'll go her way and I'll go mine 
But tomorrow we'll meet at the same place, the same time 
Me and Mrs

Takes away my trouble, takes away my grief 
Takes away all of my heartache in the night like a thief

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
Yes, I need her in the daytime 
Oh, but I need her in the night 
Yes, I wanna throw my arms around her 
Kiss and hug, kiss and hug her tight 
And when I'm returning from so far away 
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day 
Yes, it makes me righteous, it makes me feel whole 
And makes me mellow down to my soul 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

It seems like yesterday 
You opened up your eyes 
And I recognized your face 
You know that you're the one that we've been waiting for 
We're gonna keep you safe 
First time I held you in my arms 
I knew I'd love you all the way 
I tuck you in at night 
Another day has passed 
Every week goes by a little faster than the last 
It wasn't so long ago 
We walked together and you held my hand 
And now you're getting too big to want to 
But I hope you'll always understand 
That I'm always gonna lift you up 
And I'm never gonna let you down 
No matter what you do 
I'm forever proud of you 
I love you forever now 
Through your ears I hear it 
Through your eyes I see 
A world full of magic 
Full of possibilities 
You know as well as anybody how tough this life can be 
But you've got so much strength inside you 
A strengh I pray you'll never need 
And I'm always gonna lift you up 
And I'm never gonna let you down 
Time flies by 
I hope you realize that I 
Love you forever now 
I'm always gonna be right here 
I'll always gonna cheer you up 
I'm always gonna have your back 
You're never gonna be alone 
And I'm always gonna lift you up 
No, I'm never gonna let you down 
No matter what you do 
I'm forever proud of you

When we sway I go weak 
I can hear the sounds of violins 
Long before it begins 
Make me thrill as only you know how 
Sway me smooth, sway me now 
Other dancers may be on the floor 
Dear, but my eyes will see only you 
Only you have that magic technique 
When we sway I go weak 
I can hear the sounds of violins 
Long before it begins 
Make me thrill as only you know how 
Sway me smooth, sway me now 
When marimba rhythms start to play 
Dance with me, make me sway 
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore 
Hold me close, sway me more 
Like a flower bending in the breeze 
Bend with me, sway with ease 
When we dance you have a way with me 
Stay with me, sway with me 
When marimba start to play 
Hold me close, make me sway 
Like an ocean hugs the shore 
Hold me close, sway me more 
Like a flower bending in the breeze 
Bend with me, sway with ease 
When we dance you have a way with me 
Stay with me, sway with me</field>

            <field name="lyrics">It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Ev'rywhere you go; 
Take a look at the five and ten glistening once again 
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Toys in ev'ry store 
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
On your own front door. 
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots 
Is the wish of Barney and Ben; 
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk 
Is the hope of Janice and Jen; 
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Ev'rywhere you go; 
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, 
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; 
Soon the bells will start, 
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing 
Right within your heart 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Toys in ev'ry store 
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
On your own front door. 
So it's Christmas once more...</field>

Sweet, comic valentine 
You make me smile with my heart 
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable 
yet your my favorite work of art 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, 
are you smart? 
But don't change a hair for me 
Not if you care for me 
Stay little valentine 
Stay 
Each day is valentine's day 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, 
Are you smart? 
But don't change a hair for me 
Not if you care for me 
Stay little valentine 
Stay 
Each day is Valentine's Day</field>

Out of town were the people I knew 
I had that feeling of self-pity 
What to do? What to do? What to do? 
The outlook was decidedly blue 
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone 
It turned out to be the luckiest day I´ve known 
A foggy day in London Town 
I had me low and had me down 
I viewed the morning with such alarm 
The British Museum had lost its charm 
How long, I wondered, could this thing last? 
But the age of miracles hadn´t passed, 
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town 
The sun was shining everywhere.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Way back when we started 
There was a part of me that knew 
One day you'll be hiding 
And I would lose myself to you 
And I walked all night 
Lost in the silent city lights 
Thinking of you 
Wondering where I lose my mind 
After all I've decided 
That you're in my life again 
After all I'm delighted to be back 
Where we began 
I believe that you can fall in love with me again 
And we'll both be standing tall, after all 
Way back when we started 
There was a part of you that knew 
I was all that you wanted 
But only shadows filled the room 
I was lost, alright 
Lost in the sleepless empty nights 
Dreaming of you 
And in those dreams you were still mine 
After all, we're united 
Yeah, you're in my arms again 
After all, I'm delighted 
Cause we're lovers and we're friends 
I believe that I can fall in love with you again 
And I'll catch you when you fall 
After all 
I was lost, alright 
Lost in the sleepless empty nights 
Dreaming of you 
And in those dreams you were still mine 
After all I've decided 
That you're in my life again 
After all I'm delighted to be back 
Where we began 
I believe that you can fall in love with me again 
Cause I'm with you, I'll catch you when you fall 
Reunited and we made it, after all 
And we'll both be standing tall, after all

And were there more than twenty-four hours a day 
They'd be spent in sweet content dreamin' away 
Sky's are gray, sky's are blue 
Morning, noon and nighttime, too 
All I do the whole day through is dream of you 
It's the cat's meow 
All I do the whole day through

I don't care about the presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
You know that all I want for Christmas is you... 
I won't ask for much this Christmas 
I won't even wish for snow 
No, I'm just gonna keep on waiting 
Underneath the mistletoe 
There's no sense in hanging stockings 
There upon the fireplace 
Cause Santa he won't make me happy 
With a toy on Christmas Day 
I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
Girl, what can I do? 
You know that all I want for Christmas is you... 
And all the lights are shining 
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of children's 
Laughter fills the air 
And everyone is singing 
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love 
Won't you please bring my baby to me... 
I don't want a lot for Christmas 
This is all I'm asking for 
No, I just wanna see my baby 
Standing right outside my door 
Oh I just want you for my own 
More that you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
You know that all I want for Christmas is you 
Is you...</field>

My heart beats so it scares me to death!

Her lips are like a vulcano that's hot 
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup

Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go 
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow

Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin', to make a fire grow 
And baby, you've got what it takes 
Now listen, honey. 
[Michael Bublé] 
All right, baby. 
[Sharon Jones] 
You know it takes a lot of kissin' 
Ooh, To make a romance, sweet 
Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin', i hope to make my life complete 
[Michael Bublé] 
Ooh, well, it takes somebody special to knock me off my feet 
And baby, you've got what it takes.

I said, 
mm, mm, mm 
uh-huh, mm, mm, mm 
Ah, ah, hah 
mm, mm 
[Michael Bublé] 
You know you've got just what it takes! 
Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you 
It'd takes more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true 
[Sharon Jones] 
But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do". 
And baby, you've got what it takes. 
Ah, ah, hah

Baby, it's cold outside 
I've got to go away 
Baby, it's cold out there 
This evening has been 
Been hoping 
That you'd drop in 
So very nice 
I'll hold your hands 
They're just like ice 
My mother 
Will start to worry 
Beautiful 
What you're hurry 
And father 
Will be 
Pacing the floor 
Listen 
To that fireplace 
Roar 
So really 
I'd better scurry 
Beautiful 
Please don't hurry 
Well, maybe 
Just a half 
A drink more 
Put some records on 
While i pour 
And the neighbors 
Might think 
Baby 
It's bad out there 
Say 
What's in this drink? 
No cabs 
To be had out there 
I wish i knew how 
Your eyes 
Are like starlight now 
To break the spell 
I'll take your hat 
Your hair looks swell 
I ought to say 
No, no, no sir 
Mind if i 
Mmove in closer? 
At least i'm gonna say 
That i tried 
What's the sense of 
Hurtin' my pride? 
I really can't stay 
Baby don't hold out 
Baby 
But it's cold outside 
I simply must go 
But baby 
It's cold outside 
The answer is no 
I say 
It's cold out there 
The welcome 
Has been how lucky 
That you dropped in 
So nice and warm 
Look out that window 
Man that's hard 
My sister 
Will be suspicious 
Gosh 
Your lips look delicious 
My brother 
Will be there at the door 
Waves upon a tropical 
Shore 
My maiden 
Aunt's mind is vicious 
Gosh 
Your lips are delicious 
Well maybe 
Just a cigarette more 
Oh 
Never such a blizzard 
Before 
I've got to go home 
Baby 
you'll freeze out there 
Say, lend me your coat 
It's up 
To your knees out there 
You've really been grand 
I thrill 
When you touch my hand 
But don't you see 
How can you do 
This thing to me 
There's bound 
To be talk tomorrow 
Think 
Of my lifelong sorrow 
At least there 
Will be plenty implied 
If you caught pneumonia 
And died 
I really can't stay 
Get over that old lie 
Oh 
But it's cold outside</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Best Of Me 
So many years gone, still I remember 
How did I ever let my heart believe 
in one who never gave enough to me 
And so many years gone,love that was so wrong 
I can't forget the way it used to be 
and how you changed the taste of love for me 
You were my one more chance 
I never thought I'd find 
you were the one romance 
I've always known in my mind 
No one will ever touch me more 
and I only hope that in return 
I might have saved the best of me for you 
And we'll have no ending if we can hold on 
and I think I've come this far because of you 
could be no other love but ours will do 
You were my one more chance 
I never thought I'd find 
you were the one romance 
I've always known in my mind 
No one will ever touch me more 
and I only hope that in return 
I might have saved the best of me for you 
No one will ever touch me more 
and I only hope that in return 
No matter how much we have to learn 
I saved the best of me for you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene 
I said don't mind, but what do you mean: I am the one 
Who will dance on the floor in the round 
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round 
She told me her name was Billie Jean 
As she caused a scene 
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed 
Of being the one 
Who will dance on the floor in the round 
People always told me: Be careful of what you do 
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts 
My mother always told me: Be careful of who you love 
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
For forty days and forty nights 
The law was on her side 
But who can stand when she's in demand 
Her schemes and plans 
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round 
So take my strong advice 
Just remember to always think twice 
(Do think twice, do think twice) 
She told: My baby, we danced 'til three 
Then she looked at me 
Then showed a photo my baby cried 
His eyes were like mine 
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby 
People always told me be careful of what you do 
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts 
But she came and stood right by me 
Just to smell her sweet perfume 
This happened much too soon 
She called me to her room 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
(No, she is not just my baby) 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one 
(You know what you did) 
She says he is my son 
(Breaking my heart, babe) 
She says I am the one 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
(Call me, Billie Jean) 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
(She is not at the scene) 
Billie Jean is not my lover</field>

You’ll be doing alright with your Christmas of white

All ringing in song

Full of happy sounds

But it's not like Christmas at all 
I remember when you were here 
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree

I'm watching them shine

You should be here with me

You're an angel dressed in armor 
You're the fair in every fight 
You're my life and my safe harbor 
Where the sun sets every night 
And if my love is blind I don't want to see the light 
It's your beauty that betrays you 
Your smile gives you away 
Cause you're made of strength and mercy 
And my soul is yours to save 
I know this much it's true 
When my world was dark and blue 
I know the only one who'll rescue me is you 
Close your eyes 
Let me tell you all the reasons why

So I tell you gratefully 
Every single beat in my heart 
Is yours to keep 
Close your eyes

As Children sleep with one eye open 
Well, now there's more than toys at stake 
Cause I'm older now but not done hoping. 
The twinkling of the lights 
As Santa carols fill the household 
Old saint nick has taken flight 
With a heart on board so please be careful. 
Each year I ask for many different things 
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring 
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas 
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas 
Won't be wrapped under a tree 
I want something that lasts forever 
So kiss me on this cold December night. 
A tree that smells of pine 
A house that's filled with joy and laughter 
The mistletoe says stand in line 
Loneliness is what I've captured 
Oh but this evening can be a holy night 
Lets cozy on up the fireplace 
And dim those Christmas lights 
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas 
There's nothing else that you will need this Christmas 
Won't be wrapped under a tree 
I want something that lasts forever 
So kiss me on this cold December night. 
They call it the season of giving 
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking 
They call it the season of giving 
I'm here, I'm yours 
Just fall in love with me this Christmas 
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas 
Won't be wrapped under a tree 
I want something that lasts forever 
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight 
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater 
Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight 
I want something to forever 
So kiss me on this cold December night. 
They call it the season of giving

They call it the season of giving

Come on, dance with me! 
Romance with me on a crowded floor! 
And while the rhythm swings 
What lovely thing I'll be saying! 
And what is dancing 
But making love, set the music! 
When the band begins to leave the stand 
And folks start to roam 
As we walk home 
Cheek to cheek we'll be 
So come on, come on, come on 
Come on and dance with me! 
Hey there, sweets 
Throw on those Latin beats 
And come dance with me! 
What I mean is, come on and my 
Let's cha-cha-cha! 
And leave a split and do the bongo beat 
Come on, dance with me! 
Romance with me uh, la, la 
I don't care what it has 
Cause that jargon jazz makes me move it! 
And we charade 
When the band starts to groove it 
They groove it! 
Come on by, cause we're set to fly 
And I'll let you lead 
If that's agreed, you'll know where I'll be! 
So come on, come on, come on 
Come and dance with me! 
I'll do the cha-cha-cha, uh, the merengue 
We'll grow the tango 
Come on and dance with me!</field>

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down 
to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star, Tony always tended 
bar 
Across a crowded floor, they worked from eight til 
four 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 
At the Copa, Copacabana 
The hottest spot north of Havana 
At the Copa, Copacabana 
Music and passion were always the fashion 
At the Copa ... 
they fell in love 
His name was Rico, he wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancin' 
there 
And when she finished, he called her over 
But Rico went a bit too far, Tony sailed across the 
bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in 
two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 
At the Copa, Copacabana 
The hottest spot north of Havana 
At the Copa, Copacabana 
Music and passion were always the fashion 
At the Copa ... 
she lost her love 
Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl 
But that was thirty years ago, when they used to have 
a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola 
Still in the dress she used to wear, faded feathers in 
her hair 
She sits there so refined, and drinks herself 
half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind! 
At the Copa, Copacabana 
The hottest spot north of Havana 
At the Copa, Copacabana

This thing called love I must get round to it 
I ain't ready 
Crazy little thing called love 
This thing (this thing) 
Called love (called love) 
It cries (like a baby) 
In a cradle all night 
It swings (woo woo) 
It jives (woo woo) 
It shakes all over like a jelly fish 
I kinda like it 
Crazy little thing called love 
There goes my baby 
She knows how to rock 'n' roll 
She drives me crazy 
She gives me hot and cold fever 
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat 
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip 
And get on my track's 
Take a back seat, hitch-hike 
And take a long ride on my motorbike 
Until I'm ready 
Crazy little thing called love 
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip 
And get on my track's 
Take a back seat (ah hum), hitch-hike (ah hum) 
And take a long ride on my motorbike 
Until I'm ready (ready Freddie) 
Crazy little thing called love 
This thing called love I just can't handle it 
This thing called love I must get round to it 
I ain't ready 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Crazy little thing called love</field>

And the heaven's open up every time she smiles 
And when I come to her, that's just where I belong 
Yes, I'm running to her like a river's song 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down 
And when I come to her when the sun goes down 
Takes away my trouble, takes away my grief 
Takes away all of my heartache in the night like a thief 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
Love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
Yes, I need her in the daytime 
Oh, but I need her in the night 
Yes, I wanna throw my arms around her 
Kiss and hug, kiss and hug her tight 
And when I'm returning from so far away 
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day 
Yes, it makes me righteous, it makes me feel whole 
And makes me mellow down to my soul 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
I need love, love, love, love, crazy love 
Crazy love 
Crazy love 
Crazy love</field>

Got as far as the door 
They'd have asked me about you 
Don't get around much anymore 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease 
But nevertheless, why stir up memories 
Been invited on dates 
Might have gone but what for 
Awfully different without you 
Don't get around much anymore</field>

Moon and June and roses and rainbow's ends 
Down with songs that moan about night and day 
Down with love yes take it away, away 
Away 
Far away 
Give it back to the birds and bees and the Viennese 
Down with eyes romantic and stupid 
Down with sighs and down with cupid 
Brother let's stuff that dove 
Down with love 
Down with love let's liquidate all its friends 
The moons the Junes the roses and rainbow's ends 
Down with songs that moan about night and day

Say "nighty-night" and kiss me. 
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me. 
While I'm alone and blue as can be, 
Dream a little dream of me. 
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear. 
Still craving your kiss 
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear. 
Just saying this: Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you. 
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you. 
But in your dreams whatever they be, 
Dream a little dream of me. 
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear. 
Still craving your kiss 
I´m longing to linger till dawn, dear. 
Just saying this: Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.

            <field name="lyrics">Golden haze, 
Another morning feels like yesterday. 
End of may.. 
Now you're gone and there's still bills to pay. 
And you know it doesn't help to make believe 
You're sitting next to me. 
It doesn't help, to make believe 
That you are right behind me 
Saying it's okay. 
Longer days, 
More time to sit and watch the pendulum sway. 
In quiet rage I'm staring at this empty notebook page. 
In times like these you feel like you are done with feeling, 
You feel you want to stop the pain from healing 
Because you feel like you're the only one who's ever felt this way. 
Some days in a daze, there's brighter days. 
Funny how the feeling never stays, 
But I know I'll have to come to terms when I'm awake, 
Thinking about you is the icing on the cake. 
Makes me realize the fact you're gone for good for goodness sake. 
Golden haze, another morning feels like yesterday. 
End of may, a year is gone and I still feel this way, 
When we meet again I'll ask you how you're doing 
And you'll say fine and ask me how I'm doing 
And then I'll lie and I'll say ordinary 
It's just an ordinary day.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Never know how much I love you, never know how much I care 
When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard 
to bear 
You give me fever - when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight 
Fever - in the the morning, fever all through the night. 
Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night 
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right 
You give me fever - when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight 
Fever - in the the morning, fever all through the night. 
Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know 
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago. 
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same 
When he put his arms around her, he said "Julie baby you're 
my flame" 
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming 
youth 
Fever - I'm on fire, fever yea I burn forsooth. 
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair 
When her Daddy tried to kill him, she said "Daddy-O don't you dare" 
Give me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight 
Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right. 
Now you've listened to my story, here's the point I have made: 
Chicks were born to give you fever, be it Fahrenheit or 
Centigrade 
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live 
and learn 
Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn. 
What a lovely way to burn. 
What a lovely way to burn.</field>

But I hope you'll always understand 
That I'm always gonna lift you up 
And I'm never gonna let you down 
No matter what you do

Through your ears I hear it 
Through your eyes I see 
A world full of magic 
Full of possibilities 
You know as well as anybody how tough this life can be 
But you've got so much strength inside you 
A strengh I pray you'll never need 
And I'm always gonna lift you up 
And I'm never gonna let you down 
Time flies by 
I hope you realize that I 
Love you forever now 
I'm always gonna be right here 
I'll always gonna cheer you up 
I'm always gonna have your back 
You're never gonna be alone 
And I'm always gonna lift you up 
No, I'm never gonna let you down

He began to dance around. 
O, Frosty the snowman

So he said, "Let's run 
And we'll have some fun 
Now before I melt away." 
Frosty the snowman 
Had to hurry on his way, 
But he waved goodbye saying, 
"Don't you cry, 
I'll be back again some day."</field>

The whole day through 
Just an old sweet song 
Keeps Georgia on my mind 
On my mind 
I said Georgia, Georgia 
A song of you 
Comes as sweet and clear 
As moonlight through the pines 
Other arms reach out to me 
Other eyes smile tenderly 
Still in peaceful dreams I see 
The road leads back to you 
Oh, I said Georgia, Georgia 
No peace I find 
Just an old sweet song, old sweet song 
Keeps Georgia on my mind 
Oh, just an old sweet song 
Keeps Georgia on my mind 
It'll always be Georgia</field>

The world could show nothing to me 
So what good would living do me

            <field name="lyrics">Do you remember me? 
I sat upon your knee 
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies 
Well, I'm all grown-up now 
Can you still help somehow? 
I'm not a child, but my start still can dream 
So here's my lifelong wish 
My grown-up Christmas list 
Not for myself, but for a world in need 
No more lives torn apart 
That wars would never start 
And time would heal all hearts 
Every man would have a friend 
That right would always win 
And love would never end 
This is my grown-up Christmas list 
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth? 
Maybe only in that blind belief can we ever find the truth 
No more lives torn apart 
That wars would never start 
And time would heal our hearts 
Every man would have a friend 
That right would always win 
And love would never end 
This is my grown-up Christmas list 
This is my only lifelong wish 
This is my grown-up Christmas list</field>

I hope you're here to stay 
'Cause I've got me needing more of you 
Guess I'm falling for you 
You walk away 
My eyes caress you 
Then you turn and smile 
You've caught me thinkin' of love with you 
Guess I'm falling, I may be falling for you 
Since I met you days are brighter 
Life's uneven loads are lighter 
When I hear you whisper the words I long to hear dear 
Now I look into your eyes 
I'm lost in knowing that you are all I want 
My need for you is growing 
Guess I'm falling, I think I'm falling for you 
Think about falling for me too</field>

Here we are as in olden days, 
Happy golden days of yore. 
Faithful friends who are dear to us 
Gather near to us once more. 
Through the years 
We all will be together, 
If the Fates allow 
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough. 
And have yourself A merry little Christmas now.

Gather near to us once more.

Not everything lasts 
I've broken my heart so many times, 
I stopped keeping track. 
Talk myself in 
I talk myself out 
I get all worked up 
Then I let myself down. 
I tried so very hard not to lose it 
I came up with a million excuses 
I thought, I thought of every possibility 
And I know someday that it'll all turn out 
You'll make me work 
So we can work to work it out 
And I promise you kid that I give 
So much more than I get 
I just haven't met you yet 
I might have to wait 
I'll never give up 
I guess it's half timing 
And the other half's luck 
Wherever you are 
Whenever it's right 
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life 
And I know that we can be so amazing 
And baby your love is gonna change me 
And now I can see every possibility 
And somehow I know that it'll all turn out 
And you'll make me work 
So we can work to work it out 
And I promise you kid I give so much more 
Than I get 
I just haven't met you yet 
They say "all's fair" 
In love and war 
But I won't need to fight it 
We'll get it right and 
We'll be united 
And I know that we can be so amazing 
And being in your life is gonna change me 
And now I can see every single possibility 
And someday I know it'll all turn out 
And I'll work to work it out 
Promise you kid, I'll give more than I get 
Than I get 
Than I get 
Than I get 
Oh you know it'll all turn out 
And you'll make me work 
So we can work to work it out 
And I promise you kid 
To give so much more than I get 
Yeah I just haven't met you yet 
I just haven't met you yet 
Oh promise you kid 
To give so much more than I get 
I said love love love love love love love ..... 
I just haven't met you yet 
Love love love .....

Somebody's gonna come undone

Lord, I know 
Some people like to stay out late 
Some folks can't hold out that long 
But nobody wants to go home now 
There's too much goin' on 
This night is gonna last forever 
Last all, last all summer long 
Sometimes before the sun comes up 
The radio is gonna play that song 
There's gonna be a heartache tonight 
A heartache tonight, I know 
There's gonna be a heartache tonight 
A heartache tonight, I know 
There's gonna be a heartache tonight 
The moon's shinin' bright 
So turn out the light

There's gonna be a heartache tonight 
A heartache tonight, I know 
Let's go 
We can beat around the bushes 
We can get down to the bone 
We can leave it in the parkin' lot 
But either way there's gonna be a - 
Heartache tonight, a heartache tonight 
I know 
There'll be a heartache tonight 
A heartache tonight, I know

Lay your head soft against your skin

Till the early morning light 
All I'm taking is your time 
Help me make it through the night 
I don't care who's right or wrong 
I will try to understand 
Let the devil take tomorrow 
Lord tonight I need a friend 
Yesterday is dead and gone 
Yesterday is dead and gone 
And tomorrow's out of sight 
And tomorrow's out of sight 
And it's sad to be alone 
Help me make it through the night 
I don't care who's right or wrong

I guess that we were once 
Babe, we were once 
But luck will leave you cause 
It is a faithless friend 
And in the end when life has got you down 
You've got someone here that you can wrap your arms around 
So hold on to me tight 
Hold on to me tonight 
We are stronger here together 
Than we could ever be alone 
So hold on to me 
Don't you ever let me go 
There's a thousand ways for things to fall apart 
But it's no one's fault 
No it's not my fault 
Maybe all the plans we made would not work out 
But I have no doubt even though it's hard to see 
I've got faith in us and I believe in you and me 
So hold on to me tight 
Hold on, I promise it'll be alright 
Cause it's you and me together 
And baby all we've got is time 
So hold on to me, hold on to me tonight 
There's so many dreams that we have given up 
Take a look at all we've got 
And with this kind of love 
What we've got here is enough 
So hold on to me tight 
Hold on, I promise it'll be alright 
Cause we are stronger here together 
Then we could ever be alone 
Just hold on to me 
Don't you ever let me go 
Hold on to me, it's gonna be alright 
Hold on to me tonight 
They always say we were the lucky ones</field>

Could you be a movie star 
When l turn on my tv 
Will you smile and wave at me 
Telling Oprah who you are? 
So you want to be a rock star 
With blue eyed bunny's in your bed 
Well remember when you're rich 
That you sold yourself for this, 
You'll be famous cuz you're dead 
(Chorus:) 
So don't go higher for desire 
Put it in your head 
Baby, Hollywood is dead you can find it in yourself 
I don't want to take you dancing 
When you're dancing with the world 
Well you can flash your caviar 
And your million dollar car 
I don't need that kind of girl 
But you could be that next sensation 
Or will you set the latest style 
You don't need a catchy song 
Cuz the kids will sing along 
When you shoot it with a smile 
So don't go higher for desire 
Put it in your head 
Baby Hollywood is dead you can find it in yourself 
So don't fly higher for your fire 
Put it in your head 
Baby Hollywood is dead you can find it in yourself 
Keep it on your head Hollywood is dead 
Well you can do the money tango 
You can start your little band 
You can swing from vine to vine 
While the kiddies wait in line 
With the money in their hands 
But if you get to California 
Save a piece of gold for me 
If it's the only thing you save 
Then I'll bet you'll never wave 
When I watch you on tv 
So don't go higher for desire 
Put it in your head 
Baby Hollywood is dead you can find it in yourself 
So don't fly higher for your fire 
Put it in your head 
Baby Hollywood is dead you can find it in yourself 
Keep on loving what is true 
And the world will come to you 
You can find it in yourself 
Love what is true 
And the world will come to you 
You can find it in yourself 
No, no, no, no! 
Keep it in your head, Hollywood is dead! 
Baby, baby, baby 
Get it in your head 
Hollywood is dead 
Hollywood is dead!</field>

Has come and gone away 
In Paris and Rome 
But I wanna go home 
Maybe surrounded by 
A million people I 
Still feel all alone 
I just wanna go home 
Baby I miss you, you know 
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you 
Each one a line or two 
"I'm fine baby, how are you?" 
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough 
My words were cold and flat 
And you deserve more than that 
Another aeroplane 
Another sunny place 
I'm lucky I know 
But I wanna go home 
I've got to go home 
Let me go home 
'Cause I'm just too far 
From where you are 
I wanna come home 
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life 
It's like I just stepped outside 
When everything was going right 
And I know just why you could not 
Come along with me 
'Cause this was not your dream 
But you always believed in me 
Another winter day has come 
And gone away 
And even Paris and Rome 
And I wanna go home 
Let me go home 
And I'm surrounded by 
A million people I 
Still feel alone 
Let me go home 
I miss you, you know 
Let me go home 
I've had my run 
Baby, I'm done 
I gotta go home 
Let me go home 
It all will be alright 
I'll be home tonight 
I'm coming back home</field>

How can you mend a this broken man? 
How can a loser ever win? 
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the

And misty memories of days gone by 
We could never see tomorrow, no one said a word about the sorrow

Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before

And I've been holding everything inside 
But now, I've got nothing left to hide 
When I'm with you, oh, you 
But I can see 
How strong a man I'm gonna have to be 
To do for you want comes so naturally 
It's in the way you move 
And all I want is a chance to prove 
Show all I can do 
I believe in starting over 
I can see that your heart is true 
I believe in good things coming back to you 
Oh oh oh 
You're the light that lifts me higher 
So bright you guide me through 
I believe in you 
And I don't mind 
If you want to hold on to me tight 
You don't have to sleep alone tonight 
If you don't want to 
And all I want is to know you're near 
You're all I need here 
I believe in starting over 
I can see that your heart is true 
I believe in good things coming back to you 
Oh oh oh 
You're the light that lifts me higher 
So bright you guide me through 
I believe in you 
I know that there are times when you feel worthless 
Like all the love you get 
You don't deserve it 
Sometimes I feel my faith is just a burden on you, you, you 
I believe in starting over 
I can see that your heart is true 
I believe in love you give me reason to 
You're the light that lifts me higher 
So high up in the sky 
I, I think we're gonna fly 
I believe in starting over 
I can see that your heart is true 
I believe in love, you give me reason to 
Oh oh oh 
You're the light that lifts me higher 
So bright you guide me through 
I believe in you 
I believe in you 
I believe in you 
Oh 
You guide me through 
I believe in you</field>

Mere alcohol, it doesn't thrill me at all 
Tell me why should it be true 
That I get a kick out of you 
Some, they may go for cocaine 
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff 
It would bore me terrifically, too 
But I get a kick out of you 
I get a kick every time I see you 
Standing there before me 
I get a kick though it's clear to see 
You obviously do not adore me 
I get no kick in a plane 
Flyin' too high with some girl in the sky is my idea of nothing to do 
But I get a kick out of you 
I get a kick every time I see you 
Standing there before me 
I get a kick though it's clear to see 
You obviously do not adore me 
I get no kick in a plane 
Flyin' too high with some girl in the sky is my idea of nothing to do

People are dying in the dark 
While I'm lying in the sun 
And I sleep like a baby, every night it seems 
I'm having the sweetest dreams! 
I can say honestly, I got it easy! 
I'm not trying to brag about it 
So I say I appreciate it completely 
And when I'm acting a fool 
You're never cool to me! 
I got it easy, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah, yeah! 
It probably isn't much fun to be alone 
I wouldn't know 
Cause I've got you here, keeping me afloat 
And when I'm lost 
You set me straight sometimes I need it 
You raise me up, babe! I got it easy! 
Oh, some people drown in here 
while I'm walking is only knee deep 
I don't mind in a bit all this cold rainy evening 
I roll over in bed, got a beautiful woman beneath me 
And when I, I got it easy, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah 
I got it easy, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah, yeah! 
The world is wide open to me 
But it's you that completes me 
Lord, I got it easy!</field>

You are here, so am I 
Maybe millions of people go by

How can I live a day without you? 
I need your love to see me through 
But you're not here by my side 
Maybe millions of people go by 
But they all disappear from view 
And I only have eyes 
I only have eyes 
Only have eyes for you 
Only have eyes for you

and I will love you 
Forever, and ever, we never will part 
How I love you 
Together,Forever, that's how it must be 
To live without you 
Would only meen heartbreak for me. 
I run for the bus, dear, 
While riding I think of us, dear, 
I say a little pray for you. 
At work I just take time 
And all through my coffee break time, 
I say a little pray for you. 
Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you 
Forever, and ever we never will part 
Oh, how I'll love you 
Together, forever, that's how it must be 
To live without you 
Would only mean heartbreak for me. 
My darling believe me, ( believe me) 
For me there is no one but you! 
Please, love me too 
Answer my pray 
Say love me too 
Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you 
Forever, and ever we never will part

And I do mean, I wanna be around 
To see how she does it 
When she breaks your heart to bits 
Now let's see how the puzzle fits so fine 
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is so sweet 
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat 
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine

My breaking heart and I agree

The wishin' well. 
I'll be seeing you 
In every lovely summer's day; 
In every thing that's light and gay. 
I'll always think of you that way. 
I'll find you 
In the morning sun 
And when the night is new. 
I'll be looking at the moon, 
But I'll be seeing you.

Here I stand 
I'm your man 
If you want a boxer 
I will step into the ring for you 
And if you want a doctor

If you want a driver 
Climb inside 
Or if you want to take me for a ride 
You know you can 
I'm your man 
Ah, the moons too bright 
The chains too tight 
The beast won't go to sleep 
I've been running through these promises to you 
That I made and I could not keep 
Ah but a man never got a woman back 
Not by begging on his knees 
Or I'd crawl to you baby 
And I'd fall at your feet 
And I'd howl at your beauty 
Like a dog in heat 
And I'd claw at your heart 
And I'd tear at your sheet 
I'd say please, please 
I'm your man 
And if you've got to sleep 
A moment on the road 
I will steer for you 
And if you want to work the street alone 
I'll disappear for you 
If you want a father for your child 
Or only want to walk with me a while 
Across the sand 
I'm your man 
If you want a lover 
I'll do anything you ask me to 
And if you want another kind of love 
I'll wear a mask for you</field>

I´d sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night 
And repeats, yes in my head 
Don´t you know little fool, you never can win 
Use your mentality, step up to reality 
But each time I do, just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin

Ev'rywhere you go; 
Take a look at the five and ten glistening once again 
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Toys in ev'ry store 
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
On your own front door. 
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots 
Is the wish of Barney and Ben; 
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk 
Is the hope of Janice and Jen; 
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Ev'rywhere you go; 
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, 
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; 
Soon the bells will start, 
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing 
Right within your heart 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Toys in ev'ry store 
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
On your own front door. 
So it's Christmas once more...</field>

Laughing all the way 
Bells on bob tail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to laugh and sing 
A sleighing song tonight 
Jingle bells, j-jingle bells 
Jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride 
In a one horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, j-j-j-jingle bells 
Jingle all the way 
Oh, what a lotta fun, what a lotta fun to ride and sing 
In a one horse open sleigh 
Dashing through the snow (we are dashing) 
In a one horse open sleigh (one horse sleigh) 
O'er the fields we go (o'er the fields we go, we go) 
Laughing all the way (all the way) 
Bells on bob tail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to laugh and sing 
A sleighing song tonight 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride 
In a one horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride 
In a one horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Oh, what fun in one horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Oh, what fun it is to ride 
In a one horse open sleigh

            <field name="lyrics">I send flowers everyday, but you just turn them away 
And my letters go unanswered, so it seems 
Was I just too blind to see that you'd given up on me 
And it's over now, your broken heart won't mend 
Just one more dance 
why don't we try? 
Holding each other while the world stands still 
You and I, were so much in love and I would give anything 
For the chance at romance, just one more dance 
Well I know I've been a fool and I know that I've been cruel 
When you give your love completely, heart and soul 
'Let it slip right through my hands 
Can't you ever understand 
I've never felt this kind of love before 
Just one more dance 
why don't we try? 
Holding each other while the world stands still 
You and I, are so much in love 
And I would give anything for the chance at romance 
Just one more dance 
My love has no pride 
I'm dying inside 
I'm down in my knees (I'm down on my knees) 
For your love

            <field name="lyrics">You are far 
When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
Strange that you were strong enough 
To even make a start 
You'll never find 
Peace of mind 
Till you listen to your heart 
People 
You can never change the way they feel 
Better let them do just what they will 
For they will 
If you let them 
Steal your heart from you 
People 
Will always make a lover feel a fool 
But you knew I loved you 
We could have shown them all 
We should have seen love through 
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes 
Covered me with kisses and lies 
So bye 
But please don't take my heart 
You are far 
I'm never gonna be your star 
I'll pick up the pieces 
And mend my heart 
Strange that I was wrong enough 
To think you'd love me too 
You must have been kissing a fool 
I said you must have been kissing a fool 
But remember this 
Every other kiss 
That you ever give 
Long as we both live 
When you need the hand of another man 
One you really can surrender with 
I will wait for you 
Like I always do 
There's something there 
That can't compare with any other 
You are far 
When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
Strange that I was wrong enough 
To think you'd love me too 
You must have been kissing a fool 
You must have been kissing a fool 
You must have been kissing a fool</field>

Lazy river in the noon day sun 
Linger in the shade of a tree 
Throw away your troubles, dream with me 
Up a lazy river where the robin's song 
Wakes that mornin', as we roll along 
Blue skies up above ....everyone's in love 
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be 
Up a lazy river with me 
Up a lazy river by that old mill run 
That lazy, hazy river in the noon day sun 
You can linger for a while in the shade of a tree 
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream of me 
Up a lazy river where the robin's song 
Wakes that bright new mornin' as we roll along 
There may be blue skies up above 
But as long as we're in love 
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be 
If you go up a lazy river with me</field>

The dance floor's deserted 
You play the same love song 
It's the tenth time you've heard it 
And that's the beginning 
Just one of those clues 
You've had your first lesson 
In learning the blues 
The cigarettes you light 
One after another 
Won't help you forget her 
Or the way that you love her 
You're only burning 
A torch you can't move 
But you're on the right track 
For learning the blues 
When you're at home alone 
The blues will haunt you constantly 
When you're out in a crowd 
The blues will haunt your memory 
The nights when you don't sleep 
The whole night you're crying 
But you can't forget her 
Soon you'll stop trying 
You'll walk the floor 
And wear out your shoes 
When you're feeling your heart break 
You're learning the blues</field>

How I hate going out in the storm 
But if you really hold me tight 
All the way home I'll be warm

I watched the whole thing fall 
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall 
If I'd only knew 
Days were slipping past 
That the good things would never last 
That you were crying 
Summer turned to winter 
And the snow had turned to rain 
And the rain turned into tears upon your face 
I hardly recognize the girl you are today 
And god I hope its not too late 
MM.. 
Its not too late 
'Cause you are not alone 
I'm always there with you 
And we'll get lost together 
Till the light comes pouring through 
Because when you feel like you're done 
And the darkness has won 
An' baby you're not lost 
When your world's crashing down 
And you can't bear the thought 
I said baby you're not lost 
Life can show no mercy 
It can tear your soul apart 
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy 
But you're not 
Things have seemed to change 
There's one thing that's still the same 
In my heart you have remained 
And we can fly, fly, fly away 
because you are not alone 
And I am there with you 
And we'll get lost together 
Till the light comes pouring through 
Because when you feel like you're done 
And the darkness has won 
An' baby you're not lost 
And the worlds crashing down 
And you cannot bear the cross

Lies a body oozin' life 
Someone's sneakin' round that corner 
Could that someone be Mack the Knife? 
Oh there's a tugboat down, down by the river dontcha know 
Where a cement bag's just a'drooppin' on down 
That cement's there, it's there for the weight, dear 
Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town 
Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe 
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash 
Now MacHeath spends, he spends like a sailor 
Could that boy have done somethin' rash? 
Ahhhh Jenny Diver, ho, Sukey Tawdry 
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown 
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe 
Now that Macky's back in town

My baby don't care for 
He don't care for high-tone places 
Liz Taylor is not his style 
And even Liberace's smile

Is something he can't see 
I wonder what's wrong with baby 
My baby just cares for 
My baby just cares for 
My baby just cares for me</field>

Sweet, comic valentine 
You make me smile with my heart 
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable 
yet your my favorite work of art 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, 
are you smart? 
But don't change a hair for me 
Not if you care for me 
Stay little valentine 
Stay 
Each day is valentine's day 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, 
Are you smart? 
But don't change a hair for me 
Not if you care for me 
Stay little valentine 
Stay 
Each day is Valentine's Day</field>

A pretty little face 
That face just knocks me off of my feet 
Pretty little feet, she's really sweet enough to eat 
She looks like an angel looks 
Baby, I'm hooked after just one look 
And my mind's in a kind of whirl 
Cause to my mind, she's my kind of girl 
That pretty little face 
That face just knocks me off of my feet 
Pretty little feet, she's really sweet enough to eat 
She looks like an angel looks 
Oh, I'm cooked after just one look

Cause in my mind, she's my kind of girl 
And my heart has a kind of joy 
Cause in her mind, I'm just her kind of boy</field>

But how the hell can I help it? 
When I'm thinkin' on you 
Maybe, I might get a little reckless 
But you gotta expect that 
What else can a boy do? 
My momma taught me how to share 
But I'll be selfish and I don't care 
Cause I want you, I need you all for me 
Cause I don't want anybody loving my baby 
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me, hey 
And I don't want anybody thinking just maybe 
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me 
And I know when you got a lovely lady 
It might drive the boys crazy 
When she's looking so fine, woah 
I know, know, know that no one ever would blame me 
The only thing that could save me 
Is just knowing you're mine 
My papa told me once or twice 
Don't be cruel but don't be too nice 
Cause I want you, I need you all for me 
Cause I don't want anybody loving my baby 
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me, hey 
And I don't want anybody thinking just maybe 
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me 
Hey, we make beautiful music together 
How you make my heart sing 
Move into the side with us and never be apart thing 
Work of art thing, the way you pull me 
Like a harp string 
Every moment spent is worth it 
That's the perfect part, see 
I like whatever you like, we had to do right 
And do like, two sovereign nations and try to unite 
I'm proud of you, like a treasure 
You're the one I'm cherishing 
Every other girl is silly, paling in comparison 
I know I can be a bit jealous 
But how the hell can I help it? 
I'm so in love with you

On an evening in Roma 
Do they take 'em for espresso 
Yeah, I guess so 
On each lover's arm a girl I wish I knew 
On an evening in Roma 
Though there's grining and mandolining in sunny Italy 
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down 
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa 
I am only one and that's one too few 
On an evening in Roma 
Don't know what the country's coming to 
But in Rome do as the Romans do 
Will you on an evening in Roma 
Como e' bella c'è la luna brille e' strette 
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare

Yard by yard is much harder 
Life without you baby is 
Harder 
Life without you baby is hard 
Is the moon going to shine? 
The moon's a piece of cake this time 
One step out of line 
Across my fingers it's a lucky sign 
Inch by inch is a cinch 
Yard by yard is much harder 
Life without you baby is 
Harder 
Life without you baby is hard 
 
You know the whole affair can be 
Simply 
Settled right from the start 
If we both see 
There's no chance if we dance in the dark 
Lose our way and we can't find a spark 
Take one step any time 
It's easy 
Ready get set off your mark 
One step at a time 
Ain't committing a crime 
Or parking where I don't belong. 
Inch by inch is a cinch 
And yard by yard is much harder

When they ask, I'll tell them, why...

Flash! Bam! Alakazam! 
Wonderful you came by. 
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine, 
When out of that orange-colored view 
Wam! Bam! Alakazam! 
I got a look at you. 
One look and I yelled "Timber" 
"Watch out for flying glass" 
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out, 
I went into a spin and I started to shout, 
"I've been hit, This is it, This is it!" 
I was walking along, minding my business,

I hate to stop you in your tracks, Max 
But first you gotta prove your love to me 
When you do 
I'll love you, love you, love you 
Like you want me to 
Ah, come on, relax, Max 
Your nerves are kinda bad there, boy 
Hold it 
Down, boy 
Take it easy, fool 
Relax yourself 
The evening's young yet 
Mmm, come on and relax, Max 
Relax yourself

I've been an awful good guy, 
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight. 
Santa buddy, a 65 convertible too, steel blue. 
I'll wait up for you dude, 
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight. 
Think of all the fun I've missed, 
I think of all the hotties that I never kissed, 
Next year I could be just as good, 
If you'd check off my Christmas list, 
Santa pally, I wanna yacht and really that's not a lot, 
I've been a sweetie all year, 
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight. 
Santa buddy, one thing that I really do need, the deed, 
To a platinum mine, 
Santa pally, so hurry down the chimney tonight. 
Santa buddy, fill my stocking with Canucks tix, for kicks. 
Throw me on the first line, 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight. 
Come and trim my Christmas tree, 
With some decorations bought at Mercedes, 
I really do believe in you, 
Now let's see if you believe in me 
Santa poppy, forgot to mention one little thing, cha-ching, 
No, I don't mean as alone. 
Santa buddy, so hurry down the chimney tonight, 
Hurry down the chimney tonight, 
Oh, hurry down the chimney tonight.</field>

Soon it will be Christmas day 
Strings of streetlights even stop lights blink a bright red and green 
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures 
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids rush, this is Santa's big scene 
And above all this bustle you'll hear, you can hear 
Silver bells, the corner Santa Claus, silver bells, is busy now because

I miss seeing that smile 
It's been such a long time 
And although I don't have you, 
I know now that I need to, 
Somewhow make you mine 
I won't lie, it's hard seeing you with him, 
'Cause I know he can't hold you like I can 
Someday maybe when we're old and grey, 
We could be in love once more 
Till then I won't give my love away, 
Darling, I'm forever only yours 
I remember that love song, 
I sang every word wrong 
But you didn't mind, no no 
And I'll admit that I miss you 
But only if you do 
'Cause you know that I'm shy 
And I can't lie, it's hard seeing you with her 
'Cause I know she can't love you like I can 
Someday maybe when we're old and grey 
We could be in love once more 
Till then I won't give my love away 
Darling, I'm forever only yours 
And my love, it works for you then 
We've got nothing to lose 
'Cause I'm forever only yours 
(In love once more, once more, once more) 
And no need to complicate it 
That smile is worth the wait 
Yeah, I'm forever yours 
Someday maybe 
Someday maybe 
Someday maybe, I'll be yours (woah, baby) 
Someday maybe (someday maybe) 
Someday maybe (someday maybe) 
Someday maybe (someday maybe) 
I'll be yours (someday maybe I'll be yours)

Until you think you have the time 
To spend an evening with me 
And if we go some place to dance 
I know that there's a chance 
You won't be leaving with me 
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place 
And have a drink or two 
And then I go and spoil it all 
By saying something stupid 
Like I love you 
I can see it in your eyes 
That you still despise the same old lines 
You heard the night before 
And though it's just a line to you 
For me it's true 
It never seemed so right before 
I practice every day 
To find some clever lines to say 
To make the meaning come true 
But then I think I'll wait 
Until the evening gets late 
That I'm alone with you 
The time is right 
Your perfume fills my head 
The stars get red 
And oh, the night's so blue 
And then I go and spoil it all

I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme 
I've acted out my life in stages 
With ten thousand people watching 
But we're alone now 
and I'm singin' this song for you 
I know your image of me is what I hope to be 
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see 
There's no one more important to me 
So darling can't you please see through me 
'cause we're alone now 
and I'm singin' my song for you 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth 
Withholdin' nothin' 
You came out in front and I was hiding 
But now I'm so much better 
So if my words don't come together 
Listen to the melody 'cause my love's in there hiding 
I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
I love you for my life 
'cause you're a friend of mine, and when my life is over 
remember when we were together 
We were alone 
And I was singin' my song for you 
And when my life is over 
remember when we're together 
We were alone

Can he swing, from a thread? 
Take a look overhead. 
Hey, there! There goes the Spiderman! 
In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime, 
like a streak of light, 
he arrives, just in time! 
Spiderman, Spiderman, 
friendly neighborhood Spiderman. 
Wealth and fame? He's ignored. 
Action is his reward. 
Look out! There goes the Spiderman! 
To him,

Wherever there's a hang-up, 
you'll find the Spiderman!</field>

High up in the sky the little stars climb,

You wandered down the lane and far away 
leaving me a song that will not die. 
Love is now the stardust of yesterday, 
the music of the years gone by. 
Chorus 
Sometimes I wonder why 
I spend the lonely night dreaming of a song. 
The melody haunts my reverie, 
and I am once again with you, 
when our love was new, 
and each kiss an inspiration. 
But that was long ago, 
now my consolation is in the stardust of a song. 
Beside a garden wall, when stars are bright, 
you are in my arms. 
the nightengale tells his fairy tale 
of a paradise where roses grew. 
Though I dream in vain, 
in my heart you shall remain: 
My stardust melody, the memory of love's refrain</field>

MM, it was a kiss, oh, it was a kiss 
It was, it really was such a kiss 
Oh, how she could kiss, oh, what a kiss it was 
It really was such a kiss

But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender 
How well I remember, I'll always remember 
Oh, what a night, oh, it was a night 
It was, it really was such a night 
Came the dawn and my heart and her love 
And the night was gone

            <field name="lyrics">The summer wind came blowin' in 
From across the sea 
It lingered there touched your hair 
and walked with me 
All summer long 
we sang a song 
And then we strolled on golden sand 
Two sweethearts 
and the summer wind 
Like painted kites, those days and nights 
Went flying by 
The world was new 
Beneath the bright blue 
Umbrella sky 
Then softer than 
A piper man 
One day, it called to you 
I lost you to 
The summer wind 
The autumn wind 
And the winter wind 
They have come and gone 
But still those days 
Those lonely days 
Go on and on 
And guess who sighs his lullabies 
Through nights that never end? 
My fickle friend, 
The summer wind 
Umm.. 
that summer wind. 
Warm warm summer wind 
Umm.. 
that summer wind.</field>

Only you have that magic technique

'cause I've got a plan to get us 
Straight outta here 
Start packing your bag 
Got a plane to catch 
So let's disappear 
The world keeps spinning 
And we can't stop it 
Let's slip out when no one's watching 
So, baby let's go 
Let me take you away 
Let's hit the road 
I'll be your escape 
Let's travel the globe 
We're leaving today 
A shot to the unknown 
Let me take you away! 
We don't need to go far 
To start have a start 
To change our point of view 
Gonna get you to dance 
Make some sweet romance 
Baby, it's all about you 
Take your shoes off and laugh 
It's time to relax, the sun will warm us all 
In a [?] got the [?] to drink 
We let the good times roll 
The world keeps spinning 
And we can't stop it

All it's friends 
Like moon, June, roses 
And rainbow's ends 
Down with songs 
That mourn about night and day 
Down with love 
Take it away, away 
Take it away, take it away 
Give it back to the birds 
To bees and the Viennese 
Down with eyes romantic and stupid 
Down with sighs, down with cupid 
Brother let's stuff that dove 
Take it away, take it away

I can only give you love 
that lasts forever, 
And a promise to be near each time you call. 
And the only heart I own 
For you and you alone 
That's all, 
That's all 
I can only give you country walks in springtime 
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall; 
And a love whose burning light 
Will warm the winter's night 
That's all, 
That's all. 
There are those I am sure who have told you, 
They would give you the world for a toy. 
All I have are these arms to enfold you, 
And a love time can never destroy. 
If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear, 
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small. 
Say it's me that you'll adore, 
For now and evermore 
That's all, 
That's all.

You'll find you're back 
Back in style 
But I don't know life will get better 
I am sure they know, 
Sooner or later it shows, I know

It's funny to see how easy life can be 
Just sit back and smile 
You'll find that life is worthwhile

When I'm back on top in June. 
That's life, and as funny as it may seem 
Some people get their kicks, 
Stompin' on a dream 
But I don't let it get me down, 
'Cause this fine ol' world keeps spinning around 
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, 
A poet, a pawn and a king. 
I've been up and down and over and out 
And I know one thing: 
Each time I find myself flat on my face, 
I pick myself up and get back in the race. 
That's life 
I can't deny it, 
I thought of quitting, 
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it. 
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try, 
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly 
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, 
A poet, a pawn and a king. 
I've been up and down and over and out 
And I know one thing: 
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face, 
I just pick myself up and get back in the race 
That's life 
That's life and I can't deny it 
Many times I thought of cutting out 
But my heart won't buy it 
But if there's nothing shakin' come this here july 
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die</field>

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
will find it hard to sleep tonight 
They know that Santa's on his way 
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
And every mother's child is going to be spy 
To see reindeer really know how to fly

The time for giving, the best part of living 
To celebrate with friends we hold so dear 
Well, I can feel it in the air 
All bundled head-to-toe 
Too cold to bear, it's the best time of the year 
I got my stocking, got my Christmas tree 
Got my loved ones next to me 
Well, it's almost here 
So spread some cheer 
Let's give love and get some back 
The more you give, the more you'll have 
Well the fire's bright now 
And snow comes down 
Grab your friends; hold them near 
Christmas time is here 
Every house on every corner 
Stringing up the Christmas lights 
People caroling, "Oh Christmas Tree" 
"How you shine so bright for me" 
Children 'round the world 
Shouting "Santa's on his way" 
Hoping to hear those sleigh bells 
Ringing on his sleigh 
I'm gonna wrap my arms around you tight 
On this cold December night 
Well, it's almost here 
So spread some cheer 
Let's give love and get some back 
The more you give, the more you'll have 
Well the fire's bright now 
And snow comes down 
Grab your friends; hold them near 
Christmas time is here 
I hear his sleigh and I know the big guy's on his way 
Man, I'm hoping he comes through 
I hope he brings me you 
Well, It's almost here 
So spread some cheer 
Let's give love and get some back

Hold me tight, baby 
Just give it up, baby

The fire burning in her eyes 
The chaos that controlled my mind 
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane 
Never to return again 
But always in my heart 
This love has taken its toll on me 
She said goodbye too many times before 
And Her heart is breaking in front of me 
I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye anymore 
I tried my best to feed her appetite 
Keep her coming every night 
So hard to keep her satisfied 
Kept playing love like it was just a game 
Pretending to feel the same 
Then turn around and leave again.. 
forever 
This love has taken its toll on me 
She said goodbye too many times before 
Her heart is breaking in front of me 
I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye anymore 
I'll fix these broken things 
Repair your broken wings 
And make sure everything's alright 
(it's alright, it's alright) 
My pressure on your hips 
Sinking my fingertips 
Every inch of you 
Cause I know that's what you want me to do 
This love has taken its toll on me 
She said goodbye too many times before 
Her heart is breaking in front of me 
And I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye anymore 
This love has taken its toll on me

Till then, we'll dream of what there may be 
Till then, we'll call on each memory 
Till then, till I can hold you again 
Please wait till then</field>

Try a little tenderness 
It's not just sentimental 
She has her grief

So soft and gentle 
Makes it easier 
To bear 
You won't regret it

Are also on the faces of people goin' by. 
I see friends shaking hands, saying: "How do you do?" 
They're really saying, "I love you". 
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow, 
There ain't much more, that I'll never know. 
And I think to myself,

It's out of our hands 
But for all it's worth 
I'm drawing a line in the sand 
Another morning just won't do 
I need your love to shine on through 
Or it won't be new 
Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it 
Whatever it takes my love 
To put the lonely days behind us 
I'm laying it down 
Whatever it takes my love 
If there's a chance 
For two hearts to celebrate 
To blow out some candles 
And tempt the hands of fate 
You make a wish, I'll make one too 
But close your eyes love when you do 
Or it won't come true 
Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it 
Whatever it takes my love 
To put the lonely days behind us 
I'm laying it down 
Whatever it takes, my love 
'Cos I've been wandering 'round 
With the same old blues 
That have been dragging me down 
If you feel the same way too 
Maybe it takes two 
And if we give thanks 
For our love at each new dawn 
We'll find the strength 
And the will to carry on 
The sun alone will never do 
Without your love to shine on through 
It just won't be new 
Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it 
Whatever it takes, my love 
To put the lonely days behind us 
I'm laying it down 
Whatever it takes, my love</field>

When you're not here I'm lost on an ocean 
And the night is long and always silent 
Staring at a star that never shines 
When you're not here nothing seems to matter 
All hope is gone when you're not around 
Helplessly waiting while my heart is breaking 
Everything's blue when you're not around 
When you are near me the dawn starts glowing 
Bright as a morning beneath the sun 
Yours is a love that could move a mountain 
And life is laughter when you're around 
But when you're not here the flowers don't blossom 
When you're not here I'm lost on an ocean 
And the night is long and always silent 
Staring at a star that never shines

Walking in a winter wonderland. 
Gone away is the bluebird, 
Here to stay is a new bird 
He sings a love song, 
As we stroll along, 
Walking in a winter wonderland. 
In the meadow we can build a snowman, 
Will pretend that he is Parson Brown 
He'll say: Are you ready? 
We'll say: No man, 
But you can do the job 
When you're in town. 
Later on, we'll conspire, 
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid, 
The plans that we've made, 
Walking in a winter wonderland.

A noite é de festa 
E ela veste o luar 
Me arrasta, me testa 
Se sente uma super star 
E então pergunta se eu estou em paz 
Eu digo sim, I feel wonderful tonight 
I feel wonderful tonight 
I feel wonderful because I see 
The love light in your eyes 
And the wonder of it all 
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you. 
Solo 
 
I feel wonderful because I see

Cansados de festejar 
Me deita e me abraça 
Me beija, não quer falar

See the sunrise on a tropic isle 
Just remember darlin' all the while 
You belong to me 
See the market place in Old Algiers 
Send me photographs and souvenirs 
Just remember when a dream appears 
You belong to me 
I'll be so alone without you 
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue 
Fly the ocean in a silver plane 
See the jungle when it's wet with rain 
Just remember 'til you're home again 
You belong to me 
Fly the ocean in a silver plane 
See the jungle when it's wet with rain 
Just remember 'til you're home again 
You belong to me</field>

Then you say hello 
And I can hardly speak 
My heart is beating so 
And anyone can tell 
You think you know me well 
But you don't know me 
No, you don't know the one 
Who dreams of you at night 
And longs to kiss your lips 
And longs to hold you tight 
Oh I'm just a friend 
That's all I've ever been 
'Cause you don't know me 
For I never knew 
The art of making love 
Though my heart aches 
With love for you 
Afraid and shy 
I've let my chance go by 
The chance that you might 
Love me, too 
You give your hand to me 
And then you say good-bye 
I watch you walk away 
Beside the lucky guy 
You'll never know 
The one who loves you so 
Well, you don't know me 
You give your hand to me, baby 
Then you say good-bye 
I watch you walk away 
Beside the lucky guy 
No, no, you'll never ever know 
The one who loves you so 
Well, you don't know me</field>

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Running across the meadow 
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots 
You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung 
Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful fling to be flung 
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today 
'Cause you make me feel so young 
You make me young 
You make me feel the spring has sprung 
Every time I see you grin 
I'm such a happy individual

I bet you drove those other childs wild 
And when it came to winning blue ribbons 
I bet you taught those other kids how 
I can see the judges' eyes when they handed you the prize 
You had the cutest bow 
You must've been a beautiful baby

Baby you've got a friend in me

That can happen to you

To be narrow of mind 
When you're young at heart 
You can go to extremes 
With impossible schemes 
You can laugh when your dreams 
Fall apart at the seams 
And life gets more exciting 
with each passing day 
And love is either in your heart 
Or on its way 
Don't you know 
That it's worth 
Every treasure on earth 
To be young at heart 
For as rich 
As you are 
It's much better by far to be young at heart 
And if you should survive till 105 
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive 
And here is the best part 
You have a head start 
If you are among of very young at heart 
And if you should survive to 105 
Look at all you'll derive all of being alive 
And here is the best part

            <field name="lyrics">She's taken my time. 
Convince me she's fine. 
But when she leaves I'm not so sure. 
It's always the same. 
She's playing her game. 
And when she goes I feel to blame. 
Why won't she say she needs me? 
I know she's not as strong as she seems. 
Why don't I see her cry for help? 
Why don't I feel her cry for help? 
Why don't I hear her cry for help? 
I wandered around 
The streets of this town 
Trying to find sense of it all. 
The rain on my face, 
It covers the trace 
Of all the tears I'd had to waste. 
Why must we hide emotions? 
Why must we never break down and cry? 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
Somebody please hear me cry for help. 
All I can do is cry for help. 
No need to feel ashamed 
Release the pain 
Cry for help. 
Cry for help is all I need. 
All I need is a cry for help. 
Cry for help is all I need. 
All I need is a cry for help. 
Why must we hide emotions? 
Why can't we ever break down and cry? 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
I will be there when you cry for help. 
Why don't I hear her cry for help? 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
Somebody please hear me cry for help. 
All I can do is cry for help. 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
I will be there when you cry for help. 
Is it so hard to cry for help? 
(Cry for help is all I need.) No need to feel ashamed. 
(All I need is a cry for help.) Come on and release the pain. 
(Cry for help is all I need.) Put your trust in me. 
(All I need is a cry for help.) My love is gonna set you free.

I'll bring my love to you 
I'll bring my love to you 
I've been stood up and messed around 
And taken for a fool 
But next time around 
I'm gonna change the rules 
And I don't care about the things that people say 
It's you I think about each and every day 
It's much to late for you to change your ways 
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay 
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down 
Call me, I'll be around 
* Whenever you need somebody 
I'll bring my love to you 
You don't have to say you love me 
I just wanna be with you 
Lost Inside your love is where I wanna be 
I'm just asking you to spend some time with me 
Time and time you say you wanna be free 
And you can have some fun that's ok with me 
You will never know just how good I feel 
The joy inside of me makes me feel so real 
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down 
Call me, I'll be around 
(* repeat) 
I'll bring my love to you 
I just wanna be with you 
It's much to late for you to change your ways

It's only myself that I'm hurting 
If I don't try, if I don't try 
When it feels like all my hopes and dreams are shattered into dust 
I remember the only that I have to do is trust 
And you know I got to try 
Even though my heart is on the line 
And even if I'm broken on the inside 
There's nothing I won't do to make it right 
You know, you know I got to try 
Even if I'm stopped at every turn 
Even if I lose it, crash and burn 
I won't quit until your love I've earned 
You know, you know I got to try 
We don't need anyone to tell us this is golden 
I can see that there are diamonds in your eyes tonight 
Don't need anyone to tell us to [?] open 
We'll open up, we'll open up our wings and fly 
Even though our hearts are on the line 
And even if we're broken on the inside 
There's nothing I won't do to win this fight 
You know, you know we got to try 
Even if we're stopped at every turn 
Even if we lose it, crash and burn 
We won't quit until our love we've earned 
You know, you know we've got to try</field>

Wanna stay inside my dreams 
Sometimes I feel like I am breaking up 
Do you know just how that feels

I need the people that I really love 
To only give me truth 
Don't fake, I can't take it 
My heart is close to breaking 
It reminds me of my youth 
Hope is for the hopeful 
It's a dream that never fades 
Faith is for the faithful 
And I will now be 
And I got angels on my side 
I got angels flying high

Don't say goodbye, girl (goodbye, girl) 
Don't make me cry, girl (cry, girl) 
'Cos I love you (love you) 
Used to have such fun 
Used to have good times 
But now those days are gone 
Used to have it all 
Used to get on fine 
But things just went wrong 
Used to be in love 
Thought we had it made 
But everything has changed 
We just grew apart 
No one is to blame 
** Woh, time has made us strangers 
Maybe we can't go on 
But if love can take the changes 
* Don't say goodbye, girl 
Goodbye, girl 
Don't throw it all away 
'Cos I love you 
Yes I do (yes I do) 
Don't make me cry, girl 
You're my girl 
Don't say goodbye to me 
'Cos I love you 
Yes I do (yes I do) 
We could go along 
Saying things were fine 
But we're just fooling ourselves 
Maybe we should 
Talk it out right now 
And put things on the line 
Everyone in love 
Goes through times like these 
It's just part of the game 
I remember 
I used to call your name 
Woh, things don't have to be this way 
Love is the answer now 
Maybe we could start again today 
(* repeat) 
Don't say goodbye, girl 
Goodbye, girl 
Don't say goodbye, girl 
Goodbye, girl 
Don't say goodbye, girl 
Goodbye, girl 
Don't say goodbye, girl 
Goodbye, girl

Goodbye, girl 
Don't throw it all away

Don't make me cry, girl 
'Cos you're my girl" 
I couldn't live without you, no

Don't say goodbye, girl 
Goodbye, girl 
I want to spend my life with you

Lately I've been sleeping 
Far too long in bed 
I've been dreaming of you lover 
Oh the things inside my head 
I don't want to wake up 
I'm scared to break the spell 
Oh I'm sleeping like a baby 
I hope you sleep so well 
You know I'm hoping, hoping

I know there's a dream for us, 
We're gonna find

I know there's a dream for us 
I believe it's true 
In a word, love you 
And I'm hoping our dream comes true 
You know I'm hoping, hoping 
Miracles and moonbeams, wishes on a star 
These are things I dream of, I know it sounds bizarre 
I see familiar faces, or is it dÃ©jÃ  vu 
The one recurring vision 
Is a dream I have of you 
You know I'm hoping, hoping

Come on now baby

When you find someone you find someone you love 
You know you can't believe it 
When you find someone you know you can't deceive it 
Your love takes you high 
I know there's a dream for us 
I'm sure there's a dreams for us

How can you turn and walk away 
Leaving me here with things to say 
How can you stand and watch me fall 
Don't you feel no love at all 
I only want to say to you 
That it would break your Papa's heart 
For him to hear the things you say 
When we could make a brand new start

Will you hold me in your arms or let me go 
Cause I want to show the world how much I know 
That I love you

How do I know you'll always stay 
You're changing your mind most every day 
I'm telling you girl don't push too far no 
Just who do you think you are

That it would break your Mama's heart 
For her to hear the things you say 
When we could make a brand new start

Oh I love you so 
Are you ready, for a guy like me 
Come on baby, I'm on bended knee 
Are you ready to be loved by me again

That it would break my loving heart 
For me to see the things you do 
When we could make a brand new start

Oh my whole life's a mess

I'm holding on to something pure

Feel the beat love 
All you've gotta do is dance

Skip in his stride 
What a beautiful day 
And along comes a cracker 
With a gun in his hand 
Beelzebub knows he's got to save this man

They don't have enough to eat 
Mothers wait for days to end 
A hopeless situation they can't mend 
Is it good for you? 
Is it good for me? 
I don't know how the world can sleep 
It's just not right to close the door turn out the light

They'd better be the ones you love 
The children ought to get some love 
If no-one else should get enough 
They'd better be the ones you love 
Daddy waits there in line 
A little work he hopes to find 
Something wrong with times like these 
It's enough to bring a man down to his knees 
Is it good for you? 
Is it good for me? 
I don't know how the world can sleep 
It's just not right to close the door turn out the light

Oh yeah baby, oh now girl, oh now lover 
Gonna stake my claim, gonna stand my ground 
Gonna love you while the world spins around 
Gonna be with you for the rest of my days 
And nothing's gonna stand in be way 
Cos I want you baby, I need you baby 
I want to feel your body close to mine 
I mean it baby, believe me baby 
I know it to be true, 'cos 
(Chorus) 
Every time you go away 
I kick myself, and then I say 
I'm a fool to let you go 
Understand I need you so 
Every time you go away 
I can't believe it then I say 
I'm a fool to let you go 
You're the one I need to know 
Ooh now baby, ooh now lover 
Gonna lift you up, make you feel alright 
I'm gonna make you whole tonight 
Gonna make you close 
I'm gonna keep you near 
I'll love you for a thousand years and 
I want you baby, I need you baby

Oh I know, that you're the one I need to know 
When the night are long 
You know I'll be right here, I'll chase away your fears 
And the days are so grey 
You know you'll find me here, anyway 
Gonna hold you tonight, every time you go away 
Gonna hold you tonight, I kick myself and then I say 
Gonna hold you tonight, I'm a fool to let you go 
Gonna hold you tonight, You're the one I need to know

I've lost my way, now I'm so confused

All my dreams are far behind me 
They don't matter anymore 
I don't care about the things I could lose

Now the one who always played it safe 
Becomes another who's lost his way 
I can't believe it, though I know it's true

And all my dreams begin to blind me 
And I was so confused 
And I don't care about the things I could lose

To hopelessly fall, oh yeah

Lately I've been sleeping 
Far too long in bed 
I've been dreaming of you lover 
Oh the things inside my head 
I don't want to wake up 
I'm scared to break the spell 
Oh I'm sleeping like a baby 
I hope you sleep so well 
You know I'm hoping, hoping 
(Bridge) 
I know there's a dream for us 
I know there's a dream for us 
I know there's a dream for us, 
Been on our minds 
I know there's a dream for us 
I know there's a dream for us 
I know there's a dream for us, 
We're gonna find 
(Chorus) 
I know there's a dream for us 
I believe it's true 
In a word, love you 
And I'm hoping our dream comes true 
You know I'm hoping, hoping 
Miracles and moonbeams, wishes on a star 
These are things I dream of, I know it sounds bizarre 
I see familiar faces, or is it dÃ©jÃ  vu 
The one recurring vision 
Is a dream I have of you 
You know I'm hoping, hoping 
(Repeat bridge) 
Come on now baby 
(Repeat chorus) 
When you find someone you find someone you love 
You know you can't believe it 
When you find someone you know you can't deceive it 
Your love takes you high 
I know there's a dream for us 
I'm sure there's a dreams for us

How can you turn and walk away 
Leaving me here with things to say 
How can you stand and watch me fall 
Don't you feel no love at all 
I only want to say to you 
That it would break your Papa's heart 
For him to hear the things you say 
When we could make a brand new start 
(Chorus) 
Will you hold me in your arms or let me go 
Cause I want to show the world how much I know 
That I love you 
And I only want to be with you 
How do I know you'll always stay 
You're changing your mind most every day 
I'm telling you girl don't push too far no 
Just who do you think you are 
I only want to say to you 
That it would break your Mama's heart 
For her to hear the things you say 
When we could make a brand new start 
(Repeat chorus two times) 
Oh I love you so 
Are you ready, for a guy like me 
Come on baby, I'm on bended knee 
Are you ready to be loved by me again 
I only want to say to you 
That it would break my loving heart 
For me to see the things you do 
When we could make a brand new start 
Yes we could make a brand new start

Behind the smile that I portray 
I am saddened every day 
My eyes are sore with endless nights of crying 
I hope that you don't feel this way 
My heart fills with tears when you pass me by 
You won't look me in the eye 
Don't you think that it's a crying shame 
We must play these silly games 
The pain in my heart that shows we're apart 
Is growing stronger day by day 
(Repeat chorus) 
If you think that I have done you wrong 
I won't try to change your mind 
But try to think of the love that we once had 
And maybe things won't seem so bad 
The memories of those times are vivid in my mind 
And yet they slip away as time goes on 
Take me back tonight 
Hold me close and tight 
Forever I will be true 
Behind the smiles that we portray 
There is nothing hidden away 
Our eyes are sore because we are crying 
I hope we'll always feel this way.</field>

The rain is beatin' down on me 
I feel like I'm gettin' cold feet 
Now I know it's sink or swim 
Put my color up to the wind 
I'm just waitin' 
For my chance to dance with you 
A chance to dance with you 
I'm just waitin' 
For my chance to dance with you, woo 
Let's dance to your heart beat 
Let's dance till my feet bleed 
Let's dance to your heart beat 
Over and over 
Let's dance to your heart beat 
Let's dance to the same song on repeat 
The same song on repeat 
I'm just waiting 
For my chance to dance with you 
I'm just waitin' 
For my chance to dance with you 
A chance to dance with you 
I'm just waitin' 
For my chance to dance with you, woo 
I'm just waitin' 
For my chance to dance with you 
A chance to dance with you 
I'm just waitin' 
For my chance to dance with you, woo

Keep me waitin'

Waitin' for my chance to dance with you</field>

Why do stars fall down from the sky,

On the day that you were born, 
The angels got together, 
An' decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled mood dust in your hair of gold 
An' starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why, all the boys in town, 
Follow you, all around,

            <field name="lyrics">She's taken my time. 
Convince me she's fine. 
But when she leaves I'm not so sure. 
It's always the same. 
She's playing her game. 
And when she goes I feel to blame. 
Why won't she say she needs me? 
I know she's not as strong as she seems. 
Why don't I see her cry for help? 
Why don't I feel her cry for help? 
Why don't I hear her cry for help? 
I wandered around 
The streets of this town 
Trying to find sense of it all. 
The rain on my face, 
It covers the trace 
Of all the tears I'd had to waste. 
Why must we hide emotions? 
Why must we never break down and cry? 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
Somebody please hear me cry for help. 
All I can do is cry for help. 
No need to feel ashamed 
Release the pain 
Cry for help. 
Cry for help is all I need. 
All I need is a cry for help. 
Cry for help is all I need. 
All I need is a cry for help. 
Why must we hide emotions? 
Why can't we ever break down and cry? 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
I will be there when you cry for help. 
Why don't I hear her cry for help? 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
Somebody please hear me cry for help. 
All I can do is cry for help. 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
I will be there when you cry for help. 
Is it so hard to cry for help? 
(Cry for help is all I need.) No need to feel ashamed. 
(All I need is a cry for help.) Come on and release the pain. 
(Cry for help is all I need.) Put your trust in me. 
(All I need is a cry for help.) My love is gonna set you free.

Meets the devil with a broken heart 
He says 
I've been let down by the armies of darkness 
Oh my whole life's a mess 
And god says 
I've got the cure 
I'm holding on to something pure 
I've got the cure for you 
All you gotta do is dance 
Pick your feet up 
All you gotta do is dance 
Feel the beat love 
All you've gotta do is dance 
Dance with me 
Now the devil thanks god and he's on his way 
Skip in his stride 
What a beautiful day 
And along comes a cracker 
With a gun in his hand 
Beelzebub knows he's got to save this man 
And the devil says 
I've got the cure 
I'm holding on to something pure 
I've got the cure for you 
All you gotta do is dance 
Pick your feet up 
All you gotta do is dance 
Feel the beat love 
All you've gotta do is dance 
Dance with me 
All you gotta do is dance 
Pick your feet up 
All you gotta do is dance 
Feel the beat love 
All you've gotta do is dance 
Dance with me 
The trees became a multitude of angels 
Singing out like a gospel choir 
And the benches in the park rose up 
To become their chariots of fire 
Oh fire 
Fire 
Yeah 
They rose up 
They rose up 
To become their chariots of fire 
And god says 
All you gotta do is dance 
Pick your feet up 
All you gotta do is dance 
Feel the beat love 
All you've gotta do is dance 
Dance with me 
All you gotta do is dance 
Pick your feet up 
All you gotta do is dance 
Feel the beat love 
All you've gotta do is dance

If you ever wake up feeling blue 
You know there's always someone 
Who'll be right here for you 
If there's any little thing 
That's gonna get you down 
Don't be afraid, I'll always be around

So just you hush now, child 
I'll bring my love to you 
Dial my number

Just call me up, girl 
And I'll make your dreams come true 
If you're ever lonely and need some company 
Don't ever hesitate if you wanna be with me 
Pick up the phone 
And dial my number

I'll be over in a while 
So just you hush now, child 
I'll bring my love to you 
Dial my number

And I'll make your dreams come true 
Giving up my time for something that I've heard 
I need to hear those words I'm in love

Don't say goodbye, girl (goodbye, girl) 
Don't make me cry, girl (cry, girl) 
'Cos I love you (love you) 
Used to have such fun 
Used to have good times 
But now those days are gone 
Used to have it all 
Used to get on fine 
But things just went wrong 
Used to be in love 
Thought we had it made 
But everything has changed 
We just grew apart 
No one is to blame 
** Woh, time has made us strangers 
Maybe we can't go on 
But if love can take the changes 
* Don't say goodbye, girl 
Goodbye, girl 
Don't throw it all away 
'Cos I love you 
Yes I do (yes I do) 
Don't make me cry, girl 
You're my girl 
Don't say goodbye to me 
'Cos I love you 
Yes I do (yes I do) 
We could go along 
Saying things were fine 
But we're just fooling ourselves 
Maybe we should 
Talk it out right now 
And put things on the line 
Everyone in love 
Goes through times like these 
It's just part of the game 
I remember 
I used to call your name 
Woh, things don't have to be this way 
Love is the answer now 
Maybe we could start again today 
(* repeat) 
Don't say goodbye, girl 
Goodbye, girl

Don't make me cry, girl 
'Cos you're my girl" 
I couldn't live without you, no

Don't say goodbye, girl 
Goodbye, girl 
I want to spend my life with you

And look right through 
And what you get for just one night 
To show them all you got some fight in you 
The fight's still in you

Let's go back to when we were winning 
Is there a chance, a chance to start over 
'Cause I got to believe that you and me 
Can go back to the start and fill your empty heart 
'Cause I got to believe 
That you and me, that you and me 
Can go back to the start 
And fill your empty heart 
I gave you love 
I gave you blood 
I gave it all 
But your heart is empty 
Round and round and round we go 
Hoping for a chance to join the show 
Will you let me know 
What I get for just one night 
To show them all I got some fight in me

I'm holding on, I'm hanging on 
I know that I can be so strong for you, yeah you

To do what I want, say what I want,

I don't believe that you need me 
So don't say you do 
There aint no reason for staying 
We both know we are through 
So don't try to stop me now 
'Cos all we had has gone 
(All we had has gone) 
So listen to what I say 
'Cos these feelings are oh so strong 
I'm giving up on love 
'Cos I've been hurt before 
Giving up on love 
And I don't want you no more 
I'm giving up on love 
'Cos I've been hurt before 
Giving up on love 
And I don't want you no more 
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love 
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love 
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love 
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love 
So don't try to stop me now 
'Cos all we had has gone 
(All we had has gone) 
So listen to what I say 
'Cos these feelings are oh so strong

I don't want to be your lover 
Last night I heard you creeping 
I was almost sleeping 
When I heard you come home 
You knew I loved you madly 
And I would gladly 
Do anything for you 
You climbed the stairs to Heaven 
But you may never climb those steps again 
You thought you'd be forgiven 
But I was driven to make you understand 
I don't want to be your lover 
When there's another lover in your head 
I don't want to be your lover 
When there's another lover in your bed 
Tell me how you could do it 
Why put me through it 
When you said you'd be true 
You said that it was nothing 
But it was something 
And sometimes that's enough 
So climb the stairs to Heaven 
But you may never climb those steps again 
You thought you'd be forgiven 
But I was driven to make you understand 
I don't want to be your lover 
When there's another lover in your head 
I don't want to be your lover 
When there's another lover in your bed 
(Instrumental)

Me, I'm just a simple guy 
And no matter how hard I try

You may be the woman I love

Heaven knows, I do the best that I can 
I'll never let you down 
I'll be there whenever you need me 
I'll never let you down 
Come what my way 
Me, I'll be a shoulder to cry on 
I'll be someone you can rely on 
And maybe you may see just how I feel 
We may be so far apart 
But you still know I've got a hungry heart 
We must be patient, it won't last forever 
It won't be long until we're together 
I'll never let you down 
I'll be there whenever you need me 
I'll never let you down 
I'll be strong, I'll show you how love can be 
I'll never let you down 
Come what my way 
We must be patient, it won't last forever 
It won't be long until we're together

I know that love could 
realign the phases of the moon 
Yet it comes and goes like 
a wave of a stranger 
And as we stumble for the truth 
we're caught in a web of lies 
Is nothing worth a damn 
without the danger 
We're lost in a world 
of illusive dreams 
Where every story 
has a desperate ring 
(Chorus) 
We got a right to happiness 
in the name of love 
And though sometimes 
we may forget to 
give it all we possess 
We gotta try for what 
we get in the name of love 
And without pause or regret 
searching only for the best 
We could see the light unfold 
right before our eyes 
Blinded by the tears 
we get lost in the shadows 
Oh but the heart 
is a wondrous thing 
Surviving the thunder 
outlasting the rain 
(Repeat chorus) 
Oh but the heart 
is a wondrous thing 
Surviving the thunder 
outlasting the rain

Tell me if your love for me is real

Is this the real thing 
Is this really love 
Can it be the right thing 
I was born in a prison there was no way out

You don't know the kind of mess I'm in 
Nobody else is going to save my skin but 
You have got the key to set me free 
If you want my love then rescue me

I Know It's Hard To See 
Why Things Aint Going Your Way, Baby 
And Everyone You Know 
Seems To Get The Breaks You Don't 
And The Words To The Songs That You Sing 
Aint The Right Ones Baby No 
And The Grass Is The Wrong Shade Of Green 
Or So It Seems 
Don't Break It Up 
Don't Shake It Up 
Just Turn It On, Got To Keep It Turned On 
Don't Burn It Out 
Don't Sell It Out 
Just Turn It On, Got To Keep It Turned On 
Turn It On 
Got To Understand 
Life Is What You Make It Baby 
No Time To Sit Around 
Think Of The Mistakes You Made 
Well It's Not What You Had 
It's What You Have Right Here Baby 
And It's Not Who You Know 
It's What You Know Deep Down Inside.</field>

I saw my daddy crying at the steering wheel 
And oh, it made me feel so scared 
Then there was joy 
Found my religion, swimming in a choir of voices 
And oh, I knew that I'd been spared 
That I'd be saved some sunny day 
Saved from throwing my life away 
That I'd be saved some sunny day 
From throwing my life, throwing my life away 
Keep singing, woah, I keep singing 
Praising to the heavens with my voice ringing 
Keep singing, woah, I keep singing 
Clap to the beat till my hands are stinging 
And I'd be saved some sunny day 
From throwing my life, throwing my life away 
And now I understand 
I'm a wide-eyed father, and blessed are the children 
Oh, our greatest reward 
And with these hands 
I'll move a mountain, build a castle to keep you safe 
Of this you know you can be sure 
And you'll be saved some sunny day 
Saved from throwing your life away 
And you'll be saved some sunny day 
From throwing your life 
Keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Praising to the heavens with your voices ringing 
Keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Clap to the beat til your hands are stinging 
And you'll be saved some sunny day 
From throwing your life, throwing your life away 
Who do you love? 
When it all comes down to truth 
Who do you love? 
When it all comes back to you 
Who do you love? 
When you're lying in your bed 
Who do you love? 
Who do you love? 
Keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing 
And you'll be saved some sunny day 
From throwing your life, throwing your life away

It's no fool's gold so we're after it

No time, it just won't wait

We got a lot to learn 
We don't know which way to turn 
But we're learning and we're turning 
This ship around 
Can't see wood for the plastic trees 
I should be down, should be on my knees 
But I know, there's something good 
I trust in our connection 
Trust me with your protection 
I know, this is something good 
We got a lot to learn 
We don't know which way to turn 
But we're learning and we're turning

Staring At The Ceiling, Wish I Was Somewhere Else Instead 
Enough Said

Can't Stand To Look At These Four Walls

I Have Found 
I Can't Stand The Silence, Can't You Make A Sound

I See Your Body Language, Telling Me You Think It's Over 
Before It's Over 
Let's Go Out Tonight 
Can't Stand To Look At These Four Walls 
Let's Go Out Tonight 
Let's Go Out Tonight 
I'll Do Anything At All 
Let's Go Out Tonight 
You Say We've Got To Get Away 
We've Outgrown This Town It's So Mundane 
But If You're Asking Me 
The Chance Is There But We're Never Gonna Leave 
Never Gonna Leave.</field>

So I reach out for the switch butwhy pretend 
'Cause I can't turn the lights out now 
I see your face 
No, I can't turn the lights out now 
my heart will break 
'Cause everithing I see will end up killing me 
All over, al over again 
So I can't turn the lights out 
turn the lights out 
There's a clock that stopped ticking by the bed 
The second you were gone 
And it feels just like my heart stopped beating too 
'Cause it's hard too keep those promisses 
I made when I was strng 
And I'm haunted by the ghost of you 
And I can't turn the lights out now 
I see your face 
No, I can't turn the lights out now 
My heart will break 
'Cause everithing I see will end up killing me 
All over, all over again

It's so hard holding on 
It's so hard that you're gone 
It's so hard holding on

No, I can't turn the lights out now

For a girl with her head in the clouds

To stand on her own two feet 
It aint easy

Tries to hide the secret of last night

Feels like time to break the chains 
I wont be fooled again

Gonna take what's mine 
I'm gonna move right out 
Gonna take my time 
Gonna keep my pride 
Gonna move right out yeah

But I believe I'm not to blame 
When we touch its by mistake 
Tenderness she just can't fake 
Who does she think I am

My arms keep missing you

Come back today 
You said you wouldn’t hurt me any way 
And I believed in you 
We said we trust each other every day 
We’d never be untrue 
But I keep thinking you’re telling lies

Everybody needs a woman in their life 
A mother or a sister, a man may need a wife 
If you have a woman in your life 
Don't take her for granted you'll regret it by and by 
(Chorus) 
Don't use her or abuse her, or you'll lose her 
She filled with emotion, strong as the sea 
Deep as an ocean, and she'll always be 
So high on her feelings, high on my list 
She's everything, she is nature's gift 
Give her the attention that she's worthy of 
Show her some respect 
And don't take advantage of the fact that she loves you 
(Repeat chorus) 
Mother nature gave us 
Mother nature gave us this creation 
Mother nature gave us 
Mother nature gave us this creation 
Someone you can count on, 
She'll always be there whenever you need her 
(Repeat chorus) 
Weary from giving so much of herself 
Never complaining, always seems 
So high on her feeling, so high on my list 
She's everything she is nature's gift.</field>

At Least It Started Out That Way 
Two Ordinary People 
Sharing Thoughts At The End Of The Day 
Was It The Wine That Made Her Sparkle Made Her Shine 
I Crossed That Line It Was Only Meant To Be 
A One Night Stand 
Here I Am With Empty Hands 
Wasn't Looking For Love And I Knew From The Start 
It Was A One Night Stand 
She Was Only Passing Through 
But It Suited Me Just Fine 
Emotional Attachment Never Crossed My Mind 
Was It The Light That Played A Trick On My Mind 
I Crossed That Line It Was Only Meant To Be 
She Was Only Passing Through.</field>

I patiently take aim 
I've got you in the crosshair 
Never gonna hurt me or anybody else again 
Yes you rule the world for now 
You do 
Yes you rule the world for now 
Yes you rule the world 
You and all your money 
Yes you rule the world for now 
I'm starting with you 
And then I'll take the room to pieces 
To pieces I'm starting with you 
Then I'll take the room to pieces 
To pieces 
To pieces 
Prowling through the city 
I need someone to blame 
Tomorrow's headline news 
You'll all know my name 
Yes you rule the world for now 
You do 
Yes you rule the world for now 
Yes you rule the world 
You and all your money 
Yes you rule the world for now 
I'm starting with you 
And then I'll take the room to pieces 
To pieces 
I'm starting with you 
Then I'll take the room to pieces 
To pieces 
I'll put away my crossbow 
So empty all your guns 
Maybe there's another way 
To get things done 
Yes they rule the world for now 
They do 
Yes they rule the world for now 
But we can take the air 
They can keep their money 
Yes we rule the world for now 
If we choose to 
I'm starting with you 
And then we'll find a place where peace is 
I'm starting with you 
And then I'll build a place 
Where peace is 
Where peace is 
I'll find a place where peace is</field>

Easier lessons for leaving

I thought it was you, but my hopes were washed away 
I picked up the telephone, it sent a shiver down my spine 
I wanted to hear your voice, and talk about old times 
(Chorus) 
Remember the days when we walked 
The times that we talked for hours and hours 
Remember the way it used to be, just you and me 
Remember the days 
Think it over what I say 
I know it could be just like it used to be 
Do you believe it baby, do you share my point of view 
You know that I mean it baby, and all you have to do is 
(Repeat chorus) 
What can I do without you, how can I live without you 
The day's gonna come, when I'm on the run 
So I'm begging you baby please 
Remember the days

What can I do without you, how can I live without you 
So come on girl I'm begging you please 
Come on and talk to me 
The times that we walked 
The days that we used to walk out in the park 
Remember how it used to be 
Do you remember, do you remember how good it used to be 
Come on girl, I said come on girl

There's a girl I've been waiting to see 
And I really get the feeling that she likes me

I've got to tell you what I've heard 
She don't want no wild romance 
When she's with me she only wants to dance 
She wants to dance with me 
'Cos I'll hold her so tight next to me 
She wants to dance with me 
'Cos I'll let her be what she wants to be 
Now I know I've been out of touch 
And I never meant to hurt my baby oh so much 
'Cos I love her and I think she love me 
And that's the way it's got to be 
When we're together we never fight 
We've got better things to do tonight 
She wants to dance with me 
'Cos I'll hold her so tight next to me

I bought a ticket for the train 
I waited all day long 
but the train never came 
And I was so glad 
I was so glad 
The train never came 
The reason I was leaving 
Was all because of sin 
I didn't want to do it 
but I was sucked in 
And I was so sad 
I was so bad 
I didn't go home 
I was out with the boys 
Drinking all night 
Gambling all my money 
Got into a fight 
And I cried for my baby 
But my baby never came 
Sirens were a wailing 
and I stepped off of the train 
I picked up my bags 
And started down the road 
The night was drawing in now 
and I was getting cold 
And I was so glad 
I was so glad 
she was still home 
I'll never go out with the boys 
Drinking all night 
I'm saving all my money 
Never getting in a fight 
And I'll stay with my baby 
Never leaving her alone 
I'm keeping outta trouble 
So I'll be staying at home 
I'll be so glad 
we're both still home 
We're both still home 
We're both still home 
Staying at home 
Staying at home 
We're both still home.</field>

They set the wheels in motion Adam and Eve 
The beginning of romance 
He was a lonely man I do believe 
So he thought he'd take a chance 
I know just how he was feeling 
He'd been advised not to fall 
But when his senses were reeling 
That man he wanted it all 
Honey this is some kinda love 
You are my sweet temptation 
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love 
Like a moth to a flame all you gotta do is call my name 
I'll come running to you 
I was a lonely man until you came 
Life was black life was blue 
Without a word being spoken 
I saw you then I knew 
Now my defences are broken 
There's not a thing I can do 
Honey this is some kinda love 
You are my sweet temptation 
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love oh baby 
Honey this is some kinda love 
We're just one step from heaven 
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love 
Oh girl there's a fire in my soul 
I'm just burning for you 
Oh girl I'm out of control 
Tell me can you feel it too 
I'm burning up I'm burning up 
There's a fire in my soul 
I'm burning up I'm burning up 
For you 
Honey this is some kinda love 
You are my sweet temptation 
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love 
Honey this is some kinda love 
We're just one step from heaven 
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love

Peace and quiet and open air

With time to spare 
Time to look 
Time to care 
Someday 
Somewhere 
We'll find a new way of living 
We'll find a way of forgiving 
Somewhere 
There's a place for us 
A time and place for us 
Hold my hand 
And we're halfway there 
Hold my hand 
And I'll take you there 
Somehow

Times are hard, that's for sure 
Lovers need to love a little more 
Everybody's got to do their best 
You can't complain 
If you settle for less 
And I know it's hard for you 
To do the things that you want to do 
But every day can get a little better 
If you rise up, stand up 
And stick together 
* Stop breaking your heart 
Don't fall apart 
We're gonna build this thing together 
Stop breaking your heart 
This is the start 
We're gonna make it last forever 
We're gonna build this thing together 
Now 
I believe in you for sure 
People need to learn 
To trust a little more 
Everybody's got a chip on their shoulder 
Just because they feel a little older 
I know it's got to be 
So much better, wait and see 
Hold on for a little longer 
Gonna rise up, stand up 
And we'll be stronger 
( * Repeat 2 times ) 
Come on 
We're gonna build this thing together 
Now 
Build it up, build it up 
Build it up, build it up 
Every night people fight 
I'm askin' you do you think that's right 
I believe that the feeling's there 
But the people are unaware, yeah 
And I know it's hard for you 
To do the things that you want to do 
But everything can get a little better 
If you rise up, stand up 
And stick together now 
( * Repeat 2 times ) 
Now (Stop breaking your heart) 
Oh now, yeah 
We're gonna build it up 
We're gonna build it up 
We're gonna build this thing together 
Build it up 
We're gonna build it up 
We're gonna build this thing together

When we were out dancing the other night 
You almost got me into another fight 
You always want to prove you've got the touch, baby 
To make all the other guys want you so much 
But if you ever do that to me 
Just one more time 
I swear to you that I will blow 
And baby that's 
(Chorus) 
The bottom line 
The bottom line 
If you really love me like you say 
Wouldn't keep on hurting me this way 
You always turn away when I call your name 
And baby things just stay the same 
So if you ever do that to me 
Just one more time 
I swear to you that I will blow 
And baby that's 
(Repeat chorus) 
Here we go 
You've got to believe it's over 
You've got to believe it's true 
You've got to believe it's over

You've got to believe it's over 
You've got to believe it's true 
You've got to believe it's over 
And we're through 
The bottom line 
The bottom line 
The bottom line 
All that you have ever done for me 
Is show just how rotten life can be 
But this has taught me one thing that's for sure yeah 
I'll never let that girl back through my door 
And if she ever does that to me 
Just one more time 
I swear to you that I will blow 
And baby that's

The stories of the old days 
The 6 wives of Henry 
Origin into the center

And how I believed the stories that they told me 
'Cause I'm a believer 
I believe in the stories from the songs 
From the old days 
Believer 
I believe in the world that they told me existed 
On the vinyl and the tapes and from the Cd players 
That came later, so much later than the good old days 
Down a yellow brick road 
I drive a yellow taxi to a yellow submarine 
Just for fun, a super triple sign for me 
A full [?] banquet or a night at the opera 
For all it's worth, the place of my birth 
Was the music that my brothers and my sister played to me

When the words and music play 
When the records took me away 
Yeah someone save my life every single night 
I just listen to the music 
To the words in the music 
To the words in the music 
Listen to the words in the music 
Friends and the music 
Listen to the words and the music, music 
Music, music, music, music

The love has gone 
The love has gone, will we ever be the same 
The feelings wrong, the joy has turned to pain 
Wake up beside you, and hear you breathing 
And I can feel you in my arms 
No one can know just how I'm feeling 
Knowing that our love can come to no harm 
But as I open my eyes 
Then I start to realise 
That you're gone and I can't go on 
The love has gone, will we ever be the same 
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain 
The love is gone, will we ever be the same 
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain 
What have I done girl, to make you leave me 
Didn't I love you for all those years 
If you open your eyes 
Baby, then you'll realise 
That you're wrong, and I can't go on 
You know I can't go on 
The love has gone, will we ever be the same 
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain 
The love is gone, will we ever be the same 
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain 
Nothing will ever come between us 
If you will just take me back once more 
I'll show you just how much I love you 
If you'll just come walking through that door 
The love has gone, will we ever be the same 
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain 
The love is gone, will we ever be the same 
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain

Children cry on the street 
They don't have enough to eat 
Mothers wait for days to end 
A hopeless situation they can't mend 
Is it good for you? 
Is it good for me? 
I don't know how the world can sleep 
It's just not right to close the door turn out the light 
(Chorus) 
They'd better be the ones you love 
The children ought to get some love 
If no-one else should get enough 
They'd better be the ones you love 
Daddy waits there in line 
A little work he hopes to find 
Something wrong with times like these 
It's enough to bring a man down to his knees 
Is it good for you? 
Is it good for me? 
I don't know how the world can sleep 
It's just not right to close the door turn out the light 
(Repeat chorus)

The winds of march that make my heart a dancer 
A telephone that rings but whos to answer?

When I was much younger 
It used to happen every night 
I had a dream about a city dressed in lights 
And there were friends of mine 
I saw them time after time 
But I never knew their names 
And darling I swear 
I saw you there 
I know it sounds insane 
Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy 
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me 
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here 
Must be something went right 
I just know when you're near 
(Chorus) 
This must be heaven 
Have I found it what I've been looking for 
This must be heaven 
Have I finally stumbled through the door 
How could I have doubted 
I guess I must have lost my place 
You turned on the light 
And I saw my life 
Reflected in your face 
Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy oh yeah 
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me 
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here 
Must be something went right 
I just know when you're near 
(Repeat chorus) 
And I always knew that there was something more 
Come closer to me now 
You fill me up I'm overflowing 
Come closer to me now 
Come hold me tight and don't let go 
(Repeat chorus) 
You fill me up girl 
You fill me up and I'm overflowing 
This must be heaven 
Have I found what I've been living for 
This must be heaven 
Have I finally stumbled through the door 
This must be heaven 
Have I found what I've been looking for 
This must be heaven 
And I always knew that there were something more.</field>

Every day I miss you 
All those long and lonely nights 
Counting the hours till I'm with you

Praying I'm not wrong 
Hoping that our love is still strong

Keep our love alive 
Hope you're satisfied 
Till you're right here by my side 
And the hands on the clock 
Going round and round and round 
But time don't seem to be moving at all 
Every minute you were on my mind 
Every day I wrote you 
Half of me is lost in time 
Half of me is always with you 
Till then 
I'll keep holding on 
Praying I'm not wrong 
Hoping that our love is still strong

Keep our love alive 
Hope you're satisfied 
Till you're right here by my side 
And the hands on the clock 
Going round and round and round 
But time don't seem to be moving at all 
Another ticket for another trip 
To another destination (destination) 
It's just the thought of you that keeps me strong 
Moving in the right direction

I can see that there are diamonds in your eyes tonight 
Don't need anyone to tell us to [?] open

paint your palette blue and grey 
Look out on a summers day 
with eyes that know the darkness in my soul 
Shadows on the hills 
sketch the trees and the daffodills 
Catch the breeze and the winter chills 
in colors on the snowy linen land 
Now I understand 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen 
They did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now 
Starry Starry Night, 
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 
Swirling clouds in violet haze 
reflect in Vincents eyes of china blue. 
Colors changing hue. 
Morning fields of amber grain, 
Weathered faces lined in pain 
are soothed beneath the artists loving hand 
Now i understand 
What you tried to say to me 
and how you suffered for your sanity 
and how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen 
They did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now. 
For they could not love you, 
but still your love was true 
and when no hope was left in sight 
on that Starry,Starry night 
you took your life as lovers often do. 
But I could've told you Vincent, 
this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you</field>

Sometimes get the feeling that it's done to spite 
They don't need a reason to turn your world around 
(Chorus) 
I'm waiting for the bell to ring 
I want the children to sing 
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall 
I'm just about done with it all 
Do you believe it, when politicians talk 
And make, make the people walk into the fire 
Do, you concede, is there no reprieve 
From their power game, I know there's someone to blame 
We ought to be forgiven for taking in their words 
They don't even write them now is that absurd 
They don't need a reason to tear your world apart 
(Repeat chorus) 
And I'm just about done with it all 
With it all 
And I'm waiting, you know I'm waiting 
For the angels to sing for the freedom it brings 
For the bad man to fall 
When the children call, I want the angels to sing 
And I'm just about done with it all 
And I'm waiting for the bell to ring 
I want the children to sing 
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall 
I'm done with it all 
(Repeat chorus).</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Marie has set up home 
With a man who's half my age 
A halfwit in a leotard 
Stands on my stage 
The standards have fallen 
My value has dropped 
But don't shed a tear 
Some walk like they own the place 
Whilst others creep in fear 
Try if you can to walk like a man 
But you don't come near 
You've got to fly like an eagle 
Prowl like a lion in Africa 
Leap like a salmon home from the sea 
To keep up with me 
You've got to walk like a panther tonight 
Walk like a panther tonight 
The old hometown just looks the same 
Like a derelict man who had died out of shame 
Like a jumble sale left out in the rain 
It's not good, it's not right 
The standards have fallen 
My value has dropped 
But don't shed a tear 
Some walk like they own the place 
Whilst others creep in fear 
Try if you can to walk like a man 
But you don't come near 
You've got to fly like an eagle 
Prowl like a lion in Africa 
Leap like a salmon home from the sea 
To keep up with me 
You've got to walk like a panther tonight 
Walk like a panther tonight 
Where did you leave all self-respect? 
You look like a reptile, your house is a wreck 
Your existence an insult 
Stains that are suspect cover your clothes 
The standards have fallen 
My value has dropped 
But don't shed a tear 
Some walk like they own the place 
Whilst others creep in fear 
Try if you can to walk like a man 
But you, you don't come near 
You've got to fly like an eagle 
Prowl like a lion in Africa 
Leap like a salmon home from the sea 
To keep up with me 
You've got to walk like a panther tonight 
Walk like a panther tonight 
Walk like a panther tonight 
Walk like a panther tonight 
You've got to walk like a panther 
Walk like a panther tonight

Enough to last 
Till the end of time

No not just for some

Lord we don't need another meadow 
There are cornfields and wheatfields 
Enough to grow 
And there are sunbeams and moonbeams 
Enough to shine

[Rick] 
love is a special thing 
it means more to me than just a Wedding ring 
when two people join as one 
they donâ€™t know just what has begun 
it comes to love, honour, cherish and obey 
you promised girl that you would not go away 
when you gonna come back home girl 
you know I'm all alone, girl 
when you gonna come back home 
when you gonna come back home girl 
you know I'm all alone, girl 
when you gonna come back home 
[Lisa] 
love is a precious thing 
so canâ€™t you see the joy that it can bring 
so how can you be so cruel 
you've gone and broken every rule 
You promised to love, honour, cherish and obey 
you promised me you'd never go away 
when you gonna stay at home boy 
you see I was alone, boy 
when you gonna stay at home 
when you gonna stay at home boy 
you see I was alone, boy 
when you gonna stay at home 
[Rick] 
loveâ€™s got a hold on me 
I need you girl, canâ€™t you see 
[Lisa] 
so why donâ€™t we spend some time 
letâ€™s get together, maybe we could find 
[Rick and Lisa] 
weâ€™ve got to love, honour, cherish and obey 
weâ€™ve got to promise that weâ€™ll never go away 
never gonna leave you home, no 
leave you all alone 
now I'm gonna stay at home 
never gonna be alone, no 
you see I should have known 
never gonna leave you home

I went home for the weekend 
I saw my friends and my family 
I couldn't believe how they'd changed 
They where laughing and crying 
Feeling all the joy in life 
It was so good to feel it too 
And I know just how it feels 
I know just what it means 
(Chorus) 
When you love someone, it feels so right 
When you love someone, they hold you tight 
When you love someone, it feels so good 
When you love someone, it's understood 
A couple having a baby 
Are giving life to the love they feel 
They count the days expectantly 
And they, they know just how it feels 
Yeah they do, and they, they know just what it means 
Just what it means 
(Repeat chorus) 
It's just about time for a change 
It's just about time for me to rearrange 
Just about time for a change 
It's just about time for me to rearrange my life

I'll bring my love to you 
I'll bring my love to you 
I've been stood up and messed around 
And taken for a fool 
But next time around 
I'm gonna change the rules 
And I don't care about the things that people say 
It's you I think about each and every day 
It's much to late for you to change your ways 
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay 
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down 
Call me, I'll be around 
* Whenever you need somebody 
I'll bring my love to you 
You don't have to say you love me 
I just wanna be with you 
Lost Inside your love is where I wanna be 
I'm just asking you to spend some time with me 
Time and time you say you wanna be free 
And you can have some fun that's ok with me 
You will never know just how good I feel 
The joy inside of me makes me feel so real 
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down 
Call me, I'll be around 
(* repeat) 
I'll bring my love to you 
I just wanna be with you 
It's much to late for you to change your ways 
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay 
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down 
Call me , I'll be around

To tell the story of how great a love can be, 
The sweet love story that is older than the sea, 
The simple truth about the love she brings to me, 
Where do I start ? 
With her first hello! 
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine, 
There'd never be another love, another time, 
She came into my life and made the living fine, 
She fills my heart  
. 
She fills my heart with very special things, 
With angels' songs , with wild imaginings, 
She fills my soul with so much love, 
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely, 
With her along, who could be lonely ? 
I reach for her hand, it's always there  
. 
How long does it last ? 
Can love be measured by the hours in a day ? 
I have no answers now, but this much I can say, 
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away 
And she'll be there  
. 
She’ll be there

So very down 
And I've been lost around this town 
And sometimes 
No one understands

I go to work in my clean shirt 
I push a pen until half past ten 
I watch the clock there on the wall 
Tic toc, why don't you call 
The boss come in and walks down the aisles 
He turns around but he never smiles 
He watches me just like a hawk 
And then he says we must talk 
* You move me, from side to side 
You move me and if feels so right 
You move me up and down 
You move me around and around 
Son, he says (what) I've got bad news 
Life is hard and you got the blues 
I know you're good and I know you work hard 
I'm sorry, son, but here are your cards 
I went home and kicked off my shoes 
And I asked myself why do I always lose 
But then you called and everything was fine 
I'm so glad that you are mine 
(* repeat) 
You're the one thing in my life 
That makes me feel so good inside 
will you hold me tight tonight 
Oh, girl I wish you would decide

I'll show you just how much I love you 
If you'll just come walking through that door

'Bout the way you looked last night 
I remember how we held each other tight 
As we lay beside the fire 
Felt the heat of pure desire 
There ain't nothing I can do 
Now that I'm in love with you 
 
No more looking for love 
Now that I'm in love with you 
No, there's no more looking for love 
Now I've found a love that's true 
 
I'm so glad that love has come around 
I'm so thankful for the love I've found 
 
No more looking for love 
Now that I'm in love with you 
No, there's no more looking for love 
Now I've found a love that's true 
 
No more looking for love 
Now that I'm in love with you 
No, there's no more looking for love 
Now I've found a love that's true</field>

I'll bring my love to you 
 
I've been stood up messed around 
And taken for a fool 
But next time round 
I'm gonna change the rules 
 
And I don't care about the things that people say 
It's you I think about each and everyday 
It's much too late for you to change your ways 
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay 
 
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down 
Call me, I'll be around 
 
Whenever you need somebody 
I'll bring my love to you 
You don't have to say you love me 
I just want to be with you 
 
Lost inside your love is where I want to be 
I'm just asking you to spend some time with me 
Time and time you say you want to be free 
And you can have some fun that's okay with me 
 
You will never know just how good I feel 
The joy inside of me makes me feel so real 
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down 
Call me, I'll be around 
 
Whenever you need somebody 
I'll bring my love to you 
You don't have to say you love me 
I just want to be with you 
 
I'll bring my love to you 
I just want to be with you 
 
I'll bring my love to you 
I just want to be with you 
 
It's much too late for you to change your ways 
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay 
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down 
Call me, I'll be around 
 
Whenever you need somebody 
I'll bring my love to you 
You don't have to say you love me 
I just want to be with you</field>

But things aren't always what they seem 
Even my best friend says we're so good 
Just how wrong can a person be

I push a pen until half past ten 
I watch the clock there on the wall 
Tic toc, why don't you call 
The boss comes in and walks down the aisles 
He turns around but he never smiles 
He watches me just like a hawk 
And then he says we must talk 
 
You move me, from side to side 
You move me and it feels so right 
You move me up and down 
You move me around and around 
 
Son, he says (what) I've got bad news 
Life is hard and you got the blues 
I know you're good I know you work hard 
I'm sorry, son, here are your cards 
I went home and kicked off my shoes 
And asked myself why do I always lose 
But then you rang and everything was fine 
I'm so glad that you are mine 
 
You move me, from side to side 
You move me and it feels so right 
You move me up and down 
You move me around and around 
 
You're the one thing in my life 
That makes me feel so good inside 
Will you hold me tight tonight 
Oh, girl I wish you would decide 
 
You move me, from side to side 
You move me and it feels so right 
You move me up and down 
You move me around and around 
 
You move me, from side to side 
You move me and it feels so right 
You move me up and down 
You move me around and around</field>

Last night I heard you creeping 
I was almost sleeping 
When I heard you come home 
You knew I loved you madly 
And I would gladly 
Do anything for you 
 
You climbed the stairs to heaven 
But you may never climb those steps again 
You thought you'd be forgiven 
But I was driven to make you understand 
 
I don't want to be your lover 
When there's another lover in your head 
I don't want to be your lover 
When there's another lover in your bed 
 
Tell me how you could do it 
Why put me through it 
When you said you'd be true 
You said that it was nothing 
But it was something 
And sometimes that's enough 
 
So climb the stairs to heaven 
But you may never climb those steps again 
You thought you'd be forgiven 
But I was driven to make you understand 
 
I don't want to be your lover 
When there's another lover in your head 
I don't want to be your lover 
When there's another lover in your bed 
 
You climbed the stairs to heaven 
But you may never climb those steps again 
You thought you'd be forgiven 
But I was driven to make you understand 
 
I don't want to be your lover

I'd be nothing, nothing without it 
 
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl 
After all that we've been through 
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine

I couldn't imagine life without her love 
I just couldn't take it 
If you wanted to know how well I would get on 
I don't think I'd make it 
 
Maybe I just don't show her 
And now that I think it's over 
I maybe should shout about it 
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing without it 
 
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl 
After all that we've been through 
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine

And bring her back to my heart 
'Cause what I found out about her 
I just cannot live without her 
 
Maybe I just don't show her

Yet it comes and goes like a wave of a stranger 
And as we stumble for the truth 
We're caught in a web of lies 
Is nothin' worth a damn without the danger 
 
We're lost in a world of illusive dreams 
Where every story has a desperate ring 
 
We got a right to happiness, in the name of love 
And though sometimes we may forget 
To give it all we possess 
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love 
And without pause or regret, searching only for the best 
 
We could see the light unfold right before our eyes 
Blinded by the tears, we get lost in the shadows 
Oh! But the heart is a wondrous thing 
Surviving the thunder, outlasting the rain 
 
We got a right to happiness, in the name of love 
And though sometimes we may forget 
To give it all we possess 
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love 
And without pause or regret, searching only for the best 
 
Oh! But the heart is a wondrous thing 
Surviving the thunder, outlasting the rain 
 
We got a right to happiness, in the name of love 
And may be sometimes we may forget 
To give it all we possess 
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love 
 
And without pause or regret 
Searching only for the best 
Try name of love, 
Try in the name of love

Tell me if your love for me is real 
 
[Chorus] 
Is this really love 
Is this the real thing 
Is this really love 
Can it be the right thing 
 
I was born in a prison there was no way out 
If you want to be heard you got to scream and shout 
You don't know the kind of mess I'm in 
Nobody else is going to save my skin but 
You have got the key to set me free 
If you want my love then rescue me

And there were friends of mine 
I saw them time after time 
But I never knew their names 
And darling I swear 
I saw you there 
I know it sounds insane 
 
Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy 
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me 
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here 
Must be something went right 
I just know when you're near 
 
This must be heaven 
Have I found it what I've been looking for 
This must be heaven 
Have I finally stumbled through the door 
 
How could I have doubted 
I guess I must have lost my place 
You turned on the light 
And I saw my life 
Reflected in your face 
 
Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy oh yeah 
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me 
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here

Have I found it what I've been looking for 
This must be heaven 
Have I finally stumbled through the door 
 
And I always knew that there was something more 
 
Come closer to me now 
You fill me up I'm overflowing 
Come closer to me now 
Come hold me tight and don't let go 
 
This must be heaven

I thought it was you, but my hopes were washed away 
I picked up the telephone, it sent a shiver down my spine 
I wanted to hear your voice, and talk about old times

Remember the days when we walked 
The times that we talked for hours and hours 
Remember the way it used to be, just you and me 
Remember the days 
 
Think it over what I say 
I know it could be just like it used to be 
Do you believe it baby, do you share my point of view 
You know that I mean it baby, and all you have to do is 
 
(Repeat chorus) 
 
What can I do without you, how can I live without you 
The day's gonna come, when I'm on the run 
So I'm begging you baby please 
Remember the days

What can I do without you, how can I live without you 
So come on girl I'm begging you please 
Come on and talk to me 
 
The times that we walked 
The days that we used to walk out in the park 
Remember how it used to be 
Do you remember, do you remember how good it used to be 
 
Come on girl, I said come on girl 
 
To the left, to the right, we're gonna rock all night

There ought to be a reason for turning black to white 
Sometimes get the feeling that it's done to spite 
They don't need a reason to turn your world around

Do you believe it, when politicians talk 
And make, make the people walk into the fire 
Do, you concede, is there no reprieve 
From their power game, I know there's someone to blame 
 
We ought to be forgiven for taking in their words 
They don't even write them now is that absurd 
They don't need a reason to tear your world apart 
 
(Repeat chorus) 
 
And I'm just about done with it all 
 
With it all 
 
And I'm waiting, you know I'm waiting 
For the angels to sing for the freedom it brings 
For the bad man to fall 
When the children call, I want the angels to sing 
And I'm just about done with it all 
 
And I'm waiting for the bell to ring 
I want the children to sing 
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall 
I'm done with it all 
 
(Repeat chorus)

            <field name="lyrics">She's taken my time. 
Convince me she's fine. 
But when she leaves I'm not so sure. 
It's always the same. 
She's playing her game. 
And when she goes I feel to blame. 
Why won't she say she needs me?  
I know she's not as strong as she seems. 
 
Why don't I see her cry for help?  
Why don't I feel her cry for help?  
Why don't I hear her cry for help?  
 
I wandered around 
The streets of this town 
Trying to find sense of it all. 
The rain on my face, 
It covers the trace 
Of all the tears I'd had to waste. 
Why must we hide emotions?  
Why must we never break down and cry?  
 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
Somebody please hear me cry for help. 
All I can do is cry for help. 
 
No need to feel ashamed. release the pain. cry for help. 
 
Cry for help is all I need. 
All I need is a cry for help. 
Cry for help is all I need. 
All I need is a cry for help. 
 
Why must we hide emotions?  
Why can't we ever break down and cry?  
All that I need is to cry for help. 
I will be there when you cry for help. 
Why don't I hear her cry for help?  
 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
Somebody please hear me cry for help. 
All I can do is cry for help. 
 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
I will be there when you cry for help. 
Is it so hard to cry for help?  
 
(cry for help is all I need.) no need to feel ashamed. 
(all I need is a cry for help.) come on and release the pain. 
(cry for help is all I need.) put your trust in me. 
(all I need is a cry for help.) my love is gonna set you free. 
 
Woooooooooooooo.

Pour myself a glass of wine 
Let it breathe but I don't give it too much time 
Take another and set it down 
I kid myself there's nobody else around 
 
There's nothing left for me to do 
I've an empty glass, full of you 
 
But let me tell you baby 
I can't fight the feeling 
I never stopped believing 
You were coming back to me 
 
I hear footsteps by the door 
Could it be there's nothing else that I want more 
There you stand in front of me 
I see your face my heart has wings you set me free 
 
There's nothing left for me to do 
Now my empty heart, is full of you 
 
But let me tell you baby 
I can't fight the feeling

Let me tell you darling 
Never did I doubt you 
I can't live without you

The DJ plays familiar songs and it takes me back

You set my spirit free. 
I'm happy that you do.

And once a page is read, 
All but love is dead. 
That is my belief.

A very strange enchanted boy 
They say he wandered very far, very far 
Over land and sea 
A little shy and sad of eye 
But very wise was he 
 
And then one day 
A magic day he passed my way 
And while we spoke of many things 
Fools and kings 
This he said to me 
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn 
Is just to love and be loved in return" 
 
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn 
Is just to love and be loved in return"</field>

It would take I know, a Michael Angelo  
And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above  
To try and paint a portrait of my love

An airline ticket to romantic places 
And still my heart has wings 
These foolish things remind me of you 
 
A tinkling piano in the next apartment 
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant 
A fairground's painted swings 
These foolish things remind me of you 
 
You came, you saw, you conquered me 
When you did that to me 
I knew somehow this had to be 
 
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer 
A telephone that rings but who's to answer? 
Oh, how the ghost of you clings 
These foolish things remind me of you 
 
The scent of smoldering leaves the wail of steamers 
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers 
Oh how the ghost of you clings 
These foolish things 
Remind me of you 
 
How strange, how sweet, to find you still 
These things are dear to me 
They seem to bring you so near to me 
 
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations 
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations 
Oh how the ghost of you clings 
These foolish things 
Remind me of you</field>

Paint your palette blue and gray  
Look out on a summers day  
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul... 
 
Shadows on the hills  
Sketch the trees and the daffodils  
Catch the breeze and the winter chills  
In colors on the snowy linen land.  
 
Now I understand  
What you tried to say, to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free 
 
They would not listen; they did not know how  
Perhaps they'll listen now.  
Starry, starry night  
 
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze  
Swirling clouds in violet haze  
Reflect in Vincents eyes of china blue  
 
Colors changing hue  
Morning fields of amber grain  
Weathered faces lined in pain  
Are soothed beneath the artists loving hand. 
  
Now I understand  
What you tried to say, to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free 
  
They would not listen; they did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now.  
For they could not love you  
But still, your love was true  
And when no hope was left inside  
On that starry, starry night  
You took your life as lovers often do 
  
But I could've told you, Vincent  
This world was never meant  
For one as beautiful as you.</field>

To tell the story of how great a love can be 
The sweet love story that is older than the sea 
The simple truth about the love she brings to me 
Where do I start 
 
With her first hello 
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine 
There'll never be another love, another time 
She came into my life and made the living fine 
She fills my heart 
 
She fills my heart with very special things 
With angels' songs , with wild imaginings 
She fills my soul with so much love 
That everywhere I go I'm never lonely 
With you my love, who could be lonely 
I reach for her hand-it's always there 
 
How long does it last 
Can love be measured by the hours in a day 
I have no answers now but this much I can say 
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away 
And she'll be there</field>

I saw my daddy crying at the steering wheel 
And oh, it made me feel so scared 
Then there was joy 
Found my religion, swimming in a choir of voices 
And oh, I knew that I'd been spared 
 
That I'd be saved some sunny day 
Saved from throwing my life away 
That I'd be saved some sunny day 
From throwing my life, throwing my life away 
 
Keep singing, woah, I keep singing 
Praising to the heavens with my voice ringing 
Keep singing, woah, I keep singing 
Clap to the beat till my hands are stinging 
And I'd be saved some sunny day 
From throwing my life, throwing my life away 
 
And now I understand 
I'm a wide-eyed father, and blessed are the children 
Oh, our greatest reward 
And with these hands 
I'll move a mountain, build a castle to keep you safe 
Of this you know you can be sure 
 
And you'll be saved some sunny day 
Saved from throwing your life away 
And you'll be saved some sunny day 
From throwing your life 
 
Keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Praising to the heavens with your voices ringing 
Keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Clap to the beat til your hands are stinging 
And you'll be saved some sunny day 
From throwing your life, throwing your life away 
 
Who do you love? 
When it all comes down to truth 
Who do you love? 
When it all comes back to you 
Who do you love? 
When you're lying in your bed 
Who do you love? 
Who do you love? 
 
Keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing 
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing

Saved from throwing your life away 
And you'll be saved some sunny day 
From throwing your life, throwing your life away 
 
Keep singing, woah, keep singing

Does an angel contemplate my fate 
And do they know 
The places where we go 
When we're grey and old 
'cause I've been told 
That salvation lets their wings unfold 
So when I'm lying in my bed 
Thoughts running through my head 
And I feel that love is dead 
I'm loving angels instead 
And through it all she offers me protection 
A lot of love and affection 
Whether I'm right or wrong 
And down the waterfall 
Wherever it may take me 
I know that life won't break me 
When I come to call 
she won't forsake me 
I'm loving angels instead 
When I'm feeling weak 
And my pain walks down a one way street 
I look above 
And I know I'll always be blessed with love 
And as the feeling grows 
She breathes flesh to my bones 
And when love is dead 
I'm loving angels instead 
And through it all she offers me protection 
A lot of love and affection 
Whether I'm right or wrong 
And down the waterfall 
Wherever it may take me 
I know that life won't break me 
When I come to call

I just wanna feel real love 
Feel the home that I live in

Running through my veins 
Going to waste 
I don't wanna die 
But I ain't keen on living either 
Before I fall in love 
I'm preparing to leave her 
I scare myself to death 
That's why I keep on running 
Before I've arrived 
I can see myself coming 
I just wanna feel real love 
Feel the home that I live in 
'Cause I got too much life 
Running through my veins 
Going to waste 
And I need to feel real love 
And a life ever after 
I cannot get enough

Feel the home that I live in 
I got too much love 
Running through my veins 
Going to waste 
And I need to feel real love

You can see it in my face

It doesn't make me wanna stay

I know a place, we can move our feet downtown 
Ease into the rhythm when I hear that sound 
My momma taught me and I do not back down 
Hey pretty woman, I love the way you move 
Winding down low to that baseline groove 
The way you're dancing got me in the mood 
Daddy told me it's what grown folks do 
Let me tell ya now 
Hey pretty woman Imma testify 
Hey pretty woman make a grown man cry

You can make me beg 
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar) 
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna 
The way you move your legs 
Well, it just ain't proper 
Why don't you shake 
what you've been given from your momma? 
Hey pretty woman, come and hold my hand 
Dance the Charleston to that old swing band 
I know that it's getting late but you don't mind 
Let's take a taxi and get back to mine 
Hey pretty woman, your daddy don't know 
Take what you want from me, I can't say no 
Just put your hands on my body, let me taste your lips 
I put my hands on your body, baby, work those hips

You can make me beg 
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar) 
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna

You are the only one I'm thinking of 
Hey pretty woman, if you feel the same 
Just say "hey there, boy, bring that beat back again"

What was in your heart 
When it stopped going 
The whole world shook 
A storm was blowing through you 
Waiting for God to stop this 
And up to your neck in darkness 
Everyone around you was corrupted 
Saying somethin' 
There's no dignity in death 
To sell the world your last breath 
They're still fighting over 
Everything you left over 
I saw you standing at the gates 
When Marlon Brando passed away 
You had that look upon your face

And 
No one learned from your mistakes 
We let our profits go to waste 
All that's left in any case 
Is Advertising space 
Through your eyes 
The world was burning 
Please be gentle 
So I'm still learning

As you kept turning up 
They poisoned you with compromise 
At what point did you realize 
Everybody loves your lies 
But you ahahh

No one really gave a damn 
Did you think the CIA did 
I saw you standing at the gates 
When Marlon Brando passed away 
You had that look upon your face 
Advertising space and 
No one learned from your mistake 
We let our profits go to waste 
All that's left in any case 
Is Advertising space ooooohh 
No one learned from your mistakes 
We let our profits go to waste 
All that's left in any case 
Is Advertising space 
I've seen your daughter 
Man she's cute 
I was scared but I wanted to 
Boy she looks a lot like you</field>

Somewhere waiting for me 
My lover stands on golden sands 
And watches the ships that go sailing 
Somewhere beyond the sea 
She's there watching for me 
If I could fly like birds on high 
Then straight to her arms 
I'd go sailing 
Somewhere beyond the stars 
She's there watching for me 
My lover stands on golden sands 
And watches the ships that go sailing 
It's far beyond the stars 
It's near beyond the moon 
I know beyond the doubt 
My heart will lead me there soon 
We'll meet I know will meet beyond the shore 
We'll kiss just like before 
Happy we will be beyond the sea 
And never again i'll go sailing 
It's far beyond the stars 
It's near beyond the moon 
I konw, yes, I know beyond the doubt 
My heart will lead me there soon 
We'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore 
We'll kiss just as before 
And happy we'll be beyond the sea 
And never again i'll go sailing 
And never again i'll go sailing 
And never again i'll go sailing

I need to rest in arms 
Keep me safe from harm

Lord I fear the cold 
Feel I'm getting old

As my soul heals the shame 
I will grow old through this pain 
Lord I'm doing all I can 
To be a better man 
Go easy on my conscience 
Cause it's not my fault 
I know I've been taught 
To take the blame 
Rest assured my angels 
Who catch my tears 
Walk me out of here 
I'm in pain 
As my soul heals the shame 
I will grow old through this pain 
Lord I'm doing all I can 
To be a better man 
Once you've found that lover 
You're homeward bound 
Love is all around 
Love is all around 
I know some have fallen 
On stony ground 
But love is all around 
Send someone to love me

Keep me safe from harm

            <field name="lyrics">And now the end is near 
So I face the final curtain 
My friend, I'll say it clear 
I'll state my case of which I'm certain 
I've lived a life that's full 
I've travelled each and every highway 
And more, much more than this 
I did it my way 
Regrets, I've had a few 
But then again, too few to mention 
I did what I had to do 
And saw it through without exception 
I planned each charted course 
Each careful step along the byway 
Oh, and more, much more than this 
I did it my way 
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew 
When I bit off more than I could chew 
But through it all when there was doubt 
I ate it up and spit it out 
I faced it all and I stood tall 
And did it my way 
I've loved, I've laughed and cried 
I've had my fails, my share of losing 
And now as tears subside 
I find it all so amusing 
To think I did all that 
And may I say, not in a shy way 
Oh, no, no not me 
I did it my way 
For what is a man, what has he got 
If not himself, then he has not 
To say the things he truly feels 
And not the words he would reveal 
The record shows I took the blows 
And did it my way.</field>

I feel it's time 
Got a picture of you beside me 
I've got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup 
(oh,yeah!) 
I've Got a fist of pure emotion 
I've Got a head of shattered dreams 
I Gotta leave it,I gotta leave it all behind now 
Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it 
I just want you back for good 
Wherever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing 
it 
You'll be right and understood 
(I want you back,I want you back for good) 
Unaware but underlined, I figured out this story 
(no,no) It wasn't good ,no,no! 
But in the corner of my mind 
I celebrated glory 
But that was not to be 
In the twist of separation, you excelled at being free 
Can't you find a little room inside for me? 
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
I just want you back for good 
Wherever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing 
it 
You'll be right and understood 
And we'll be together, this time is forever 
I'll be fighting and forever we'll be 
So complete and our love 
will never be uncovered again 
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
I just want you back for good 
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing 
it 
You'll be right and understood 
I want you back for good. 
I guess,now it's time 
But you come back for good.</field>

just who 
you used to be 
and you don't ring true 
so please 
stop calling me 
Your "I love you"'s 
are ten a penny 
You're dropping clues 
like you've got any 
You got to choose 
There's been so many ohhhh 
I love you baby 
but face it she's Madonna 
No man on earth 
could say that he don't want her 
This look of love 
says I'm leaving 
you're frozen now 
I've done the freezing 
I'm walking out 
Madonna's calling me 
She's got to be 
obscene to be believed 
That's her routine 
Not what she means to me 
I found myself 
by circumstance 
across a room 
where people dance 
And quite by chance 
she' danced right next me 
I love you baby 
but face it she's Madonna 
No man on earth 
would say that he don't want her 
It's me not you 
I've got to move on 
You're younger too 
but she's got her groove on 
I'm sorry love 
Madonna's calling me 
Oh, Madonna, Madonna 
I want to tell you a secret 
We're having drinks 
with Kate and Stella 
Gwyneth's here 
she's brought her fella 
But all I wanna do 
is take Madonna home 
I love you baby 
but face it she's Madonna 
No man on earth 
would say that he don't want her 
It's me not you 
I've got to move on 
You're younger too

So self aware so full of shit

I'm contemplating thinking about thinking 
It's overrated to just get another drink in 
Watch me come undone 
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street 
Pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep 
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet 
Because I'm scum 
And I'm your son 
I come undone 
I come undone 
So rock and roll so corporate suit 
So damn ugly, so damn cute 
So well trained, so animal 
So need your love, so fuck you all 
I'm not scared of dying I just don't want to 
If I stopped lying I'd just disappoint you 
I come undone 
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street 
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep 
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet 
Because I'm scum 
And I'm your son 
I've come undone 
So write another ballad 
Mix it on a Wednesday 
Sell it on a Thursday 
Buy a yacht by Saturday 
It's a love song 
A love song 
Do another interview 
Sing a bunch of lies 
Tell about celebrities that I despise 
And sing love songs 
We sing love songs 
So sincere 
So sincere 
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street 
Pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep 
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet 
Because I'm scum 
I'm your son 
I've come undone 
I've come undone 
I've come undone 
I've come undone 
I am scum 
Love your son 
I am scum 
Love your son 
You've gotta love my sad song 
my love song 
My sad song, my love song 
my sad song, my love song</field>

All the lonely hearts in London 
Caught a plane and flew away 
And all the best women are married 
All the handsome men are gay 
You feel deprived 
Yeah are you questioning your size? 
Is there a tumour in your humour? 
Are there bags under your eyes? 
Do you leave dents where you sit 
Are you getting on a bit? 
Will you survive 
You must survive 
When there's no love in town 
This new century keeps bringing you down 
All the places you have been 
Trying to find a love supreme 
A love supreme 
Oh what are you really looking for? 
Another partner in your life to 
abuse and to adore? 
Is it lovey dovey stuff 
Do you need a bit of rough? 
Get on your knees 
Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear 
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment 
That echoes in your ear 
Saying love will stop the pain 
Saying love will kill the fear 
Do you believe 
You must believe 
When there's no love in town 
This new century keeps bringing you down 
All the places you have been 
Trying to find a love supreme 
A love supreme 
I spy with my little eye 
Something beginning with (ah) 
Got my back up 
And now she's screaming 
So I've got to turn the track up 
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up 
I know this girl she likes to switch teams 
And I'm a fiend but I'm living for a love supreme 
 
When there's no love in town 
This new century keeps bringing you down 
All the places you have been 
Trying to find a love supreme 
A love supreme 
Come and live a love supreme 
Don't let it get you down 
Everybody lives for love

Oh yeah 
And now I'm gonna get me so happy 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I told you so

Take back your singing in the rain

What a kick just my buddies and me 
(What a kick just my buddies and me) 
We won the race 
Got out of the place 
I went back home got a brand new face 
For the boys on Mtv (boys on Mtv) 
 
But today the way I play the game has got to change 
Oh yeah 
And now I'm gonna get myself happy 
 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I stopped the show 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone I forgot to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Don't think that I'll be back again 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah

Well it looks like the road to heaven 
But it feels like the road to hell 
And when you shake your ass 
They notice fast 
Some mistakes were built to last 
That's what you get 
That's what you get 
I just hope you understand sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to see now 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah

I can see it in your eyes 
you still dispise the same old lines 
you heard the night before 
And though it's just a line to you 
for me it's true 
it never seemed so right before 
I practice everyday 
to find some clever lines to say 
to make the meaning come true 
But then I think I'll wait

your perfume fills my head 
the stars get red

I stumble through the words as they're leaving me, 
Tremble at the side of Your Majesty, 
And I cut myself just to get them out

Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes... 
You took my youth, you took my health, 
And if you're not here I'll fight myself 
You're supposed to make this better, better, better 
No self-control and no reason why, 
If I don't change, then we both die, 
This is it for you and I 
Blisters at the end of my fingertips, 
Praying to a god I don't think exist 
Will you listen now? 
Can you forgive me somehow? 
This time I'll be different, I promise you,

If love was the answer, 
Then hope was the question? 
Closer now, let's pretend 
We've never been out here before 
This time I'll be different, I promise you,

Wave your hands if your not with a man 
Can I kick it? 
(Yes you can) 
I got 
(Funk) 
You got 
(Soul) 
We got everybody 
I've got the gift 
Gonna stick it in the goal 
It's time to move your body 
Babylon back in business 
Can I get a witness? 
Every girl, every man 
Houston, do you hear me? 
Ground control, can you feel me? 
Need permission to land 
I don't wanna rock, DJ 
But your making me feel so nice 
When's it gonna stop, DJ? 
Cause you're keepin' me up all night 
Singin' in the classes 
Music for your masses 
Give no head 
No backstage passes 
Have a proper giggle 
I'll be quite polite 
But when I rock the mic 
I rock the mic 
(Right) 
You got no love, then you're with the wrong man 
It's time to move your body 
If you can't get a girl 
But your best friend can 
It's time to move your body 
I don't wanna be sleazy 
Baby just tease me 
Got no family plan 
Houston, do you hear me? 
Ground control, can you feel me ? 
Need permission to land

Every night

She's a working girl, in a modern world 
Tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen 
Pour myself a cup of ambition 
And yawn and stretch and try to come alive 
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping 
Out on the street the traffic starts jumping 
And folks like me on the job from nine to five 
Working nine to five 
What a way to make a living 
Barely getting by 
It's all taking and no giving 
They just use your mind 
And they never give you credit 
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it 
Nine to five, for service and devotion 
You would think 
That I would deserve a fair promotion 
Wanna move ahead 
But the boss won't seem to let me 
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me 
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter 
You're just another step 
On the boss man's ladder 
But you got dreams he'll never take away 
You're in the same boat 
With a lot of your friends 
Waitin' for the day your ship will come in 
Then the tide's goin' to turn 
And it's all gonna go your way 
Working nine to five 
What a way to make a living

It's all taking and no giving

There's only one of me 
Single-handedly raising the economy 
Ain't no chance of the record company dropping me 
Press be asking do I care for sodomy 
I don't know, yeah, probably 
I've been looking for serial monogamy 
Not some bird that looks like Billy Connolly 
But for now I'm down for ornithology 
Grab your binoculars, come follow me</field>

One day I'll look back at this and die

Do you run around all day avoiding mirrors? 
Do you find comfort in the hate? I 
S this abuse too late? 
My heart's just bleeding for you 
And this is my fuck you to you 
By the time you were into my blood 
I was all of seventeen 
You were the light of my life 
And the darkness in-between 
Whatever that means 
Did we sail you down river? 
Do you run around all day avoiding mirrors? 
Do you find comfort in the hate? I 
S this abuse too late? 
My heart's just bleeding for you 
And this is my fuck you to you 
I used to see you in my dreams 
But I could not compete 
Then you taught me the value 
Of never losing sleep 
How you sink like a home 
Putting children on the street 
Is it anger or sympathy 
How I sail you down river? 
But you must feel some disdain 
Then I'll forgive you 
All day long you are night 
But I am vaguely right 
My hearts just bleeding for you 
This is a fuck you 
This is my fuck you to you</field>

Candice's inner business 
She wants the boys to notice 
Her rainbows, and her ponies 
She was educated 
But could not count to ten 
How she got lots of different horses 
By lots of different men 
And I say 
Liberate your sons and daughters 
The bush is high 
But in the hole there's water 
You can get some, when they give it 
Nothing sacred, but it's a living 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too loud or a little too close 
She's got a hurricane in the back of her throat 
And she thinks she's made of candy 
Ring a ring of roses 
Whoever gets the closest 
She comes and she goes 
As the war of the roses 
Mother was a victim 
Father beat the system 
By moving bricks to Brixton 
And learning how to fix them 
Liberate your sons and daughters 
The bush is high 
But in the hole there's water 
As you win 
She'll be the Hollywood love 
And if it don't feel good 
What are you doing this for 
Now tell me 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too loud or a little too close 
She's got a hurricane in the back of her throat 
And she thinks she's made of candy 
Liberate your sons and daughters 
The bush is high 
But in the hole there's water 
As you win 
She'll be the Hollywood love 
And if it don't feel good 
What are you doing it for 
What are you doing it for 
What are you doing it for... 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too loud or a little too close 
She's got a hurricane in the back of her throat 
And she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
She thinks she's made of candy

A year below you

You're face now fear here 
You're getting skanks 
Must be a reason 
Why I'm shooting blanks 
If you were the somewhere 
Right in my life 
The only saviour 
You're mine tonight 
Big wheel turning 
Down by the river 
Found my calling 
Down by the river 
Wanna live forever 
So far so good 
Now I trust myself better 
God I wish you would 
I've never been unfaithful 
Good with the law 
I know I've been faithful 
1974 
1974 
I'll die in your footsteps 
Trade on your name 
I'll kill you with kindness 
If you hurt me again 
Standing in the rain 
Thinking of you tonight 
I've been searching for a meaning 
Trying to find a wife 
Loving all persons 
To make it alright 
Ive been singing in the rain 
Watching over you tonight 
Stunned by the saddest 
songs she used to sing 
Don't look for tomorrow today 
Goodbye dear Sunday 
It's been fun now it's Monday 
Everything's coming up roses

The more you see the less you know 
When others would leak it

Plays God when it's your time to go 
Queen and country safe and sound 
With villians six feet underground 
And no one knows cause no one's found 
Any trace of a man for all seasons 
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone 
And you and I wouldn't have a clue 
Who's doing what, why, when and who 
Up the creek with no canoe 
Watch out for the man for all seasons 
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone 
But safe at homeï¼Š 
From the House of Lords 
Saving Norfolk Broads 
Commoners and landed gentry 
His word his bond 
Whether brunette or blonde 
Baby it's so elementary 
For the man never messed up your life 
With one stare 
See the film you'll know how it goes 
But this ain't no fiction 
Just check the diction quid pro quo a pro's pro 
Fellas 
Don't be jealous 
When they made him they broke the mould 
So charismatic 
Willing, automatic 
Never prematurely shooting his load

There's no dignity in death

When Marlon Brando passed away 
You had that look upon your face

No one learned from your mistakes 
We let our profits go to waste 
All that's left in any case

The world was burning 
Please be gentle 
So I'm still learning 
You seemed to say 
As you kept turning up 
They poisoned you with compromise 
At what point did you realize 
Everybody loves your lies 
But you ahahh 
Special agent for the man 
Through watergate and vietnam 
No one really gave a damn 
Did you think the CIA did 
I saw you standing at the gates

The battles you've won 
Oh we're up all naked

I climb on 
By chance of grand design 
We were built to climb 
It's a sign 
Climb on 
And the truth is we don't know 
About how or why or where or when we go 
In the end no matter what 
I'm gonna make the most of what precious time I've got 
From the cradle to the grave 
To take those opportunities I must be very brave 
Could it all be a mistake 
Too scared to care 
Too hurt to love 
Enough 
Climb on 
Too scared to breathe 
In here with me 
My love 
Climb on 
It's my soul transmission 
A higher calling, call it love 
Climb on 
All my life these visions 
Telling me to keep on fighting

Too hurt to love

You should, cos it shows 
Got me looking at your lips 
See through your clothes 
I hold you goodbye 
just a little too long 
We don't act like it's wrong 
Say where you've been 
You look to the side 
Not in the eyes, 
no not in his eyes anymore 
His eyes 
I know the secret, 
skins you alive 
But the heart is chosen 
All that I want 
Is to pick you up 
and out of that dress 
Carry you to that desk 
And feel the sin of your flesh 
It's all that I want 
Arching your back 
With that look on your face 
All that I needs 
an hour and space 
When did it change 
I guess when we started 
sweeping under carpets 
I talk you to sleep 
And no one will know 
He hasn't a heart so he can't 
change your soul anymore, 
your soul 
I know the secret, 
skins you alive 
But the heart is chosen 
All that I want 
Is to pick you up 
and out of that dress 
Carry you to that desk 
feel the sin of your flesh 
Now I confess 
Do you think of me less 
Get it off your chest 
But if you wear that dress 
You do what you want 
And I wanna tear your 
clothes off, baby 
But you'd be homeless 
in your heart 
All that I want 
Is to pick you up 
and out of that dress 
Carry you to that desk 
feel the sin of your flesh 
Now I confess 
Do you think of me less 
Get it off your chest 
But if you wear that dress 
You do what you want</field>

I was frightened of the teachers 
I didn't learn nothing 
Cause I couldn't understand it 
I'm a little too much 
Then not enough 
And all the kids were violent 
Cause the town was rough 
Hey babies 
It's the eighties 
Electric blue 
Pure shock 
Cocaine in the bathroom 
You like my shoes? 
I like your top 
Oh, let's rock 
We're with andy warhol at studio 54 
That's right, ah ha, oh yeah 
When you come down 
You've gotta ride the white horse 
That's right, ah ha, oh yeah 
Could go bananas, ah ha 
I'm off this planet, ah ha 
Embrace the madness, ah ha 
I always felt different 
The world felt strange 
And if your gonna play out 
Then you've got to be brave 
Everyone was angry 
Cause no one had nothing 
And we hoped for the best 
Maybe come to something 
Hey babies 
It's the eighties 
Success 
Lighten up 
Poppers on the dance floor 
You like my shoes? 
I like your swatch 
Oh, let's rock 
We're with andy warhol at studio 54 
That's right, ah ha, oh yeah 
The boys are with the boys 
And the girls are naked on the floor

Welcome to our club 
The future has arrived 
Only the chosen are allowed inside 
Bowie's at the door

Does an angel contemplate my fate 
And do they know 
The places where we go 
When we're grey and old 
'cause I've been told 
That salvation lets their wings unfold 
So when I'm lying in my bed 
Thoughts running through my head 
And I feel that love is dead 
I'm loving angels instead 
And through it all she offers me protection 
A lot of love and affection 
Whether I'm right or wrong 
And down the waterfall 
Wherever it may take me 
I know that life won't break me 
When I come to call 
she won't forsake me 
I'm loving angels instead 
When I'm feeling weak 
And my pain walks down a one way street 
I look above 
And I know I'll always be blessed with love 
And as the feeling grows 
She breathes flesh to my bones 
And when love is dead 
I'm loving angels instead 
And through it all she offers me protection 
A lot of love and affection 
Whether I'm right or wrong 
And down the waterfall 
Wherever it may take me 
I know that life won't break me 
When I come to call 
she won't forsake me 
I'm loving angels instead

And charge the earth for it 
If you're lucky they'll let you breathe 
So scream as you go faster 
If that's the world you're after 
But make sure you're home for tea 
Don't believe in clever people 
Clever people drop the bomb 
Don't believe your big and evil 
They´re aliens...

I know a place where heaven breathes 
And its through her window 
Your baby girl's window 
I know you're happy where you are 
Singing to the moon talking to the stars 
Through her window 
Your baby girl's window 
There's finger marks around her soul 
But your laughter fills the hole 
Through her window 
Your baby girl's window 
Aaah I wish you would stay 
Aaah to see what she made of herself 
People say you were gone too soon 
I see your face when flowers bloom 
Through her window 
Your baby girl's window 
I'm looking for the words to say 
Something to take the pain away 
Through her window 
Aaah I wish you would stay 
Aaah to see what she made of herself.</field>

I've Got a head of shattered dreams 
I Gotta leave it,I gotta leave it all behind now 
Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it

Wherever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing

You'll be right and understood

Unaware but underlined, I figured out this story 
(no,no) It wasn't good ,no,no! 
But in the corner of my mind 
I celebrated glory 
But that was not to be 
In the twist of separation, you excelled at being free 
Can't you find a little room inside for me? 
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
I just want you back for good 
Wherever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing

I'm walking like bambi 
You might not understand me 
But I know you 
Leave me to the water 
You talking like andy

Got a brand new needle for you 
You said weed was evil 
So we smoked it in the lobby in the hotel foyer 
It wasn’t even noon yet 
We didn’t want to peak too soon yet 
But when the sun goes down through the after glow 
The night is yours, but your mother should never know 
Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star 
You rock like a bastard, plastered 
You should have seen her 
Everything we did was wunderbar 
‘Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus 
Eva tore my heart out 
I got wasted in action 
But you know that I am a sucker for 
instant satisfaction 
There’s nothing more obscene now than seeing where I’ve been 
But you learn you know, to see the after glow 
You’ve got to burn to grow, but your 
mother should never know 
Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star 
You rock like a bastard, plastered 
You should have seen her 
Everything we did was wunderbar 
‘Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus 
You were everything, everything, 
everything to me 
You were everything, everything, 
everything to me 
You were everything, everything, 
everything to me 
You were everything, everything, 
everything to me 
Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star 
You rock like a baster, plastered 
You should have seen her 
Everything we did was wunderbar

everything, everything, everything to me you were everything, everything,

When the depression sets in and my spirit breaks 
And I go out hunting demons and they make me beg 
Got me pissing in the wind, down my own damn leg 
If God wrote a book 'bout everything that he's done 
I'd go searching for my name, now wouldn't every one? 
And you can tell me point-blank that I'm a narcissist 
I'm just needing confirmation that I exist 
[Chorus 1] 
Please don't read my mind 
I'm so scared of what you'll find 
I haven't left it all behind 
So much hate 'cause of all the hurt 
No idea what I'm really worth 
I'm holding out for peace and air time 
You have to understand that my intentions are good 
And everything I do I do for love 
I got two little souls and I love them, man 
That I'm trying to lead to the promised land 
We take ego trips out to the country side 
Got a big old house where we reside 
And there's a big old boy with a big old gun 
Stays up all night in case the weirdos come 
[Chorus 2] 
I had a job but I resigned 
Then I had a change of mind 
I will again if I'm inclined 
Another moan from a millionaire 
I don't know why I'm telling you 'cause you don't care 
I'm holding out for peace and air time 
[Outro] 
I'm a little bit older but not wiser still 
I was smoking marijuana, taking sleeping pills 
But I get up in the morning, take the kids to school 
And my other indiscretions are so miniscule 
And I really pray to God it stays that way 
'Cause deep inside I think I'm still hurting 
When you take your chances and you ride your luck 
All you're really saying is 'I could fuck this up' 
You have to understand that my intentions are good 
And everything I do I do for love 
I made a ton of mistakes, it's either fight or flight 
But every now and then 
I kinda get it right 
(He kinda gets it right) 
I kinda get it right

I need to rest in arms 
Keep me safe from harm 
In pouring rain 
Give me endless summer 
Lord I fear the cold 
Feel I'm getting old 
Before my time 
As my soul heals the shame 
I will grow old through this pain 
Lord I'm doing all I can 
To be a better man 
Go easy on my conscience 
Cause it's not my fault 
I know I've been taught 
To take the blame 
Rest assured my angels 
Who catch my tears 
Walk me out of here 
I'm in pain 
As my soul heals the shame 
I will grow old through this pain 
Lord I'm doing all I can 
To be a better man 
Once you've found that lover 
You're homeward bound 
Love is all around 
Love is all around 
I know some have fallen 
On stony ground 
But love is all around 
Send someone to love me 
I need to rest in arms 
Keep me safe from harm 
In pouring rain 
Give me endless summer 
Lord I fear the cold 
Feel I'm getting old 
Before my time 
As my soul heals the shame 
I will grow old through this pain 
Lord I'm doing all I can

Somewhere waiting for me 
My lover stands on golden sands 
And watches the ships that go sailing 
Somewhere beyond the sea 
She's there watching for me 
If I could fly like birds on high 
Then straight to her arms 
I'd go sailing 
Somewhere beyond the stars 
She's there watching for me 
My lover stands on golden sands 
And watches the ships that go sailing 
It's far beyond the stars 
It's near beyond the moon 
I know beyond the doubt 
My heart will lead me there soon 
We'll meet I know will meet beyond the shore 
We'll kiss just like before 
Happy we will be beyond the sea 
And never again i'll go sailing 
It's far beyond the stars 
It's near beyond the moon 
I konw, yes, I know beyond the doubt 
My heart will lead me there soon 
We'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore 
We'll kiss just as before 
And happy we'll be beyond the sea 
And never again i'll go sailing 
And never again i'll go sailing 
And never again i'll go sailing

I met you and the task was thankless 
We were carefree and classless 
And then you changed 
I´m nouveau rich 
What can I do 
You´re legionnaires on a summer breeze 
It´s who you do 
You had something to put to me now 
I got something I´m gonna stick in you 
I couldn´t give a flying toss ´bout the relatives you lost 
I think it´s better that 
Your bloodline stops from here 
On in and 
Whoops there I go again 
With friends that I wanna rip apart 
Limb by limb 
Soak the skin with paraffin 
Drop a row 
Hit´n the limb 
And Max let´s see what happens 
Hey now you´re getting in my way now 
You´re a waste of time 
You´re a waste of time 
You got under my radar 
You said kicking shins in the clock end 
Was just a phase so I paged ya 
And you became my new best friend 
For a while 
I should have known you were a psychopath 
It´s who you do 
I was lonely we were having a laugh 
Should have known but worshipped a few 
I couldn´t give a flying toss ´bout the relatives you lost 
I think it´s better that 
Your bloodline stops from here 
On in and 
Whoops there I go again 
With friends that I´d like to tear apart 
Limb by limb 
Soak the skin with paraffin 
Drop a row 
Hit´n the limb 
Oh Max let´s see what happens 
Hey now there´s nothing left to say now 
You´re just a waste of time</field>

The Egyptians built their pyramids 
The Romans did what they did 
Now everything's come down to this 
It's just you and I, our kid 
We could send a million to the moon 
But why can't I get on with you? 
Cellophane around my mouth 
Stops the anger seeping out 
Our deaf and dumb dinners 
Gravy in the mud 
No singles, just fillers 
Sometimes I wish I could 
But I can't behave 
Though it's not the heathen in me 
It's just that I've been bleeding lately, 
Internally 
Don't turn to me, 
Bite your tongue, the torrid weapon 
We could learn a useful lesson 
What's so great about the Great Depression 
Is it a blast for you? 
'Cause it's blasphemy 
Words cut like a knife through Vaseline 
You can't really mean what you mean 
When you say what you say 
Tourettes make them come out that way 
Wish I was here well I wish you weren't 
Your gift of anger's better burnt 
If nothing's said then nothing's learnt 
I thought I wasn't but I'm really hurting 
Our deaf and dumb dinners, 
There's gravy in the mud 
And I can't behave 
No, it's not the heathen in me 
It's just that I've been bleeding lately, 
Internally 
Don't turn to me 
Bite your tongue, plethoric weapon 
We could learn a useful lesson 
What's so great about the Great Depression 
Was it a blast for you? 
Blasphemy 
Our great adventure Christmas in the snow 
Seen our dimension baby, what a way to go 
I can't behave 
I know it's not the heathen in me 
It's just that I've been bleeding lately, 
Internally 
So turn to me 
Bite your tongue, your torrid weapon 
We could learn a useful lesson 
Ain't it great, this great depression? 
It's not a blast for me, 
It's blasphemy</field>

UK and entropy, 
I feel like its (****)in’me 
Wanna feed off the energy, 
Love living like a deity 
What a day, one day, 
And your Jesus really died for me 
I guess Jesus really tried for me 
Bodies in the Body tree, 
Bodies making chemistry 
Bodies on my family, 
Bodies in the way of me 
Bodies in the cemetery, 
And that’s the way it’s gonna be 
All we’ve ever wanted 
Is to look good naked 
Hope that someone can take it 
God save me rejection 
From my reflection, 
I want perfection 
Praying for the rapture, 
‘Cause it’s stranger getting stranger 
And everything’s contagious 
It’s the modern middle ages 
All day every day 
And if Jesus really died for me

Papa was king of the Congo 
Deep down in the jungle 
I started bangin' my first bongo 
Every monkey'd like to be 
In my place instead of me 
Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby 
I'm the king of bongo bong 
I went to the big town 
Where there is a lot of sound 
From the jungle to the city 
Looking for a bigger crown 
So I play my boogie 
For the people of big city 
But they don't go crazy 
When I'm bangin' in my boogie 
I'm the "king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong" 
Hear me when I come 
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong 
Hear me when I come 
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong 
Bangin' on my bongo all that swing belongs to me 
I'm so happy there's nobody in my place instead of me 
I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town 
They say that I'm a clown 
Making too much dirty sound 
They say there is no place for little monkey in this town 
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me 
Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie 
I'm the king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong 
Hear me when I come 
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong 
Bangin' on my bongo all that swing belongs to me 
I'm so happy there's nobody in my place instead of me 
I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town 
But I'm the king of bongo baby I'm the king of bongo bong

Let's call it a booty call baby 
If that's what it is 
I like your eyes, the way they smile 
You've got that special brew 
I been online all of the night 
Trying to get a message to you 
Cause you're like a ray of sunshine 
On an otherwise lonely night 
I'll send a carriage over it 
Sounds like a good compromise 
Do they still call it a booty call?

Yet again, it's an honor to be nominated 
Bla bla bla bla 
Well that Brits night was so fucking boring 
Past the days of yes, yes, Charlene 
Coke in the box til 7 in the morning 
Look the wrong way and we end up brawling 
When I had a bit of beef with you know who 
And I fucked a few female stars or two 
Nearly everything I said I'd end getting screwed 
Spitting at the.. 
looking rude in the news 
Oh yes, you're still rocking with the best! 
Second person on my year to have touched a breast 
I'm nearly 40 now and I'm still impressed 
Here's the midlife crisis I guess. 
Oh I recall, taking in the wonder of it all 
I'm still looking for an answer through the looking glass 
Still not concentrating at the back of the class 
No thanks sir, this one's for you! 
It's like a VD clinic, only pricks are in it 
So fucking corporate and professional and timid 
To be frank sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer! 
I still want to get laid by you right! 
Now I know I've got fat but make no mistake 
Every million that I make they bake me a cake 
So I've got plenty, 120 
Wearing rows of tweed like the... 
I still want to get you naked 
I'll see you in the summer, so glad you could make it! 
I'll be that mega white thing, fast as lightening 
In.. 
shape, but twice as frightening. 
If they can't be bothered, then I promise you this 
If they won't entertain you then I'll do my fucking best!

Still not concentrating at the back of the class 
No thanks sir, this one's for you!

Would you let me live?

I would stay up all night 
and act like heaven was a place I'd already seen 
And then you straddled me 
like a bridge going somewhere good 
And I looked at your eyes and I was like, oh my word 
This is how I fell in love 
(That was the moment when I) 
No one ever near good enough 
(That was the moment when I) 
It started years ago long before I'd ever been to see 
Us, hoping she would come and find, run and find me 
But I was somewhere out of time 
out of space, out of whack 
(Never look back, never look back) 
It's the unknown now, can never look back 
(Never look back) 
This is how I fell in love 
(That was the moment when I) 
No one ever near good enough 
(That was the moment when I) 
That's why 
(This is what it feels like) 
I fell 
(This is what it feels like) 
In love 
(This is what it feels like) 
And I hope it don't change 
And I hope it stays the same 
And I hope we do remain best friends 
Cause I love you more than life 
Take a bullet for you 
I swear, I swear 
In a heartbeat 
I'd jump in front of that gun 
And take a bullet for you baby 
(Take a bullet for you baby) 
Instantly 
(Take a bullet for you baby) 
You're why 
I fell in love 
(Take a bullet for you baby) 
And that's why 
It hurts 
(Take a bullet for you baby) 
I'd take a bullet for you 
I'd take a bullet for you 
I'd take a bullet for you 
I'd take a bullet for you 
I adore you

They have defaced the marks 
you left upon the wall 
The writing's now not there at all 
Can you stand what you stood for 
Are you more normal than before 
Goodbye to the Normals 
Goodbye to the Normals 
In your place there's just chavs 
The kids aren't alright 
they know they're born today 
Reaching out to feel the sun 
At the time it seemed like fun 
I was there when you got done 
There for two weeks by the surf 
We used to know what we were worth 
Before the Normals fell to earth 
Goodbye to the Normals 
Goodbye to the Normals 
Whatever happened to 
the mere mortals crewBurslem 
The fine young casuals 
blew a fuse and 
All the Burslem lads know 
that they're all Dads 
It meant so much to me, 
it makes me sad 
In your wake there's nowt left</field>

You've opened up doors 
In and out of their wives 
In and out of your smalls 
It's not a BAFTA you're after 
You want a million dollar lay 
By all means necessary 
You will get your way 
It all seems so easy 
But so are you 
That's what I've heard them say 
All the make up that you wear 
Can't hide the flaws 
Your work in charity for your own cause 
You won't be dating a teacher 
You'd rather shag a manic street preacher 
By all means necessary 
You will get your way 
It all seems so easy 
But so are you 
That's what I've heard them say 
Sex with a stranger 
You've been laid in a manger 
And you think he's your saviour 
Will he leaves his pager? 
You could be his daughter 
Look what he's bought ya 
But the money won't change ya 
Of that there's no danger 
Now your life's getting darker 
It's you that they're after 
Fifteen minutes a matyr 
Blame it on your father 
That dress nearly fitts ya 
Girl what's possessed you 
Can we please take your picture 
You know they'll forget ya 
Ooh yeah 
It all seems so easy 
But so are you 
That's what I've heard them say 
By all means necessary

You will get your way

You will get your way 
you don't get your way

Candice's inner business 
She wants the boys to notice 
Her rainbows, and her ponies 
She was educated 
But could not count to ten 
How she got lots of different horses 
By lots of different men 
And I say 
Liberate your sons and daughters 
The bush is high 
But in the hole there's water 
You can get some, when they give it 
Nothing sacred, but it's a living 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too loud or a little too close 
She's got a hurricane in the back of her throat 
And she thinks she's made of candy 
Ring a ring of roses 
Whoever gets the closest 
She comes and she goes 
As the war of the roses 
Mother was a victim 
Father beat the system 
By moving bricks to Brixton 
And learning how to fix them 
Liberate your sons and daughters 
The bush is high 
But in the hole there's water 
As you win 
She'll be the Hollywood love 
And if it don't feel good 
What are you doing this for 
Now tell me 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too loud or a little too close 
She's got a hurricane in the back of her throat 
And she thinks she's made of candy 
Liberate your sons and daughters 
The bush is high 
But in the hole there's water 
As you win 
She'll be the Hollywood love 
And if it don't feel good 
What are you doing it for 
What are you doing it for 
What are you doing it for... 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too loud or a little too close 
She's got a hurricane in the back of her throat 
And she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
She thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too loud or a little too close 
She's got a hurricane in the back of her throat

It’s in the heroin, the ecstasy they’re mixing lately 
Give me the boys and girls in bathrooms getting plenty friendly 
With just the thought of us debauched and in the missionary 
Watch me out of my skull 
Watch me out of my mind 
I’m out of control 
But I’m still alive 
Go get me cigarettes 
Watch the circus pass by 
Twos up on an eighth 
All back to mine 
What a feeling 
Got steep my sweet dysfunction 
I’ll keep on kneeling 
For my chemical devotion 
Let me kiss the ceiling 
It’s just a notion for you 
More than a feeling 
That sweet devotion for you 
It’s in the black sick and the choking on the blood and your tears 
It’s in the echo of the jackdaw ringing in your ears 
Watch me out of my gates 
Ill advised, unprepared 
No one gave a shit 
When nobody cared 
Another wasted talent 
But that’s just fine 
Two’s up on an eighth 
All back to mine 
What a feeling 
Got steep my sweet dysfunction 
I’ll keep on stealing 
For my chemical devotion 
Don’t kiss the ceiling 
More than a potion for you 
More than a feeling 
That sweet devotion for you 
I can’t take the fever from you 
I don’t want to neither 
They’re dropping science on you 
You just need a breather 
I’ll be looking over you 
Overlooking me 
It’s all in God’s time 
All back to mine 
What a feeling 
Got steep my sweet dysfunction 
So appealing 
This chemical devotion 
Got to kiss the ceiling 
More than an ocean for you 
More than a feeling 
That sweet devotion for you 
Shallow in the deep end 
Got steep my sweet dysfunction 
And I can depend 
On chemical devotion 
It’s like my best friend 
That keeps the world in motion 
I’ve got to defend

I found myself breaking the girl 
The king is half undressed 
She’s not my saviour 
(I don’t want your love) 
Don’t take my seed 
(It’s not your love that I need) 
You’re in no danger caressing me 
But you’re talking to a man I’m not supposed to be 
And the clothes remain the same 
I fear to face the walk of shame 
Been nice to know you 
I’m soaking in the morning rain 
Find my car forgot your name 
Been nice to hold you 
Don’t feel small 
When I don’t call 
If I could talk I’d tell you 
If I ever did don’t answer kid 
I’ve only lies to sell you 
I’ll be your stranger 
(I don’t want your love) 
If you’re in need 
(It’s not your love that I need) 
It’s odd behaviour seducing me 
I’m a million miles away and she’s too blind to see 
And the clothes remain the same 
I fear to face the walk of shame 
Been nice to know you 
I’m soaking in the morning rain 
Find my car forgot your name 
Been nice to hold you 
Step on board the gravy train 
Same old faces different names 
You bet your life I will complain 
Cause I’m a sensitive boy 
The real McCoy 
Don’t wanna stick me on your bed post 
And I never really will forget you 
I’m sorry dear have I met you 
All that you take from me is coffee and tea and sympathy 
And the clothes remain the same 
I fear to face the walk of sham

Been nice to hold you 
I have my needs 
I hope she leaves

Mama put your popcorn down, he's turning to the 
band, yeah he's running his legs off, ladies 
and gentlemen Mr Robbie Williams" Just because your dyslexic 
Doesn't mean your not fake 
We know you're not that stupid 
You'll marry someone rich 
Bet you won't steal his watch 
When your down by near his crotch 
That'll explain the itch 
You were such a lying bitch I know you hold my suitcase 
Down in Kensington 
And you were screwing Ewen 
When I wasn't in. 
Did it to me, you'll do it to him 
Your friends just gave me grief 
I will make this brief 
You were such a lousy thief 
You were such a lousy thief 
But you were good in bed 
You were good in bed 
So good in bed Now you tell my girlfriend 
That I'll never change 
You've been up since Wednesday 
Don't you find that strange 
You're ex-boyfriend is deranged 
You'll tell them down in Browns Haven't been for years 
It's full of coke and tears 
Full of coke and tears 
Full of coke and tears 
But you were good in bed 
Good in bed [Elvis Impersonator - Spoken] 
"Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you on 
behalf of Mr Robbie Williams and the band, you've 
been a fantasticaudience 
Robbie's opened his heart 
out to you tonight andyou've really taken him on

Remember the name and wheneverhe's in the 
neighbourhood, you get yourselves down there 
alright.It's been a great evening, thank you very 
much

In lama land, there’s a one man band 
And he’ll toot his flute for you 
Come fly with me, let’s take off in the blue 
Once I get you up there, 
Where the air is rarefied 
We’ll just glide 
Starry eyed 
Once I get you up there 
I’ll be holding you so near 
You may here, angels cheer - just because we’re together 
Weather wise it’s such a lovely day 
Just say the words, and we’ll beat the birds 
Down to acapulco bay 
It’s perfect, for a flying honeymoon - they say 
Come fly with me, let’s fly let’s fly away 
Hit it jack

Is this a long range effort, cause I'll pitch a tent 
I'm kinda used to feeling cold 
Should I walk naked should I bear my sould 
Won't you help me fill this hole 
And what I'm trying to say is be the one 
Love me anyway...though I'm too far gone 
Come take me over - I'm riddled with my past 
Come take me over - is that too much to ask 
Before I leave this town - love me or put me down 
Got semi heaven, I wanna fall in love 
You said the walking wounded could 
I know I've sent the 'morrows to an early grave 
Is this the price I have to pay. 
What I'm try'na say, if you could touch 
The love I fantasize, is that too much 
Come take me over - I'm riddled with my past 
Come take me over - Is that too much to ask? 
Before I leave this twon - love me 
Take me to the shops, tie me up and abuse me 
I'm looking good, so how could you refuse me 
Say I'm so special, why ain't you cooking for two? 
I'll meet your mum, I'll meet your friends 
When you coming down, 
I'll love you through the bends 
I know I'm special, but why ain't you cooking for two? 
Is this a long range effort, cause I'll pitch a tent 
I'm kinda used to feeling cold 
Should I walk naked, should I bare my soul 
Won't you help me fill this hole 
Guess what I'm trying to say, is be the one 
Love me anyway...though I'm too far gone 
Come take me over - I'm riddled with my past 
Come take me over - Is that too much to ask? 
Before I leave this town - love me

I guess what I'm try'na say, 
is what I've never known 
Can't use it anyway, just give me love 
Come take me over - Gonna be the last 
Come take me over - If she don't meet this task 
Before I leave this town - 
Love me or put me down

Such a saint but such a whore 
So self aware so full of shit 
So indecisive so adamant 
I'm contemplating thinking about thinking 
It's overrated to just get another drink in 
Watch me come undone 
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street 
Pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep 
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet 
Because I'm scum 
And I'm your son 
I come undone 
I come undone 
So rock and roll so corporate suit 
So damn ugly, so damn cute 
So well trained, so animal 
So need your love, so fuck you all 
I'm not scared of dying I just don't want to 
If I stopped lying I'd just disappoint you 
I come undone 
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street 
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep 
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet 
Because I'm scum 
And I'm your son 
I've come undone 
So write another ballad 
Mix it on a Wednesday 
Sell it on a Thursday 
Buy a yacht by Saturday 
It's a love song 
A love song 
Do another interview 
Sing a bunch of lies 
Tell about celebrities that I despise 
And sing love songs 
We sing love songs 
So sincere 
So sincere 
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street 
Pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep 
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet 
Because I'm scum

I've come undone 
I've come undone 
I've come undone 
I've come undone 
I am scum 
Love your son 
I am scum 
Love your son

my love song

my sad song, my love song</field>

Tell God he's got a dirty angel

I'm not ashamed to say that I am frightened 
Hold me now, I used to heal like lightning 
Are yours the last eyes that I'll ever see 
Staring into me? 
[Pre-Chorus] 
Was I just because 
A mistake in love 
Two people who stop trying enough 
Don't want a brand new life 
This one's just right 
Why would I throw it all away? 
[Chorus] 
Won't you hold me now? 
Just before I stop breathing 
I know I promised I wouldn't leave here without you 
Please, don't let me go 
While they play the last song ever 
The last chance to hold each other forever 
Hold me now, I've still got words worth hearing 
I just wanna be a human being 
Hold me now, we all know what I'm fearing 
I think I see the light, am I disappearing? 
[Pre-Chorus] 
Was I just because 
A mistake in love 
Two people who stop trying enough 
Don't want a brand new life 
This one's just right 
Why would I throw it all away? 
[Chorus] 
Won't you hold me now? 
Just before I stop breathing 
I know I promised I wouldn't leave here without you 
Please, don't let me go 
While they play the last song ever 
The last chance to hold each other forever 
[Chorus] 
Won't you hold me now? 
Just before I stop breathing 
I know I promised I wouldn't leave here without you 
Please, don't let me go 
While they play the last song ever 
The last chance to hold each other forever

Hold me now 
Remember how we were at the beginning</field>

You're coming down already 
This howl wants see us through 
Nothing I can change now 
I've learnt to lie to you 
 
What happened to me 
What happened to you 
You were putting me on 
I was leading you through 
Lie to me 
I always have a vision 
That love would see us through 
What's the point of wishing 
When my dreams depend on you 
Gonna needs a porter 
Your friends can get around 
And you can tell the story 
On how I let you down

I'm much too young to be cynical 
It's you that make me miserable 
Can you tell a lie through a smile 
In bed we're always deviant 
And I'm the one who comes too late 
This seems not inside of my mind my mind 
I always have an alibi 
And you allow me there 
But tonight I have no concience 
So what comes after that

Hello Deceptacon, this will not be going away 
From all of us there to all over here 
We wish you all of the best all of the year 
She said, well, he's never been quite right 
And I know we'll be stepping on eggshells tonight 
And all over Britain, we wait for permission 
To form another queue 
We stand in position though somebody's missing 
And that somebody's you but what can I do? 
I love you but I don't like you right now, 
Was all she had to say 
Hello Deceptacon, I will not be going away 
From all of us here to all over there 
We wish you all of the best all of the year 
She said, only you can make it right 
But I've stopped stepping on eggshells tonight 
And all over Britain, we wait for permission 
To form another queue 
We stand in position, though somebody's missin' 
And that somebody's you but what can I do? 
Send my best to all concerned 
I know I've been a gracious host 
Goodbye Deceptacon 
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? 
And what are you to me? 
What can I do for you? 
What can you do for me? 
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? 
And what are you to me?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When I look you in the lies, 
Something deep inside me dies, 
'Cause I know you won't get better, better, better... 
You'd rather be right than be loved, 
The only thing I understood 
Nothing's ever good enough 
I stumble through the words as they're leaving me, 
Tremble at the side of Your Majesty, 
And I cut myself just to get them out 
This time I'll be different, I promise you, 
This time I'll be special, you know I will, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes 
This time I'll be better, I want you to know, 
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes... 
You took my youth, you took my health, 
And if you're not here I'll fight myself 
You're supposed to make this better, better, better 
No self-control and no reason why, 
If I don't change, then we both die, 
This is it for you and I 
Blisters at the end of my fingertips, 
Praying to a god I don't think exist 
Will you listen now? 
Can you forgive me somehow? 
This time I'll be different, I promise you, 
This time I'll be special, you know I will, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes 
This time I'll be better, I want you to know, 
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes... 
Closer now to the end, 
If love was the answer, 
Then hope was the question? 
Closer now, let's pretend 
We've never been out here before 
This time I'll be different, I promise you, 
This time I'll be special, you know I will, 
Don't leave with me in your eyes 
This time I'll be better, I want you to know, 
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes...</field>

            <field name="lyrics">We're the futurists in the bistro 
Where the music is for weirdos, 
We like it different 
We like it strange 
In our own way 
We haven't changed 
I got my eyes made up at the bus stop 
By my girlfriend 
And you know what, 
She likes me different 
She likes me strange 
In her own way 
She's just the same 
Psycho evolution, your pollution 
Makes it difficult for weirdos 
Just another humanoid reaction 
To the voices in this town 
Every Saturday, at the plaza 
Guess the gender 
Unless you'd rather 
He is a lesbian, but that's OK 
She is the centre of attention for another day 
In the universe 
We are magenta 
You can join us 
If you enter, 
Because you're different 
And you are strange 
In your own way 
You're just the same 
Psycho evolution, your pollution 
Makes it difficult for weirdos 
Just another humanoid reaction 
To the voices in this town 
Time isn't lost 
Where devotion is 
I never wasted a life 
Space is the place 
Where the social is 
Far from the safe and the norm 
In the offstream 
They call it cabaret 
But they'll say that, 
Won't they? 
I want it different 
I like it strange 
In my own way 
I haven't changed 
It's insulting 
To be mislead 
By the hairdo 
Of the godhead 
They show irreverence 
But that's OK 
We are the centre of the universe, anyway 
Psycho evolution, your pollution 
Makes it difficult for weirdos 
Just another humanoid reaction 
To the voices in this town 
Psycho evolution, your pollution 
Makes it difficult for weirdos 
Just another humanoid reaction

Going in an hour
