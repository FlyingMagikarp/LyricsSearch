&lt;br /&gt;That man &lt;br /&gt;She loved that man &lt;br /&gt;For all his life &lt;br /&gt;But now we meet to take him flowers &lt;br /&gt;And only god knows why &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For what's the use in pressing palms  &lt;br /&gt;When children fade in mother's arms &lt;br /&gt;It's a cruel world, we've so much to lose &lt;br /&gt;And what we have to learn, we rarely choose &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So if it's god who took her son &lt;br /&gt;He cannot be the one living in her mind &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take care my love, she said &lt;br /&gt;Don't think that god is dead &lt;br /&gt;Take care my love, she said &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You have been loved &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I was weak, forgive me &lt;br /&gt;But I was terrified &lt;br /&gt;You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love &lt;br /&gt;The kind that makes devils cry &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;That man &lt;br /&gt;She loved that man &lt;br /&gt;For all his life &lt;br /&gt;But now we meet to take him flowers &lt;br /&gt;And only god knows why &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For what's the use in pressing palms  &lt;br /&gt;When children fade in mother's arms &lt;br /&gt;It's a cruel world, we've so much to lose &lt;br /&gt;And what we have to learn, we rarely choose &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;So what's the use in pressing palms  &lt;br /&gt;If you won't keep such love from harm &lt;br /&gt;It's a cruel world, you've so much to prove &lt;br /&gt;And heaven help the ones who wait for you &lt;br /&gt;

friend &lt;br /&gt;And our love would never end &lt;br /&gt;How long before I had your trust again &lt;br /&gt;I opened up the doors when it was cold outside &lt;br /&gt;Hopin' that you'd find your own way in &lt;br /&gt;But how can I protect you &lt;br /&gt;Or try not to neglect you &lt;br /&gt;When you won't take the love I have to give &lt;br /&gt;I bought me an illusion &lt;br /&gt;An I put it on the wall &lt;br /&gt;I let it fill my head with dreams &lt;br /&gt;And I had to have them all &lt;br /&gt;But oh the taste is never so sweet &lt;br /&gt;As what you'd believe it is- &lt;br /&gt;Well I guess it never is &lt;br /&gt;It's these prejudiced illusions &lt;br /&gt;That pump the blood &lt;br /&gt;To the heart of the biz &lt;br /&gt;You know I never thought &lt;br /&gt;That it could take so long &lt;br /&gt;You know I never knew how to be strong &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I let you shape me &lt;br /&gt;But I feel as though you raped me &lt;br /&gt;'Cause you climbed inside my world &lt;br /&gt;And in my songs &lt;br /&gt;So now I've closed the door &lt;br /&gt;To keep the cold outside &lt;br /&gt;Seems somehow I've found the will to live &lt;br /&gt;But how can I forget you &lt;br /&gt;Or try not to reject you &lt;br /&gt;When we both know it takes time to forgive &lt;br /&gt;Sweetness is a virtue &lt;br /&gt;And you lost your virtue long ago &lt;br /&gt;You know I'd like to hurt you &lt;br /&gt;But my conscience always tells me no &lt;br /&gt;You could sell your body on the street &lt;br /&gt;To anyone whom you might meet &lt;br /&gt;Who'd love to try and get inside &lt;br /&gt;And bust your innocence open wide &lt;br /&gt;'Cause my baby's got a locomotive &lt;br /&gt;My baby's gone off the track &lt;br /&gt;My baby's got a locomotive &lt;br /&gt;Got ta peel the bitch off my back &lt;br /&gt;I know it looks like I'm insane &lt;br /&gt;Take a closer look I'm not to blame &lt;br /&gt;No &lt;br /&gt;Gonna have some fun with my frustration &lt;br /&gt;Gonna watch the big screen in my head &lt;br /&gt;I'd rather take a detour &lt;br /&gt;'Cause this road ain't gettin' clearer &lt;br /&gt;Your train of thought has cut me off again &lt;br /&gt;Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one &lt;br /&gt;Better tame that boy for he's a man &lt;br /&gt;Sweetheart don't make me laugh &lt;br /&gt;You's gettin' too big for your pants &lt;br /&gt;And I's think maybe you should &lt;br /&gt;Cut out while you can &lt;br /&gt;You can use you illusion- &lt;br /&gt;Let it take you where it may &lt;br /&gt;We live and learn &lt;br /&gt;And then sometimes it's best to walk away &lt;br /&gt;Me I'm just here hangin' on &lt;br /&gt;It's my only place to stay at least &lt;br /&gt;For now anyway &lt;br /&gt;I've worked too hard for my illusions &lt;br /&gt;Just to throw them all away &lt;br /&gt;I'm taking time for quiet consolation &lt;br /&gt;In passing by this love that's passed away &lt;br /&gt;I know it's never easy- &lt;br /&gt;So why should you believe me &lt;br /&gt;When I've always got so many things to say &lt;br /&gt;Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made &lt;br /&gt;'Cause playful hearts &lt;br /&gt;Can sometimes be enraged &lt;br /&gt;You know I tried to wake you- &lt;br /&gt;I mean how long could it take you &lt;br /&gt;To open up your eyes and turn the page &lt;br /&gt;Kindness is a treasure- &lt;br /&gt;And it's one towards me you've seldom shown &lt;br /&gt;So I'll say it for good measure &lt;br /&gt;To all the ones like you I've known &lt;br /&gt;Ya know I'd like to shave your head &lt;br /&gt;And all my friends could paint it red &lt;br /&gt;'Cause love to me's a two way street &lt;br /&gt;An all I really want is peace &lt;br /&gt;But my baby's got a locomotive &lt;br /&gt;My baby's gone off the track &lt;br /&gt;My baby's got a locomotive &lt;br /&gt;Got ta peel the bitch off my back &lt;br /&gt;I know it looks like I'm insane &lt;br /&gt;Take a closer look I'm not to blame &lt;br /&gt;No &lt;br /&gt;Affection is a blessing &lt;br /&gt;Can you find it in your sordid heart &lt;br /&gt;I tried to keep this thing ta-gether &lt;br /&gt;But the tremor tore my pad apart &lt;br /&gt;Yeah I know it's hard to face &lt;br /&gt;When all we've worked for's gone to waste &lt;br /&gt;But you're such a stupid woman &lt;br /&gt;And I'm such a stupid man &lt;br /&gt;But love like time's got its own plans &lt;br /&gt;'Cause my baby's got a locomotive &lt;br /&gt;My baby's gone off the track &lt;br /&gt;My baby's got a locomotive &lt;br /&gt;Got ta peel the bitch off my back &lt;br /&gt;I know it looks like I'm insane &lt;br /&gt;Take a closer look I'm not to blame &lt;br /&gt;Yeah &lt;br /&gt;If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane &lt;br /&gt;Love's so strange</field> &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;She wouldn't say goodbye &lt;br /&gt;But then it seems that I &lt;br /&gt;Had seen it in her eyes. &lt;br /&gt;And it might not be wise &lt;br /&gt;I'd still have to try &lt;br /&gt;With all the love I have inside &lt;br /&gt;I can't deny &lt;br /&gt;I just can't let it die &lt;br /&gt;Cause her heart's just like mine &lt;br /&gt;And she holds her pain inside &lt;br /&gt;So if you ask me why &lt;br /&gt;She wouldn't say goodbye &lt;br /&gt;I know somewhere inside &lt;br /&gt;There is a special light &lt;br /&gt;Still shining bright &lt;br /&gt;And even on the darkest night &lt;br /&gt;She can't deny &lt;br /&gt;So if she's somewhere near me &lt;br /&gt;I hope to God she hears me &lt;br /&gt;There's no one else &lt;br /&gt;Could ever make me feel &lt;br /&gt;I'm so alive &lt;br /&gt;I hoped she'd never leave me &lt;br /&gt;Please God you must believe me &lt;br /&gt;I've searched the universe &lt;br /&gt;And found myself &lt;br /&gt;Within' her eyes &lt;br /&gt;No matter how I try &lt;br /&gt;They say it's all a lie &lt;br /&gt;So what's the use of my &lt;br /&gt;Confessions to a crime &lt;br /&gt;Of passions that won't die &lt;br /&gt;In my heart &lt;br /&gt;So if she's somewhere near me &lt;br /&gt;I hope to God she hears me &lt;br /&gt;There's no one else &lt;br /&gt;Could ever make me feel &lt;br /&gt;I'm so alive &lt;br /&gt;I hoped she'd never leave me &lt;br

&lt;br /&gt;Had seen it in her eyes &lt;br /&gt;And now it seems that I &lt;br /&gt;Gave up my ghost of pride &lt;br /&gt;I'll never say goodbye</field> &lt;br /&gt;        </doc> &lt;br /&gt;
