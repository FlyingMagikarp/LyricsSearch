You made a monster of me 
Through all your wicked lies 
Forever tortured by you 
Abandoned at death's door 
Until I said no more 
 
Don't look away 
You're just a former regret of mine 
And when you want, just look away 
You're just a former regret of mine 
Erasing now 
 
You made a rock star of me 
Gave me this wicked life 
Paid to be tortured by you 
A life I now abhor 
And still I say, no more 
 
Don't look away 
You're just a former regret of mine 
Don't look away 
You're just a former regret of mine 
 
Think over all of the shit in your mind 
Think over and come to grip with it 
Think over all of the shit in your little twisted sick mind, all said 
 
Think over all of the shit in your mind 
Think over and come to grip with it 
Think over all of the shit in your little twisted sick mind 
 
Don't look away 
You're just a former regret of mine 
And when you want, just look away 
You're just a former regret of mine 
Erasing now</field>

            <field name="lyrics">They are the ghosts of innocence 
That have awoken from my dreams 
Welcome to your nightmare 
Say good-bye to everything 
All your past obscenities 
They have determined where I stand 
Echoing cries, in the time that it began 
 
Hear me now 
Feel my blade 
There is no more time for apologies 
Malevolent emotions 
Take hold of me 
Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side 
Death is an old friend of mine 
 
You can't escape your judgment 
I hear them calling out your name 
Do not beg for mercy now 
You never showed any to them 
Embrace your final punishment 
There's not a soul to hear you scream 
I have to thank you for letting out the animal in me 
 
Hear me now 
Feel my blade 
There is no more time for apologies 
Malevolent emotions 
Take hold of me 
Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side 
Death is an old friend of mine 
 
The blood became alive 
When I was trapped inside 
And I can feel the dark passenger coming 
My mother's blood and mine 
Uniquely intertwined 
Help me father put your memory from my mind 
My hunger to destroy 
When I was just a boy 
It pulled me deeper into something that I now enjoy 
The ritual begins 
Evil will meet it's end 
In your destruction I will finally feel whole again 
 
There is no more time for apologies 
Malevolent emotions 
Take hold of me 
Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side 
Death is an old friend of mine 
 
I have become your nightmare 
Say good-bye to everything</field>

You've committed a terrible crime 
You've stepped over the line and you'd better be running for your life 
Fucked over again, I even called you a friend 
A mistake I won't be repeating 
I just don't understand how you can even continue to deny 
 
You know why 
(You don't remember why) 
Don't you pretend that you don't know why 
(You fucking parasite) 
Because you're living through association that has been getting you high 
You sell your soul for just a taste of my life 
 
Now what a surprise, to discover the lies 
You'll be telling again in no time 
You just don't realize they'll come back and be fucking up your life 
In trouble again, I just don't understand 
This whole pattern that keeps repeating 
You know you'll do it again and admit you can step into the light 
 
You know why

Don't you pretend that you don't know why

That's enough of all your taunting 
Seems I can't remove you from my mind 
Don't you know that sometimes 
I wish they'd kill me for wanting you 
I will sit alone in silence 
Can't allow the meaning I can find 
Will you be defeated when they 
Kill me for wanting you 
 
I can't believe that my sanity 
Lies in abandoning you 
I can't recall the helpless times 
I've been betrayed by you 
 
Sickened from wanting you 
Frightened of finding the truth 
Don't say anymore 
Now my mind isn't changing 
This reckoning's long overdue 
 
All past the walls around me 
In the prison of my own design 
Will I win my freedom if they 
Kill me for wanting you 
Maybe the arms of Hell will hound me 
Just as long as I remain confined 
I will be completed when they 
Kill me for wanting you 
 
I can't believe that my sanity 
Lies in abandoning you 
I can't recall the helpless times 
I've been betrayed by you 
 
Sickened from wanting you 
Frightened of finding the truth 
Don't say anymore 
Now my mind isn't changing 
This reckoning's long overdue 
 
So I have determined I am undone 
Will I bury another problem 
In the graveyard you allowed me to find 
So I have determined I am no one 
When I finally cling to something 
And it's never been tied to 
Every single memory of you 
 
Sickened from wanting you 
Frightened of finding the truth 
Don't say anymore 
Now my mind isn't changing 
This reckoning's long overdue 
 
So I have determined I am undone 
Will I bury another problem 
In the graveyard you allowed me to find</field>

Raging inside

Remove the sickness

Show me the light 
 
Two worlds collide 
Whenever I step to the front

I swallow my pride 
But never forget what I want 
Starting to long for a time 
I bury the war in my mind 
 
Two worlds are warring in me 
Both sides are losing 
Patience has died 
None of the mourner in me 
Drowns my conviction 
Regions divide 
 
Two worlds are warring in me 
Killing us now 
Show me the light 
 
Two worlds collide 
Whenever I step to the front 
I look for a new place to hide 
While tearing my color away 
I swallow my pride 
But never forget what I want 
Starting to long for a time 
I bury the war in my mind 
 
Give me a sign 
Tell me when it's time 
Show me the light 
Tell me when it's fucking over 
 
Two worlds collide

Ahh, Ahhh 
Burning now I bring you Hell! 
 
Ah, Ah 
Oh, burning now I bring you Hell! 
 
Read me tonight, when the warnings said leave a shudder upon you 
Running from all that you feared in your life 
Soul of the night, when the sun mislead paint a horror upon you 
Marking the moment, displaying in my ghost of a life! 
And I can't get round the way you left me out in the open 
To leave me to die! 
So how can I, forget the way you lead me through the path into Heaven 
To leave me behind! 
 
Now I can't stay behind 
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance 
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell 
Burning now I bring you Hell! 
 
Ah, Ah 
Oh, burning now I bring you Hell! 
 
Free me tonight, as the animal kings breathe their terror upon you 
Caught in the moment, engaging in my 
Bloodlust tonight, now I can't control my venom's flow 
Get back from me demon, or be exorcised! 
 
Now I can't stay behind 
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance 
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell 
Burning now I bring you Hell! 
 
All my emotion and all my integrity 
All that you've taken from me 
All my emotion and all my integrity 
All that you've taken from me 
 
Now I can't stay behind 
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance 
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell 
Soul of the night, I know 
Now I can't stay behind 
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance 
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell 
Burning now I bring you Hell!</field>

My resolve is weakening 
Pounding on the doors of my mind 
Its nearly overpowering 
I cannot begin to describe 
The hunger that I feel again 
Run if you intend to survive 
For the beast is coming to life 
 
Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight 
Death approaches on this night 
 
For the animals soul is mine 
We will be completed right before your eyes 
I have no control this time 
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight 
 
I can feel the calling again 
The primal need is filling me 
Changes are about to begin 
And now my blood is boiling 
I can see the fear in your eyes 
But you cant bring yourself to scream 
Time to shed the mortal disguise 
The beast is coming to life 
Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight 
Death approaches on this night 
 
For the animals soul is mine 
We will be completed right before your eyes 
I have no control this time 
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight 
 
We begin the hunt tonight 
Til the power courses the creatures take flight 
When the kill is close and I will be satisfied 
For the smell of fear tonight 
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied 
You're mine 
 
For the animals soul is mine 
We will be completed right before your eyes 
I have no control this time 
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight 
 
For the animals soul is mine 
And the world around will never hear your cries 
An unholy crime 
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight</field>

Barely even remember when 
There was nothing left to hide and 
She has found a way inside, then 
I was forced to walk alone 
Living in an empty home 
All I wanted was to hide and 
Try to numb the ache inside 
And I'm still afraid of the light 
And a thousand voices share their laughter at my demise 
 
Now if I am to survive 
The infection must die 
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive 
The infection must die 
 
Nothing left but a broken man 
Terrified of everything 
Nothing left of his foolish pride, his 
Fond memories slowly die, then 
As he wakes again alone 
Still a prisoner in his home 
Ready to allow the dark to 
Penetrate his broken heart 
And I'm still afraid of the light (of the light) 
And a thousand voices share their laughter at his demise 
 
Now if I am to survive 
The infection must die 
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive 
The infection must die 
 
Now if I am to survive (now I must survive) 
The infection must die 
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive 
The infection must die 
 
This is where I draw the line (draw the line) 
The infection must die (This infection must die) 
Give me release from this demon of mine (demon of mine) 
This infection must die

Angel of death has come and ripped you from my life

Hope that I get to see you on the other side 
 
Blue sky has turned to blackest night 
Now you're gone, it just isn't right

I'm beaten down, drained emotionally

Save our last goodbye 
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter

I've come to talk with you again 
Because a vision softly creeping 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 
Still remains 
Within the sound of silence 
 
In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone 
'Neath the halo of a street lamp 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light 
That split the night 
And touched the sound of silence 
 
And in the naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people, maybe more 
People talking without speaking 
People hearing without listening 
People writing songs that voices never share 
And no one dared 
Disturb the sound of silence 
 
Fools, said I, you do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows 
Hear my words that I might teach you 
Take my arms that I might reach you 
But my words, like silent raindrops fell 
And echoed in the wells of silence 
 
And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made 
And the sign flashed out its warning 
In the words that it was forming 
And the sign said, the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls 
And tenement halls 
And whispered in the sounds of silence</field>

Leave you cornered and alone 
So what you waiting for, tell me what you waiting for 
Let them all be reminded 
 
Don't let them undermine 
Your dreams can never be stolen 
Don't leave them stagnant, rotting on the vine 
Say goodbye to anyone who tries 
To bleed you dry, you will show them 
You're blessed with an unlimited supply 
 
Leave nothing left behind 
 
So what you waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for 
Don't stand by and deny it 
So what you waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for 
Break new ground and defy it 
Don't let the world outside 
Leave you cornered and alone 
So what you waiting for, tell me what you waiting for 
Let them all be reminded 
 
(So what you waiting for?) 
 
So what you waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for 
Don't stand by and deny it 
So what you waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for 
Break new ground and defy it 
Don't let the world outside 
Leave you cornered and alone 
So what you waiting for, tell me what you waiting for 
Let them all be reminded 
 
So what you waiting for? 
So what you waiting for?</field>

You once were someone I could dignify (ah, ah) 
A guiding force, in which I thought could rely 
I watched as you began to metamorphosize (ah) 
Can't face it anymore, it's eating me alive 
 
I'm not able to recognize 
Where does the answer lie? 
You're no longer the same 
Is there nothing more that I can do? 
 
Who who who

Who who who the hell are you?

Who who who the fuck are you? 
 
You were someone in whom I could confide (ah, ah) 
But you pushed me further away with every single lie 
You used to have a soul, but it has surely died (ah) 
What happened when did you turn to the other side? 
 
No longer able to recognize 
For every word's a lie 
You are forever changed 
And there's nothing more that I can do 
 
Who who who

Oh 
 
You and I, we were once so 
You and I, it was once incredible 
You and I, we were once so 
You and I, we were indivisible 
 
You and I, were once two of a kind 
Where did all your innocence go? 
Now I wonder how it happened 
 
That you and I, we were once so 
You and I, we were once inseparable 
You and I, we were once like Gemini 
It was undeniable 
 
You and I, we were once two of a kind 
Where did my deliverance go? 
Can there be a mend to this divide? 
 
I'm not able to recognize

You're no longer the same

            <field name="lyrics">I hear the voices echoing around me 
Angered eyes that don't even know who I am 
Looking to kill again (they will kill again) 
As the unknown enemies surround me 
Wicked laughter resonates inside my head 
And I am filled with dread (and adrenaline) 
What did I do, why do I deserve this? 
So we're different, why do I deserve to die now? 
Give me a reason why? 
 
Then it all goes a blur, let instinct take flight 
Find my hands on his throat, yet hear myself say 
 
Tell me now, who taught you how to hate? 
'Cause it isn't in your blood 
Not a part of what you're made 
So let this be understood 
Somebody taught you how to hate 
When you live this way, you become 
Dead to everyone 
 
A father's pride, my son walking beside me 
I look around and marvel at the children play 
In perfect disarray (so innocent) 
No judgment, pure exhilaration 
Not to wipe the colours of it on their minds 
Nothing realigned (all different) 
There's always one who plants an evil seed and 
creatures here to pull you to the other side 
Into a world of lies 
 
Everything is unsure when you lost your sight 
Can it still be if you're what made you this way? 
 
Tell me now, who taught you how to hate? 
'Cause it isn't in your blood 
Not a part of what you're made 
So let this be understood 
Somebody taught you how to hate 
When you live this way you become 
Dead to everyone (you're not anyone) 
 
Oh, oh 
 
Lost all innocence 
Invested in arrogance, you burn all your life (no telling you) 
No deliverance, consumed by the best events of hate 
Don't deny 
Deep in your heart does it still remain? 
Do you think you can bring it back to life again? 
Is it still in your soul? (no saving you) 
Where's the deviant? 
The unholy remnant that has made you this way? 
Lay before the disdain 
 
Tell me who, who taught you how to hate 
because it isn't your blood 
Not a part of what you're made 
So let this be understood 
Somebody taught you how to hate 
When you live this way you become (you become) 
 
Tell me now, who taught you how to hate 
'Cause it isn't in your blood 
Not a part of what you're made

The burden you bear can cripple you 
A ravenous cancer, eating your soul 
Lost within a world beyond your control 
So tonight, let there be a reckoning 
Let this moment empower you to no end 
Let the doubts within you, start to descend 
 
Take the path that the weak ones demonize 
Look around and begin to realize

            <field name="lyrics">The monster shattered the day 
In a place where innocents play 
I was mourning as the headlines shouted his name 
They didn't waste any time 
I was disgusted when the madman's image appeared at the top of the screen 
Some were barely alive 
Too many didn't survive 
Still they kept repeating headlines shouting the name 
Do they not realize 
The future demons with the hope of becoming the one at the top of the screen? 
 
They've thrown morality away 
With such depravity, I must say 
You made sure the world will remember the name 
But didn't the thought even enter your mind 
You'd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life 
 
The pictures drove me insane 
Can't get them out of my brain 
You made certain they were right at the top of the page 
You disrespected the dead 
When the only name was of the one who committed the murder at the top of the page 
The madman watching with glee 
As the herd of innocents flee 
They saw it all unfold right on the face of the screen 
Perhaps they could be the one 
Who'd become famous for the acts of terror reflected on the face of the screen? 
 
You've thrown morality away 
With such depravity, I must say 
You made sure the world will remember the name 
But didn't the thought even enter your mind 
You'd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life 
And I call you a pimp, as you whore the insane 
The damage you caused, you cannot rectify 
You've inspired new legions of monsters determined to take more life 
 
Take a look around 
Listen to the sound 
Feel it on the ground 
Fear has come in a wave 
Just another gathering of helpless innocents forced into the grave 
Listen to me now 
Are you with me now 
Can you tell me how these vultures still glorify them 
Lets defy them

That we're over all the violence 
Are we done with this? Put it all to rest 
Turn the screams now into silence 
Will you be a man? Can you make a stand? 
Will you own up or deny it all? 
All the time we lost, was it worth the cost  
Of breaking a family in two? 
Destroyed all we knew 
 
A tyrant, so defiant 
Lonely as your heart is sinking 
Consequences, no defenses 
If only you had been thinking 
Compliant, for a moment 
Why did both of us have to believe that we were right? 
Tyrant! 
 
Can I clear my mind? Leave it all behind 
Start to pick up all the pieces 
Can I hide the scars? Just like prison bars 
That have always seemed to confine me 
Will we save it all? Even from the fall 
Is there time left for revival 
Can I be convinced that some hope exists? 
With these wounds cut so deep in my soul 
Can we become whole? 
 
A tyrant, so defiant 
Lonely as your heart is sinking 
Consequences, no defenses 
If only you had been thinking 
Compliant, for a moment 
Why did both of us have to believe that we were right? 
Tyrant! 
 
There's so many things that I wanted to say 
But the love turned to hate we kept pushing away 
And the words that came out turned it into a mess 
And it's like pulling teeth cause you'll never confess 
Now the damage is done 
The hurt and the pain when nobody has won 
Have we forgot it's your blood inside of my veins 
That feeds my heart 
 
A tyrant, so defiant 
Lonely as your heart is sinking 
Consequences, no defenses 
If only you had been thinking 
Compliant, for a moment 
Why did both of us have to believe that we were right?

It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity 
Hear the innocent voices scream 
As their tormentors laugh through all of it 
No forgiveness from all I've seen 
The degradation I cannot forget 
 
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight 
For judgement falls upon you at first light 
 
I'm the hand of God 
I'm the dark messiah 
I'm the vengeful one

In the blackest moment of a dying world 
What have you become 
(Look inside and see what you're becoming) 
 
As the violence surges 
And the teeming masses have been terrorized 
The human predators all gone mad 
Are reaping profits born from their demise 
The rabid media plays their roles 
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise 
Only too eager to sell their souls 
For the apocalypse must be televised 
 
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight

I'm still surrounded by the "new sound" I've had enough and I'm ready to go A stranglehold throughout the world now The new obsession will fade in time I thin reminder of the past now All convoluted, hardly ready to go Their whines and moans will never last now I think you've given us our fill this time Come on, can't you just leave it alone It doesn't have any soul Just find a thing of your own And stop pretending to know As the countless numbers hunger For worldwide renown All the pimping sons of plunder Will roll up their sleeves All searching for the answers They don't even care to know Give it to me Give it to me You like it? As it's blown apart Hundreds thrown away Makes me question, just what I believe Brothers torn apart Mindless drones enslaved Makes me search for an answer I don't want to know It's like a plague from below Killing all that I know One hundred voices the same Drench their sorrow in fame As the countless numbers hunger For worldwide renown All the pimping sons of plunder Will roll up their sleeves All searching for the answers They don't even care to know Give it to me Give it to me You like it? As the countless numbers hunger For worldwide renown All the pimping sons of plunder Will roll up their sleeves All searching for the answers They don't even care to know Give it to me Give it to me You like it?

            <field name="lyrics">How can you see into my eyes 
like open doors 
leading you down into my core 
where I've become so numb? 
Without a soul; 
my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold, 
until you find it there and lead it back home. 
(Wake me up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(I can't wake up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(Save me 
) 
Call my name and save me from the dark. 
(Wake me up 
) 
Bid my blood to run. 
(I can't wake up 
) 
Before I come undone. 
(Save me 
) 
Save me from the nothing I've become. 
Now that I know what I'm without 
you can't just leave me. 
Breathe into me and make me real. 
Bring me to life. 
(Wake me up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(I can't wake up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(Save me 
) 
Call my name and save me from the dark. 
(Wake me up 
) 
Bid my blood to run. 
(I can't wake up 
) 
Before I come undone. 
(Save me 
) 
Save me from the nothing I've become 
Bring me to life. 
(I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.) 
Bring me to life. 
Frozen inside without your touch, 
without your love, darling. 
Only you are the life among the dead. 
All of this time 
I can't believe I couldn't see 
Kept in the dark 
but you were there in front of me 
I've been sleeping a one thousand years it seems. 
I've got to open my eyes to everything. 
Without a thought 
Without a voice 
Without a soul 
(Don't let me die here/There must be something more.) 
Bring me to life. 
(Wake me up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(I can't wake up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(Save me 
) 
Call my name and save me from the dark. 
(Wake me up 
) 
Bid my blood to run. 
(I can't wake up 
) 
Before I come undone. 
(Save me 
) 
Save me from the nothing I've become. 
Bring me to life. 
(I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.) 
Bring me to life.</field>

Suppressed by all my childish fears 
And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave 
'Cause your presence still lingers here 
And it won't leave me alone 
These wounds won't seem to heal 
This pain is just too real 
There's just too much that time cannot erase 
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears 
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears 
And I held your hand through all of these years 
But you still have all of me 
You used to captivate me by your resonating light 
Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind 
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams 
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me 
These wounds won't seem to heal 
This pain is just too real 
There's just too much that time cannot erase 
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears 
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears 
And I held your hand through all of these years 
But you still have all of me 
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone 
But though you're still with me 
I've been alone all along 
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears 
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears 
And I held your hand through all of these years 
But you still have all of me</field>

Lithium - don't want to lock me up inside 
Lithium - don't want to forget how it feels without 
lithium- I want to stay in love with my sorrow 
oh but God I want to let it go 
come to bed, don't make me sleep alone 
couldn't hide the emptiness you let it show 
never wanted it to be so cold 
just didn't drink enough to say you love me 
I can't hold on to me 
wonder what's wrong with me 
Lithium- don't want to lock me up inside 
lithium- don't want to forget how it feels without 
lithium- I want to stay in love with my sorrow 
oh... 
Don't want to let it lay me down this time 
drown my will to fly 
here in the darkness I know myself 
can't break free until I let it go 
let me go 
Darling, I forgive you after all 
anything is better than to be alone 
and in the end I guess I had to fall 
always find my place among the ashes 
I can't hold on to me 
wonder what's wrong with me 
Lithium- don't want to lock me up inside 
lithium- don't want to forget how it feels without

Selfishly hated 
No wonder you're jaded 
You can't play the victim this time 
And you're too late 
So don't cry to me

You never call me when you're sober 
You only want it cause it's over

How could I? 
You were never mine

Maybe I'll wake up for once 
Not tormented daily defeated by you 
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom 
I'm dying again 
I'm going under 
Drowning in you 
I'm falling forever 
I've got to break through 
I'm going under 
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies 
So I don't know what's real and what's not 
Always confusing the thoughts in my head 
So I can't trust myself anymore 
I'm dying again 
I'm going under 
Drowning in you 
I'm falling forever 
I've got to break through 
So go on and scream 
Scream at me I'm so far away 
I won't be broken again 
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under 
I'm dying again

Drowning in you

Chained of this fear

Open your eyes to the light

I lie inside myself for hours 
And watch my purple sky fly over me 
Don't say I'm out of touch 
With this rampant chaos - your reality 
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge 
The nightmare I built my own world to escape 
In my field of paper flowers 
And candy clouds of lullaby 
I lie inside myself for hours 
And watch my purple sky fly over me 
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming 
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights 
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming 
The goddess of imaginary light 
In my field of paper flowers 
And candy clouds of lullaby 
I lie inside myself for hours 
And watch my purple sky fly over me</field>

You won't cry for my absence, I know, you forgot me long ago 
Am I that unimportant? 
Am I so insignificant? 
Isn't something missing? 
Isn't someone missing me? 
Even though I'd be sacrificed, 
You won't try for me, not now. 
Though I'd die to know you loved me, 
I'm all alone. 
Isn't someone missing me? 
Please, please forgive me, 
But I won't be home again. 
I know what you do to yourself, 
I breathe deep and cry out: 
Isn't something missing? 
Isn't someone missing me? 
Even though I'd be sacrificed, 
You won't try for me, not now. 
Though I'd die to know you loved me, 
I'm all alone. 
Isn't someone missing me? 
And if I bleed, I'll bleed, 
Knowing you don't care. 
And if I sleep just to dream of you 
And wake without you there, 
Isn't something missing? 
Isn't something... 
Even though I'd be sacrificed, 
You won't try for me, not now. 
Though I'd die to know you loved me, 
I'm all alone.

And at sweet night, you are my own 
Take my hand 
We're leaving here tonight 
There's no need to tell anyone 
They'd only hold us down 
So by the morning's light 
We'll be half way to anywhere 
Where love is more than just your name 
I have dreamt of a place for you and I 
No one knows who we are there 
All I want is to give my life only to you 
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore 
Let's run away, I'll take you there 
We're leaving here tonight 
There's no need to tell anyone 
They'd only hold us down 
So by the morning's light 
We'll be half way to anywhere 
Where no one needs a reason 
Forget this life 
Come with me 
Don't look back you're safe now 
Unlock your heart 
Drop your guard 
No one's left to stop you 
Forget this life 
Come with me 
Don't look back you're safe now 
Unlock your heart 
Drop your guard 
No one's left to stop you now 
We're leaving here tonight 
There's no need to tell anyone 
They'd only hold us down 
So by the morning's light 
We'll be half way to anywhere 
Where love is more than just your name 
We're leaving here tonight 
There's no need to tell anyone 
They'd only hold us down 
So by the morning's light 
We'll be half way to anywhere 
Where love is more than just your name</field>

And I know there's something wrong but I can't turn the light on 
In that split second change 
When you knew we couldn't hold on 
I realized I live to love you 
Save yourself! 
Don't look back! 
Tearing us apart until it's all gone 
The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves 
But I remember 
I won't give up on you 
I can feel you in my heart just show me the way 
I don't belong here 
Alone 
I can still see your face 
Where it's burned into my mind 
I die every time 
I close my eyes, you're always there 
Save yourself! 
Don't look back! 
Tearing us apart until it's all gone 
The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves 
But I'm the one who's drowning 
Without your love 
I am lost and I can never go back home 
All across the ocean 
We are calling 
Calling... 
Ah 
Ah, are you there? 
Nothing left for me 'till I find you because it's 
All gone 
The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves 
But I'm the one who's drowning 
Without your love 
I am lost and I can never go back 
I can never go back home</field>

If you have a dream for better 
Do what you what you want

Do what you what you want 
Your world's closing in on you now (it isn't over) 
Stand and face the unknown 
(got to remember who you really are) 
Every heart 
In my hands 
Like a pale reflection 
Hello, hello remember me? 
I'm everything you can't control 
Somewhere beyond the pain 
There must be a way to believe 
We can break through 
Do what you what you want 
You don't have to lay your life down (it isn't over) 
Do what you what you want 
Till you find what you're looking for 
(got to remember who you really are) 
But every hour 
Slipping by 
Screams that I have failed you 
Hello, hello remember me? 
I'm everything you can't control 
Somewhere beyond the pain 
There must be a way to believe 
Hello, hello remember me? 
I'm everything you can't control 
Somewhere beyond the pain 
There must be a way to believe 
There's still time 
Close your eyes 
Only love will guide you home 
Tear down the walls and free your soul 
Till we crash we're forever spiraling down 
Down, down, down 
Hello, hello, it's only me 
infecting everything you love 
Somewhere beyond the pain 
There must be a way to believe 
Hello, hello remember me? 
I'm everything you can't control 
Somewhere beyond the pain 
There must be a way to learn forgiveness 
Hello, hello remember me? 
I'm everything you can't control 
Somewhere beyond the pain 
There must be a way to believe

I don't know what I said 
But I didn't mean to hurt you 
I heard the words come out 
I felt that I would die 
It hurt so much to hurt you 
Then you look at me 
You're not shouting anymore 
You're silently broken 
I'd give anything now 
to kill those words for you 
Each time I say something I regret I cry "I don't want to lose you." 
But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah. 
'Cause you were made for me 
Somehow I'll make you see 
How happy you make me 
I can't live this life 
Without you by my side 
I need you to survive 
So stay with me 
You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside then I'm sorry. 
And you forgive me again 
You're my one true friend 
And I never meant to hurt you</field>

Grieving the things I can't repair and willing... 
To let you blame it on me

I don't want to hold you back now love 
I can't change who I am 
Not this time, I won't lie to keep you near me 
And in this short life 
There's no time to waste on giving up 
My love wasn't enough 
And you can blame it on me 
Just set your guilt free, honey 
I don't want to hold you back now love

The more you try to hide it 
The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it 
You know you can't deny it 
The world's a little more fucked up everyday 
I'm gonna save you from it 
Together we'll outrun it 
Just don't give into the fear 
So many things I would've told you 
If I knew that I was never gonna see you again 
I wanna lift you up 
Into the light 
That you deserve 
I wanna take your pain 
Into myself 
So you won't hurt 
Don't you dare surrender 
Don't leave me here without you 
'Cause I could never 
Replace your perfect imperfection 
The way you look us over 
Your counterfeit composure 
Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower 
The world is on our shoulders 
Do you really know the weight of the words you say? 
You want a little of it 
You just can't let go of it 
You've got an ego to feed 
Too late to rise above it 
Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade 
I'm gonna lift you up 
Into the light 
That you deserve 
I'm gonna take you down 
To the real world 
So you can watch it burn 
Don't you dare surrender 
Don't leave me here without you 
'Cause I could never 
Replace your perfect imperfection 
We stand undefined 
Can't be drawn with a straight line 
This will not be our ending 
We are alive, we are alive 
Don't you dare surrender 
Don't leave me here without you 
'Cause I could never 
Replace your perfect imperfection 
Don't you dare surrender 
I'm still right beside you 
And I could never 
Replace your perfect imperfection</field>

Say you're here and it's all over now 
Speaking to the atmosphere 
No one's here and I fall into myself 
This truth drives me into madness 
I know I can stop the pain if I will it all away 
If I will it all away 
Don't turn away 
[Don't give in to the pain] 
Don't try to hide 
[Though they're screaming your name] 
Don't close your eyes 
[God knows what lies behind them] 
Don't turn out the light 
[Never sleep, never die] 
I'm frightened by what I see 
But somehow I know that there's much more to come 
Immobilized by my fear 
And soon to be blinded by tears 
I can stop the pain if I will it all away 
If I will it all away 
Don't turn away 
[Don't give in to the pain] 
Don't try to hide 
[Though they're screaming your name] 
Don't close your eyes 
[God knows what lies behind them] 
Don't turn out the light 
[Never sleep, never die] 
Fallen angels at my feet 
Whispered voices at my ear 
Death before my eyes 
Lying next to me I fear 
She beckons me shall I give in 
Upon my end shall I begin 
Forsaking all I've fallen for I rise to meet the end 
Don't turn away 
[Don't give in to the pain] 
Don't try to hide 
[Though they're screaming your name] 
Don't close your eyes

Don't turn out the light

As much as I'd like 
To feel like I belong here 
I'm just as scared as you

Clean sparks driving down 
Cool in the waterway 
Where the baptized drown 
Naked in the cold sun 
Breathing life like fire 
Thought I was the only one 
But that was just a lie 
Cause I heard it in the wind 
And I saw it in the sky 
And I thought it was the end 
And I thought it was the 4th of July 
Pale in the flare light 
The scared light cracks and disappears 
And leads the scorched ones here 
And everywhere no one cares 
The fire is spreading 
And no one wants to speak about it 
Down in the hole 
Jesus tries to crack a smile 
Beneath another shovel load 
And I heard it in the wind 
And I saw it in the sky 
And I thought it was the end 
And I thought it was the 4th of July 
Now I'm in control 
Now I'm in the fall out 
Once asleep but now I stand 
And I still remember 
Your sweet everything 
Light a Roman candle 
And hold it in your hand 
Cause I heard it in the wind 
And I saw it in the sky 
And I thought it was the end 
And I thought it was the 4th of July</field>

Find the words to make me better 
If I only knew how to pull myself apart

All that I can't ignore alone at night

Lock the last open door 
My ghosts are gaining on me 
I believe that dreams are sacred 
Take my darkest fears and play them 
Like a lullaby 
Like a reason why 
Like a play of my obsessions 
Make me understand the lesson 
So I'll find myself 
So I wont be lost again 
All that I'm living for 
All that I'm dying for 
All that I can't ignore alone at night

Guess I thought I'd have to change the world 
To make you see me 
To be the one 
I could have run forever 
But how far would I have come 
Without mourning your love? 
All that I'm living for 
All that I'm dying for 
All that I can't ignore alone at night 
All that I'm wanted for 
Although I wanted more 
Lock the last open door 
My ghosts are gaining on me 
Should it hurt to love you? 
Should I feel like I do? 
Should I lock the last open door?

What you hide so carelessly? 
I saw her bleed 
You heard me breathe 
And I froze inside myself 
And turned away 
I must be dreaming 
We all live 
We all die 
That does not begin to justify you 
It's not what it seems 
Not what you think 
No I must be dreaming 
It's only in my mind 
Not in real life 
No I must be dreaming 
Help you know I've got to tell someone 
Tell them what I know you've done 
I fear you but spoken fears can come true 
We all live 
We all die 
That does not begin to justify you 
It's not what it seems 
Not what you think 
No I must be dreaming 
It's only in my mind 
Not in real life 
No I must be dreaming 
Not what it seems 
Not what you think 
I must be dreaming 
Just in my mind 
Not in real life 
I must be dreaming</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I've been looking in a mirror for so long 
That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side 
All the little pieces falling, shattered 
Shards of me too sharp to put back together 
Too small to matter 
But big enough to cut me into so many 
Little pieces if I try to touch her 
And I bleed 
I bleed 
And I breathe 
I breathe, no more 
I take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well 
Yet again you refuse to drink 
Like a stubborn child 
Lie to me convince me that I've been sick forever 
And all of this will make sense when I get better 
But I know the difference between myself and my reflection 
I just can't help but to wonder which of us do you love 
So I bleed 
I bleed 
And I breathe 
I breathe no 
Bleed 
I bleed 
And I breathe 
I breathe 
I breathe 
I breathe, no more</field>

            <field name="lyrics">How can you see into my eyes 
like open doors 
leading you down into my core 
where I've become so numb? 
Without a soul; 
my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold, 
until you find it there and lead it back home. 
(Wake me up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(I can't wake up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(Save me 
) 
Call my name and save me from the dark. 
(Wake me up 
) 
Bid my blood to run. 
(I can't wake up 
) 
Before I come undone. 
(Save me 
) 
Save me from the nothing I've become. 
Now that I know what I'm without 
you can't just leave me. 
Breathe into me and make me real. 
Bring me to life. 
(Wake me up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(I can't wake up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(Save me 
) 
Call my name and save me from the dark. 
(Wake me up 
) 
Bid my blood to run. 
(I can't wake up 
) 
Before I come undone. 
(Save me 
) 
Save me from the nothing I've become 
Bring me to life. 
(I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.) 
Bring me to life. 
Frozen inside without your touch, 
without your love, darling. 
Only you are the life among the dead. 
All of this time 
I can't believe I couldn't see 
Kept in the dark 
but you were there in front of me 
I've been sleeping a one thousand years it seems. 
I've got to open my eyes to everything. 
Without a thought 
Without a voice 
Without a soul 
(Don't let me die here/There must be something more.) 
Bring me to life. 
(Wake me up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(I can't wake up.) 
Wake me up inside. 
(Save me 
) 
Call my name and save me from the dark. 
(Wake me up 
) 
Bid my blood to run. 
(I can't wake up 
) 
Before I come undone. 
(Save me 
) 
Save me from the nothing I've become. 
Bring me to life. 
(I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.) 
Bring me to life.</field>

I wanted you to know that I love the way you laugh 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away 
I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome 
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

You've gone away 
You don't feel me here, anymore

The worst is over now and we can breathe again 
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away 
There's so much left to learn, and no one left to fight 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

'Cause I'm broken when I'm open 
And I don't feel like I am strong enough

Don't cry to me

You want me, come find me 
Make up your mind 
Couldn't take the blame 
Sick with shame 
Must be exhausting to lose your own game 
Selfishly hated 
No wonder you're jaded 
You can't play the victim this time 
And you're too late 
So don't cry to me 
If you loved me 
You would be here with me 
You want me, come find me 
Make up your mind 
You never call me when you're sober 
You only want it cause it's over 
It's over 
How could I have burned paradise? 
How could I? 
You were never mine 
So don't cry to me 
If you loved me 
You would be here with me 
Don't lie to me 
Just get your things 
I've made up your mind</field>

Well, living on a tour bus ain't that bad

On Cartoon Network 
I miss you so 
On Cartoon Network 
Where did you go? 
Grim and Evil, how I love that little brain 
Johnny Bravo, can I smack you once again? 
I hope you've learned a lesson here 
Treasure what you have 
Don't make the mistake I made 
The rockstar life is sad 
Well, living on a tour bus is pretty bad 
And now I'm sure I know 
The meaning of my life 
The love within my soul 
The reason I wake up each day and it's

Beg my broken heart to beat 
Save my life

So go on and break your wings 
Follow your heart till it bleeds 
As we run towards the end of the dream 
I'm not afraid 
I push through the pain 
And I'm on fire 
I remember how to breathe again 
As much as it hurts ain't it wonderful to feel? 
So go on and bring your wings 
Follow your heart till it bleeds 
As we run towards the end of the dream 
Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly? 
I will find a way even without wings

Not enough to say goodbye 
Burn it till there's nothing left 
I'm drowning in the mess that i have made

There is no other way down 
I only have myself to blame For it all

I've nowhere else to go

Two months passed by and it's getting cold 
I know I'm not lost I'm just alone 
But I won't cry, I won't give up, I can't go back now 
Waking up is knowing who you really are 
Here in the shadows

Trapped in the eyes of a stranger

As wars rage before me 
Finding myself in these last days of existence 
This parasite inside me, I forced it out

            <field name="lyrics">I wanted you to be with me 
For so long I don't even know why now 
But now that I've given up on you 
Defiantly you see me 
Walking away I see the pain 
You put me through 
Lost in your game to change the same 
Forever gone, forever you 
There's something very wrong about this 
I think you knew all along somehow 
You'll only take me to change my mind 
And leave me broken and defeated 
So far away I see the truth 
I see through you 
Now that I know the way you play 
I don't want to 
Walking away I see the pain 
You put me through 
Lost in your game to change the same 
Forever gone, forever you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Can you forgive me again? 
I don't know what I said 
But I didn't mean to hurt you 
I heard the words come out 
I felt that I would die 
It hurt so much to hurt you 
Then you look at me 
You're not shouting anymore 
You're silently broken 
I'd give anything now 
to kill those words for you 
Each time I say something I regret I cry "I don't want to lose you." 
But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah. 
'Cause you were made for me 
Somehow I'll make you see 
How happy you make me 
I can't live this life 
Without you by my side 
I need you to survive 
So stay with me 
You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside then I'm sorry. 
And you forgive me again 
You're my one true friend 
And I never meant to hurt you</field>

Prisoners in the gates of a cold place 
For where it was my smile? 
Prisoner in tomb concrete 
Everything what I have now is solitude, 
Seated in I sing it darker of the room 
Bleeding and screamig out on the inside 
My broken pieces spread of the soil 
And nobody to join, oh 
Never I thought that would feel as much pain 
Bleeding and screaming out on the inside 
And why nobody hears? 
I go close the eyes now 
And when to open I want everything as was before 
I want seated you in my bed 
Saying good night it sleeps well 
And when I to bleeding you will hug me 
And it will place me in its cool? 
Oh, it is so safe here 
And when I to feel cold you will cover me 
With the more aconchegante blanket, 
And if I to bleed you say me 
That always will be here to my side 
Please, I need this for to live, for to breathe 
And when I to beg for to be free 
Does not leave 
Forces me with here with you 
And after yor good night 
When I to close the eyes 
Please, does not disappear of new 
Please...</field>

Place onto me your burden 
I'll drink your deadly poison 
Why should I care if they hurt you 
Somehow it matters more to me 
Than if I were hurting myself 
Save you, I'll save you 
Fear not the flame of my love's candle 
Give unto me all that frightens you 
I'll have you're nightmares for you 
If you sleep soundly 
Fear not the flame of my love's candle 
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness</field>

Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you

Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself 
Maybe I'll wake up for once 
Not tormented daily defeated by you 
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom 
I'm dying again 
I'm going under 
Drowning in you 
I'm falling forever 
I've got to break through 
I'm going under 
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies 
So I don't know what's real and what's not 
Always confusing the thoughts in my head 
So I can't trust myself anymore 
I'm dying again 
I'm going under 
Drowning in you 
I'm falling forever 
I've got to break through 
So go on and scream 
Scream at me I'm so far away 
I won't be broken again 
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under 
I'm dying again 
I'm going under 
Drowning in you 
I'm falling forever 
I've got to break through

Drink up sweet decadence 
I can't say no to you 
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind 
I can't say no to you 
Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely 
Now I can't let go of this dream 
Can't believe that I feel 
Good enough 
I feel good enough 
It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good 
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall 
Pour real life down on me 
Cause I can't hold on to anything this 
Good enough 
Am I good enough 
For you to love me too? 
So take care what you ask of me

Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming 
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights

The more you try to hide it 
The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it 
You know you can't deny it 
The world's a little more fucked up everyday 
I'm gonna save you from it 
Together we'll outrun it 
Just don't give into the fear 
So many things I would've told you 
If I knew that I was never gonna see you again 
I wanna lift you up 
Into the light 
That you deserve 
I wanna take your pain 
Into myself 
So you won't hurt 
Don't you dare surrender 
Don't leave me here without you 
'Cause I could never 
Replace your perfect imperfection 
The way you look us over 
Your counterfeit composure 
Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower 
The world is on our shoulders 
Do you really know the weight of the words you say? 
You want a little of it 
You just can't let go of it 
You've got an ego to feed 
Too late to rise above it 
Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade 
I'm gonna lift you up 
Into the light 
That you deserve 
I'm gonna take you down 
To the real world 
So you can watch it burn 
Don't you dare surrender 
Don't leave me here without you 
'Cause I could never 
Replace your perfect imperfection 
We stand undefined 
Can't be drawn with a straight line 
This will not be our ending 
We are alive, we are alive 
Don't you dare surrender 
Don't leave me here without you 
'Cause I could never 
Replace your perfect imperfection 
Don't you dare surrender 
I'm still right beside you 
And I could never 
Replace your perfect imperfection</field>

There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you 
I'm coming for you 
You're not alone 
No matter what they told you you're not alone 
I'll be right beside you forevermore 
I long to be like you, sis 
Lie cold in the ground like you dear 
There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you 
And as we lay in silent bliss 
I know you remember me 
I long to be like you 
Lie cold in the ground like you 
There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you 
I'm coming for you</field>

Listen to each drop of rain [listen listen] 
Whispering secrets in vain [listen listen] 
Frantically searching for someone to hear 
Their story before they hit ground 
Please don't let go 
Can't we stay for a while? 
It's just too hard to say goodbye 
Listen to the rain

Weeping 
Ooh ooh oh oh oh oh 
Ooh ooh oh oh oooh 
Listen [listen] listen [listen] 
Listen [listen] listen 
I stand alone in the storm [listen listen] 
Suddenly sweet words take form [listen listen] 
Hurry, they say, for you haven't much time 
Open your eyes to the love around you 
You may feel you're alone 
But I'm here still with you 
You can do what you dream 
Just remember to listen to the rain 
Ooh ooh oh oh oh oh 
Ooh ooh oh oh oooh

Lithium - don't want to lock me up inside 
Lithium - don't want to forget how it feels without 
lithium- I want to stay in love with my sorrow 
oh but God I want to let it go 
come to bed, don't make me sleep alone 
couldn't hide the emptiness you let it show 
never wanted it to be so cold 
just didn't drink enough to say you love me 
I can't hold on to me 
wonder what's wrong with me 
Lithium- don't want to lock me up inside 
lithium- don't want to forget how it feels without 
lithium- I want to stay in love with my sorrow 
oh... 
Don't want to let it lay me down this time 
drown my will to fly 
here in the darkness I know myself 
can't break free until I let it go 
let me go 
Darling, I forgive you after all 
anything is better than to be alone 
and in the end I guess I had to fall 
always find my place among the ashes 
I can't hold on to me 
wonder what's wrong with me 
Lithium- don't want to lock me up inside 
lithium- don't want to forget how it feels without 
lithium stay in love with you 
oh I'm gonna let it go</field>

Just to lose control, just once 
With all the pretty flowers in the dust 
Mary had a lamb 
His eyes black as coals 
If we play very quiet, my lamb 
Mary never has to know 
Just once in my life 
I think it'd be nice 
Just to lose control, just once 
If I cut you down to a thing I can use 
I fear there will be nothing good left of you</field>

As if I was human

Just to let you down 
You believed in me, but I'm broken 
I have nothing left 
And all I feel is this cruel wanting 
We've been falling for all this time 
And now I'm lost in paradise 
As much as I'd like 
The past not to exist 
It still does 
As much as I'd like 
To feel like I belong here 
I'm just as scared as you 
I have nothing left 
And all I feel is this cruel wanting 
We've been falling for all this time 
And now I'm lost in paradise 
Run away, run away 
One day we won't feel this pain anymore 
Take it all away 
Shadows of you 
'Cause they won't let me go 
Till I have nothing left 
And all I feel is this cruel wanting 
We've been falling for all this time 
And now I'm lost in paradise 
Alone and lost in paradise</field>

Am I that unimportant?

Isn't someone missing me? 
Even though I'd be sacrificed, 
You won't try for me, not now. 
Though I'd die to know you loved me, 
I'm all alone. 
Isn't someone missing me? 
Please, please forgive me, 
But I won't be home again. 
I know what you do to yourself, 
I breathe deep and cry out: 
Isn't something missing?

Knowing you don't care. 
And if I sleep just to dream of you 
And wake without you there,

Isn't something... 
Even though I'd be sacrificed, 
You won't try for me, not now.

And I will wander till the end of time 
Torn away from you 
My heart is broken 
Sweet sleep, my dark angel 
Deliver us from sorrow's hold 
Over my heart, heart 
I can't go on living this way 
But I can't go back the way I came 
Chained of this fear 
That I will never find the way 
To heal my soul 
And I will wander till the end of time 
Half alive without you 
My heart is broken 
Sweet sleep, my dark angel 
Deliver us 
Change 
Open your eyes to the light 
I denied it all so long, oh so long 
Say goodbye 
Goodbye 
My heart is broken 
Release me, I can't hold on 
Deliver us 
My heart is broken 
Sweet sleep, my dark angel 
Deliver us 
My heart is broken 
Sweet sleep, my dark angel 
Deliver us from sorrow's hold.</field>

When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears 
And I held your hand through all of these years 
But you still have all of me 
You used to captivate me by your resonating light 
Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind 
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams 
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

It ends here tonight 
I'll miss the winter 
A world of fragile things 
Look for me in the white forest 
Hiding in a hollow tree 
(Come find me) 
I know you hear me 
I can taste it in your tears

Holding my last breath 
Safe inside myself 
Are all my thoughts of you 
Sweet raptured light 
It ends here tonight 
Closing your eyes to disappear 
You pray your dreams 
Will leave you here 
But still you wake and know the truth 
No one's there 
Say goodnight 
Don't be afraid 
Calling me calling me 
As you fade to black 
Holding my last breath 
Safe inside myself 
Are all my thoughts of you

Ah 
Ah, are you there? 
Nothing left for me 'till I find you because it's

            <field name="lyrics">Don't want to be the one to walk away 
But I can't bear the thought of one more day 
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost 
Can't find the road to lead us out of this 
A million miles from where we burned the bridge 
Can't keep pretending everything's gonna be alright 
With the whole world 
Falling around me 
Cross the oceans in my mind 
Find the strength to say goodbye 
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands 
Fallen so far from where we were before 
You'll never find what you've been searching for 
Something to fill the void and make up for all of those missing pieces of you 
Like I could only dream to do 
Cross the oceans in my mind 
Find the strength to say goodbye 
Everything that we believed in was a lie 
Cross the oceans in your mind 
Find a way to blur the line 
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands 
And we never learn 
So we fall down again 
Heaven help me find a way to dream 
Within this nightmare 
Cross the oceans in my mind 
Find the strength to say goodbye 
Everything that we believed in was a lie 
Cross the oceans in your mind 
Find a way to blur the line 
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands</field>

I fall before you, 
Here I am, 
I have nothing left, 
Though I've tried to forget, 
You're all that I am, 
Take me home, 
I'm through fighting it, 
Broken, 
Lifeless, 
I give up, 
You're my only strength, 
Without you, 
I can't go on, 
Anymore, 
Ever again. 
My only hope, 
(All the times I've tried) 
My only peace, 
(To walk away from you) 
My only joy, 
My only strength, 
(I fall into your abounding grace) 
My only power, 
My only life, 
(And love is where I am) 
My only love. 
I can't run anymore, 
I give myself to you, 
I'm sorry, 
I'm sorry, 
In all my bitterness, 
I ignored, 
All that's real and true, 
All I need is you, 
When night falls on me, 
I'll not close my eyes, 
I'm too alive, 
And you're too strong, 
I can't lie anymore, 
I fall down before you, 
I'm sorry, 
I'm sorry. 
My only hope, 
(All the times I've tried) 
My only peace, 
(To walk away from you) 
My only joy, 
My only strength, 
(I fall into your abounding grace) 
My only power, 
My only life, 
(And love is where I am) 
My only love. 
Constantly ignoring, 
The pain consuming me, 
But this time it's cut too deep, 
I'll never stray again. 
My only hope, 
(All the times I've tried) 
My only peace, 
(To walk away from you) 
My only joy, 
My only strength, 
(I fall into your abounding grace) 
My only power, 
My only life, 
(And love is where I am) 
My only love, 
My only hope, 
(All the times I've tried) 
My only peace, 
(To walk away from you) 
My only joy, 
My only strength, 
(I fall into your abounding grace) 
My only power, 
My only life, 
(And love is where I am) 
My only love.</field>

Keeping me from killing you 
And from pulling you down with me here 
I can almost hear you scream 
One more medicated peaceful moment (give me) 
One more medicated peaceful moment 
And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility 
No, I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility 
Gotta cut away clear away 
Snip away and sever this umbilical residue

Snip away and sever this umbilical residue

Can't shake this feeling that I have 
The worst is just around the bend

And will he see how much he means to me? 
I think it's not to be 
What will become of my dear friend? 
Where will his actions lead us then? 
Although I'd like to join the crowd 
In their enthusiastic cloud 
Try as I may, it doesn't last 
And will we ever end up together? 
And will we ever end up together? 
no, I think not, it's never to become

I'm tired of feeling so alone 
Cause you won't let me understand (let me understand) 
I don't want to pretend 
I want to feel, I want to live 
Say you will or say you won't 
Open your heart to me 
Now or never tell the truth 
Is this real, is this real? 
Whenever you're around I can't fight it 
You get under my skin in a way that I like it 
And I can't take anymore 
Tell me what you want from me 
Or leave me alone 
Cause I'm all caught up 
And I'm losing control 
I'm tired of holding on so tight 
When you won't let me understand (let me understand) 
Now I'm falling apart 
I never meant to lose myself 
Say you will or say you won't 
Open your heart to me 
Now or never tell the truth 
Is this real, is this real? 
Say you will or say you won't 
Open your heart to me 
Now or never tell the truth 
Is this real, is this real? 
Like drops of rain against my heart 
Cut through like silver 
And I want to make you feel that way 
And I want to make you feel the way that I do 
Say you will or say you won't 
Open your heart to me 
Now or never tell the truth 
Is this real?

They're my own veins 
Any more than a whisper 
Any sudden movement of my heart 
And I know, I know I'll have to watch them pass away 
Just get through this day 
Give up your way, you could be anything, 
Give up my way, and lose myself, not today 
That's too much guilt to pay 
Sickened in the sun 
You dare tell me you love me 
But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die 
Honey you know, you know I'd never hurt you that way. 
You're just so pretty in your pain. 
Give up my way, and I could be anything 
I'll make my own way 
Without your senseless hate... 
So run, run, run 
And hate me, if it feels good 
I can't hear your screams anymore 
You lied to me 
But I'm older now 
And I'm not buying baby 
Demanding my response 
Don't bother breaking the door down 
I found my way out 
And you'll never hurt me again.</field>

When they all come crashing down (midflight) 
You know you're not the only one 
When they're so alone they find 
A back door out of life 
You know you're not the only one 
We're all grieving 
Lost and bleeding 
All our lives 
We've been waiting 
For someone to call our leader 
All your lies 
I'm not believing 
Heaven shine a light down on me 
So afraid to open your eyes (hypnotized) 
You know you're not the only one 
Never understood this life 
And you're right I don't deserve 
But you know I'm not the only one 
We're all grieving 
Lost and bleeding 
All our lives 
We've been waiting 
For someone to call our leader 
All your lies 
I'm not believing 
Heaven shine a light down on me 
Don't look down 
Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you 
Don't look down 
You'll fall down 
You'll become their sacrifice 
Right or wrong 
Can't hold on to the fear 
That I'm lost without you 
If I can't feel, I'm not mine, 
I'm not real 
All our lives 
We've been waiting 
For someone to call our leader 
All your lies 
I'm not believing 
Heaven shine a light down on me</field>

Counting the days to meet you on the other side 
I will always be waiting 
Until the day that I see you on the other side 
Come and take me home 
I'm not giving you 
I want you back 
Holding together by the shards of our past 
Stole my heart away 
I can't let you go 
Break these chains and let me fly to you 
High above the world below 
Over and over in my mind 
Counting the days to meet you on the other side 
I will always be waiting 
Until the day that I see you on the other side 
Come and take me... 
Home 
I am so lost without my place inside your heart 
I won't survive I need to know you hear me 
Awake and release my love 
Counting the days to meet you on the other side 
I will always be waiting 
Until the day that I see you on the other side 
Come and take me 
Counting the days to meet you on the other side

Wanna see you try to take a swing at me 
Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground 
Why are you trying to make fun of me? 
You think it's funny? 
What the fuck you think you're doing to me? 
You take you turn lashing out me 
I want you crying with you 
Dirty ass in front of me

Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies

Drown, drown, drown 
I wanna kill and rape you he way you raped me 
And I'll pull the trigger 
And you're down, down, down 
Why are you trying to make fun of me?

They all screamed, and cried 
Gonna take you down

We'll be together again 
All just a dream in the end 
We'll be together again 
So many fears were swimming around and around in my mind 
Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find? 
I've found a world where love and dreams and darkness all colide 
Maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind 
We'll be together again 
All just I dream in the end</field>

Consciously, you've forgotten it. 
That's the way the human mind works. 
Whenever something is too unpleasant 
Too shameful for us to entertain, 
We reject it. 
We erase it from our memory, 
But the imprint is always there." 
[We wash it all away] 
[We wish it all away] 
[We hope it all away] 
[Can't cry it all away] 
The pain that grips you 
The fear that binds you 
Releases life in me 
In our mutual shame, we hide our eyes 
To blind them from the truth that finds a way for who we are 
Please don't be afraid 
When the darkness fades away 
The dawn will break the silence, screaming at our hearts 
My love for you still grows 
This I do for you 
Before I try to fight the truth my final time 
"We're supposed to try to be real. 
We feel alone when we're not together 
And that is real." 
[We wash it all away] 
[We wish it all away] 
[We hope it all away] 
[Can't cry it all away] 
Lying beside you, listening to you breathe 
The light that flows inside of you, burns inside of me 
Hold and speak to me 
Of love without a sound 
Tell me you will live through this 
And I will die for you 
Cast me not away 
Say you'll be with me 
For I know I cannot bear it all alone 
["You're not alone, honey, never.. 
Never."] 
Can't fight it all away 
Can't hope it all away 
Can't scream it all away 
It just won't fade away, no... 
Ohh, can't wash it all away 
Can't wish it all away, 
Can't throw it all away 
Can't scratch it all away, yeah.... 
Can't fight it all away 
Can't hope it all away 
Can't scream it all away 
Move it all away 
Move it all away 
["But the imprint is always there 
Nothing is ever really forgotten."] 
God just don't hate me 
Because I'll die if you do. 
Because I'll die if you do. 
Because I'll die if you do. 
Because I'll die if you do. 
Because I'll die if you do.</field>

Don't turn out the light 
[Never sleep, never die] 
I'm frightened by what I see 
But somehow I know that there's much more to come 
Immobilized by my fear 
And soon to be blinded by tears 
I can stop the pain if I will it all away 
If I will it all away 
Don't turn away 
[Don't give in to the pain] 
Don't try to hide 
[Though they're screaming your name] 
Don't close your eyes 
[God knows what lies behind them] 
Don't turn out the light 
[Never sleep, never die] 
Fallen angels at my feet 
Whispered voices at my ear 
Death before my eyes 
Lying next to me I fear 
She beckons me shall I give in 
Upon my end shall I begin 
Forsaking all I've fallen for I rise to meet the end 
Don't turn away 
[Don't give in to the pain] 
Don't try to hide 
[Though they're screaming your name] 
Don't close your eyes 
[God knows what lies behind them] 
Don't turn out the light

Sweet words that I want to give you 
And I can't sleep, I need to tell you.. 
goodnight 
When we're together I feel perfect 
When I'm pulled away from you I fall apart 
All that you say is sacred to me 
Your eyes are so blue, I can't look away as we lay in the stillness 
You whisper to me: 
-Amy, marry me, promise you'll stay with me 
Oh you don't have to ask me, you know you're all that I live for 
You know I'd die just to hold you, stay with you 
Somehow I'll show you that you are my night sky 
I've always been right behind you 
Now I'll always be right beside you 
So many nights I've cried myself to sleep 
Now that you love me I love myself 
I never thought I would say that 
I never thought there'd be you</field>

Me and all I stood for 
We're wandering now 
All in parts in pieces, swim lonely 
Find your own way out 
I can't see your star 
I can't see your star 
How can the darkness feel so wrong? 
And I'm alone now 
Me and all I stood for 
We're wandering now 
All in parts in pieces, swim lonely 
Find your own way out 
So far away 
Its growing colder without your love 
Why can't you feel me calling your name? 
Can't break the silence 
Its breaking me 
All my fears turn to rage 
And I'm alone now me 
And all I stood for 
We're wandering now 
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely 
Find your own way out 
Now, Nothing worth fighting for 
We're wandering now

For when you're really gonna need 'em 
Throw out your cares and fly 
Wanna go for a ride? 
She's the one for me 
She's all I really need 
'Cause she's the one for me 
Emptiness is loneliness and loneliness is cleanliness 
And cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me 
Intoxicated with the madness 
I'm in love with my sadness 
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms 
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth 
I never let on that I was on a sinking ship 
I never let on that I was down 
You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore 
You blame yourself for wanting more 
She's the one for me 
She's all I really need 
She's the one for me 
She's my one and only</field>

Closing your eyes to disappear You pray your dreams will leave you here, But still you wake and know the truth - No one's there. Say goodnight, don't be afraid Calling me, calling me, as you fade to black. (Say goodnight) Holding my last breath (Don't be afraid) Safe inside myself (Holding me) Are all my thoughts of you?

Some turn to dust or to gold

And just one mistake 
It's all it will take 
We'll go down in history

Hey, hey, hey 
Remember me for centuries 
Mummified my teenage dreams 
No, it's nothing wrong with me 
The kids are all wrong, the story's all off 
Heavy metal broke my heart 
Come on, come on, and let me in 
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints 
And this is for tonight 
The darkness that you felt 
I never meant for you to fix yourself 
Some legends are told 
Some turn to dust or to gold 
But you will remember me 
Remember me, for centuries 
And just one mistake 
It's all it will take 
We'll go down in history 
Remember me for centuries 
Hey, hey, hey 
Remember me for centuries 
And I can't stop until the whole world knows my name 
Cause I was only born inside my dreams 
Until you die for me 
As long as there's a light, my shadow's over you 
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia 
And you're a cherry blossom 
You're about to bloom 
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon 
Some legends are told 
Some turn to dust or to gold 
But you will remember me 
Remember me, for centuries 
And just one mistake 
It's all it will take 
We'll go down in history 
Remember me for centuries 
Hey, hey, hey 
Remember me for centuries 
We've been here forever 
And here's the frozen proof 
I could scream forever 
We are the poisoned youth 
Some legends are told 
Some turn to dust or to gold 
But you will remember me 
Remember me, for centuries 
And just one mistake 
It's all it will take 
We'll go down in history

You always fold just before you're found out 
Drink up its last call 
Last resort 
But only the first mistake

So now the world can never get me on my level 
I just got to get you out of the cage 
I'm a young lover's rage 
Gonna need a spark to ignite 
My songs know what you did in the dark 
So light them up, up, up, light them up, up, up 
Light them up, up, up, I'm on fire 
So light them up, up, up, light them up, up, up 
Light them up, up, up, I'm on fire 
Woah woah woah woah 
In the dark, dark 
Woah woah woah woah 
In the dark, dark 
All the writers keep writing what they write 
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies 
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see 
That you're the antidote to everything except for me 
A constellation of tears on your lashes 
Burn everything you love 
Then burn the ashes 
In the end everything collides 
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see 
My songs know what you did in the dark 
So light them up, up, up, light them up, up, up 
Light them up, up, up, I'm on fire 
So light them up, up, up, light them up, up, up 
Light them up, up, up, I'm on fire 
Woah woah woah woah 
In the dark, dark 
Woah woah woah woah 
In the dark, dark 
My songs know what you did in the dark 
My songs know what you did in the dark 
So light them up, up, up, light them up, up, up 
Light them up, up, up, I'm on fire 
So light them up, up, up, light them up, up, up 
Light them up, up, up, I'm on fire 
Woah woah woah woah 
In the dark, dark 
Woah woah woah woah 
In the dark, dark 
Woah woah woah woah</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Coming in unannounced, 
Drag my nails on the tile 
I just follow your scent, 
You can just follow my smile 
All of your flaws are aligned 
With this mood of mine 
Cutting me to the bone, 
Nothing left to leave behind 
You ought to keep me concealed 
Just like I was a weapon 
I didn't come for a fight 
But I will fight til the ending 
This one might be a battle, 
Might not turn out okay 
You know you look so Seattle 
But you feel so La 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
And I love the way you hurt me 
It's irresistible, whoa, whoa, oh, yeah 
Whoa, whoa, oh, yeah 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby 
I'm gonna get you to burst 
Just like you were a bubble 
Frame me up on your wall 
Just to keep me out of trouble 
Like a moth getting trapped 
In the light by fixation 
Truly free, love it baby, 
I'm talking no inflation 
Too many war wounds and not enough wars 
Too few rounds in the ring 
And not enough settled scores 
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves 
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
And I love the way you hurt me 
It's irresistible, whoa, whoa, oh, yeah 
Whoa, whoa, oh, yeah 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby 
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke 
I breathe you in, but honey 
I don't know what you're doing to me 
Mon chéri but the truth 
catches up with us eventually 
Try to say live, live and let live 
But I'm no good, good at lip service 
Except when they're yours, mi amor 
I'm coming for you and I'm making war 
And I still love the way I hurt you 
It's irresistible, whoa, whoa, oh, yeah 
Whoa, whoa, oh, yeah 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby</field>

I'm having no tomorrow 
She said you gotta' find yourself something

When I think of you

Oh so intricate. 
I'm the leading man 
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate 
Oh so intricate 
I wrote the gospel on giving up

But the real bombshells have already sunk

At night we're painting your trash gold 
While you sleep

I'm just kinda too frozen 
You were the only one 
That even kinda came close 
I just pinch myself 
No longer comatose 
I woke up, no luck 
I woke up, no luck 
And when your stitch comes loose 
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz 
And stuffing that comes out of you, you 
I took too many hits off this memory 
I need to come down 
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by 
So hold me tight 
Hold me tight, or don't 
Oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends

I got too high again 
Realized I can't not be with you 
Or be just your friend 
I love you to death 
But I just can't, I just can't pretend 
We weren't lovers first 
Confidants but never friends 
Were we ever friends? 
But when your stitch comes loose 
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz 
And stuffing that comes out of you, you 
I took too many hits off this memory 
I need to come down

It sharpens me like a knife

Get them drunk on rose water 
See how dirty I can get them 
Pulling out their fragile teeth 
And clip their tiny wings

And will be held against you 
So only say my name 
It will be held against you 
Anything you say can and will be held against you 
So only say my name 
If heaven's grief brings hell's rain 
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows 
For just one yesterday 
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday 
(I saved it all for you) 
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way 
Still I'd trade all my tomorrows 
For just one yesterday

(I saved it all for you) for just one yesterday 
Letting people down is my thing baby 
Find yourself a new gig 
This town isn't big enough for the two of us 
I don't have the right name, or the right looks 
But I have twice the heart 
Anything you say can and will be held against you 
So only say my name 
It will be held against you 
Anything you say can and will be held against you 
So only say my name

The world would never look at you the same way 
Now I'm here to give you hope my love 
So I can watch your face 
As I take it all away away away-ay-yay

Not a saint, not that great, feel like I was born a car 
In 94, the world started me and I've been driving 
Sometimes a man just can't open his car, and 
Ain't gotta be somebody, be anybody 
Rather be anybody than live in a dead body 
If you can't see me then find a helicopter 
In the night sky, shine like a star 
And I'm back with a madness 
I'm a champion 
of the people who don't believe in champions 
I got nothing but dreams inside 
I got nothing but dreams 
I'm just young enough to still believe 
still believe

Have you ever felt how hard it is to be an anybody 
To be living, to be breathing 
not choosing a dead body 
Remember, the man told me 
that this life is a party 
Yeah, all the glory's so short 
you should put away the garbages 
Normal ain't normal, ordinary is a luxury 
People say: Woo, pessimism 
why do you all on me? 
If you wanna understand, you stand under 
This shit is vital, respect to the mothers and fathers 
What's wrong with the life of a passenger 
If somebody gotta be then I'mma be the messenger 
I'm just too young don't know what to believe in 
But too young, you know, not to believe in 
I will stay, I will wait and I'll fall like a king 
Even though I can forever ever be a king 
I will marry this goddamn world by my own 
And put myself I get a damn ring 
If I can live through this 
If I can live through this 
If I can live through this 
I can do anything 
(I can do anything I can) 
Do anything, anything, yeah 
If I can live through this 
If I can live through, live through this

Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground 
We are the jack-o'-lanterns in July 
Setting fire to the sky 
Here he comes this rising tide 
So come on 
Put on your war paint 
Crosswalks and crossed hearts and hope to die 
Seal the clouds with grey lining 
So we can take the world back from the heart attack 
One maniac at a time 
We will take it back 
You know time crawls on 
When you're waiting for the song to start 
So dance alone to the beat of your heart 
Hey young blood 
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out? 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
Wearing all vintage misery 
No, I think it looked a little better on me 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
Bring home the boys in scraps 
Scrap metal the tanks 
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks 
Because the world is just a teller 
And we are wearing black masks 
So rock our spirits 
And you'll know we've passed 
So we can take the world back from the heart attack 
One maniac at a time 
We will take it back

We are the lions 
Free of the coliseums 
In poison places 
We are anti-venom 
We're the beginning of the end 
Tonight the foxes hunt the hounds 
And it's all over now before it has begun 
We've already won 
We are wild, we are like young volcanoes 
We are wild, Americana, exotica 
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby? Yeah! 
Oh! 
Come on 
Make it easy, say I never mattered 
Run it up the flagpole 
We will teach you how to make boys next door 
Out of assholes

Drag my nails on the tile 
I just followed your scent 
You can just follow my smile 
All of the flaws are alive 
With this mood of mine 
They cutting me to the bone 
Nothing left to leave behind 
You ought to keep it concealed 
Just like I was a weapon 
I didn't come for a fight 
But I will fight till the end 
And this might be a battle 
Might not turn out okay 
You know you look so Seattle 
But you feel so La 
Hey, hey, heey, heey 
Hey, hey, heey, heey 
And I love the way you hurt me 
It's irresistible whoa, whoa oh yeah 
Whoa, whoa oh yeah 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby 
I'm gonna get you to burst 
Just like you were a bubble 
Frame me up on your wall 
Just to keep me out of trouble 
Like a moth getting trapped 
In the light by fixation 
Truly free, love it baby 
I'm talking no inflation 
Too many war wounds 
And not enough wars 
Too few rounds in the ring 
And not enough settled scores 
Too many sharks 
And not enough blood in the waves 
You know I'd give my love 
Ought to fall out of the net 
Hey, hey, heey, heey 
Hey, hey, heey, heey

I love the way you hurt me, baby 
You're second hand smoke 
Second hand smoke 
I breathe you in 
But honey I don't know 
What you're doing to me, mon chéri 
But the truth catches up with us eventually 
Try to say live, baby let live 
But I'm no good good at lip service 
Except when they're yours 
Move over more 
I'm coming for you and I'm making war 
And I still love the way you hurt me 
It's irresistible whoa, whoa oh yeah 
Whoa, whoa oh yeah 
I love the way, I love the way

Better put your fingers back to the keys

One night, yeah, and one more time 
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories

And this crystal ball

One night stand (one night stand off)

"To I swear, I say" 
To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes" 
To drinks at the club, to the bar 
To the keys to your car 
To hotel stairs to the emergency exit door 
To the love, I left my conscience pressed 
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer

It never calls me when I'm down 
Love never wanted me 
But I took it anyway 
Put your ear to the speaker 
And choose love or sympathy 
But never both 
Love never wanted me 
"I hoped you choked 
And crashed your car" 
Hey "tear catcher", that's all that you are 
And ever were 
From the start 
I swear, I say

Again and again and again and again 
Forever a lake effect kid

Forget your night times 
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel 
And joke us, joke us, 
'Til life's on track comes back into focus 
I just want to come back to love 
Spark until you hit it, keep you warm enough

And ground me 
I'm just a racehorse on the track 
Send me back to the glue factory 
Always thought I'd float away 
And never come back 
But I've got enough miles on my card 
To fly the boys home on my own 
But you know me, I like being all alone 
And keeping you all alone 
And the charts are boring 
And kids are snoring 
And my ego's in a sling 
You say you're not listening 
And I said I'm wishing

You're a bottled star

You're just like Mars 
You shine in the sky

I keep telling myself 
I'm not the desperate type 
Sitting out dances on the wall 
Trying to forget everything that isn't you 
I'm not going home alone 
'Cause I don't do too well 
Sitting out dances on the wall 
Trying to forget everything that isn't you 
I'm not going home alone 
'Cause I don't do too well on my own 
I keep telling myself 
I keep telling myself

Dropping "I'm sorrys" like you're still around 
And I know you dressed up 
"Hey kid, you'll never live this down" 
You're just the girl all the boys want to dance with 
And I'm just the boy who took too many chances 
I'm sleeping on your folk's porch again, dreaming 
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?" 
I don't blame you for being you 
But you can't blame me for hating it 
So say, what are you waiting for? 
Kiss her, kiss her 
I set my clocks early cause I know I'm always late 
Write me off, give up on me 
'Cause darling what did you expect 
I'm just off, a lost cause, a long shot, don't even take this bet 
You can make all the moves, you can aim all the spotlights 
Get all the sighs and the moans just right 
I'm sleeping on your folk's porch again, dreaming 
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?" 
I don't blame you for being you 
But you can't blame me for hating it 
So say, what are you waiting for? 
Kiss her, kiss her 
I set my clocks early cause I know I'm always late 
I'm just always on 
You said you'd keep me honest 
(always on, always on) 
But I won't call you on it 
(always on, always on) 
I don't blame you for being you 
But you can't blame me for hating it 
So say, what are you waiting for? 
Kiss her, kiss her

In the back of yellow checkered cars 
The tombstones were waiting 
They were half-engraved 
They knew it was over 
Just didn't know the date 
And I cast a spell over the west to make you think of me 
The same way I think of you 
This is a love song in my own way 
Happily ever after below the waist 
Best friends 
Ex-friends till the end 
Better off as lovers 
And not the other way around 
Racing through the city 
Windows down 
In the back of yellow checkered cars 
Best friends 
Ex-friends till the end 
Better off as lovers 
And not the other way around 
Ex-friends till the end 
Better off as lovers

These are the last blues we're ever gonna have

The last, the last, the last

The last, the last, the last 
I got a feeling inside 
that I can't domesticate 
It doesn't wanna live in a cage 
A feeling that I can't housebreak 
And I'm yours 
'Til the earth starts to crumble and the heavens roll away 
I'm struggling to exist with you and without you, yeah 
I'm just a full tank away from freedom

I'm sifting through the sand, sand, sand 
Looking through pieces of broken hourglass 
Trying to get it all back 
Put it back together 
As if the time had never passed 
I know I should walk away, know I should walk away 
But I just want to let you break my brain 
And I can't seem to get a grip 
No matter how I live with it 
These are the last blues, yeah

            <field name="lyrics">I sat outside my front window 
this story's going somewhere: 
"He's well hung," and I am hanging up. 
There's a song on the radio that says: 
"Let's get this party started." 
So let's get this party started. 
What you do on your own time's just fine. 
My imagination's much worse, 
I just never want to know. 
And what meant the world had folded 
like legs and fingers 
holding onto what escapes me; 
what he has: a better kiss that never lasts. 
You said, between your smiles and regrets: 
"Don't say it's over" 
Dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
The calm before the storm set it off, 
and the sun burnt out tonight. 
A reception less than warm set it off. 
The sun burnt out tonight. 
This is me standing in the arch of the door 
hating that look that's on your face 
that says there's another fool like me. 
There's one born every minute. 
What you do on your own time's just fine. 
My imagination's much worse, 
I just never want to know. 
What meant the world imploded, 
inflated then demoted 
all my oxygen to product gas 
and suffocated my last chance to say 
between your smiles and regrets: 
"Don't say it's over" 
Dead and gone

But me, I'm just the covers on top of your bed 
You steer a rear view mirror - you make my head swim 
I keep you warm and won't ask you where you've been 
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin 
When it's said and done they're all scrambling 
And we're friends, we're friends 
Just because we move units 
Strike us like matches, 'cause everyone deserves the flames 
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame 
At least everyone else is trying, everyone else is shining 
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame 
Such a shame 
The sounds of this small town make my ears hurt 
(Make my ears hurt) 
Oh yeah, you caught me 
But I caught you way worse 
They say, "You want a war? You've got a war." 
But who are you fighting for? 
The tides out, the ship's run aground 
We drown traitors in shallow water 
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin 
When it's said and down they're all scrambling 
And we're friends, we're friends 
Just because we move units 
Strike us like matches, 'cause everyone deserves the flames 
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame

To be living, to be breathing 
not choosing a dead body 
Remember, the man told me 
that this life is a party 
Yeah, all the glory's so short 
you should put away the garbages 
Normal ain't normal, ordinary is a luxury 
People say: Woo, pessimism 
why do you all on me? 
If you wanna understand, you stand under 
This shit is vital, respect to the mothers and fathers 
What's wrong with the life of a passenger 
If somebody gotta be then I'mma be the messenger 
I'm just too young don't know what to believe in 
But too young, you know, not to believe in 
I will stay, I will wait and I'll fall like a king 
Even though I can forever ever be a king 
I will marry this goddamn world by my own 
And put myself I get a damn ring 
If I can live through this 
If I can live through this 
If I can live through this

Wear it like a bruise or blackeye 
My badge, my witness 
That means that I believed 
Every single lie you said 
Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap negates 
The pains I went through to avoid you 
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention fails to mention I still hate you 
But there's a light on in chicago 
And I know I should be home 
All the colors of the street signs.. 
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's 
house 
She tooks me down and said: 
"boy's like you are overrated 
So save your 
breath." 
Loaded words and loaded friends 
Are loaded guns to our heads 
Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap 
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you 
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention fails to mention I still hate you 
But there's a light on in chicago 
And I know I should be home 
All the colors of the street signs.. 
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's 
house 
You want apologies 
Girl, you might hold your breath 
Until your breathing stops forever, forever 
The only thing you'll get 
Is this curse on your lips: 
I hope they taste of me forever 
But there's a light on in chicago 
And I know I should be home 
All the corners of the street signs.. 
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's 
With every breath I wish your body will be broken again</field>

Got a few more fake friends 
And it's getting hard to know what's real

Good times go 
I'm either gone in an instant

What I've got will make you feel more alive 
I'll be your favorite drug I will get you high 
I will get you high

Fell out of bed. 
Butterfly bandage,

Put him in the back of a squad car

Detox just to retox 
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life 
Imperfect boys with their perfect ploys 
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy

You caught me staring odd 
Or was that just a telescopic camera nod 
Painted dolls in the highway truck stop stalls 
Lot lizard scales cool your night life rules 
All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk when you leave the room

Livin' in a lonely world

Just a city boy 
Born and raised in South Detroit 
He took the midnight train going anywhere 
A singer in a smoky room 
The smell of wine and cheap perfume 
For a smile they can share the night 
It goes on and on and on and on 
Strangers waiting 
Up and down the boulevard 
Their shadows searching in the night 
Streetlights people 
Living just to find emotion 
Hiding somewhere in the night 
Working hard to get my fill 
Everybody wants a thrill 
Payin' anything to roll the dice 
Just one more time 
Some will win, some will lose 
Some were born to sing the blues 
Oh, the movie never ends 
It goes on and on and on and on 
Strangers waiting 
Up and down the boulevard 
Their shadows searching in the night 
Streetlights people 
Living just to find emotion 
Hiding somewhere in the night

Don't stop believin' 
Hold on to the feelin'

You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire) 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
That went off too soon 
And I miss you in the June gloom too 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
I said I'd never miss you 
But I guess you'll never know 
May the bridges I have burned 
Light my way back home 
On the fourth of July 
I'll be as honest as you let me 
I miss your early morning company 
If you get me 
You are my favorite "what if" 
You are my best "I'll never know" 
I'm starting to forget 
Just what summer ever meant to you 
What did it ever mean to you? 
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean any of it 
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa 
In between being wrong and being right 
You were my Versailles at night 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
That went off too soon 
And I miss you in the June gloom, too 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
I said I'd never miss you 
But I guess you'll never know 
May the bridges I have burned 
Light my way back home 
On the fourth of July 
My "9 to 5" is cutting open old scars 
Again and again 'til I'm stuck in your head 
Had my doubts, but I let them out 
You are the drowned 
And I'm the holy water you have been without 
And all my thoughts of you 
They could heat or cool the room 
And no, don't tell me you're crying 
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie 
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean any of it 
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa 
In between being young and being right 
You were my Versailles at night 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
That went off too soon 
And I miss you in the June gloom, too 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks

But I guess you'll never know 
May the bridges I have burned 
Light my way back home 
On the fourth of July 
I wish I'd known how much you loved me 
I wish I cared enough to know uhhh 
I'm sorry every song's about you 
The torture of small talk with someone 
You used to love 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
That went off too soon 
And I miss you in the June gloom, too 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
I said I'd never miss you 
But I guess you'll never know 
May the bridges I have burned 
Light my way back home

[Og Maco:] 
From the last time we talking got me feeling defeated 
Since the last time we talked your shit almost got deleted 
It's nothin' personal, personally, just thoughts of you hurting me 
I purchased all this shit in the bias of misery 
I purchased all these furnishings I still got bitched 
Let go of my white women and I still got lynched 
The sex was on fire, shit we still sexy 
Them hoes was one too many, how they still your friends? 
I'd explode from the pressure 
Yeah, the bombs go off, watch the bombs go off 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
That went off too soon 
And I miss you in the June gloom too 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
I said I'd never miss you 
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned 
Light my way back home on the fourth of July 
My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars 
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head 
Had my doubts but I let them out 
You are the drought 
And I'm the holy water you have been without 
And all my thoughts of you 
They could heat or cool the room 
And no, don't tell me you cried 
Oh Honey, you don't have to lie 
Oh I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it 
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa 
In between being young and being right 
You were my Versailles at night 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
That went off too soon 
And I miss you in the June gloom too 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
I said I'd never miss you 
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned 
Light my way back home on the fourth of July 
[Og Maco:] 
We were fireworks 
On the fourth of July 
Shining bright in the sky 
We went off too soon, yeah 
We were playing with fire 
In the middle of June 
It can explode from the pressure 
Yeah the bombs go off, watch the bombs go off 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
That went off too soon 
And I miss you in the June gloom too 
It was the fourth of July 
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks 
I said I'd never miss you

So let me see your moves 
Let me see your moves 
Lips pressed close to mine 
True blue 
But the prince of any failing empire knows that 
everybody wants 
Everybody wants to drive on through the night if it's 
the drive back home 
Things aren't the same anymore 
Some nights it gets so bad 
I almost pick up the phone 
Trade baby blues for wide-eyed browns 
I sleep with your old shirts and walk through this 
house in your shoes 
I know it's strange 
It's a strange way of saying that I know "I'm supposed 
to love you" 
"I'm supposed to love you" 
Whoa-oh-oh 
I've already given up on myself twice 
Third time is the charm 
Third time is the charm 
Threw caution to the wind but I've got a lousy arm 
And I've traced your shadows on the wall 
Now I kiss them whenever I'm down, whenever I'm down 
Just kind of figured on not figuring myself out 
Things aren't the same anymore 
Some nights it gets so bad 
I almost pick up the phone 
Trade baby blues for wide-eyed browns 
I sleep with your old shirts and walk through this 
house in your shoes 
I know it's strange 
It's a strange way of saying that I know "I'm supposed 
to love you" 
"I'm supposed to love you" 
Whoa-oh-oh 
I was born under a bad sign 
But you saved my life 
That night on the roof of your hotel 
Cross my heart and hope to die splinter from the 
headboard in my eye 
Photo-proofed kisses I remember so well 
Trade baby blues for wide-eyed browns 
I sleep with your old shirts and walk through this 
house in your shoes 
I know it's strange 
It's a strange way of saying that I know "I'm supposed 
to love you" 
"I'm supposed to love you"

But we never stood a chance 
And I'm not sure if it matters 
If you are the shores, I am the waves begging for big moons

(your secret's out) 
I know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to) 
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one 
And it's mind over you don't, don't matter 
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters 
But it must be said again that all us boys are just screaming 
Into microphones for attention 
Because we're just so bored 
We never knew that you would pick it apart, oh 
I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts

I know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to) 
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one 
And it's mind over you don't, don't matter 
I used to obsess over living, 
Now I only obsess over you 
Tell me you'd like boys like me better 
In the dark lying on top of you

[Talking:] 
From day one I talked about getting out 
But not forgetting about 
How my worst fears are letting out 
He said why put a new address 
On the same old loneliness 
When breathing just passes the time 
Until we all just get old and die 
Now talking's just a waste of breath 
And living's just a waste of death 
And why put a new address 
On the same old loneliness 
And this is you and me 
And me and you 
Until we've got nothing left

I can't sleep when I'm home alone 
Night time my lights on 
Woo, got me scared 
Woo, underneath my bed 
In my closet down the hall 
I see shadows all on my wall 
Man these monsters be big and tall 
Ghostbusters, who you gon' call? 
They roll up to my house, they knocking at my door 
They come busting in, killing all the ghosts 
It's so strange in my neighborhood 
Look out the window and it ain't too good 
I ain't afraid so let's get to it 
Smoke these ghosts like backwoods 
Listen 
I'm not a-, I'm not-a 
I'm not afraid, not afraid 
I'm not afraid, not afraid 
Uh, I'm not afraid 
Now, who you calin'?

And all the lovers with no time for me 
And all the mothers raise their babies 
To stay away from me... 
Tongues on the sockets 
Of electric dreams 
Where the sewage of youth 
Drowned the spark of my 
Teens 
And I knew the lights of the city were too heavy for

And thought I carried karats for everyone to see

and I'm grounding all my dreams 
of ever really seeing California, 
because I know what's in between 
is something sensual 
in such non-conventional ways 
Tonight the headphones 
will deliver you the words 
that I can't say 
Tonight I'm writing you 
a million miles away. 
Tonight is all about 
"We miss you." 
And I can't forget your style 
or your cynicism, 
somehow it was like 
you were the first to listen to everything we said. 
My smile's an open wound without you... 
and my hands are tied to pages 
inked to bring you back 
Tonight the headphones will deliver 
you the words that I can't say 
Tonight I'm writing you 
a million miles away 
Tonight is all about 
"We miss you."

Now versus then 
"Better off" against "words for wear" 
And you're someone 
Who knows someone who knows someone 
I once knew 
And I just want to be a part of this 
The road outside my house 
Is paved with good intentions 
Hire a construction crew 
Cause it's hell on the engine 
And you are the dreamer 
And we are the dream 
I could write it better than you ever felt it 
So hum hallelujah 
Just off the key of reason 
I thought I loved you 
It was just how you looked in the light 
Our teenage vow in a parking lot 
Till tonight do us part 
I've seen the blues 
And I've swallowed them too 
My words are my fate to hell 
With our good name 
We mix up your guts 
Your insight x-rays, and 
One day we'll get nostalgic for disaster 
we're a bull, your ears are just a china shop 
I love you in the same way 
There's chapel in the hospital 
one foot in your bedroom 
And one foot out the door 
Sometimes we take chances 
Sometimes we take pills 
I could write it better than you ever felt it 
So hum hallelujah 
Just off the key of reason 
I thought I loved you 
It was just how you looked in the light 
Our teenage vow in a parking lot 
Till tonight, do us part 
I've seen the blues 
And I've swallowed them too 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu

Sweat it out, shut your mouth

I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped 
Back to your family 'cause I know you will be missed 
So you can find a safe place, place to serve 
They call kids like us vicious and carved out of

But for what we've become, we just feel more

Always weigh what I've lost against what I left

Prettier and younger but not any better off

If I woke up next to you 
If I woke up next to you 
Collect the bad habits 
That you couldn't bare to keep 
Out of the woods but I love 
A tree I used to lay beneath 
Kisses still there 
From a sour bottle baby girl 
With eyes the size of baby worlds 
We're the new face of failure 
Prettier and younger but not any better off 
Bulletproof and loneliness

Ain't bad

Do you remember the way I held your hand? 
Under the lamp post and ran home 
This way so many times

It's already gon' be another martyr 
It's already gon' be another murder

Do a Hail Mary then run for the border

You're second hand smoke 
Second hand smoke 
I breathe you in 
But honey I don't know 
What you're doing to me, mon chéri 
But the truth catches up with us eventually 
Try to say live, baby let live 
But I'm no good good at lip service 
Except when they're yours 
Move over more 
I'm coming for you and I'm making war 
And I still love the way you hurt me 
It's irresistible whoa, whoa oh yeah 
Whoa, whoa oh yeah 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby

Drag my nails on the tile 
I just follow your scent, 
You can just follow my smile 
All of your flaws are aligned 
With this mood of mine 
Cutting me to the bone, 
Nothing left to leave behind 
You ought to keep me concealed 
Just like I was a weapon 
I didn't come for a fight 
But I will fight til the ending 
This one might be a battle, 
Might not turn out okay 
You know you look so Seattle 
But you feel so La 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
And I love the way you hurt me 
It's irresistible, whoa, whoa, oh, yeah 
Whoa, whoa, oh, yeah 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby 
I love the way, I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby 
I'm gonna get you to burst 
Just like you were a bubble 
Frame me up on your wall 
Just to keep me out of trouble 
Like a moth getting trapped 
In the light by fixation 
Truly free, love it baby, 
I'm talking no inflation 
Too many war wounds and not enough wars 
Too few rounds in the ring 
And not enough settled scores 
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves 
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey

You hurt me one time then I love it 
You hurt me two times then fuck it 
When my pockets was old, you was ready to go 
Now my pockets on so you got relationship goals 
When you laid your eyes on me, you was excited 
And I was the fuel to your flame, I ignited 
Then you stole my heart, that's the heart of a lion 
So fuck all this shit, let's just start up a riot 
This world is so cold that's why I bought a fur coat 
My house is on a island, you gonna need a fucking boat 
And I swim with the sharks til the other side 
And I feed on the [?] outside 
I came from the bottom, are you from the bottom? 
If you ever had problems and you started from the bottom, holler 
And I love the way you hurt me

[Takeoff:] 
Hey, talk somethin' Takeoff 
See I would toss her salad [?] rock and never fold 
I'ma tell him, my son, everythin' glitter it ain't gold 
I showed you shit that a basic bitch, she'll never know 
And took you places a basic bitch, she'll never go 
Now you running around showing off your camel toe 
Got you singing a sad song, call you Satchmo 
Then go home and tell your momma about us and we fuss 
She called my phone and question me like we love her, she bugging 
I think it's better that we end our days and split our ways 
Know you like them red bottles, put you right back in them Js 
When we go shopping we cop it right then and never wait 
When we depart, go put that merchandise on layaway 
I tried to show you expensive shit and luxury living 
Breaking news, break your heart when you see me on television 
Takeoff 
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke 
I breathe you in, but honey I don't know what you're doing to me 
Mon chéri but the truth catches up with us eventually

So listen carefully to every word I say: 
"I'm the only one who's gonna get away with making excuses today" 
You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have 
Blackmailed myself 
(Cause I ain't got) 
Cause I ain't got anyone else 
This is a stick up 
Give us all your inspiration 
And I've got the red carpet blues baby 
So put your hands in the air and don't make a sound 
But don't get the wrong idea 
We're gonna shoot you 
We're gonna shoot you 
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet 
That could change just how this goes 
No 
We're gonna shoot you 
We're gonna shoot you 
Whoa 
When I said that I'd return to you I meant more like a relapse 
Now and again I think "His and her's" "For better or worse" 
But the only ring I want buried with me are the ones around my eyes 
You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have 
And I've got the red carpet blues, baby 
So put your hands in the air and don't make a sound 
But don't get the wrong idea 
We're gonna shoot you 
We're gonna shoot you 
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet 
That could change just how this goes 
And everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat 
Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound 
But don't get the wrong idea 
We're gonna shoot you 
We're gonna shoot you 
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet 
That could change just how this goes 
And everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat 
But don't get the wrong idea

We're gonna shoot you

Just like Judy 
The kind that makes june feel like september 
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember 
And I'm trying to find that peace of mind 
Behind these two white highway lines 
When the city goes silent 
The ringing in my ears gets violent 
She's in a long black coat tonight 
Waiting for me in the downpour outside 
She's singing 'baby come home' in a melody of tears 
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time 
And I remember 'baby, come home' 
I remember 'baby, come home' 
I remember 'baby, come home' 
I remember 'baby, come home' 
Did you ever love her? do you know? 
Or did you never want to be alone? 
And she was singing 'baby, come home' 
"baby, come home" 
I've got those jet pack blues 
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me 
Honey, don't you leave 
Don't you remember how we used to slip a drink? 
It never mattered what it was 
I think our hands were just that close 
The sweetness never lasted, no 
She's in a long black coat tonight 
Waiting for me in the downpour outside 
She's singing 'baby come home' in a melody of tears

I know you heard that I got nominated 
Won't you walk the red carpet with it 
With a dress I bought you, it's awful when I've been gone too long 
And I call like it ain't been a while 
That promise that I hold you down seem like a lyric from your favorite song 
I'm not surprised if you step aside and get another 
Way too hard to reach like a boy in a bubble 
Always on a shuttle to another planet 
It's crazy how my crash landed only leave you damaged 
I just keep up all the pieces that I left you in 
Hoping praying when I'm home I see you again 
And you understand I'm being the man I need to be 
To provide for the lives of you and me 
Cause you know that 
I got those jet pack blues 
Just like Judy 
The kind that makes June feel like September 
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember

I'm talking about another green room, another hotel 
Doing what I'm doing a lot, doing it well 
Maybe we should kick it next time, go out all the time 
Bone appetite it's so bittersweet when I come around 
Always on the phone texting and scrolling talking bout business 
Swiping my card could never fix it when I visit 
And that's the realest drop you whispered in my ear 
The last time you cried on the phone, I felt the tear, believe it or not 
When I vamp, I give you all that I got 
I do this for us so don't ask me to stop 
The lights and glamour ain't the reason why I put in this work 
I'm seconds from the stage but I'm putting you first 
Despite my absence, words and closed captions 
Read me like a simple I love you wrote on a napkin 
This is more than just a fly by night action 
You're the fuel everlasting to keep my jet packing 
I've got those jet pack blues 
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me 
Honey, don't you leave 
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink 
It never mattered what it was, I think 
Our hands were just that close 
The sweetness never lasts, you know

Waiting for me in the downpour outside

Get them drunk on rose water 
See how dirty I can get them 
Pulling out their fragile teeth 
And clip their tiny wings 
Anything you say can 
And will be held against you 
So only say my name 
It will be held against you 
Anything you say can and will be held against you 
So only say my name 
If heaven's grief brings hell's rain 
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows 
For just one yesterday 
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday 
(I saved it all for you) 
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way 
Still I'd trade all my tomorrows 
For just one yesterday 
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday 
(I saved it all for you) for just one yesterday 
Letting people down is my thing baby 
Find yourself a new gig 
This town isn't big enough for the two of us 
I don't have the right name, or the right looks 
But I have twice the heart 
Anything you say can and will be held against you 
So only say my name 
It will be held against you 
Anything you say can and will be held against you 
So only say my name 
If heaven's grief brings hell's rain

Still I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday 
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday 
(I saved it all for you) for just one yesterday 
If I spilled my guts 
The world would never look at you the same way 
Now I'm here to give you hope my love 
So I can watch your face 
As I take it all away away away-ay-yay 
If heaven's grief brings hell's rain 
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows

Opium den mother, forget my head 
At the dead-end called of unsteadiness 
Boxed blondes have less fun 
Boomerang my head 
Back to the city I grew up in 
Again and again and again and again 
Forever a lake effect kid 
I got the skyline in my veins 
Forget your night times 
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel 
And joke us, joke us, 
'Til life's on track comes back into focus 
I just want to come back to love 
Spark until you hit it, keep you warm enough 
I got a pocket full of deadliness 
Opium den mother, forget my head 
At the dead end called unsteadiness 
Boxed blondes have less fun, fun 
Boomerang my head

Boomerang my head

Why is the bedroom so cold 
Turned away on your side? 
Is my timing that flawed, 
our respect run so dry? 
Yet there's still this appeal 
That we've kept through 
our lives 
Love, love will tear us apart again [x4] 
Do you cry out in your sleep 
All my failings expose? 
Get a taste in my mouth 
As desperation takes hold 
Is it something so good 
Just can't function no more?

Life is just a Ferris wheel 
It's always up and down, don't make a sound 
When you wake up the world will come around 
When you wake up the world will come around 
It's just the sweet weather

in the morning it will all be better

Chlorine kissed summer skin 
I miss missing you now and then 
Sometimes before it gets better 
The darkness gets bigger 
The person that you'd take a bullet for is behind the trigger 
Oh 
We're fading fast 
I miss missing you now and then 
Making eyes at this husk around my heart 
I see through you when we're sitting in the dark 
So give me your filth 
Make it rough 
Let me let me trash your love 
I will sing to you every day 
If it will take away the pain 
Oh and I've heard you got it got it so bad 
'Cause I am the best you'll never have

and i thought about many movies ive seen at your house 
excuse me if im rude 
but id rather that we just strike from the record ones id see again without you 
leaning on my shoulder 
distracting me from the plotline 
where can i go when i want you around 
but i cant stand to be around you 
"go home" 
ill walk myself to you 
ill walk myself away from here 
"go to hell" is all i thought for seven weeks 
but i grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people 
looking glossed just like a summer ago 
where can i go when i want you around 
but i cant stand to be around you 
"go home" 
ill walk myself to you 
ill walk myself away from here 
"call me back" im pleading with a cork in my head 
it wouldnt be the first time 
my pillow has been mistaken 
where can i go when i want you around 
but i cant stand to be around you 
"go home" 
ill walk myself to you 
ill walk myself away from here 
cant stand to be around you 
around you, around you 
cant stand to be around you

around you

            <field name="lyrics">Spent most of last night dragging this lake 
for the corpses of all my past mistakes 
sell me out, the jokes on you 
he is salt and you are the wound 
empty another bottle 
and let me tear you to pieces 
this is me wishing you into the worst situations 
I'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go 
but you wouldn't know a good thing 
if it came up and slit your throat 
woah, woah 
ooh 
woah, woah 
your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears 
rather ones that just don't care 
cause I know 
that you're in between arms somewhere 
next to heartbeats where you shouldn't dare asleep 
now I'll teach you a lesson for keeping secrets from me 
take your taste back 
peel back your skin 
and try to forget how it feels inside 
you should try saying no once in a while 
oh, once in a while 
take your taste back 
peel back your skin 
and try to forget how it feels inside 
you should try saying no once in a while 
oh, once in a while 
and did you hear the news? 
I could dissect you 
and gut you on this stage 
not as eloquent as I may have imagined 
but it will get the job done, and you're done 
every line is plotted and designed 
to leave you standing on your bedroom windows ledge 
and everyone else that it hits, that it gets to 
is nothing more than collateral damage 
take your taste back 
peel back your skin 
and try to forget how it feels inside 
you should try saying no once in a while 
oh, once in a while 
take your taste back 
peel back your skin 
and try to forget how it feels inside 
you should try saying no once in a while 
oh, once in a while</field>

Somewhere another pretty vein just dies 
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see 
That you're the antidote to everything except for me 
A constellation of tears on your lashes 
Burn everything you love 
Then burn the ashes 
In the end everything collides 
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see

Singing I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare 
I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare 
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you 
you would never sing along 
Cast them out cause this is our culture 
These new flocks are nothing but vultures 
Because they took our love and they filled it up 
Filled me up with novocaine and now I'm just numb 
Now I'm just numb 
Don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun 
So don't stop, don't stop until your heart goes numb 
Now I'm just numb 
Don't feel a thing for you 
I'm just a problem that doesn't want to be solved 
So could you please hold your applause 
Take this sideshow and all it's freaks 
And turn it into the silver screen

I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare

Uzi, Fall Out Boy 
Lately I've been cooking up the blue flame 
And I'm hanging with a model cause it do 'caine 
Yeah, be out tweaking on the D'usse, uh 
I showed up to the party with the bling-bling, got a new chain 
Every single time the news change 
I can never do same or it's too strange 
Judging how things turned out, I'm guessing things do change 
I grew up the [?] boy seeking loose change 
Niggas acting brand new off the new fame 
Swear this shit is lame [?] 
I've been getting twisted off the liquor and the champagne 
Pirex [?] 
All they do is ball, all you niggas small, small change 
I stay with a brand new new 
And a brand new moon, new room, and I'm ready to blaze 
Because they took our love and they filled it up 
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb 
Now I'm just numb 
Don't' mind me I'm just a son of a gun 
Don't stop don't stop till your heart goes numb 
Now I'm just stuck 
I don't feel a thing for you 
Ooh, I say one day the valley is gonna swallow me whole

I feel like a photo that's been overexposed

I'm head over heels for someone (I) 
That I really can't deal with (deal with) 
I want to block her out my mind 
But I really can't do it 
I tell myself this the last time 
I'ma let her do this to me 
Whenever we do spend time 
I realize that I can't get enough of you

Wipe that smile off your fucking face (Then I say to you) 
Wipe that smile off your face (Then I say to you) 
Wipe that smile off your fucking face (Then I say to you) 
Wipe that smile off your face (Then I say to you)

To be sought

Right in the middle

To be dreamt of 
To be sought 
On the inside 
I don't care 
Be my unholy 
My one and my only

I wear scarves and hoods 
'Cause they're the only poker face that I got left 
And everything I love about you is a mess 
Smash the mirror and break the palm readers hand

Girl, just look what you've done 
How could you do this to me? 
I gotta put my foot down 
I can't let you do this to me 
I can't forget those good ole times 
And all the things you've been doing to me 
I wanna hit that one more time 
I mean love, what your doing to me 
I'ma say it loud, right here 
Let's fuck in this crowd 
Why we arguing 
I thought me and you were supposed to be 
Friends 
Let's chill for minute (for a minute) 
Better yet we need to heal for a minute (for a minute) 
Baby, put down the knife 
Sometime I wanna save ya life

So many kids but I only see you

But thats none of my business is it? 
I'm not the way you think I am [whoooaaah] 2x

Was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine

Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
No thesis existed for burning cities down 
At such a rampant rate 
No graphics and no f**king powerpoint presentation 
So they just DIY'd that sh*t 
And built their own bombs 
She's his suicide blond, she's number than gold 
Are you ready for another bad poem? 
One more off key anthem 
Let your teeth sink in 
Remember me as I was not as I am 
And I said "I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead" 
I kept wishing she had blonde ambition 
And she'd let it go to my head 
Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
If my love is a weapon 
There's no second guessing when I say 
Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
If my heart is a grenade 
You pull the pin and say 
We're all fighting growing old 
We're all fighting growing old 
In the hopes 
Of a few minutes more 
To get on St 
Peter's list 
But you need to lower your standards 
Cause it's never 
Getting any better than this 
We are professional ashes of roses 
This kerosene's live 
You settled your score 
This is where you come to beg 
Unborn and unshaven 
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens 
This is what we do, we nightmare you 
I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards 
And your heart beat in reverse 
Our guts can't be reworked 
As alone as a little white church 
In the middle of the desert 
Getting burned 
But I'll take your heart served up two ways 
I sing a bitter song 
I'm the lonelier version of you 
I just don't know where it went wrong 
Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
If my love is a weapon 
There's no second guessing when I say 
Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
If my heart is a grenade 
You pull the pin and say 
We're all fighting growing old 
We're all fighting growing old 
In the hopes

Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
It's never getting any better than this 
Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
It's never getting any better than this 
Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
It's never getting any better than this 
She's sick and she's wrong 
She's young dirty blonde 
And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb 
He says "I've seen bigger" 
She says "I've lit better" 
And they throw the matches down into the glitter 
Not a dry eye left in the house 
Go boy, go boy, run for your life 
Go boy, go boy run for your life 
Go boy, go boy, run for your life 
We're all fighting growing old 
We're all fighting growing old 
In the hopes 
Of a few minutes more 
To get on St 
Peter's list 
But you need to lower your standards 
Cause it's never 
Getting any better than this 
Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey

They always bring up how you changed 
Never the same person when I go to sleep 
As when I wake up, as when I wake up

It's just a matter of time until we're all found out 
Take our tears, put them on ice 
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light 
We're the therapists pumping through your speakers 
Delivering just what you need 
We're well-read and poised 
We're the best boys 
We're the chemists who've found the formula 
To make your heart swell and burst 
No matter what they say, don't believe a word 
'Cause I'll keep singing this lie if you'll keep believing it 
I'll keep singing this lie 
I'll keep singing this lie 
Are we growing up or just going down

Take our tears, put them on ice 
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light 
We're traveled like gypsies 
Only with worse luck and far less gold 
We're the kids you used to love 
But then we grew old 
We're the lifers, here til the bitter end 
Condemned from the start 
Ashamed of the way 
The songs and the words own 
The beating of our hearts 
'Cause I'll keep singing this lie 
I'll keep singing this lie 
Are we growing up or just going down? 
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out 
Take our tears, put 'em on ice 
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light 
There's a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up 
And there's another around to help us bend your trust 
I've got a sunset in my veins 
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay 
The best part of "Believe" is the "Lie," 
I hope you sing along and you steal a line 
I need to keep you like this in my mind

Sun, sun, sun (I'm stuck in the sun) 
You are my truest feeling yet

It's just like oxygen 
And it's getting to my head 
A public meltdown 
Pebulant but irrelevant 
Take all your possibilities 
and take away the limits 
Take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks 
I do the best with what I have

“I could have died with you” 
I hope you choke on those words, that kiss, that bottle - confess (So bury me in memory) 
Now ash yourself, yeah, out on the insides, said I loved you but I lied 
Let’s play this game called “when you catch fire” 
I wouldn’t piss to put you out 
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them 
So I can forget about you 
So bury me in memory 
His smile’s your rope 
So wrap it tight around your throat 
On the drive home 
Joke about the kid you used to see 
And his jealousy 
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool 
As when you wrap your car around a tree 
Your makeup looks so great next to his teeth (his teeth) 
Let’s play this game called “when you catch fire” 
I wouldn’t piss to put you out, no 
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them 
So I can forget about you

Young hollywood 
Is on the other line 
Her nose runs ruby red 
Death's in a double bed 
Singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate

But I'm no good at math and besides the dollar is down 
Plant palm trees on Lake Michigan before it gets cold 
I gotta feel the wind chill again before I get old 
I wanna scream 'I love you' from the top of my lungs 
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me 
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long 
Before it all becomes the same old song 
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town 
And get new passports and get get get get get out now 
All the Yes men said 'no comment' 
My mouth got going the wrong way and all the calls started to roll in 
The time my dad caught me a horse shoe crab 
And I asked him if throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back 
I wanna scream 'I love you' from the top of my lungs 
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me 
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long 
Before it all becomes the same old song 
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town 
And get new passports, get out now 
Tell that boy I'll leave you alone now 
Like a stove, I'll turn my love down 
Supra and the prophet are both in the business of souls 
I wanna scream 'I love you' from the top of my lungs 
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me 
I wanna scream 'I love you' from the top of my lungs 
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me 
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long 
Before it all becomes the same old song 
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town

And get new passports and get get get get get out,

And we shake, shake, shake the hips in relationships 
Stop by this disaster town 
You'll put your eyes to the sun and say "I know" 
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding 
And we might have started singing just a little soon 
And we're throwing the stones in a glass room 
Whoa ah oh, we're so miserable and stunning 
Whoa ah oh, far from the genuine becoming 
We keep the beat with your blistered feet 
We bullet the words at the mockingbirds, singing 
Slept through the weekend and dreamed 
we're sinking with the melody of the kiss of eternity 
Your pulse comes from a pharmacist, saying "How you been?" 
We might of said good byes just a little soon 
(Stop by this disaster town) 
Our beliefs of kissing beats over this room 
Whoa ah oh, we're so miserable and stunning 
Whoa ah oh, far from the genuine becoming 
Whoa ah oh, we're so miserable and stunning 
Whoa ah oh, far from the genuine becoming 
It was icecream headaches and sweet avalanche 
when the pearls in our shells come out to dance 
This is what you get for abusing sweet love 
Take off your clothes, it hurts just right 
What happens I'm okay; diving into knives don't cut me 
Think you could call me when you get home? 
Take your self apart find yourself with love 
Whoa ah oh, we're so miserable and stunning 
Whoa ah oh, far from the genuine becoming

So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever 
Bel Air baby did you get dressed up? 
Pretty pout pout

The mighty fall 
They fall in love 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
Oh how the mighty fall in love 
Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme 
And I'm dizzy on dreams 
(Yeah you're dizzy on dreams) 
But if you ask me 
Two's a whole lot lonelier than one 
B-baby we should've left our love 
In the gutter where we found it 
(Gutter where we found it) 
Cause you think your only crime is 
That you got caught 
I'm singing 
Whoa 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
They fall in love 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
Oh how the mighty fall in love 
It's getting clear 
You're never coming clean 
So I'll lock you up inside 
And swallow 
Swallow the key 
Hello? 
Yeah I know you said not to call 
Unless I'm dying 
But I'm driving 
And I can't stop staring at my eyelids 
But even though my eyes closed, I still see you 
I just hope when you see me 
I'm not see-through 
You know how we do 
Some times I swear, I need a day just for me to lay 
With some T and A, but the way we 
They way we is do deeper 
Baby straight up chemistry DNA 
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A 
Like, I let her climb on top 
I'm either fuckin or workin' 
So the grind don't stop 
They say I got screws missing, well hell 
Only when I'm missing you 
And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you 
Whoa 
How the mighty fall (hey) 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
They fall in love 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
Oh how the mighty fall in love</field>

In my aching heads I got my kisses slipped. 
Our gossip lips stuttered every word I said, I said, 
I got your love letters, corrected the grammar and sent them back. 
It's true - romance is dead, I shot it in the chest then in the head. 
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your prince, 
Because they've got me in a band 
where I've never seen a heart I couldn't break. 
It was never about the songs, it was competition, 
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest... 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances. 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances. 
I'm casualty-obsessed and I've forgiven death, 
I am indifferent yet (I am total wreck), 
I'm every cliche, but I simply do it best. 
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your prince, 
Because they've got me in a band 
where I've never seen a heart I couldn't break. 
It was never about the songs, it was competition, 
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest... 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances. 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances. 
(Go!) 
I went to sleep a poet, and I woke up a fraud, 
To calm your nerves I'm feeling for my clothes in the dark. 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances. 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances. 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances.

You are a brick tied to me 
That's dragging me down 
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground 
We are the jack-o'-lanterns in July 
Setting fire to the sky 
Here he comes this rising tide 
So come on 
Put on your war paint 
Crosswalks and crossed hearts and hope to die 
Seal the clouds with grey lining 
So we can take the world back from the heart attack 
One maniac at a time 
We will take it back 
You know time crawls on 
When you're waiting for the song to start 
So dance alone to the beat of your heart 
Hey young blood 
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out? 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
Wearing all vintage misery 
No, I think it looked a little better on me 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
Bring home the boys in scraps 
Scrap metal the tanks 
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks 
Because the world is just a teller 
And we are wearing black masks 
So rock our spirits 
And you'll know we've passed 
So we can take the world back from the heart attack 
One maniac at a time 
We will take it back 
You know time crawls on 
When you're waiting for the song to start 
So dance alone to the beat of your heart 
Hey young blood 
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out? 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
Wearing all vintage misery 
No, I think it looked a little better on me 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
Put on your war paint 
The war is won 
Before it's begun 
Release the doves 
Surrender love 
The war is won 
Before it's begun 
Release the doves 
Surrender love 
The war is won 
Before it's begun 
Release the doves 
Surrender love

they were gone by the time we (talked)... 
I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself 
But you know that I could crush you with my voice 
Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me 
Hide the details I don't want to know a thing 
I hate the way you say my name like it's something secret 
My pen is the barrel of the gun 
Remind me which side you should be on 
I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel..</field>

Enough to make up for lost time 
Enough to make up for lost time

I wrote the gospel on giving up

[Patrick Stump:] 
Last summer we took three across the board 
But by fall we were a cover story 
Now in stores 
Make us poster boys for your scene 
But we are not making an accepting speech 
I found the safest place to keep all of our mistakes 
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update 
So long live the car-crash hearts 
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life 
Fix me in 45 
So long live the car-crash hearts 
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life 
Fix me in 45 
I can take your problems away 
with a nod and a wave 
Of my hand, 
'Cause that's just the kind of boy that I am. 
The only thing I haven't done yet is die 
And it's me and my plus one in the afterlife 
Crowds are won and lost and won again 
But our hearts beat for the diehards 
So long live the car-crash hearts 
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life 
Fix me in 45 
So long live the car-crash hearts 
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life 
Fix me in 45 
Long live the car-crash hearts

That shares our fate and deserves our pity 
I don't want to remember it all 
The promises I made if you just hold on 
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
[Joey Bada$$:] 
Woke up inside a casket after thought that I missed her 
Funny it's always an after thought whenever I kissed her 
Skeleton in my closet don't want to see me alive 
But somehow I get blinded when I look into your eyes 
I just need enough of you to dull the pain 
Just to get me through the night until we're twins again 
Until we're stripped down to our skeletons again 
Until we're saints just swimming in our sins again 
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on 
Up above our heads droning on and on and on 
Keep making trouble till find what you love 
I need a new partner in crime and you shrug 
There's a room in a hotel in New York City 
That shares our fate and deserves our pity 
I don't want to remember it all 
The promises are made if you just hold on 
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Woke up inside a casket after thought that I missed her 
Funny it's always an after thought whenever I kissed her 
Skeleton in my closet don't want to see me alive 
But somehow I get blinded when I look into your eyes 
A birth and a death on the same day 
And honey I only appear so I can fade away 
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream 
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame 
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on 
Up above our heads droning on and on and on 
Hit it never quit it I have been through the wreck 
But I can scream enough to show my face in the light of day 
[Joey Bada$$:] 
Innie-minnie decisions who I choose to be with 
Victim of superstition, won't see me in the pic booth 
I'm under supervision would be damned if I slipped up 
You knew my true intention but you want to keep pretending 
Look I can't keep pretensin', can't even be present 
Now you tryna [?] 
Let the story fucking [?] 
Fuck it, go to Heaven 
I'm the room 407

Up above our heads droning on and on and on 
Keep making trouble till find what you love 
I need a new partner in crime and your shotgun 
There's a room in a hotel in new york city 
That shares our fate and deserves our pity 
I don't want to remember it all 
The promises are made if you just hold on 
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
A birth and a death on the same day 
And honey I only appear so I can fade away 
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream 
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame 
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on 
Up above our heads droning on and on and on 
Hit it never quit it I have been through the wreck 
But I can scream enough to show my face in the light of day 
There's a room in a hotel in new york city 
That shares our fate and deserves our pity 
I don't want to remember it all 
The promises are made if you just hold on 
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on</field>

How we're all alone 
Give me, build me 
it's your club, so let me in (let me in)

it is inside your skin

Oh hell yes, I'm a nervous wreck 
Oh hell yes, the drugs just make me reset 
Knock once for the father, twice for the son 
Three times for the holy ghost 
Come on in the water's warm 
Come on like a sugar cube but with a kick in the head 
like putting wings on lead 
Your eyes are blocking my starlight 
I'm the last of my kind 
And that's all that should matter to you 
Follow the desorganized religion of my head 
And we'll never get through customs 
Let's just take of again instead 
Got my degree in the gutter 
My broken in dorms of the Ivy League 
Oh hell yes, I'm a nervous wreck 
Oh hell yes, the drugs just make me reset

I hope he is a gentleman 
Maybe he won't find out what I know 
You were the last good thing 
We're going down, down in an earlier round 
And sugar, we're goin' down swinging 
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to halftime 
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you'd love to lead 
Dance, this is the way they'd love 
If they knew how misery loved me 
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
One night and one more time 
Thanks for the memories 
Even though they weren't so great 
He tastes like you, only sweeter 
Growing up, growing up

Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair 
What's this? 
What's this? What's this? 
There's something very wrong 
What's this? 
There's people singing songs 
What's this? 
The streets are lined with 
Little creatures laughing 
Everybody seems so happy 
Have I possibly gone daffy? 
What is this? 
What's this? 
There's children throwing snowballs 
Instead of throwing heads 
They're busy building toys 
And absolutely no one's dead 
There's frost on every window 
Oh, I can't believe my eyes 
And in my bones I feel the warmth 
That's coming from inside 
Oh, look 
What's this? 
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss 
Why that looks so unique, inspired 
They're gathering around to hear a story 
Roasting chestnuts on a fire 
What's this? 
What's this? 
In here they've got a little tree, how queer 
And who would ever think 
And why? 
They're covering it with tiny little things 
They've got electric lights on strings 
And there's a smile on everyone 
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong 
This looks like fun 
This looks like fun 
Oh, could it be I got my wish? 
What's this? 
Oh my, what now? 
The children are asleep 
But look, there's nothing underneath 
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them 
Oh ensnare them, only little cozy things 
Secure in their dreamland 
What's this? 
The monsters are all missing 
And the nightmares can't be found 
And in their place there seems to be 
Good feeling all around 
Instead of screams, I swear 
I can hear music in the air 
The smell of cakes and pies 
Are absolutely everywhere 
The sights, the sounds 
They're eveywhere and all around 
I've never felt so good before 
This empty place inside of me is filling up 
I simply cannot get enough 
I want it, oh, I want it 
Oh, I want it for my own 
I've got to know 
I've got to know 
What is this place that I have found? 
What is this?</field>

It's the only reason that I sing 
I don't believe a word you say 
But I can't stop listening 
This is the story of how they met 
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes 
When she touched him he turned ruby red 
A story that they'll never forget 
Never forget 
And all the boys are smoking menthols 
Girls are getting back rubs 
I will appear to you 
If you make yourself shake fast enough 
My old aches become new again 
My old friends become exes again 
Whoa, where did the party go? 
We're ending it on the phone 
I'm not gonna go home alone 
Where did the party go? 
I know I expect too much 
And not enough all at once 
You know I only wanted fun 
Then you got me all fucked up on love 
Oh I looked for your name on the ouija board 
And your naked magic oh dear lord 
You and me are the difference 
Between real love and the love on tv 
And all the boys are smoking menthols 
Girls are getting back rubs 
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough 
My old aches become new again 
My old friends become exes again, yeah

Stuck in talking cinema life

My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out 
It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed 
"To I swear, I say" 
"To I swear, I say" 
To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes" 
To drinks at the club, to the bar 
To the keys to your car 
To hotel stairs to the emergency exit door 
To the love, I left my conscience pressed 
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer 
"What did it ever do for me" I say 
It never calls me when I'm down 
Love never wanted me 
But I took it anyway 
Put your ear to the speaker 
And choose love or sympathy 
But never both 
Love never wanted me 
"I hoped you choked 
And crashed your car" 
Hey "tear catcher", that's all that you are 
And ever were 
From the start 
I swear, I say 
(I swear, I say) 
To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes" 
To drinks at the club, to the bar 
To the keys to your car 
To hotel stairs to the emergency exit door, no 
To the love, I left my conscience pressed 
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer 
"What did it ever do for me" I say 
It never calls me when I'm down 
Love never wanted me 
But I took it anyway 
Put your ear to the speaker 
And choose love or sympathy 
But never both, no 
To the "love" I left my conscience pressed 
Through the keyhole, I watched you dress 
Kiss and tell 
Loose lips sink ships 
To the "love" I left my conscience pressed 
Through the keyholes, I watched you dress 
Kiss and tell 
Loose lips sink ships 
To the "love" I left my conscience pressed 
Through the keyholes, I watched you dress 
Kiss and tell (kiss and tell) 
Loose lips sink ships 
To the "love" I left my conscience pressed 
To the "love" I left my conscience pressed 
To the "love" I left my conscience pressed 
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer

We never stood a chance 
And I'm not sure if it matters 
If you are the shores, I am the waves begging for big moons 
I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town 
I know this hurts, it was meant to 
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one 
And it's mind over (you don't) matter 
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters 
But it must be said again that all us boys are just screaming 
Into microphones for attention 
Because we're just so bored 
I never knew that you would pick it apart, oh 
I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts 
I used to obsess over living, 
Now I only obsess over you 
Tell me you'd like boys like me better 
In the dark lying on top of you 
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters</field>

is dressed to the nines. 
In the mirror he practices all his lines. 
To his closing argument twelve hearts beat in favor. 
I'm guessing that he read the morning paper. 
The headline reads, "The Man Hangs, But The Jury Doesn't". 
And everyone's looking for relief. 
United States versus disbelief. 
Mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle. 
Clear your throat and face the world. 
The verdict falls like bachelors for bad luck girls. 
Only breathing with the aid of denial. 
Case open, case shut, 
But you could pay to close it like a casket. 
Baby boy can't lift his headache head. 
Isn't it tragic? (Whoaaa-ooo.) 
He glances at his peers sitting, seven to twelve, 
Stacked on one to six. 
The gallery is hushed. 
Boys in three pieces dream of grandstanding and bravado. 
The city sleeps in a cell not withstanding what we all know. 
Hang on a rope or bated breath. 
Whichever you prefer. 
And everyone's looking for relief. 
A bidding war for an old friend's grief. 
The cause, the kid, the cause, the charm and the curse. 
Not a word that could make you comprehend. 
Too well dressed for the witness stand. 
The press prays for whichever headline's worse. 
Case open, case shut, 
But you could pay to close it like a casket. 
Baby boy can't lift his headache head. 
Isn't it tragic? (Whoaaa-ooo.) 
Fresh pressed suit and tie. 
Unimpressed birds sing and die. 
Can talk my way out of anything. 
The foreman reads the verdict: 
"In the above entitled actions we find the defendant, 
Guilty..." 
Case open, case shut, 
But you could pay to close it like a casket. 
Baby boy can't lift his headache head. 
Isn't it tragic? 
Case open, case shut, 
But you could pay to close it like a casket.

Woke up on the wrong side of reality

Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived

don't call me up, when the snow comes down

Until you die for me, as long as there is a light 
My shadow is over you 'cause I am the opposite of amnesia

You're about to bloom 
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

This story's going somewhere 
He's well hung and I am hanging on 
There's a song on the radio that says 
"Let's get this party started" 
So let's get this party started 
 
What you do on your own time's just fine 
My imaginations much worse 
I just never want to know 
And what meant the world had folded 
Like legs and fingers holding on to 
What escapes me what he has: 
A better kiss that never lasts 
 
You said between your smiles and regrets 
"Don't say it's over" 
Dead and gone 
Dead and gone yeah 
 
The calm before the storm, set it off 
And the sun burnt out tonight 
A reception less than warm, set it off 
And the sun burnt out tonight 
 
This is me standing in the arch of the door 
Hating that look that's on your face 
That says there's another fool like me 
There's one born every minute 
There's one born every minute 
 
What you do on your own time's just fine 
My imaginations much worse 
I just never want to know (never want to know) 
What meant the world imploded 
Inflated then demoted all my 
Oxygen to product gas 
And suffocated my last chance 
 
You said between your smiles and regrets 
"Don't say it's over" 
Dead and gone 
Dead and gone yeah 
 
Calm before the storm (set it of, set it off) 
Calm before the storm (set it off, set it off) 
 
The calm before the storm, set it off 
And the sun burnt out tonight 
A reception less than warm set it off

Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap 
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you 
And every little tap on the shoulder for attention 
Fails to mention I still hate you 
 
But there's a light on in Chicago 
And I know I should be home 
All the colors of the street signs 
They remind me of the pickup truck 
Out in front of your neighbor's house 
 
She took me down and said 
"Boys like you are overrated. So save your breath" 
Loaded words and loaded friends 
Are loaded guns to our heads. 
 
You want apologies, girl you might hold your breath 
Until your breathing stops forever 
The only thing you'll get 
Is this curse on your lips 
I hope they taste of me forever 
 
With every breath I wish your body 
Will be broken again</field>

Tonight is all about "We miss you."

And one just cause they'll kill you sooner than my expectations 
To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar: 
"I could have died with you" 
I hope you choke on those words, that kiss, that bottle I confess 
Now ash yourself out on the insides, when I said I loved you I swear I lied 
 
Let's play this game called "when you catch fire" 
I wouldn't piss to put you out 
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them 
So I can forget about you 
 
So bury me in memory 
His smile's your rope 
Wrap it tight around your throat 
 
On the drive home 
Joke about the kid you used to see 
And his jealousy 
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool 
As when you wrap your car around a tree 
Your makeup looks great next to his teeth</field>

And ambitions are low 
And resentment rides high 
But emotions won't grow 
And we're changing our ways 
Taking different roads 
Love, love will tear us apart 
Again, again, again, again 
 
Why is this bedroom so cold 
Turned away on your side? 
Is my timing that flawed 
Our respect run so dry? 
Yet there's still this appeal 
That we've kept through 
Our lives 
 
[Repeat: x4] 
Love, love will tear us apart again 
 
You cry out in your sleep 
All my failings exposed 
There's a taste in my mouth 
As desperation takes hold 
Just that something so good 
Just can't function more

Dragging this lake 
For the corpses of all my past mistakes 
Sell me out the jokes on you 
We are salt and you are the wound 
 
Empty another bottle 
And let me tear you to pieces 
This is me wishing you into the worst situations 
I'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go 
But you wouldn't know a good thing 
If it came up and slit your throat 
 
Whoa 
Whoa 
Oh 
Whoa 
Whoa 
 
Your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears 
Rather ones that just don't care 
Cause I know that your in between arms somewhere 
Next to heartbeats 
Where you shouldn't dare sleep 
Now, I'll teach you a lesson 
For Keeping secrets from me 
 
Take your taste, back 
Peel back your skin 
And try to forget how it feels inside 
You should try saying "No once in a while" 
"Oh once in a while" 
 
Take your taste, back 
Peel back your skin 
And try to forget how it feels inside 
You should try saying "No once in a while" 
"Oh once in a while" 
 
And did you hear the news? 
I could dissect you 
And gut you on this stage, 
Not as eloquent as I may have imagined 
But it will get the job done 
And you're, done 
 
Every line is plotted and designed 
To leave you 
Standing on your bedroom window's ledge 
And everyone else 
That it hits, that it gets to 
Is nothing more than collateral damage 
 
Take your taste, back 
Peel back your skin 
And try to forget how it feels inside 
You should try saying "No once in a while" 
"Oh once in a while" 
 
Take your taste, back 
Peel back your skin 
And try to forget how it feels inside

You steer away in a rear view mirror you make my head swim

With your backless black dress soaked to the skin 
When it's said and down they're all scrambling 
And we're friends, yeah we're friends 
Just because we move units 
 
Strike us like matches, cause everyone deserves the flames 
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame 
At least everyone is trying, everyone else is shining 
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame 
Such a shame 
 
The sounds of this small town make my ears hurt 
Oh yeah, you caught me. But I caught you way worse 
They say, "You want a war? You've got a war."

And I'm not sure if it matters

Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one 
And it's mind over you don't, don't matter

But it must be said again that all us boys are just screaming 
Into microphones for attention 
Because we're just so bored 
We never knew that you would pick it apart, oh 
I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts

I know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to) 
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one 
And it's mind over you don't, don't matter 
 
I used to obsess over living, 
Now I only obsess over you 
Tell me you'd like boys like me better 
In the dark lying on top of you

I know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)

From day one I talked about getting out 
But not forgetting about how my worst fears are letting out 
He said why put a new address 
On the same old loneliness 
When breathing just passes the time 
Until we all just get old and die 
Now talking's just a waste of breath and living's just a waste of death 
And why put a new address on the same old loneliness 
And this is you and me 
And me and you until we've got nothing left</field>

Delivering just what you need 
We're well read and poised 
We're the best boys 
We're the chemists who've found the formula

Only with worse luck and far less gold 
The kids you used to love 
But then we grew old 
We're the lifers here til the bitter end 
Condemned from the start 
Ashamed of the way 
The songs and the words own the beating of our hearts 
 
Are we growing up or just going down

I've got a sunset in my veins 
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay

I hope you sing along and you steal a line 
I need to keep you like this in my mind

My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out 
It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed 
To I swear, I say, to I swear, I say 
 
To hands between legs, to whatever it takes 
To drinks at the club, to the bar 
To the keys to your car 
To hotel stares, to the emergency exit door 
 
To the love, I left my conscience 
Pressed between the pages of a 
Bible in the drawer 
"What did it ever do for me?" I say 
 
It never calls me when I'm down 
Love never wanted me, but I took it anyway 
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy 
But never both, love never wanted me 
 
"I hoped you choked and crashed your car" 
Hey tear catcher, that's all that you are 
And ever were from the start 
I swear, I say 
 
To hands between legs, to whatever it takes 
To drinks at the club, to the bar 
To the keys to your car 
To hotel stares, to the emergency exit door 
 
To the love, I left my conscience 
Pressed between the pages of the 
Bible in the drawer 
"What did it ever do for me?" I say 
 
It never calls me when I'm down 
Love never wanted me, but I took it anyway 
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy 
But never both...love 
 
To the love I left my conscience pressed 
Through the keyhole, I watched you dress 
Kiss and tell 
Loose lips sink ships 
 
To my love I left my conscience pressed 
Through the keyhole, I watched you dress 
Kiss and tell 
Loose lips sink ships 
 
To the love I left my conscience pressed 
Through the keyholes, I watched you dress 
Kiss and tell (Kiss and tell) 
Loose lips sink ships

In my aching heads I got my kisses slipped 
Our gossip lips stuttered every word I said, I said 
I got your love letters, corrected the grammar and sent them back 
It's true, romance is dead, I shot it in the chest then in the head 
 
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your friend 
Because they've got me in a band where I've never seen a heart I couldn't break 
It was never about the songs, it was competition 
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest 
 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashion, we're last chances 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashion, we're last chances 
 
I'm casully-obsessed and I've forgiven death 
I am indifferent yet (I'm a total wreck) 
I'm every cliche, but I simply do it best 
 
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your friend 
Because they've got me in a band where I've never seen a heart I couldn't break 
It was never about the songs, it was competition 
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest

We're high-fashion, we're last chances 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashion, we're last chances 
 
(Go!) 
 
I went to sleep a poet, and I woke up a fraud 
To calm your nerves I'm feeling for my clothes in the dark 
 
Which came first, the music or the misery? 
We're high-fashion, we're last chances 
 
Which came first, the music or the misery?

Oh, put love on hold, Young Hollywood

A nose runs ruby red, death's seen a double bed 
Singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate

Best friends 
Ex-friends till the end 
Better off as lovers 
And not the other way around 
Racing through the city 
Windows down 
In the back of 
Yellow-checkered cars 
 
This city says 
Come hell or high water 
When I'm feeling hot and wet 
I can't commit to a thing 
Be it heart or hospital 
 
Best friends 
Ex-friends till the end 
Better off as lovers 
And not the other way around 
Racing through the city 
Windows down 
In the back of 
Yellow-checkered cars 
 
The tombstones are waiting 
They were half engraved 
They knew it was over 
Just didn't know the date 
 
And I cast a spell over the West 
To make you think of me 
The same way I think of you 
This is a love song in my own way 
Happily ever after below the waist

From life's lush lips 
And we shake, shake, shake the hips 
In relationships 
Stop by this disaster town 
You'll put your eyes to the sun, and say "I know" 
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding 
And we might have started singing just a little soon 
We're throwing the stones in a glass room 
 
Whoa, ah, oh 
We're so miserable and stunning 
Whoa, love songs for the genuinely cunning 
Whoa, ah, oh 
 
We keep the beat 
With your blistered feet 
We bullet the words at the mockingbirds, singing 
Slept through the weekend and we were dreaming 
Of sinking with the melody of the kiss of eternity 
Got postcards from my former self, saying "how you been?" 
 
We might have said goodbyes just a little soon 
(Somehow this disaster town) 
Whoa, ah, oh 
Robbing lips and banks under this room 
 
Whoa, ah, oh 
We're so miserable and stunning 
Whoa, love songs far from the genuine becoming 
Whoa, ah, oh 
We're so miserable and stunning 
Whoa, love songs far from the genuine becoming 
 
Ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 
It was ice-cream headaches and sweet avalanche 
When the pearls in our shells came out to dance 
You call me a bad tripper of the cradle 
But my tired yawns for fawns on hunters lawns 
We're the has-beens of husbands 
Sharpening the knives of young wives 
Take two years, and call me when you're better 
Take teardrops of mine; find yourself wetter 
 
Whoa, ah, oh 
We're so miserable and stunning 
Whoa, love songs far from the genuine becoming 
Whoa, ah, oh 
We're so miserable and stunning 
Whoa, love songs far from the genuine becoming

Signing off "I'm all right in bed, but I'm better with a pen." 
The kid was all right but it went to his head 
 
I am God's gift, but why would He bless me with 
Such wit without a conscience equipped? 
I'm addicted to the way I feel when I think of you, whoa 
There's too much green to feel blue 
 
When I'm home alone, I just dance by myself

Better off against 
Worse for wear 
And you're someone 
Who knows someone who knows someone I once knew 
And I just want to be a part of this 
 
The road outside my house 
Is paved with good intentions 
Hired a construction crew 
'Cause it's hell on the engine 
And you are the dreamer 
And we are the dream 
I could write it better than you ever felt it 
 
So hum hallelujah 
Just off the key of reason 
I thought I loved you 
But it's just how you looked in the light 
A teenage vow in a parking lot 
Till tonight do us part 
I sing the blues and swallow them too 
 
My words are my faith 
To hell with our good name 
A remix up your guts 
Your insides x-rayed 
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster 
We're a bull 
Your ears are just a china shop 
 
I love you in the same way 
There's a chapel in a hospital 
One foot in your bedroom 
And one foot out the door 
Sometimes we take chances 
Sometimes we take pills 
I could write it better than you ever felt it 
 
So hum hallelujah 
Just off the key of reason 
I thought I loved you 
But it's just how you looked in the light 
A teenage vow in a parking lot 
Till tonight do us part 
I sing the blues and swallow them too

We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn't make it 
To the fans that held us down till everybody came around 
Welcome 
It's here 
 
Last summer we took threes across the board 
But by fall we were a cover story, "now in stores" 
Make us poster boys for your scene 
But we are not making an acceptance speech 
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes 
Every dot-com's refreshing for a journal update 
 
So long live the car-crash hearts 
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life 
Fix me and fortify 
 
So long live the car crash hearts 
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life 
Fix me and fortify an take your problems away with a nod and a wave 
Of my hand 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am 
The only thing I haven't done yet is die 
And it's me and my plus-one at the afterlife 
Crowds are won and lost and won again 
But our hearts beat for the die-hards 
 
So long live the car-crash hearts 
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life 
Fix me in forty-five 
 
So long live the car-crash hearts 
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life 
Fix me in forty-five 
 
Long live the car crash hearts

Long live the car crash hearts 
(Long live the car crash hearts) 
 
Long live the car crash hearts 
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life 
And fix me in forty-five

Let me see your moves, 
Let me see your moves 
Lips pressed this close to mine, 
True Blue 
 
But the prince of any failing empire knows that 
Everybody wants, everybody wants 
To drive on through the night 
If it's a drive back home 
 
Things aren't the same anymore 
Some nights, they get so bad 
You almost pick up the phone 
 
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns 
I sleep with your old shirts 
And walk through this house in your shoes, 
You know it's strange 
It's a strange way of saying, 
I'm supposed to love you 
I'm supposed to love you 
 
I've already given up on myself twice 
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm 
Threw caution to the wind 
But I've got a lousy arm 
 
And I've traced your shadows on the wall 
Now I kiss them whenever I'm down 
Whenever I'm down 
Figured on not figuring myself out 
 
Things aren't the same anymore 
Some nights, they get so bad 
I almost pick up the phone 
 
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns 
I sleep with your old shirts 
And walk through this house in your shoes, 
You know it's strange 
It's a strange way of saying 
That I know I'm supposed to love you 
I'm supposed to love you 
 
Born under a bad sign, but you saved my life 
That night on the roof of your hotel 
"Cross my heart and hope to die 
Splintered from the headboard in my eye" 
Photo-proofed kisses I remembered so well 
 
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns 
I sleep with your old shirts 
And walk through this house in your shoes, 
You know it's strange 
It's a strange way of saying 
That I know I'm supposed to love you 
I'm supposed to love you

So listen carefully to every word I say: 
"I'm the only one who's gonna get away with making excuses today, 
 
You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have" 
Blackmailed myself 
Cause I ain't got anyone else 
"This is a stick up 
Give us all your.." 
I've got the red carpet blues baby 
 
"Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound 
But don't get the wrong idea 
We're gonna shoot you 
We're gonna shoot you 
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet 
That could change just how this goes 
No 
We're gonna shoot you 
We're gonna shoot you" 
 
When I said that I'd return to you I meant more like a relapse 
Now again I think "His and her's" "For better or worse" 
But the only ring I want buried with me are the ones around my eyes 
 
"You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have" 
I've got the red carpet blues baby 
 
"Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound 
But don't get the wrong idea

With a nod and a wave

I want to scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs 
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me

Before it all becomes the same old song 
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town 
And get new passports and get get get get get out now 
 
All the Yes men said "no comment" 
My mouth got going the wrong way and all the calls started snowing 
The time my dad caught me a horse shoe crab 
And I asked him if throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back 
 
I want to scream 'I love you' from the top of my lungs

Tell that boy I'll leave you alone now 
Like a stove, I'll turn my love down 
Supra and the prophet are both in the business of souls 
 
I want to scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs 
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me, woah

Send me back to the glue factory 
Always thought I'd float away 
And never come back 
But I've got enough miles on my card 
To fly the boys home on my own 
But you know me: I like being all alone 
And keeping you all alone 
And the charts are boring 
And the kids are snoring 
And the eagles in a sling 
You say you're not listening

You're a bottled star

You shine in the sky

Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling 
 
Tempest in a teacup, 
Get unique. 
Peroxide Princess shine like shark teeth 
It's a sign, (it's a sign) 
It's a sign, (it's a sign) 
It's a sign, what if you peaked early. 
 
Does your husband know the way that 
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band? 
Does he know the way, does he know the way 
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night? 
 
Does he, does he know the way to worship our love? 
Does your husband know the way 
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band? 
 
But, I will never end up like him. 
Behind my back, I already am. 
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know.

I dare you to say they taste the same, 
Let the leaves fall off in the summer 
And let December glow in flames 
 
Erase myself and let go, 
Start it over again in Mexico 
These friends, they don't love you 
They just love the hotel suites, now 
 
I don't care what you think, 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness, in misery 
I don't care what you think, 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness, in misery 
 
Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance, 
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants 
Pull a breath like another cigarette, 
Pawn shop heart trading up, said no 
 
I'm the oracle in my chest, 
Let the guitar scream like a fascist, 
Sweat it out, shut your mouth, 
Free love on the streets, but 
In the alley it ain't that cheap now 
 
I don't care what you think, 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness, in misery 
I don't care what you think, 
As long as it's about me 
The best of us can find happiness, in misery 
 
Said-a, I don't care just a-what you think, 
As long as it's about me, you said-a 
I don't care just what you think, 
As long as it's about me, you said-a 
I don't care (I don't care) 
You said I don't care (I don't care) 
Said I don't care, I don't care

Come on like I sugared you, but with a kick in the head 
Like putting wings on lead 
Your eyes are black in my starlight 
I'm the last of my kind 
(And as always I'm not addicted to you) 
 
Follow the disorganized religion of my head 
And we'll never get through customs 
Let's just take off again instead 
 
Got my degree in the gutter 
My heart broken in the dorms of the Ivy League

Let's be alone together 
We could stay young forever 
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs 
 
Say, yeah 
Let's be alone together 
We can stay young forever 
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young 
 
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh

My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken 
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah 
 
I'm outside the door, invite me in 
So we can go back and play pretend 
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next 
Tonight I'm high as a private jet 
 
Yeah 
Let's be alone together 
We could stay young forever 
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs 
 
Say, yeah 
Let's be alone together 
We can stay young forever 
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young 
 
I don't know where you're going, 
But do you got room for one more troubled soul 
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home 
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead 
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end</field>

Sean Don 
Fall Out, Boi! 
 
Did you trip down 12 steps into Malibu, ooh ooh 
(Malibu, ooh, ooh, oh,) 
So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever 
Bel Air baby, did you get dressed up, 
Pretty pout, pout 
Until you bottomed up, oh 
I can't stop it when there's chemicals keeping us together 
I'm singing 
 
Whoa 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
They fall in love 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
Oh how the mighty fall in love 
 
Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme 
And I'm dizzy on dreams (and I'm dizzy on dreams) 
But if you ask me two's a whole lot lonelier than one 
Baby we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it 
(Gutter where we found it) 
'Cause your only crime is that you got caught 
I'm singing 
 
Whoa 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
They fall in love 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
Oh how the mighty fall in love 
 
It's getting clear 
You're never coming clean 
Lock you up inside, and swallow, swallow the key 
 
Hello? 
Yeah I know you said not to call unless I'm dying 
But I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids 
But even though my eyes closed, I still see you 
I just hope that when you see me I'm not see-through 
You know how we do 
 
Sometimes I swear, I need a day just for me to lay 
With some T and A, but the way we, they way we is do deeper 
Baby straight up chemistry DNA 
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A 
Like, I let her climb on top 
I'm either fuckin or workin', so the grind don't stop 
They say I got screws missing, well hell, only when I'm missing you 
And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you 
 
Whoa 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
They fall in love 
How the mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
The mighty fall 
Oh how the mighty fall in love</field>

You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down 
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground 
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July setting fire to the sky 
Here, here comes this rising tide, so come on 
 
Put on your war paint 
 
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies 
Silver clouds with grey linings 
 
So we can take the world back from a heart attack 
One maniac at a time we will take it back 
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start 
So dance alone to the beat of your heart 
 
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out? 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
Wearing our vintage misery 
No, I think it looked a little better on me 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
 
Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks 
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks 
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks 
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass 
 
So we can take the world back from a heart attack 
One maniac at a time we will take it back 
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start 
So dance alone to the beat of your heart 
 
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out? 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
Wearing our vintage misery 
No, I think it looked a little better on me 
I'm gonna change you like a remix 
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix 
 
Put on your war paint 
 
The war is won, before it's begun 
Release the doves, surrender love 
 
The war is won, before it's begun 
Release the doves, surrender love 
 
The war is won, before it's begun 
Release the doves, surrender love 
 
The war is won, before it's begun (Wave the white flag!) 
Release the doves, surrender love (Wave the white flag!) 
 
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out? 
I'm gonna change you like a remix

(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat hey) 
No thesis existed for burning cities down at such a rampant rate 
No graphics and no fucking PowerPoint presentation 
So they just DIY'd that shit and built their own bombs 
She's his suicide blond, she's never in gold 
 
Are you ready for another bad poem? 
One more off key anthem 
Let your teeth sink in 
Remember me as I was not as I am 
And I said "I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead," 
I kept wishing she had blonde ambition and she'd let it go to my head 
 
Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
If my love is a weapon 
There's no second guessing when I say 
Rat a tat tat 
Rat a tat tat tat hey 
If my heart is a grenade 
You pull the pin and say 
 
We're all fighting growing old 
We're all fighting growing old 
In the hopes 
Of a few minutes more 
To get on St. Peter's list 
But you need to lower your standards 
'Cause it's never 
Getting any better than this 
 
We are professional ashes of roses 
This kerosene's live 
You settled your score 
This is where you come to beg, unborn and unshaven 
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens 
This is what we do, we nightmare you 
 
I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards 
And your heart beat in reverse 
Our guts can't be reworked 
As alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert 
Getting burned 
But I'll take your heart served up two ways 
I sing a bitter song 
I'm the lonelier version of you 
I just don't know where I went wrong 
 
Rat a tat tat

It's never 
Getting any better than this 
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey) 
It's never 
Getting any better than this 
 
She's sick and she's wrong 
She's young dirty blonde 
And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb 
He says "I've seen bigger" 
She says "I've lit better" 
And they throw the matches down into the glitter 
Not a dry eye left in the house 
Go boy, go boy, run for your life 
Go boy, go boy, run for your life 
Go boy, go boy, run for your life 
 
We're all fighting growing old 
We're all fighting growing old 
In the hopes 
Of a few minutes more 
To get on St. Peter's list 
But you need to lower your standards 
'Cause it's never 
Getting any better than this

It's the only reason that I sing 
I don't believe a word you say, 
But I can't stop listening 
 
This is the story of how they met, 
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes, 
And when she touched him he turned ruby red 
A story that they'll never forget 
Never forget 
 
And all the boys are smoking Menthol's, 
Girls are getting back rubs, 
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough 
 
My old aches become new again 
My old friends become ex's again 
 
Oh where did the party go?

I'm the last one that you'll ever remember 
 
And I'm trying to find that peace of mind 
Behind these two white highway lines 
When the city goes silent 
The ringing in my ears gets violent 
 
She's in a long black coat tonight 
Waiting for me in the downpour outside 
She's singing "Baby come home" in a melody of tears 
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time 
 
And I remember "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
 
Did you ever love her? Do you know? 
Or did you never want to be alone? 
 
And she was singing "Baby, come home" 
"Baby, come home" 
 
I've got those jet pack blues 
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me 
Honey, don't you leave 
 
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink? 
It never mattered what it was 
I think our hands were just that close 
The sweetness never lasted, no 
 
She's in a long black coat tonight 
Waiting for me in the downpour outside 
She's singing "Baby come home" in a melody of tears 
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time 
 
And I remember "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
 
Did you ever love her? Do you know? 
Or did you never want to be alone? 
 
And she was singing "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
 
She's in a long black coat tonight 
Waiting for me in the downpour outside 
She's singing "Baby come home" in a melody of tears 
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time 
 
And I remember "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home" 
 
Did you ever love her? Do you know? 
Or did you never want to be alone? 
 
And she was singing "Baby, come home" 
I remember "Baby, come home"</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Stuck in the jet wash 
Bad trip I couldn't get off 
And maybe I bit off more than I could chew 
And overhead of the aqua blue 
 
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture 
Blessed be the boys time can't capture 
On film or between the sheets 
I always fall from your window 
To the pitch black streets 
 
And with the black banners raised as the crooked smiles fade 
Former heroes who quit too late 
Just wanna fill up the trophy case again 
 
And in the end 
I'd do it all again 
I think you're my best friend 
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright 
I'll be yours 
When it rains it pours 
Stay thirsty like before 
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright 
 
I'm not passive but aggressive 
Take note, it's not impressive 
Empty your sadness, like you're dumping your purse 
On my bedroom floor 
We put your curse in reverse 
 
And it's our time now if you want to to be 
More the war like the carnival bears set free 
And your love is anemic and I can't believe 
That you couldn't see it coming from me 
 
And I still feel that rush in my veins 
It twists my head just a bit too thin 
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead 
 
And in the end 
I'd do it all again 
I think you're my best friend 
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright 
I'll be yours 
When it rains it pours 
Stay thirsty like before 
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright 
 
And sometimes I just want to sit around 
And gaze at my shoes yeah 
And let your dirty sadness fill me up 
Just like a balloon 
 
And in the end 
I'd do it all again 
I think you're my best friend 
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright 
And I'll be yours 
When it rains it pours 
Stay thirsty like before 
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright</field>

So put all of your anger on 
In the truly gruesome do we trust 
I will always land on you like a sucker punch 
 
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare 
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare 
 
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you 
You would never sing along 
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture 
These new flocks are nothing but vultures 
 
Because they took our love and they filled it up 
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb 
And now I'm just numb 
Don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun 
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb 
And now I'm just numb 
I don't feel a thing for you 
 
I'm just a problem that doesn't wanna be solved 
So could you please hold your applause 
Take this sideshow and all its freaks 
And turn it into the silver screen dream 
 
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare 
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare 
 
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you,

I said one day the bell is gonna swallow me whole

That shares our fate and deserves our pity 
I don't want to remember it all 
The promises I made if you just hold on 
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
 
And I just need enough of you to dull the pain 
Just to get me through the night till we're twins again 
Till we're stripped down to our skeletons again 
Till we're saints just swimming in our sins again 
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on 
Up above our heads droning on and on and on 
Keep making trouble till you find what you love 
I need a new partner in crime and you just shrug 
 
But there's a room in a hotel in New York City 
That shares our fate and deserves our pity 
I don't want to remember it all 
The promises are made if you just hold on 
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
 
A birth and a death on the same day 
And, honey, I only appear so I can fade away 
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream 
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame 
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on 
Up above our heads droning on and on and on 
Hit it, never quit it, I have been through the wreck 
But I can string enough to show my face in the light again 
 
There's a room in a hotel in New York City 
That shares our fate and deserves our pity 
I don't want to remember it all 
The promises are made if you just hold on

You can't just follow my smile

You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon 
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight till the end 
This might be your battle, might not turn out okay 
You know you look so Seattle, but you feel so LA

I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble 
Frame me up on your walls, to keep me out of trouble 
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation 
Truly free, love it baby, I'm talking no inflation 
 
Too many war wounds and not enough wars 
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores 
Too many sharks and not enough blood in the waves 
You know I give my lover a four letter name

You're second hand smoke 
You're second hand smoke 
I breath you in, but honey I don't know 
What you're doing to me 
Mon Cheri, but the truth catches up with us eventually 
Tryna say live, live and let live 
I'm no good good, admit to this 
 
Second is yours, mi amour 
I'm coming for you, and I'm making war 
 
I still love the way you hurt me, 
It's irresistible, oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah

Young and a menace 
 
Woke up on the wrong side of reality 
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me 
And as far as the time, far as the time 
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm searching out the ride, yeah

Alone with a fear-filled head 
Thinking of losing you is a haunted song 
And a dread much worse than the fear of death 
Now I feel the fear rising up 
Climbing up, taking over my body 
And I feel my pulse starting up 
Waking me again 
Open my eyes, I'm reaching for you 
Set me on fire, set me on fire 
I'm burning inside, I'm waiting for you 
Set me on fire, set me on fire 
Your hand in mine, oh 
I feel the fire 
Two hearts that beat, oh, to feed the fire 
You are a spark that shines a light where we could 
Belong together, factionless 
Let's keep it burning bright 'til we're floating 
Away, 'til we're ashes dancing inside the flames 
Now I feel the fear rising up 
Climbing up, taking over my body 
And I feel my pulse starting up

With what's written on my heart 
I will break, break 
I'm so sick, infected with 
Where I live 
Let me live without this 
Empty bliss, selfishness 
I'm so sick 
I'm so sick 
If you want more of this 
We can push out, sell out, die out 
So you'll shut up 
And stay sleeping 
With my screaming in your itching ears 
I'm so sick, infected with 
Where I live 
Let me live without this 
Empty bliss, selfishness 
I'm so sick 
I'm so sick 
Hear it, I'm screaming it 
You're heeding to it now 
Hear it, I'm screaming it 
You tremble at this sound 
You sink into my clothes 
This invasion makes me feel 
Worthless, hopeless, sick 
I'm so sick, infected with 
Where I live 
Let me live without this 
Empty bliss, selfishness 
I'm so, I'm so sick</field>

With every injustice and deadly fate 
Praying it all be new 
And living like it all depends on you 
Here you are down on your knees again 
Trying to find air to breathe again 
Only surrender will help you now 
I love you please see and believe again 
I love that you're never satisfied 
With face value wisdom and happy lies 
You take what they say and go back and cry 
You're so close to me that you nearly died 
Here you are down on your knees again 
Trying to find air to breathe again 
Only surrender will help you now 
I love you please see and believe again 
They don't have to understand you 
Be still 
Wait and know i understand you 
Be still 
Be still 
Here you are down on your knees again 
Trying to find air to breathe again 
Only surrender will help you now 
The floodgates are breaking 
And pouring out 
Here you are down on your knees 
Trying to find air to breathe 
Right where i want you to be again 
I love you please see and believe again 
Here you are down on your knees again 
Trying to find air to breathe again 
Right where i want you to be again 
See and believe!</field>

It's true that I dream less often 
I'm not ashamed of that long december. 
Your hand's coming down again. 
I close my eyes and brace myself 
I only noticed your face 
No matter what you're gonna build my shell 
No matter what you're gonna build my shell. 
I'm falling 
I'm shedding my skin. 
But it's not time I'm told. 
I am aware of what you mean and by then, 
I'm only ten years old. 
I close my eyes and brace myself 
I only noticed your face 
No matter what you're gonna build my shell 
No matter what you're gonna build my shell. 
My scars are yours today. 
This story ends so good. 
I love you and I understand 
that you stood where I stood. 
I close my eyes and brace myself 
I only noticed your face 
No matter what you're gonna break my shell 
No matter what you're gonna break my shell. 
I’m done healing.</field>

Swam out below her star on sea beneath 
Though I lifted up my hands to her 
She never lifted me 
Oh something's missing in me 
I felt it deep within me 
As lovers left me to bleed alone 
Found something sweet 
On the island with daughters of eve 
But through thick and thin they've gone away 
and only left their grief 
Oh, something's missing in me 
I felt it deep within me 
As lovers left me to bleed alone 
Oh, something's missing in me 
I felt it deep within me 
As lovers left me to bleed alone 
Something's missing in me 
Something missing in me 
Down here love wasn't' meant to be 
It wasn't meant to be for me 
All is vanity underneath the sun 
All is vanity 
Oh, something's missing in me

We will make it out alive 
There's a note in the pages of the book 
So Sleep tonight, 
We'll sleep dreamlessly this time 
When we awake we'll know that everything's alright 
And sing to me about the end of the world 
End of these hammers and needles for you 
Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for, 
There's still strength left in us yet 
Hold on to the world we all remember dying for, 
There's still hope left in it yet 
The snow on your face, and your razor blades 
The twilight is bruised and there you lie 
And sing to me, about the end of the world 
End of these hammers and needles for you 
We'll cry tonight, but in the morning we are new 
Stand in the sun, we'll dry your eyes 
Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for, 
There's still strength left in us yet 
Hold on to the world we all remember dying for, 
There's still hope left in it yet 
And sing 
Sing 
Arise 
Arise and be, 
all the you dreamed, all that you dreamed 
Arise and be, 
all the you dreamed, all that you dreamed 
Arise and be, 
all the you dreamed, all that you dreamed 
Arise and be,

But we don't know this place at all, 
That's enough now dry your tears 
It's been a long eleven years 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars, 
You're ashamed of where you're from, 
Crying 'cause your father's drunk 
We can't die because we're young 
At least that's what we heard in a song 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars, 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars 
You're ashamed of what you've done, 
Crying 'cause your father's wrong 
Trying to be something new, 
You'll feel that you were something to prove 
What you confuse for glory's fire 
Is fire from the tongues of liars. 
What you confuse for glory's fire 
Is fire from the tongues of liars. 
Oh send your rain 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars,

Fire from the tongues of liars

Fire, fire, fire!

Crying 'cause your father's gone 
Dreaming 'til you hit the truth 
You'll find that you've nothing to lose. 
You'll find that you've nothing to prove.</field>

There's only artificial light 
My flaws hide well here 
I used to be afraid of cluttered noises 
Now I'm afraid of silence 
Fill this space Idle words 
I'm scared to death of light and silence 
Jesus kill me inside this 
Raise me up to live again 
Like you did, like you did. 
Now I am mute despite myself 
All of them are gone 
The silence overtakes me 
The idle words forsake me and I am left to face me 
I'm held accountable 
For every idle word 
Curse the idle words 
I'm scared to death of light and silence 
Jesus kill me inside this 
Raise me up to live again 
Like you did, like you did. 
Glory shows up 
Exposes us 
I'm naked here 
Forsaken here, by the dark, by the dark 
I'm scared to death of light and silence 
Jesus kill me in side this 
Raise me up to live again 
Like you did 
Like you did.

            <field name="lyrics">All your twisted thoughts free flow to 
Everlasting memories show soul 
Kiss the stars with me 
And dread the wait for 
Stupid calls returning us to life 
We say to those who are in love 
It can't be true cause we're too young 
I know that's true because 
So long I was so in love with you 
So I thought 
A year goes by 
And I can't talk about it 
On my knees in a dim lighted room 
Thoughts free flow try to consume myself in this 
I'm not faithless 
Just paranoid 
Of getting lost or that I might lose 
Ignorance is bliss cherish it 
Pretty neighborhoods 
You learn too much to hold 
Believe and not 
And fight the tears 
With pretty smiles and lies about the time 
A year goes by 
And I can't talk about it 
The times weren't right 
And I couldn't talk about it 
Choris romance says goodnight 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Remember you remember me 
Choris romance says goodnight 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Remember you remember me 
And I'm praying that we will see 
Something there in between 
Then and there 
That exceeds all we can dream 
So we can talk about it 
Choris romance says goodnight 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Remember you remember me 
Choris romance says goodnight 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Remember you remember me 
And I'm praying that we will see 
Something there in between 
Then and there 
That exceeds all we can dream 
So we can talk about it 
And all these twisted thoughts I see 
Jesus there in between 
And all these twisted thoughts I see 
Jesus there in between</field>

The question asked in order

Written on the bullet 
Say yes to pull the trigger 
"Do you believe in God?" 
Written on the bullet 
And Cassie pulled the trigger 
All heads are bowed in silence 
To remember her last sentence 
She answered him knowing what would happen 
Her last words still hanging in the air 
In the air... 
"Do you believe in God?" 
Written on the bullet 
Say yes to pull the trigger 
"Do you believe in God?" 
Written on the bullet 
And Cassie pulled the trigger 
How many will die... 
I will die 
I will say YES !!!

Say yes to pull the trigger

"Do you believe in God?"

Oh, whoa, don't you know 
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better 
Oh, whoa, don't I know 
Come spend the night inside our soul 
It's so beautiful, at all 
The howling wolves between my ears 
Go silent when they hear you call 
My darkness fades away 
If you speak, I hear you call 
Not just the words you say 
And now I'm feeling oh so happy 
Aren't we all trying to become something better? 
(Something better) 
Oh, whoa, don't you know 
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better 
(Someone better) 
Oh, whoa, don't I know 
Come spend the day, watch the sunshine play 
Off the light that's in your eyes 
A lonely bird chirps a cheerful word 
As he floats across the sky 
My darkness fades away 
If you speak, I hear you call 
Not just the words you say 
And now I'm feeling oh so happy 
Aren't we all trying to become something better? 
(Something better) 
Oh, whoa, don't you know 
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better 
(Someone better) 
Oh, whoa, don't I know 
She said, "Don't forget the person you are" 
Seem to remember chasing falling stars 
Up until you found me lying on the ground and whispered 
Aren't we all trying to become something better? 
(Something better) 
Oh, whoa, don't you know 
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better 
(Someone better) 
Oh, whoa, don't I know

Ready to smile and love life 
Fully alive 
Now she knows how to believe in futures 
All my complaints shrink to nothing, 
I'm ashamed of all my somethings 
She's glad for one day of comfort 
Only because she has suffered... 
Here she stands today 
In her brilliant shiny way 
Fully alive

Ready to smile and love life 
Fully alive 
Now she knows how to believe in futures

I'm thankful for every breath I take 
I won't take it for granted ( I won't take it for granted) 
So I learn from my mistakes 
It's beyond my control sometimes it's best to let go, 
whatever happens in this lifetime 
So I trust in love ( So I trust in love ) 
You have given me peace of mind 
I, I feel so alive 
For the very first time 
I can't deny you 
I feel so alive 
I, I feel so alive ( so alive) 
For the very first time( For the very first time) 
And I think I can fly 
Sunshine upon my face (Sunshine upon my face) 
A new song for me to sing 
Tell the world how I feel inside 
Even though it might cost me everything 
Now that I know this is beyond my control 
'cause I could never turn my back away 
Now that I see you (Now that I see you) 
I can never look away 
I, I feel so alive 
For the very first time 
I can't deny you 
I feel so alive 
I, I feel so alive ( so alive) 
For the very first time (For the very first time) 
And I think I can fly 
Now that I know you 
I could never turn my back away 
And now that I see you 
I could never look away 
And now that I know you 
I could never turn my back away 
And now that I see you 
I believe no matter what they say 
I, I feel so alive

I can't deny you 
I feel so alive

And I can't be okay with alright 
So point me to the edge of life 
I'll stand up on my toes 
Stretch my fingers out to there and bring it back here 
It's too important for us to forget 
We'll unify our thoughts 
God will hear and save 
God will hear and save us 
All together standing up on our toes 
Reaching for the very thing I don't know 
So catch it as it pours 
We know what we need 
Don't get tired when you're running back to show them 
It's too important for us to forget 
We'll unify our thoughts 
God will hear and save 
God will hear and save us</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Sometimes life seems too quiet 
Into paralyzing silence 
Like the moonless dark 
Meant to make me strong 
Familiar breath of my old lies 
Has changed the color in my eyes 
Soon he will perforate the fabric of the peaceful 
by and by 
Sorrow last through this night 
I'll take this piece of you 
And hold for all eternity 
For just one second I felt whole 
As you flew right through me 
Left alone with only reflections of the memory 
To face the ugly girl 
That's smothering me 
Sitting closer than my pain 
He knew each tear before it came 
Soon he will perforate the fabric of the peaceful 
by and by 
Sorrow last through this night 
I'll take this piece of you 
And hold for all eternity 
For just one second I felt whole 
As you flew right through me 
And we kiss each other one more time 
And sing this lie that's halfway mine 
The sword is slicing through the question 
So I won't be fooled by his angel light 
Sorrow lasts through this night 
I'll take this piece of you 
And hold for all eternity 
For just one second I felt whole 
As you flew right through me 
And up into the stars 
Joy will come</field>

To satisfy the longing in my heart 
But everytime I come away emptier than before

'Cause I could never live without you now 
I'm giving you my life so take me 
'Cause I could never live without you now 
There were times I cried myself to sleep at night 
Only to wake up wishing that I didn't 
And now I finally see the reason

I'm giving you my life, so take me 
'Cause I could never live without you now 
I'm giving you my life so take me 
'Cause I could never live without you now 
Thank you for never giving up on me! 
When I looked to everything else but you 
You bled and you died to be with me! 
Why would you do something like that 
For someone like me? 
And now I finally see the reason 
Because I was made to be yours alone 
I'm giving you my life, so take me

Anything and everything you feel. 
I laugh about the past- 
Secretly, 
Wish we could go back, 
And save the child...

See the worried eyes I know 
It’s time I cannot buy 
Was this worth the time to rise? 
Was this worth the time to rise?

Praying it all be new

I love you please see and believe again 
I love that you're never satisfied 
With face value wisdom and happy lies 
You take what they say and go back and cry 
You're so close to me that you nearly died 
Here you are down on your knees again 
Trying to find air to breathe again 
Only surrender will help you now 
I love you please see and believe again 
They don't have to understand you 
Be still 
Wait and know i understand you 
Be still 
Be still 
Here you are down on your knees again 
Trying to find air to breathe again 
Only surrender will help you now 
The floodgates are breaking 
And pouring out 
Here you are down on your knees 
Trying to find air to breathe 
Right where i want you to be again 
I love you please see and believe again 
Here you are down on your knees again 
Trying to find air to breathe again 
Right where i want you to be again 
See and believe!</field>

I'm thankful for every breath I take 
I won't take it for granted ( I won't take it for granted) 
So I learn from my mistakes 
It's beyond my control sometimes it's best to let go, 
whatever happens in this lifetime 
So I trust in love ( So I trust in love ) 
You have given me peace of mind 
I, I feel so alive 
For the very first time 
I can't deny you 
I feel so alive 
I, I feel so alive ( so alive) 
For the very first time( For the very first time) 
And I think I can fly 
Sunshine upon my face (Sunshine upon my face) 
A new song for me to sing 
Tell the world how I feel inside 
Even though it might cost me everything 
Now that I know this is beyond my control 
'cause I could never turn my back away 
Now that I see you (Now that I see you) 
I can never look away 
I, I feel so alive 
For the very first time 
I can't deny you 
I feel so alive 
I, I feel so alive ( so alive) 
For the very first time (For the very first time) 
And I think I can fly 
Now that I know you 
I could never turn my back away 
And now that I see you 
I could never look away 
And now that I know you 
I could never turn my back away 
And now that I see you 
I believe no matter what they say 
I, I feel so alive

Thickening the air I'm breathing 
Holding on to what I'm feeling 
Savoring this heart that's healing 
My hands float up above me 
And you whisper you love me 
And I begin to fade 
Into our secret place 
The music makes me sway 
The angels singing say we are alone with you 
I am alone and they are too with you 
I'm still alive, I'm still alive, we still alive 
I can feel you all around me 
Thickening the air I'm breathing 
Holding on to what I'm feeling 
Savoring this heart that's healing 
And so I cry 
The light is white 
Holy

I'm alive, I'm still alive, we still alive

Thickening the air I'm breathing 
Holding on to what I'm feeling

Take my hand 
I give it to you 
Now you owe me 
All I am 
You said you would never leave me 
I believe you 
I believe 
I can feel you all around me

Says the world doesn't even know 
About the pain she hides inside 
Says happiness is just a lie 
Smell the roses throw them down 
Just whisper, don't make a sound 
Don't want the world to know the truth 
You've been broken and abused...by you 
Amy says 
"I see you laughing at the rain that hits your face 
With your arms stretched open soaking in the love 
In a world I find so hard you find so beautiful 
There's a hope in you deep inside for me." 
The colors of her mind 
Bleed into each other 
As the morning melts the night 
And the stars enchant another 
While her eyes are still held shut 
She can hear you breathing softly 
Your words echo in her mind 
And your words are clear and she knows that you are here 
Yes 
I see her laughing at the rain that hits her face 
With her arms stretched open soaking in the love 
In a world she found so hard she finds so beautiful 
There's a hope in her deep inside from you

We will make it out alive 
There's a note in the pages of the book 
So Sleep tonight, 
We'll sleep dreamlessly this time 
When we awake we'll know that everything's alright 
And sing to me about the end of the world 
End of these hammers and needles for you 
Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for, 
There's still strength left in us yet 
Hold on to the world we all remember dying for, 
There's still hope left in it yet 
The snow on your face, and your razor blades 
The twilight is bruised and there you lie 
And sing to me, about the end of the world 
End of these hammers and needles for you 
We'll cry tonight, but in the morning we are new 
Stand in the sun, we'll dry your eyes 
Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for, 
There's still strength left in us yet 
Hold on to the world we all remember dying for, 
There's still hope left in it yet 
And sing 
Sing 
Arise 
Arise and be, 
all the you dreamed, all that you dreamed 
Arise and be,

Start this lie, this grand disguise, I bury under it 
Thy I was claiming by your side, you left me bind 
I saw our future up ahead, now it is caving in 
I feel the ground, it is giving out 
It came around and down on us 
Didn't think you were smart 
And is hard to dance, trance to the other edge 
Start cause, heart frozen in time 
Causing down the mountain side 
And is hard to dance, trance to the other edge 
We were lackless from the start, like quick handle it 
Before we even fall apart, you`ve ended it 
And now alone to feel the sun, watching over me 
And that to earlier each time from a memory 
I wont stay down, I'm digging out 
It came around and down on us 
Didn't think you were smart 
And is hard to dance, trance to the other edge 
Start cause, heart frozen in time 
Causing down the mountain side 
And is hard to dance, trance to the other edge 
Let`s go, you will know, until you let go (x3) 
Let`s go, you will now, you dont know 
You dont know, until you let go 
Ahh, ow ow ow ohh

Didn't think you were smart 
And is hard to dance, trance to the other edge

Fighting ends in forgiveness 
Unite and fight all division

Train your fingers for battle 
Urgency's here now 
Train your fingers for battle 
Fighting this violence 
With your feet wrapped in peace 
Sad tears and silence 
Now screams of joy 
Victory

How far You went to pick us up 
If one part's hurt the whole body's sick 
If one part mourns we all mourn with Him

Oh, here I go, collecting roses to me from you 
Oh, here I go, a dozen red for every wound

Gonna find my way, break the lock on the emerald city gates 
It could be simple, but we're only half-awake 
I feel the pain set in when I think of you and grip the stems 
I feel my head begin to spin, I'm not alright 
Oh, here I go, collecting roses to me from you 
Oh, here I go, a dozen red for every wound

It feels like I'm born again 
It feels like I'm living 
For the very first time 
For the very first time 
In my life 
Make a promise to me now 
Reassure my heart somehow 
That the love that I feel is so much more real 
than anything 
I've a feeling in my soul 
And I pray that I'm not wrong 
That the life I have now, it is only the beginning 
It feels like I'm born again

Then you came to me and you gave to me 
Life and a love that I've never known 
That I've never felt before

            <field name="lyrics">You try your hardest to perfect your explanations... 
You lie until they've run out of questions 
You can only move as fast as who's in front of you 
And if you assume just like them 
What good will it do? 
So find out for yourself 
So your ignorance will stop bleeding through. 
You can breathe today 
Only one thing 
Big enough to fill the void that's inside of you 
It's just a breath away 
You can breathe today 
So many lies swirling, All around You 
You're suffocating 
The emtpy shape in you 
Steals your breath you're suffocating 
Logic forces me to believe in this 
And I have learned to see 
And I can only say what I've seen and heard 
And only you can choose 
And every choice you make will effect you 
Suit your own self 
You can breathe today 
So many lies swirling,All around you 
you're suffocating 
The empty shape in you 
Steals your breath, you're suffocating 
BREATHE 
Big enough to fill the void that's inside of you 
It's just a breath away 
So many lies swirling, All around you 
You're suffocating 
The empty shape in you, Steals your breathe 
You're suffocating 
Breathe Today</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Too late this is not the answer 
I need to pack it in 
I can't pull your heart together 
With just my voice solo 
A thousand shards of glass i came to meet you in 
You cut the piece out of me 
As you ripped it all apart that's when I turn to watch you 
And there's a light in you in dark I saw you turn to shadow 
If you would salvage some part of you that once knew love 
But I'm losing this 
And I'm losing you 
Oh, I've gotta turn and run 
The faces that you never see 
Oh, I've gotta save my blood 
From all that you've broken 
I hold these pieces of me 
It's too late now to stop the process 
This was your choice you let it in 
This double life you lead is eating you up from within 
A thousand shards of glass you pushed beneath my skin 
And left me lying there to bleed 
And as you showed me your scars I only held you closer 
But if the light in you in dark I saw you turn over 
I wanted always to be there for you and close to you 
But I'm losing this 
And I'm losing you 
Oh, I've gotta turn and run 
The faces that you never see 
Oh, I've gotta save my blood 
From all that you've broken 
I hold these pieces of me 
The broken pieces (And i hold the pieces of me) 
The broken pieces (And I hold this pieces) 
Maybe without me you'll return to 
All the beauty I once knew 
But if I say i know 
We will both be drowned 
By you holding on to me 
Oh, I've gotta turn and run 
The faces that you never see 
Oh, I've gotta save my blood 
From all that you've broken 
I hold these pieces of me 
The broken pieces (And i hold the pieces of me) 
The broken pieces (And I hold this pieces)</field>

Oh, I pray a friend for life 
And have I ever told you how much you mean to me? 
Oh, you're everything to me 
And I am so lost for words 
And I am so overwhelmed 
Please don't go just yet 
Can you stay a moment please? 
We can dance together 
We can dance forever 
Under your stars tonight 
And I am so overwhelmed 
By 1000 broken wings. 
1000 broken wings. 
So close your eyes but don't dream too deep 
And please pass me some memories 
And when I fall you're underneath 
1000 broken hearts 
Carried by 1000 broken wings 
1000 broken wings 
1000 broken wings 
1000 voices singing reasons 
Of understanding why it happens 
1000 voices singing reasons

Under platinum headstones 
Gold, gold, bones, bones 
Under platinum headstones 
You're so cold as you sit there alone 
Selling your bright ideas 
And paying someone to answer your phone 
So this is life, 
Come home to kids and wife 
After a day of twisting the knife 
'Til you get yours 
There's blood on the tracks again. 
Do you buy, buy what you're selling them? 
You know it breaks my heart 
It breaks my heart 
I hate to see you drown in a sea of bills 
Where did you bury all that 
Precious, precious 
Gold, gold, bones, bones 
Under platinum headstones 
Gold, gold, bones, bones 
Under platinum headstones 
You build empires, airplanes 
And smog coated spires 
Up to the last blank page 
When the wildfires rage on the hills 
There's blood on the tracks again. 
Do you buy, buy what you're selling them? 
You know it breaks my heart 
It breaks my heart 
I hate to see you drown in a sea of bills 
Where did you bury, did you bury 
Take my hand 
Let's leave this place 
Tonight we'll need our souls 
And not that... 
Gold, gold, bones, bones 
And all that worthless 
Gold, gold, bones, bones 
And all that useless... 
There's blood on the tracks again. 
Do you buy, buy what you're selling them? 
You know it breaks my heart 
It breaks my heart 
I hate to see you drown in a sea of bills 
Where did you bury all that 
Precious, precious... 
Gold, gold, bones, bones 
Under platinum headstones 
Gold, gold, bones, bones 
And all that worthless 
Gold, gold, bones, bones 
And all that useless 
Gold, gold, bones, bones 
Where did you bury your heart?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Another dreamer steps onto the stage 
He sings his hope and his fear and his rage 
As the applause from the crowd start to fade 
He hears them swallow the key to his cage 
Welcome to the machine 
It's a currency generator 
And then it's a guillotine 
A mirror held up to your own behavior 
I'm gonna take my bow 
And disappear into the sound 
I'm leaving my cage on the ground 
When I take my bow 
I'm watching it burn to the ground 
See my feet flying up through the clouds 
The dreamer dances inside of his cage 
All his music and words are the same 
But in the moment he exits the stage 
You hear him whisper a prayer for the flames 
Welcome to the machine 
It's a currency generator 
And then it's a guillotine 
A mirror held up to your own behavior 
I'm gonna take my bow 
And disappear into the sound 
I'm leaving my cage on the ground 
When I take my bow 
I'm watching it burn to the ground 
See my feet flying up through the clouds 
When they distinguish your name 
It may extinguish your flame 
I'm gonna take my bow 
And disappear into the sound 
I'm leaving my cage on the ground 
When I take my bow 
I'm watching it burn to the ground 
See my feet flying up through the clouds 
One day distinguish your name 
(I'm leaving my cage on the ground) 
It may extinguish your flame 
(I'm leaving my cage on the ground) 
So trade those ashes for a crown</field>

Receives a message that defies the laws of this world 
All she can do is weep and nod 
She's to bring into this world the Son of God 
God's angels sound their trumpets 
And blow their horns 
Tonight the long awaited savior is to be born 
The goodness bound by Satan it has been torn 
With this baby's precious brow ready for thorns 
A star appears fufilling ancient prophecy 
There's an ounce of fear as wise men follow faithfully 
The Virgin Mary brings forth the human savior 
And this future king sleeps soundly in the manger 
Soundly in the manger 
God's angels sound their trumpets 
And blow their horns 
Tonight the long awaited savior is to be born 
The goodness bound by Satan it has been torn 
With this baby's precious brow ready for thorns 
Tonight He is born so one day He can die 
To heal hearts that are torn and live the perfect life 
So He hang upon a cross and we can take His life 
So we can live as sinners 
And He can pay the price 
Tonight He is born so one day he can die 
But He will rise again 
God's angels sound their trumpets 
And blow their horns 
Tonight the long awaited savior is to be born 
The goodness bound by Satan it has been torn 
With this baby's precious brow ready for thorns</field>

Chance and choice break his heart 
His innocent arm moves to save me and I, I am spared 
His beautiful arm is bloody and cut off 
His heart ripped out to show me he loved me 
But I wouldn't believe him 
He did all that he could 
Still would not believe him 
Woah, I left his arms empty and tied 
Outstretched for me until he died 
Left his arms empty and tied 
Outstretched for me until he died 
No man shows greater love 
Than when a man lays down his life 
For his beloved 
I left his arms empty and tied outstretched until he died 
Left his arms empty and tied outstretched until he died 
Ande here I am alive 
And I don't have the right 
But he gave me the right 
Costing him his life 
New mercies in the morning 
I believe! what if I believe you? Now oh 
Could it ever change this harrow 
Forgive me, relieve me, please come back to life 
I believe! what if I believe you? Now oh 
Could it ever change this harrow 
Forgive me, relieve me, please come back to life</field>

Everything is changed again 
I remember fighting to believe in 
Truth and how the good will win 
When we were young, almost in love 
Too scared to reach out for what was 
Walking past the house that you grew up in 
Man, it looks so different now 
Remembering the story of your first kiss 
The feeling of my heart ripped out 
When we were young, almost in love 
Too scared to reach out for what was 
Looking back, we try to laugh 
City kids, the ghosts of past 
When you were just a girl you wrote a letter 
It said that we were dearest friends 
I push myself to read a little further 
It said we would be 'til we're dead 
But we were young, almost in love 
Too scared to reach out for what was 
Looking back, we try to laugh 
City kids, the ghosts of past

Living in fear something in us dies 
Like a bird with broken wings 
It's not how high he flies, 
But the song he sings 
Courage is when you're afraid, 
But you keep on moving anyway 
Courage is when you're in pain, 
But you keep on living anyway 
It's not how many times you've been knocked down, 
It's how many times you get back up 
Courage is when you've lost your way, 
But you find your strength anyway 
Courage is when you're afraid 
Courage is a burning faith, 
Courage is when you make a change, 
And you keep on living anyway 
You keep on giving anyway 
It's when you're in pain but you keep moving anyway 
You keep on loving anyway</field>

But we don't know this place at all, 
That's enough now dry your tears 
It's been a long eleven years 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars, 
You're ashamed of where you're from, 
Crying 'cause your father's drunk 
We can't die because we're young 
At least that's what we heard in a song 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars, 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars 
You're ashamed of what you've done, 
Crying 'cause your father's wrong 
Trying to be something new, 
You'll feel that you were something to prove 
What you confuse for glory's fire 
Is fire from the tongues of liars. 
What you confuse for glory's fire 
Is fire from the tongues of liars. 
Oh send your rain 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars, 
(Oh send your rain) 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars 
(Oh send your rain) 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars, 
Fire, fire, fire! 
Fire from the tongues of liars 
You're afraid of who you are 
Crying 'cause your father's gone 
Dreaming 'til you hit the truth 
You'll find that you've nothing to lose. 
You'll find that you've nothing to prove.</field>

bout how all her bones are broken 
Hammers fall on all the pieces 
Two months in the cover creases 
Here she stands today 
In her brilliant shiny way 
Fully alive 
More than most 
Ready to smile and love life 
Fully alive 
Now she knows how to believe in futures 
All my complaints shrink to nothing, 
I'm ashamed of all my somethings 
She's glad for one day of comfort 
Only because she has suffered... 
Here she stands today 
In her brilliant shiny way 
Fully alive 
More than most 
Ready to smile and love life 
Fully alive 
Now she knows how to believe in futures 
Fully alive 
More than most 
Ready to smile and love life 
Fully alive 
Now she knows how to believe in futures

I am in awe of who you are 
And it's Your love I'm living for 
Can't you feel I'm drawing near 
The place that broke your heart 
Cut up and scarred 
The dawn is breaking 
My body's shaking 
Oh, the secret memories you keep 
Ignoring so that you can sleep 
I'm facing what you won't tonight 
The dawn is breaking 
My body's shaking 
Great love setting the world on fire 
I am in awe of who you are 
And it's your love I'm living for 
Great love filling me up inside 
You are the one I'm looking for 
And I am yours forevermore 
There I was awaiting death for you 
And all I did was love you too 
I'm facing what you won't tonight 
The dawn is breaking 
My body's shaking 
Great love setting the world on fire 
I am in awe of who you are 
And it's your love I'm living for

Screaming something I could understand.

I need anyone who's desperate..

We have made mistakes I know 
I know 
Don't tell me of better days 
There's a memory I have 
Could be something I read 
Of laughter and cheap guitars 
In a house full of friends 
Could've been one of ours 
They stayed up and loved the stars 
Can't remember the rest 
Just a few parts 
Have we lost our way back home 
We have made mistakes I know 
I know 
I think they lost something that they miss 
I wanna find that book 
Dust it off and read it again 
There was hope in the end 
Have we lost our way back home 
We have made mistakes I know 
I know 
We were braver still when we were young 
And when we were young 
We spoke in tongues</field>

I looking at that red light 
I'll drown in the water 
If I listen to the sound of cruel laughter 
I let the stones fall to the ground 
They don't know a thing about me 
And still the wolves are crying loud 
And I hear you say 
"I'll take you away 
So will you stand for something? 
And give then back the ammunition 
Or will you let then thell you who you are? 
My love is deeper than the stars 
And you are bigger than the scars that you fill at night 
When you hold on your pillow tight 
And you're wishing, someone who call you home 
Is you and I alone 
Is you and I alone"

Hurry refinish 
You wasted your chance, I'm provoked

And I prove that my gifts have revoked

you were meant for this life 
By dying 
And I won't repent from this 
I won't repent from this 
Blood is binding

You're my flesh and blood 
You're my flesh and blood 
You're my flesh and blood 
I'll never feel at home 
Anywhere, anywhere you go 
And when you sit around 
All your questions they start to grow 
They won't give you any answers 
And they lie of our world they don't know 
And I won't repent from this 
I won't repent from this

You're my flesh and blood 
You're my flesh and blood 
You're my flesh and blood,blood,blood... 
You only know my heart when it's cold, 
But it burns when I hear my affliction in your voice, 
Don't you see, all my soul that is yours? 
When you stand in the truth 
Upholding you 
And I won't repent from this 
I won't repent from this

Love you were meant for this flesh 
you were meant for this life 
By dying 
And I won't repent from this 
I won't repent from this

Tears stain your eyes 
But you didn't give up the fight 
And now the fear won't paralyze 
So leave your broken satellite 
Every breath is a chance to know yourself 
And show them what you're made of now 
Forgiveness is the sweetest sound

We're looking out for brighter days

Now I am mute despite myself 
All of them are gone 
The silence overtakes me 
The idle words forsake me and I am left to face me 
I'm held accountable 
For every idle word 
Curse the idle words

Glory shows up 
Exposes us 
I'm naked here 
Forsaken here, by the dark, by the dark 
I'm scared to death of light and silence 
Jesus kill me in side this 
Raise me up to live again

Secret hymns pour from your lips 
Healing for this broken soul 
We'd drive late

Drown our fears 
We may age if we do not die today, 
Until then we'll let this music be our prayers

Pullin me from the other side of the world 
Magnetic 
Fillin'up the space between the stars we are 
Magnetic 
Nothing gonna come between us now 
Always gonna find each other somehow 
Magnetic, magnetic 
Oh, oh 
Magnetic, magnetic

Always gonna find each other somehow 
Always gonna find each other somehow

Nothing gonna come between us now 
Always gonna find each other somehow

            <field name="lyrics">On a hill called Calvary 
Stands an endless mercy tree 
Every broken weary soul 
Find your rest and be made whole 
Stripes of blood that stain its frame 
Shed to wash away our shame 
From the scars pure love released 
Salvation by the mercy tree 
In the sky between two thieves 
Hung the blameless Prince of Peace 
Bruised and battered, scarred and scorned 
Sacred head pierced by our thorns 
"It is finished" was His cry 
The perfect Lamb was crucified 
The Sacrifice our victory 
Our Savior chose the mercy tree 
Hope went dark that violent day 
The whole earth quaked at Love's display 
Three days silent in the ground 
This Body born for Heaven's crown 
But on that bright and glorious day 
When Heaven opened up the grave 
He's alive and risen indeed 
Oh praise Him for the mercy tree 
Death has died Love has won 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Jesus Christ has overcome 
He has risen from the dead 
Death has died Love has won 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Jesus Christ has overcome 
He has risen from the dead 
One day soon we'll see His face 
And every tear He'll wipe away 
No more pain or suffering 
Oh praise Him for the mercy tree 
Death has died Love has won 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Jesus Christ has overcome 
He has risen from the dead 
Death has died Love has won 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Jesus Christ has overcome 
He has risen from the dead 
On a hill called Calvary 
Stands an endless mercy tree</field>

As lovers left me to bleed alone 
Found something sweet 
On the island with daughters of eve 
But through thick and thin they've gone away 
and only left their grief 
Oh, something's missing in me 
I felt it deep within me 
As lovers left me to bleed alone

As lovers left me to bleed alone

Down here love wasn't' meant to be

All is vanity underneath the sun

It feels so much like falling, 
Dying while I wait to die, 
The fear of something or nothing, 
Lonely empty lie, 
I don't want to be a liar, 
I don't want to be selfish anymore, 
I want so much to change, 
Learning your love everyday, 
There's still so much to know, 
You grip my wrists, 
I let go, 
It feels so much like falling, 
Separated from the fear, 
Aware of a destination far away from here, 
Far away from here, 
It feels so much like falling, 
Separated from the fear, 
Aware of a destination far away from here,

So open up your eyes

New horizons 
You said I'd only have to wait until I die but that's in no time 
How did we come to think and this was funny 
Cheering and laughing at the dying 
While we're riding the light in you 
Wait, you said I'd only have to wait 
Until I die (new horizons) 
There is no such thing as time 
Inside this moment, no sun rising 
Wait until I fly (new horizons) 
Wait until I fly (new horizons) 
Sin with a conquest lifeless 
Sin with a new quest 
Here's a voice for the voiceless 
And a song for the soulless 
Lifeless sin 
Wait, you said I'd only have to wait until I die (new horizons) 
There is no such thing as time 
Inside this moment, no sun rising 
Wait until I fly (new horizons) 
Wait until I fly (new horizons) 
When the times keep going wrong and we go right 
When the times keep going wrong and we go right 
Wait, you said I'd only have to wait until I die (new horizons)

I just held the pen that day 
And I don't deserve this

It's not something for which I can take the bow 
And I don't deserve this 
It wasn't me 
I can't take glory for something that I can't be 
I don't deserve this 
I know what perfection is like 
And I cannot stand before its might 
And I'm so far from what you think that I must be 
I just drown myself in mercy 
And all the art that I supposedly create 
Is simply a faded reflection of something He's already made

Met that old friend who made her angry 
They walked the beach 
When it was raining 
Fell in love 
And then got married 
Pretend like we are more friends

Don't have too much to say 
With my screaming in your itching ears 
It's a beautiful lie 
I'm So Sick, infected with 
Where I Live 
Let me leve, without this 
Empty bliss, selfsheness 
I'm so sick 
I'm so sick 
So beautiful, beautiful that makes me 
You sick into my clothes 
This invasion makes me feel 
Worthless, hopeless, sick 
I'm So Sick, infected with (I'm so sick) 
Where I Live (I'm so sick) 
Let me leve, without this (I'm so sick) 
Empty bliss, selfsheness (I'm so sick) 
I'm so ... 
So beautiful, beautiful (I will break) 
So beautiful, beautiful, it's a beautiful lie (I will break) 
So beautiful, beautiful, it's a beautiful lie (I will break) 
So beautiful, beautiful, it's a beautiful lie (I will break) 
So beautiful, beautiful lie (I will break) 
 
I'm So Sick, infected with 
Where I Live 
Let me leve, without this 
Empty bliss, selfsheness 
I'm so ... 
I'm so sick 
I will Break !!!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">All your twisted thoughts free flow to 
Everlasting memories show soul 
Kiss the stars with me 
And dread the wait for 
Stupid calls returning us to life 
We say to those who are in love 
It can't be true cause we're too young 
I know that's true because 
So long I was so in love with you 
So I thought 
A year goes by 
And I can't talk about it 
On my knees in a dim lighted room 
Thoughts free flow try to consume myself in this 
I'm not faithless 
Just paranoid 
Of getting lost or that I might lose 
Ignorance is bliss cherish it 
Pretty neighborhoods 
You learn too much to hold 
Believe and not 
And fight the tears 
With pretty smiles and lies about the time 
A year goes by 
And I can't talk about it 
The times weren't right 
And I couldn't talk about it 
Choris romance says goodnight 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Remember you remember me 
Choris romance says goodnight 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Remember you remember me 
And I'm praying that we will see 
Something there in between 
Then and there 
That exceeds all we can dream 
So we can talk about it 
Choris romance says goodnight 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Remember you remember me 
Choris romance says goodnight 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Remember you remember me 
And I'm praying that we will see 
Something there in between 
Then and there 
That exceeds all we can dream 
So we can talk about it 
And all these twisted thoughts I see 
Jesus there in between 
And all these twisted thoughts I see 
Jesus there in between</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Let your head fill up with sirens 
Let the lights caress and spin you down 
Close your eyes and wake inside your head again 
Yeah, you've been wasted all day 
But you reach for a pipe in a smoke-filled room 
Head to the club and wreck your car again 
I won't be the one to hold you 
Let go of my hand 
This is the sober serenade 
I won't be the one who knows you 
Let go of my hand 
This is the sober serenade 
Do you see the spell you're under 
When you twist the knife that kills your soul 
Or the pain you cause the ones you say you love 
Or the people you leave waiting 
While you build up to a perfect storm 
When your lungs quit breathing will you say, "enough" 
I won't be the one to hold you 
Let go of my hand 
This is the sober serenade 
I won't be the one who knows you 
Let go of my hand 
This is the sober serenade 
Say enough, say enough 
Say enough, say enough 
Say enough 
Let your head fill up with sirens 
Let the lights caress and spin you down 
Close your eyes and wake inside your head again 
I won't be the one to hold you 
Let go of my hand 
This is the sober serenade 
I won't be the one who knows you 
Let go of my hand 
This is the sober serenade 
I won't be the one, won't be the one 
Let go of my hand 
This is the sober serenade

Oh, whoa, don't you know 
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better 
Oh, whoa, don't I know 
Come spend the night inside our soul 
It's so beautiful, at all 
The howling wolves between my ears 
Go silent when they hear you call 
My darkness fades away 
If you speak, I hear you call 
Not just the words you say 
And now I'm feeling oh so happy 
Aren't we all trying to become something better? 
(Something better) 
Oh, whoa, don't you know 
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better 
(Someone better) 
Oh, whoa, don't I know 
Come spend the day, watch the sunshine play 
Off the light that's in your eyes 
A lonely bird chirps a cheerful word 
As he floats across the sky 
My darkness fades away 
If you speak, I hear you call 
Not just the words you say 
And now I'm feeling oh so happy 
Aren't we all trying to become something better? 
(Something better) 
Oh, whoa, don't you know 
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better 
(Someone better) 
Oh, whoa, don't I know 
She said, "Don't forget the person you are" 
Seem to remember chasing falling stars 
Up until you found me lying on the ground and whispered 
Aren't we all trying to become something better? 
(Something better) 
Oh, whoa, don't you know 
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better

Oh, whoa, don't I know

Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears 
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore 
Scraping through my head ’til I don’t want to sleep anymore 
You make this all go away 
You make this all go away 
I just want something 
I just want something I can never have 
You always were the one to show me how 
Back then I couldn’t do the things that I can do now 
This thing is slowly taking me apart 
Grey would be the color if I had a heart 
Come on tell me 
You make this all go away 
You make this all go away 
I'm down to just one thing 
And I'm starting to scare myself 
You make this all go away 
You make this all go away 
I just want something 
I just want something I can never have 
In this place it seems like such a shame 
Though it all looks different now 
I know it’s still the same 
Everywhere I look you’re all I see 
Just a fading reminder of who I used to be 
Come on tell me 
You make this all go away 
You make this all go away 
I'm down to just one thing 
And I'm starting to scare myself 
You make this all go away 
You make this all go away

Into paralyzing silence 
Like the moonless dark 
Meant to make me strong 
Familiar breath of my old lies 
Has changed the color in my eyes 
Soon he will perforate the fabric of the peaceful 
by and by 
Sorrow last through this night 
I'll take this piece of you 
And hold for all eternity 
For just one second I felt whole 
As you flew right through me 
Left alone with only reflections of the memory 
To face the ugly girl 
That's smothering me 
Sitting closer than my pain 
He knew each tear before it came 
Soon he will perforate the fabric of the peaceful 
by and by 
Sorrow last through this night 
I'll take this piece of you 
And hold for all eternity 
For just one second I felt whole 
As you flew right through me 
And we kiss each other one more time 
And sing this lie that's halfway mine 
The sword is slicing through the question 
So I won't be fooled by his angel light 
Sorrow lasts through this night 
I'll take this piece of you 
And hold for all eternity 
For just one second I felt whole 
As you flew right through me 
And up into the stars 
Joy will come</field>

Remembering these wounds will heal 
You are not 
Alone in this 
We will look ahead 
At the dreams 
That were laid 
In our heart 
And we can begin again 
Stand

And these tired body's spirit perseveres 
Remembering these wounds will heal

How long did you bleed for us 
Hold fast 
Don't you look at the past

You stop in for a pack of cigarettes 
You don’t smoke 
Don’t even want to 
Hang out, check your change 
Dressed up like a car crash 
Wheels are turning but your upside-down 
You say when he hits you 
You don’t mind 
Because when he hurts you, 
You feel alive 
Oh, is that what it is 
Red lights, gray morning 
You stumble out of a whole in the ground 
A vampire or a victim 
It depends on who’s around 
You used to stay in to watch the adverse, 
You could to lip-synch to the talk shows 
And if you look, you look through me 
And when you talk, it’s not to me 
And when i touch you, you don’t feel a thing 
If i could stay then a night would give you up 
Stay and the day would keep its trust 
Stay and the night would be alive 
Far away, so close 
Up with the static and the radio 
With satellite, television 
You can go any where 
Miami, new orleans, london, belfast, and berlin 
And if you listen i can call 
And if you jump, you just might fall 
And if you shout i’ll only hear you 
If i could stay then a night would give you up 
Stay and the day would keep its trust 
Stay with the demons you drowned 
Stay with the spirit i found 
Stay and the night would be alive 
Oh… oh… oh…oh 
Three o’ clock in the morning 
It’s quite and there’s no one around 
Just a bang and a clatter 
As angel rams the ground 
Just a bang and a clatter 
As angel hits the ground.</field>

Each passing day 
She can't even manage to stand on her own its gotten so bad 
You think in saying theres no use in praying 
But still she bows her head 
So she can say 
Thank you for just one more day 
Supernatural patience 
Graces her face 
And her voice never raises 
All because, of a love, never let go of 
He has every reason to throw up his fists in the face of his God who let his mother die 
Through all the prayers and tears, she still passed in pain anyway 
You think in saying theres no use in praying 
But still he bows his head 
So he can say 
Thank you for ending her pain 
Supernatural patience 
Graces his face 
And his voice never raises 
All because of a love never let go of 
Never let go of 
He is teaching me 
What love really means 
Supernatural patience 
Graces his face 
And his voice never raises 
All because of a love never let go of

Wrapped in your classic voice 
Angelic in your syntax, demonic in your motive 
Your eyes don't know 
That the water flowing from this well isn't fresh 
Demolish all that sets you up against your rising up 
Confessing all that's broken and watch the healing 
come 
Spread out your open hands 
Admit you've held them shut 
Turn all the way around 
Be swept away by this. 
Time for surrender 
Spread out your open hands 
And He will raise you up 
Confessing all that's broken 
And watch the healing come 
Spread out your open hands 
Admit you've held them shut 
Be swept away by this 
Your clothes are smooth and spotless 
The air is putrid sewage downwind of your pressed 
church clothes 
Your eyes are black and empty 
Your deeds are just for showing how big and bright 
your fake smile glows 
I see you moving and they`re getting scared 
Their eyes are focusing on something else 
You`re staring at me and I stare at you 
I rage against everything that you do. 
See them surrender 
Spread out your open hands 
And he will raise you up 
Confessing all that's broken 
Look at the healing come 
Spread out your open hands 
Admit you've held them shut 
Be swept away by this 
I see you moving and their getting scared 
Their eyes are focusing on something else 
You`re staring at me and I stare at you 
I rage against everything that you do 
Get this hell out out of my way 
There's nothing more that you can say so 
Get this hell out get this hell out out out of my way 
We spread our open hands 
And he is rising up 
Repairing all that broken 
Look at the healing come 
We spread our open hands 
Forgiveness holds them up 
We're swept away by this.

And it's just the kind that rips the clothing off your mind 
She is feeding you and you lie with her 
And for the first time your right arm becomes useful 
As you sin with it you wanna cut it off 
But instead you thank God for all of the wrong you do 
But it's not the kind, the kind you talked about 
And it's just the kind that rips the clothing off your mind

And for the first time your right arm becomes useful 
As you sin with it you wanna cut it off 
But instead you thank God for all of the wrong you do 
You cut the cord today with God's hand to hold yours steady 
He waits for you to apply the pressure, the warmth of His breath 
Wrapped in His words as He repeats His truth, after truth 
After truth, after truth, after truth, after truth, after truth, after truth, after 
And it's just the kind, the kind you talked about 
And it's just the kind that clothes your mind with Christ 
He is feeding you and you know the truth 
And I pray this is the last song I will sing to you

In the sand, waves rushing over where the shore begins

All dressed up for the wedding of the sun 
And the emerald sea 
Feel your breath over me, travelling on the salty breeze 
In this place forever, but it's always escaping me 
All dressed up for the wedding forever 
Falling sand from the hourglass inside my head 
I warm my hands and start to feel the winter closing in 
All dressed up for the wedding of the sun 
And the emerald sea 
Feel your breath over me, travelling on the salty breeze 
In this place forever, but it's always escaping me

All dressed up for the wedding forever

All dressed up for the wedding of the sun

With the voice of the dead, I'm screaming 
I don't know who I am anymore 
Not once in life have I been real but I never felt this close before 
I've been looking in your window I've been dressing in your clothes 
I've been walking dead, watching you, long enough to know I can't go on. 
Had a dream that fire fell from an opening in the sky 
Someone warned me of this hell, and I spit in his naive eye 
And left him crying for my soul he said would die. 
In the hearts of the blind something you'll never find is a vision of light 
With the voice of the dead I'm screaming 
I don't know who I am anymore. 
Not once in life have I been real, but I've never felt this close before 
I've been looking in your window, been dressing in your clothes, 
I've been watching you long enough to know I can't go on. 
In the hearts of the blind, something you'll never find is a vision of light 
With the voice of the dead, I'm screaming 
I don't know who I am anymore. 
Not once in life have I been real, but I've never felt this close before 
I've been looking in your window, been dressing in your clothes, 
I've been watching you long enough to know I can't go on. 
I've been looking in your window I've been dressing in your clothes 
I've been walking dead, watching you, long enough to know I can't go on.</field>

My parachute in shreds

Resurrect the fear I hold inside 
Resurrect the fear and chain my sight

Hold my breath and make no sound 
Tied to the broken and hear 
Halos of lighting, you found us 
The distance is breaking between you and I 
Lying, when I say I`m fray often 
Hoping that you will come save me again 
Tell me you hear my cry

Now they only stare at her burns 
Her small voice so full of honesty 
Take care of my loves

Keep me alive while I die 
They can't not notice her sickness 
Like their own dung sprayed with perfume 
They try not to hear her speaking 
But they can't hear anything else 
Take care of my loves 
I can't hold on 
Keep me alive while I die

Send one more

I missed my chance 
Send one more chance 
I'm not wasting this one more chance</field>

When will you open up for me 
I love you so 
And want to meet you again 
Before one of us must go 
Your lips touched every hand but mine 
In their shadows you slept fine 
When will you get back to me 
So we can rest 
Tiny heart 
You're not by yourself 
When will you recognize the beat 
Of my own heart 
Making your blood flow 
So that your chest can rise and fall 
Your lips touched every hand but mine 
In their shadows you slept fine 
When will you get back to me 
So we can rest 
You will never know 
What you have done to me 
You will never know 
Losing love from me 
You will never know 
A single day alone 
Tiny heart 
Stuck inside yourself 
When will you open up 
Your lips touched every hand but mine 
In their shadows you slept fine 
When will you get back to me 
So we can rest 
When you choose me 
I'm waiting for you

Can I tell you a story 
As we dance while the sun starts to bleed 
Song of songs, love is calling 
Daughter, wake up from your sleep 
Refined 
I'll become the most dazzling precious treasure 
I'll be treasured over all the earth 
Bearing the gift of a new heart 
Patience ablaze, I'm slowly burning 
Refined 
I'll become the most dazzling precious treasure 
I'll be treasured over all the Earth 
I am in awe and in shock 
I'm in love and given away 
I'm reserved with these words 
Can I tell you a story 
As we dance while the sun starts to bleed 
Trees rejoice with the wind here 
Hallelujah, Yes Shua 
Tonight I've become the most dazzling precious 
I am treasured over all the earth 
Just look at what he's done 
How he's laying down his life 
Take this life 
Oh, most dazzling precious treasure 
Tonight I've become the most dazzling precious

I am treasured over all the Earth</field>

Her death has been swallowed up by life 
This dead will rise 
Dying to death and raising to life 
The moment we became alive death was waiting, chasing 
And all of us fell and kept breathing 
One day, today 
A sprits alive, a body has died 
And death has been swallowed up by life 
This death will rise 
Dying to death and raising to life 
With mournful joy she finally lets out her cry 
Death has been swallowed life 
This dead will rise 
In the middle of 
All the business 
A call to be still 
Multitude of words 
Quiet be still 
And death has been swallowed up by life

With mournful joy she finally lets out her cry

There's color everywhere 
What's this? 
There's white things in the air 
What's this? 
I can't believe my eyes 
I must be dreaming 
Wake up, jack, this isn't fair 
What's this? 
What's this? What's this? 
There's something very wrong 
What's this? 
There are people singing songs 
What's this? 
The streets are lined with 
Little creatures laughing 
Everybody seems so happy 
Have I possibly gone daffy? 
What is this? 
What's this? 
There are children throwing snowballs here 
instead of throwing heads 
They're busy building toys 
And absolutely no one's dead 
There's frost on every window 
Oh, I can't believe my eyes 
And in my bones I feel the warmth 
That's coming from inside 
Oh, look 
What's this? 
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss 
Why that looks so unique, inspired 
They're gathering around to hear a story 
Roasting chestnuts on a fire 
What's this? 
What's this? 
In here they've got a little tree, how queer 
And who would ever think 
And why? 
They're covering it with tiny little things 
They've got electric lights on strings 
And there's a smile on everyone 
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong 
This looks like fun 
This looks like fun 
Oh, could it be I got my wish? 
What's this? 
Oh my, what now? 
The children are asleep 
But look, there's nothing underneath 
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them 
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things 
Secure inside their dreamland 
What's this? 
The monsters are all missing 
And the nightmares can't be found 
And in their place there seems to be 
Good feeling all around 
Instead of screams, I swear 
I can hear music in the air 
The smell of cakes and pies 
Is absolutely everywhere 
The sights, the sounds 
They're everywhere and all around 
I've never felt so good before 
This empty place inside of me is filling up 
I simply cannot get enough 
I want it, oh, I want it 
Oh, I want it for my own 
I've got to know 
I've got to know 
What is this place that I have found? 
What is this?</field>

You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.

Breathe out, so I can breathe you in, 
Hold you in, and now, I know you've always been there

I'm a road that drives away 
And follows you back home 
I, I am a streetlight shining 
I'm a white light blinding bright 
Burning off and on 
It's times like these you learn to live again 
It's times like these you give and give again 
It's times like these you learn to love again 
It's times like these time and time again 
I, I am a new day rising 
I'm a brand new sky 
To hang the stars upon tonight 
I, I'm a little divided 
Do I stay or run away 
And leave it all behind? 
It's times like these you learn to live again 
It's times like these you give and give again 
It's times like these you learn to love again 
It's times like these time and time again</field>

This could take all night 
Think I need a devil to help me get things right 
Hook me up a new revolution 
Cause this one is a lie 
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die 
I'm looking to the sky to save me 
Looking for a sign of life 
Looking for something to help me burn out bright 
I'm looking for complication 
Looking cause I'm tired of trying 
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high 
I think I'm done nursing the patience 
It can wait one night 
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try 
We live happily ever trapped if you just save my life 
Run and tell the angels that everything is alright. 
I'm looking to the sky to save me 
Looking for a sign of life 
Looking for something to help me burn out bright 
I'm looking for a complication 
Looking cause I'm tired of trying 
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high 
Make my way back home when I learn to 
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone 
Try and make this life my own 
Fly along with me, I cant quite make it alone 
Try to make this life my own 
I'm looking to the sky to save me 
Looking for a sign of life 
Looking for something to help me burn out bright 
I'm looking for a complication 
Looking cause I'm tired of trying 
Make my way back home when I learn to 
I'm looking to the sky to save me

Your signal in the distance 
To whom it may concern 
I think I lost my way 
Getting good at starting over 
Everytime that I return 
I'm learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
I'm learning to talk again 
Can't you see I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
Do you remember the days 
We built these paper mountains and sat and watched them burn 
I think I found my place 
Can't you feel it growing stronger 
Little conquerors 
I'm learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
I'm learning to talk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
Now 
For the very first time 
Don't you pay no mind 
Set me free again 
You keep alive a moment at a time 
But still inside a whisper to a riot 
To sacrifice but knowing to survive 
The first to climb another state of mind 
I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign 
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die 
I never wanna die, I never wanna die 
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die 
I'm dancing on my grave, I'm running through the fire 
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die 
I never wanna leave, I'll never say goodbye 
Forever, whenever, forever, whenever 
I'm learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
I'm learning to talk again 
Can't you see I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
I'm learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
I'm learning to talk again 
Can't you see I've waited long enough?</field>

Send in your skeletons 
Sing as their bones go marching in...again 
They need you buried deep

Are you ready? 
I'm finished making sense 
Done pleading ignorance 
That whole...defense 
Spinning infinity, boy 
The wheel is spinning me 
It's never-ending, never-ending 
Same old story 
What if I say I'm not like the others? 
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? 
You're the pretender 
What if I say I will never surrender? 
What if I say I'm not like the others?

I'm just another soul for sale..

We're temporary, temporary

I'm the voice inside your head 
You refuse to hear 
I'm the face that you have to face 
Mirrored in your stare 
I'm what's left, I'm what's right 
I'm the enemy 
I'm the hand that will take you down 
Bring you to your knees

Yeah, who are you?

Something never comes, never leads to nothing 
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close 
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope 
All night long I dream of the day 
When it comes around, and it's taken away 
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most 
Feeling it come to life when I see your ghost 
Calm down, don't you resist 
You've such a delicate wrist 
And if I give it a twist 
Something to hold when I lose my grip 
Will I find something in there, 
to give me just what I need 
another reason to bleed 
One by one, hidden up my sleeve 
One by one, hidden up my sleeve 
[2x] 
Hey, don't let it go to waste 
I love it but, I hate that taste 
Weight, keeping me down 
Will I find a believer 
Another one who believes 
Another one to deceive 
Over and over, down on my knees 
If I get any closer, 
And if you open up wide 
And if you let me inside 
On and on, I've got nothing to hide 
On and on, I've got nothing to hide 
[2x] 
Hey, don't let it go to waste 
I love it but, I hate that taste 
Weight, keeping me down 
All my life I've been searching for something 
Something never comes, never leads to nothing 
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close 
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope 
All night long I dream of the day 
When it comes around, and it's taken away 
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most 
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost 
Then done, done, on to the next one 
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one

Well I wanted something better man 
I wished for something new

When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)

Broken hearts will mend

I'm cold as a match ready to strike 
So here I go 
Here lies a city on fire 
Singing along the arsonist choir 
Now here I go 
It started with a spark 
And burned into the dark 
Now here I go 
There's a river I've found 
Into the wild, under the ground 
So here I go 
A button on a string 
And I heard everything 
Now here I go 
Oh sweet ignition, be my fuse 
You had no choice you have to choose 
Bid farewell to yesterday 
Say goodbye I'm on my way 
But in the end we all 
Come from what's come before 
So here I go 
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse 
You have no choice you have to choose 
Bid farewell to yesterday 
Say goodbye I'm on my way 
I threw it all away because 
I had to be what never was 
Been so hungry I could lie 
You took my word, I took your wine 
And held you with my bloody hands 
These rattled bones and rubber bands 
Wash them in the muddy water 
Looking for a dime and found a quarter 
But you can't make me change my name 
You'll never make me change my name 
Pay no mind no ain't that something 
Fuck it all, I came from nothing 
I'm something 
From nothing 
You are my fuse 
I'm something 
From nothing 
You are my fuse 
It goes oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
It goes oh oh oh 
All rise 
No, you can't make me change my name 
You'll never make me change my name 
Pay no mind, now ain't that something

A simple round of conversation 
Became a shameful equation 
I flip to station to station 
Hey don't go and turn the other way 
Don't say there's nothing more to say 
Come on and hear me out 
Hush hush settle down 
Button up don't make a sound 
Shame shame go away 
Come again some other day 
You used to say I couldn't save you enough 
So I've been saving it up 
I started saving it up 
And when you said I couldn't give you enough 
I started giving you up 
I started giving you up 
You are not me 
Arlandria, Arlandria 
You and what army? 
Arlandria, Arlandria 
Oh God you gotta make it stop! 
Chase all of those memories away 
Save them all for another day 
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you 
Wait! I wanna see if you could change 
I wanna keep all I can take 
I feel much better now 
Use me up, spit me out 
Let me be your hand me down 
Fame fame, go away 
Come again some other day 
You used to say I couldn't save you enough 
So I've been saving it up 
I started saving it up 
And when you said I couldn't give you enough 
I started giving you up 
I started giving you up 
You are not me 
Arlandria, Arlandria 
You and what army? 
Arlandria, Arlandria 
Oh God you gotta make it stop! 
My sweet Virginia 
I'm the same as I was in your arms 
My sweet Virginia 
I'm the same as I was in your arms 
Shame shame go away 
Come again some other day 
Memories keep haunting me 
Help me chase them all away 
Hush now settle down 
Button up don't make a sound 
Close your eyes, turn around 
Help me burn this to the ground 
Come now take the blame 
That's ok I'll play the game 
I don't care it's all the same 
Watch you all go up in flames 
Use me up, spit me out 
Let me be your hand me down 
Fame fame go away 
Come again some other day 
You used to say I couldn't save you enough 
So I've been saving it up 
I started saving it up 
and when you said I couldn't give you enough 
I started giving you up 
I started giving you up

It disappeared with time and never made much sense 
Adolescent resident 
Wasting another night on planning my revenge 
One in ten, one in ten, one in ten 
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench 
One more indecent accident 
I'd rather leave then suffer this 
I'll never be your monkey wrench 
Always time to make amends 
What do you do when all your enemies are friends 
Now and then I"ll try to bend 
Under the pressure wind up snapping in the end 
One in ten, one in ten, one in ten 
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench 
One more indecent accident 
I'd rather leave then suffer this 
I'll never be your monkey wrench 
Temper, temper, temper, 
One last thing before I quit 
I never wanted anymore than I could fit into my head 
I still remember every single word you said 
And all the shit that somehow came along with it 
Still there's one thing that comforts me 
Since I was always caged but now I'm free 
Dont' wanna be your monkey wrench 
One more indecent accident 
I'd rather leave then suffer this 
I'll never be your monkey wrench 
Dont' wanna be your monkey wrench [fall in, fall out] 
Dont' wanna be your monkey wrench [fall in, fall out]

Say have you heard the news today? 
One flag was taken down, to raise another in its place 
A heavy cross you bare 
A stubborn heart remains unchanged 
No home, no life, no love 
No stranger singing me your name 
It maybe the season, the colors change in the valleys skies 
'Dear God I've sealed my fate 
Running through hell 
heaven can wait' 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes 
Under the cold street lights 
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight 
Lets say we take this town 
No king no queen of any state 
Get up to shut it down 
Open the streets and raise the gates 
I know I want to still 
I know what I feel without a name 
Head on without a care 
Before its way too late 
It maybe the season, the colors change in the valleys skies 
'Oh God I've sealed my fate 
Running through hell 
heaven can wait' 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes

No tomorrow, no dead ends 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes 
Under the cold street lights 
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight 
For every piece to fall in place 
Forever gone without a trace 
you'll rise it takes its shape 
No turning back, don't turn that page 
Come now im leavin here tonight 
Come now lets leave it all behind 
Is that the price you pay? 
Runnin through hell, heaven can wait 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes 
Under the cold street lights 
No tomorrow, no dead ends

Better get out

make me break out 
I don't want to look like that 
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me break out 
You can see this on my face 
It's all for you 
The more and more I take 
I break right through 
Therapy still scares me 
Putting me on my back again. 
I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends 
One of these days I'll phase you out 
Burn it in the blast off, burn it in the blast off 
Watching me crawl away 
Try to get out, try to get out 
You know you make me break out 
Make me break out

Our hopes gone up in smoke, 
Swallow your crown. 
Choke! On a kiss, 
Thought I'd save my breath for you. 
Choke! On a kiss, 
Thought I'd save my breath for you. 
Gimme some rope, I'm coming loose. 
I'm hanging on you. 
Gimme some rope, I'm coming loose. 
I'm pulling for you now. 
Gimme some rope, I'm coming out of my head, 
Into the clear 
When you go, I come loose! 
These premonitions got me crying up a storm. 
In your condition this position does no harm. 
Choke! On a kiss, 
Thought I'd save my breath for you. 
Choke! On a kiss,

This one last cigarette

share it with you 
I behave I behave 
I behave so I can share it with you

a smoke will fill the air

for you to walk out that door

But who you want me to be? 
I'm the same, I'm the same,

One day we'll come crashing down 
What will I do 
Never had a chance to say goodbye 
Close my eyes and hope that it's 
a real smooth flight

Close my eyes and hope that it's

I look out, we're going down

The borrowed cloud I'm on? 
All you gotta do is try, 
Pray you're just getting by 
Hey wait I thought you'd made it 
How'd your bottled crown fall off 
Tell me how'd you get so tired 
Faded down to the wire 
Try living a lie 
And kicking out the same old guise 
Wasting time 
So very ordinary 
Wait until my bomb goes off 
See the actors run and hide 
Fake it all in stride 
One day we all can say we're gone 
And haunt the ground we're from 
Everything's so open wide 
Here within the divide 
Try living a lie 
And kicking out the same old guise 
Wasting time 
Ain't it the life, ain't it the life, ain't it the life 
Got no crime 
Just sail on by 
Sail on by 
Ain't it the life, ain't it the life, ain't it the life

Something never comes, never leads to nothing 
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close 
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope 
All night long I dream of the day 
When it comes around, and it's taken away 
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most 
Feeling it come to life when I see your ghost 
Calm down, don't you resist 
You've such a delicate wrist 
And if I give it a twist 
Something to hold when I lose my grip 
Will I find something in there, 
to give me just what I need 
another reason to bleed 
One by one, hidden up my sleeve 
One by one, hidden up my sleeve 
[2x] 
Hey, don't let it go to waste 
I love it but, I hate that taste 
Weight, keeping me down 
Will I find a believer 
Another one who believes 
Another one to deceive 
Over and over, down on my knees 
If I get any closer, 
And if you open up wide 
And if you let me inside 
On and on, I've got nothing to hide 
On and on, I've got nothing to hide 
[2x] 
Hey, don't let it go to waste 
I love it but, I hate that taste 
Weight, keeping me down 
All my life I've been searching for something

Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close 
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope 
All night long I dream of the day 
When it comes around, and it's taken away 
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most 
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost 
Then done, done, on to the next one 
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one 
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one 
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one 
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one 
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one 
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one 
Done, I'm done, and I'm on to the next 
[2x] 
Done, done, and I'm on the next one 
Done, I'm done, and I'm on to the next 
[2x] 
Hey, don't let it go to waste 
I love it but, I hate that taste 
Weight, keeping me down 
Done, done on the next one done, 
I'm done, and I'm on to the next</field>

Tear at the seams

Not that he should

Not that I should

Lets go another round 
I will follow you down and 
We could just lay around 
Stare at the ceiling 
Want to forget about 
One for the feeling 
Room for photographs 
Box full of letters 
Come on make it last 
Nothing else matters right now

Button up don't make a sound

So I've been saving it up 
I started saving it up

I started giving you up 
I started giving you up 
You are not me 
Arlandria, Arlandria 
You and what army? 
Arlandria, Arlandria 
Oh God you gotta make it stop! 
Chase all of those memories away 
Save them all for another day 
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you 
Wait! I wanna see if you could change 
I wanna keep all I can take 
I feel much better now 
Use me up, spit me out 
Let me be your hand me down 
Fame fame, go away

Memories keep haunting me 
Help me chase them all away 
Hush now settle down 
Button up don't make a sound 
Close your eyes, turn around 
Help me burn this to the ground 
Come now take the blame 
That's ok I'll play the game 
I don't care it's all the same 
Watch you all go up in flames 
Use me up, spit me out 
Let me be your hand me down

Alone on a dead end street 
Dancing through life 
On the front lines 
She led a quiet life 
Ends, they don't always meet 
Years passed her by 
Waiting to rise 
She had arrows in her eyes 
Fear where her heart should be 
War in her mind 
Arrows in her eyes 
Fear where her heart should be 
War in her mind 
Shame in her cries 
Arrows in her eyes 
Tears in her arteries 
War in her mind 
Shame as she cries 
Fire away 
Under a silent light 
Screaming biology 
Queen Gemini 
The world in her sights 
I want a new life 
Forming inside of me 
Blessed and born 
Into this fire 
You had arrows in your eyes 
Fear where your heart should be 
War in your mind 
Arrows in her eyes 
Fear where your heart should be

In another life, I sold myself 
Way back then, back when I was you 
Somewhere down the line I started to slip 
Years gone by, biting my lip 
All the while, all this time I knew 
Now you're on your own, one for the pages 
Over the hill and through the ages 
Does my heaven burn like hell on you? 
Out beneath the cracks and coming in waves 
Rolling like an earthquake under the pavement 
Will they now tell me, mr 
true? 
You got a lot of nerve! 
Ohhhh! 
Now show a little backbone, why don't you? 
I'm looking for some back and forth with you 
Are you feeling the same as I do 
Now and, now and then? 
I'm looking for some back and forth with you 
Are you feeling the same as I do 
Down and out? 
Holding my breath, I waited and waited 
How'd the simple life get so complicated? 
Shoes to fill, secrets to spill down you 
Deer in the headlights, spoke in the wheel 
You want "pretend", I need "for real" 
I'm taking it back, all my iou's 
You got a lot of nerve! 
Ohhh! 
Now show a little backbone, why don't you? 
I'm looking for some back and forth with you

Light in your head and dead on your feet 
Well another crazy day 
You'll drink the night away 
And forget about everything 
This city's dance makes you feel so cold 
It's got so many people that it's got no soul 
And its taking you so long 
To find out you were wrong 
When you thought it held everything 
You used to think that it was so easy 
You used to say that it was so easy 
But you're trying, you're trying now 
Another year and then you'll be happy 
Just one more year and then you'll be happy 
But you're crying, you're crying now 
Way down the street there's a lad in his place 
He opens the door 
And he's got that look on his face 
And he asks you were you've been 
You tell him who you've seen 
And you talk about everything 
He's got this dream about buying some land 
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands 
And then he'll settle down 
In some quiet little town 
And forget about everything 
But you know he'll always keep moving 
You know he's never gonna stop moving 
Cause he's rolling, he's a rolling stone 
When you wake up it's a new morning 
The sun is shining it's a new morning 
You're going, your going' home</field>

Stuck inside these four walls, sent inside forever, 
Never seeing no one nice again like you, 
Mama you, mama you 
If I ever get out of here, 
Thought of giving it all away 
To a registered charity. 
All I need is a pint a day 
If I ever get out of here 
Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into the sun, 
And the first one said to the second one there "I hope you're having fun" 
Band on the run, band on the run 
And the jailer man and sailor sam were searching every one 
For the band on the run, band on the run, band on the run, band on the run 
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh seeing no one else had come 
And a bell was ringing in the village square for the rabbits on the run 
Band on the run, band on the run 
And the jailer man and sailor sam, were searching every one 
For the band on the run, band on the run, band on the run, band on the run 
Well, the night was falling as the desert world began to settle down 
In the town they're searching for us every where, but we never will be found 
Band on the run, band on the run 
And the county judge, who held a grudge 
Will search for evermore 
For the band on the run, band on the run, band on the run, band on the run</field>

Putting me on my back again.

My numbers up, bridges well burned 
Why won't you let me twist your faith 
It's getting kinda late but I don't wanna wait no more 
Well may I have this dance of day 
Locked in your embrace 
Passed your test of faith 
Another time, another place 
Another line upon your face 
Another in your way 
Down crooked stairs and sideways glances 
Comes the king of second chances 
Now throw him in the flame 
Whatever keeps you warm at night 
(Whatever keeps you warm at night) 
Whatever keeps you warm inside 
Your bridges are burning down 
They're all coming down 
It's all coming round 
You're burning them down 
It's all coming round 
They're all coming down 
Your bridges are burning now 
Oh let me put you in your place 
I love it when you say 
Giving everything away 
Tell me what's in it for me 
Tell me now what's in it for me 
No one's getting this for free 
So tell me now what's in it for me 
Whatever keeps you warm at night 
(Whatever keeps you warm at night) 
Whatever keeps you warm inside 
Your bridges are burning down 
They're all coming down 
It's all coming round 
You're burning them down 
It's all coming round 
They're all coming down 
Your bridges are burning now 
Gathering the ashes 
Everything blown away 
Gathering the ashes 
Scatter as they blow away 
Gathering the ashes 
Everything blown away 
Gathering the ashes 
Scatter as they blow away 
Your bridges are burning down 
They're all coming down 
It's all coming round 
You're burning them down 
It's all coming round 
They're all coming down 
Your bridges are burning down 
(Gathering the ashes) 
(Scatter as they blow away) 
They're all coming down 
(Gathering the ashes) 
(Scatter as they blow away) 
It's all coming round 
You're burning them down

It's all coming round

They're all coming down

Waiting for the chance 
Save you my confession 
Save me your last dance 
The same old superstitions haunt us now and then 
I'm begging for ignition to start it all again 
We'll burn away, burn away, burn away my bride 
We'll burn away, burn away, burn away my bride 
We'll burn away, from all the other flames that burn tonight 
We'll burn away, burn away, burn away my bride 
Breathe for me from now on 
Breathe for me when I'm gone 
Burn out beyond, 
Out beyond the sun 
Will you still remember 
There behind the skies 
Walking on the embers 
Standing in their light 
The hardest part is knowing 
Everything must die 
The hardest part is waiting here 
Ready to collide 
We'll burn away, burn away, burn away my bride 
We'll burn away, burn away, burn away my bride 
We'll burn away, from all the other flames that burn tonight 
We'll burn away, burn away, burn away my bride 
Breathe for me from now on 
Breathe for me when I'm gone 
Burn out beyond, 
Out beyond the sun 
Burn on, burn on high until you 
Burn on, burn on high until you 
Burn on, burn 
Or never burn again 
Never burn again 
Never burn again 
We'll never burn again 
Never burn again.</field>

Don't take what I don't need 
(give me back my peace of mind) 
Don't say what I don't mean 
(give me back my precious time) 
No way you'll silence me, you'll see 
What you up to now your mirror's gone 
Is there someone you should be 
Did you think I was just fooling 'round with you 
But honestly x3 
Don't take what I don't need 
(give me back my peace of mind) 
Don't say what I don't mean 
(give me back my precious time) 
No way you'll silence me 
(give me back my peace of mind) 
No where to hide from me, you'll see 
And tonight I thank the stars 
As I count my lucky scars 
For everything you've given me 
And all the words I gave to you 
Something borrowed something blue 
If you want them back 
I'll give it to you (x16) 
I don't want one thing that I gave to you (8)</field>

It's your cold day in the sun 
Looks like you're bleeding heart 
Has already won 
Wish I could take it away 
And save you from yourself 
You get so lost inside your head like no one else 
Looking for someone to blame 
Blame me all along 
You'll take the heat, but you would never take the fall 
It's your cold day in the sun 
Looks like you're bleeding heart 
Has already won 
You're so afraid 
That you are the only one 
That you are the only one 
You know 
Don't be afraid 
Cause your not the only one 
You're not the only one 
I know 
It's your cold day in the sun

It's your cold day in the sun 
Looks like you're bleeding heart 
Has already won

Life belonged to runaways 
Nothing here to see, no looking back 
Every sound monotone 
Every color monochrome 
Life began to fade into the black 
Such a simple animal 
Sterilized with alcohol 
I could hardly feel me anymore 
Desperate meaningless 
All filled up with emptiness 
Felt like everything was said and done 
I lay there in the dark I closed my eyes 
You saved me the day you came alive 
Still I tried to find my way 
Spinning I was in a daze 
Burning like a flame behind my eyes 
Drown it out drink it in 
Crown the king of suffering 
Prisoner slave to the disguise 
Disappear the only thing 
Bittersweet surrendering 
Knew that it was time to say goodbye 
I lay there in the dark I closed my eyes 
You saved me the day you came alive 
No reason left for me to survive 
You saved me the day you came alive 
Come alive 
I lay there in the dark I close my eyes 
You saved me the day you came alive 
Come alive 
Nothing more to give 
I can finally live 
Come alive 
Your life into me 
I can finally breathe 
Come alive 
I lay there in the dark 
Open my eyes 
You saved me the day that you came alive 
Come alive</field>

I could not go 
What little time we spent 
A penny on the floor 
My desperation 
A spinning top 
Revolving on and on 
A world that never stops 
Is it all mine? 
How could I know? 
We threw the rind away 
Swallowed all the core 
Tried levitation 
You're not alone 
The stars are holding open 
A door we'll never close 
I have an engine made of gold 
Something so beautiful 
The world will never know 
Our roots are stronger than you know 
Up through the concrete we will grow 
Is it all mine? 
I can't let go 
What little time we spent 
A penny on the floor 
My desparation 
Is this a curse? 
'Til death do us part 
For better or for worse 
I have an engine made of gold 
Something so beautiful 
The world will never know 
Our roots are stronger than you know 
Up through the concrete we will grow 
Our roots are stronger than you know 
Up through the concrete we will grow

He came for everyone 
The day he heard the lightning in the field 
I heard him clear his throat 
The fork within the road 
That night that Tallahatchie took the wheel 
I've been throwing knives 
To see just where they'll land 
Now my world is in your hands 
Send in the congregation 
Open your eyes, step in the light 
A jukebox generation 
Just as you were 
The voice upon the stage 
Is the heart inside a cage 
And it's singing like a bluebird in the round 
There's mystery in this wood 
And ghosts within these roots 
And it tangled deep beneath this southern ground 
I've been going through life 
Making foolish plans 
Now my world is in your hands 
Send in the congregation 
Open your eyes, step in the light 
A jukebox generation 
Just as you were, right? 
Just as you were 
Just as you were, alright 
And you need blind faith 
No false hope, no false hope 
Do you have blind faith? 
No false hope, no false hope 
Where is your blind faith? 
No false hope, no false hope 
Open your eyes, open your eyes 
Step into the light 
Open your eyes, step into the light

Dancing with the bones to my buried past 
Nevermind, there's nothing I can do 
Bet your life there's something killing you 
Chorus: 
It's a shame we have to die, my dear 
No one's getting out of here alive 
this time What a way to go, but have no fear 
No one's getting out of here alive this time 
I'm finished 
I'm getting you off my chest 
Made you come clean in a dirty dress 
A promise is a promise 
You're kept in check 
Hard to cross a heart that beats it's fists 
Take a good hard look for the very last time 
The very last one in a very long line 
Only took a second to say goodbye 
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine 
Ain't no way 
D.O.A. 
It's a shame we have to die, my dear 
No one's getting out of here alive this time 
What a way to go, but have no fear 
No one's getting out of here alive this time 
It's a shame we have to disappear 
No one's getting out of here alive this time</field>

I guess u could say she was a sex fiend 
I met her in a hotel lobby 
Masturbating with a magazine 
She said how'd u like 2 waste some time 
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind 
She took me 2 her castle 
And I just couldn't believe my eyes 
She had so many devices 
Everything that money could buy 
She said sign your name on the dotted line 
The lights went out 
And Nikki started 2 grind 
Nikki 
The castle started spinning 
Or maybe it was my brain 
I can't tell u what she did 2 me 
But my body will never be the same 
Her lovin' will kick your behind 
Oh, she'll show u no mercy 
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show u how 2 grind 
Darlin' Nikki 
Woke up the next morning 
Nikki wasn't there 
I looked all over and all I found 
Was a phone unmber on the stairs 
It said thank u 4 a funky time 
Call me up whenever u want 2 grind 
Oh, Nikki, ohhhh 
come back Nikki, come back 
Your dirty little Prince 
wanna grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I've been drinking dirty water 
But I've been here before, after all 
The witching hour is upon us 
So you and I can sing haunted songs 
In my dreams I'm climbing ladders 
And then I tumble down, rung by rung 
And I keep on falling faster 
The heart is echoing, on and on 
On and on 
I feel an earthquake coming on 
I feel the metal in my bones 
'Cause I'm a natural disaster 
You're the morning after all my storms 
You're my sea of poison flowers 
Standing in the sun, row by row 
I've been drinking dirty water 
The taste of sweet revenge, best served cold 
All we know 
I feel an earthquake coming on 
I feel the metal in my bones 
I'm a natural disaster 
And you're the morning after all my storms 
Bleed dirty water 
Breathe dirty sky 
Bleed dirty water 
Breathe dirty sky 
Bleed dirty water 
Breathe dirty sky 
Bleed dirty water 
Breathe dirty sky 
Bleed dirty water 
Breathe dirty sky 
Bleed dirty water 
Breathe dirty sky 
I feel an earthquake coming on 
I feel the metal in my bones 
'Cause I'm a natural disaster 
Dirty water in my blood 
I feel a moment coming on 
Heavy metal in my bones 
'Cause I'm a natural disaster 
You're the morning after all my storms</field>

Sing along for yesterday 
Sing along my soul to take 
Sing along another song for you

No one has a fit like I do

I'm the only one that fits you 
Whispering me pass the time 
Whisper for the days gone by 
Whisper with that voice inside of you 
With this ring you will be mine 
With this ring I'll multiply 
With this ring surrendering to you

Come to tom-tom's the place to eat 
Like it was built in one day 
You can watch the humans trying to run 
Oh look, there's a rape machine 
I'd go outside if it'd look the other way 
Wouldn't believe the things they do 
Down in the park 
Where the chant is death, death, death 
Til' sun cries morning 
Down in the park with friends of mine 
We are not lovers, we are not romantics 
We are here to serve 
Different face but the words never change</field>

Everlong. 
Tonight, I throw myself into, 
And out of the red, out of her head she sang. 
Come down and waste away with me, down with me... 
Slow how, you wanted it to be, 
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang. 
And I wonder when I sing along with you, 
If everything could ever feel this real forever. 
If anything could ever be this good again, 
The only thing I'll ever ask of you. 
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when. 
She sang: 
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in, 
Hold you in, and now, I know you've always been there 
Out of your head, out of my head I sang. 
And I wonder when I sing along with you, 
If everything could ever feel this real forever, 
If anything could ever be this good again. 
The only thing I'll ever ask of you, 
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.

I pass this time alone 
Somewhere so unknown 
It heals the soul 
You ask for walls 
I'll build them higher 
We'll lie in shadows of them all 
I'd stand but they're much too tall 
And I fall

So we can get out of here 
I'll always be the one who runs from everyone 
Cause everyone's just too weird 
Sink with someone tied to me 
I'm making you volunteer 
Another one has come and gone 
They crawl along, make them disappear 
Dress me up in stitches it's now or never 
Tired of wearing black and blue 
Dress me up in stitches it's now or never 
Dying to get my blood on you 
Blood on you 
Take another stab at me, I promise in time I'll heal 
But yesterday went on and on a bit too long 
I waited out on high street 
There's nothing to find out here 
Another day has come and gone 
They crawl along, wasting all these years 
Dress me up in stitches it's now or never 
Tired of wearing black and blue 
Dress me up in stitches it's now or never 
Dying to get my blood on you 
How can you go on when you're murdering someone 
Killing me like you do 
Gimme stitches now or never 
Gimme stitches now or never 
Gimme stitches now or never 
Blood on you 
Blood on you 
Blood on you 
Blood on you 
Blood on you 
Dress me up in stitches it's now or never

Tired of wearing black and blue

Dress me up in stitches it's now or never

I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it 
Run me out of town 
Somewhere a move might intended a gown at 
Pissed at all the bowels 
Always the blues and a delicate smile 
Missed all of the sideways 
Gull and noun 
Chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around 
Good grief 
Since I'm putting down all

Hey, someone got the best of you

Rain down, rain down 
Innocence is dead 
Goodbye lament, goodbye lament 
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe 
Pray for me 
Fading memories 
Give me time and I will fade into you 
Come and dance with me 
I will always be sleeping behind the eyes 
That I'm bleeding through

Busy counting shadows on the wall

Roses in the whiskey jar 
Blood on the thorns

Cracks in the floorboards are deep from dancing 
To the sound of candles burning out 
Heavy from writing your resignations 
Licking bitter envelopes 
Blood on your tongue 
Drink until the taste is gone 
Where is your Shangri-La now? 
Where is your Shangri-La now? 
Counting down to zero hour 
There ain't no superheroes now 
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground 
Happy ever after

Well I've always had a deep respect, 
And I mean that most sincerely. 
The band is just fantastic, 
that is really what I think. 
Oh by the way, which one's Pink? 
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy, 
We call it Riding the Gravy Train. 
We're just knocked out. 
We heard about the sell out. 
You gotta get an album out. 
You owe it to the people. 
We're so happy we can hardly count. 
Everyone else is just green, 
Have you seen the chart? 
It's a helluva start, 
It could be made into a monster 
If we all pull together as a team.

She's spilling over me 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
Don't wanna have it all 
Winding through this maze you hold me in 
Searching all these days to find the out

Tangled in your headwires, headwires now 
Help you feed the wires when your head unwinds 
And if our headlines become entwined 
You can have all mine, I'll be fine 
There's a reason why keeping me alive 
There's a cure in me that I wish were mine 
As long as I can fight, I'll survive

Sing farewell 
See you in Hell 
Don`t break my spell 
We'll drown the wishin' well 
We'll find some time to kill 
I'll be right there 
The Buzz inside your head 
The horrible electric chair

Kiss ass while you bitch so you can get rich 
But your boss gets richer off you 
Well you'll work harder with a gun in your back 
For a bowl of rice a day 
Slave for soldiers 'til you starve 
Then you head is skewered on a stake 
Now you can go where people are one 
Now you can go where they get things done

Patience and grace 
All of these moments I'll never replace 
Fear of my heart 
Absence of faith

Some of them living 
Some of them dead

No I cannot forgive you yet

Came without a warning 
Caught me unaware

Men are coming to take me away

There's a weight that's pressing down 
Late at night i can hear the sound 
Even the noise you make when you sleep 
Can't see across the river so deep 
They know my name, 'cause i told it to them 
But they don't know where and they don't know when 
It's coming, when it's coming 
There's a fear i get so deep 
You knew the sentence before i could speak 
They know my name, 'cause i told it to them 
But they don't know where and they don't know when 
It's coming, or where 
But it's coming 
Keep the car running 
If some night i don't come home 
Please don't think i've left you alone 
The same place animals go when they die 
Can't get across the mountain so high 
The same city i go when i sleep 
Can't see across the river so deep 
They know my name, 'cause i told it to them 
But they don't know where and they don't know when 
It's coming, or when 
Is it coming?

Downtown the young ones are going 
Downtown the young ones are growing 
We're the kids in America (Whoa) 
We're the kids in America (Whoa) 
Everybody live for the music-go-round 
Bright lights, the music gets faster 
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance 
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance 
Hot-shot, give me no problems 
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind 
You know life is cruel, life is never kind

Downtown the young ones are growing

Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right 
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight 
Outside a new day is dawning 
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere 
I don't want to go, baby 
New York to east California 
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya

Down at the liquor store. 
Beneath the neon sky. 
Our moonlight. 
Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice. 
The pan's dried up so tight. 
With hardened beans. 
We're hungry. 
So I lean on you sometimes. 
Just to see you're still there. 
Your feet can't take the weight of one. 
Much less two. 
We hit concrete. 
How were we born into this mess? 
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby. 
But we were run out on a rail. 
Fell from the wagon to the night train. 
I kissed the bottle. 
I should've been kissing you. 
You wake up to an empty night. 
With tears for two. 
Cigarettes they fill the gaps. 
In our empty days. 
In our broken teeth. 
We're jonesing. 
Say mister, can you spare a dime? 
Some change could make a change. 
Could buy some time. 
Some freedom. 
Or an ear to hear my story. 
It's all I've got 
My fiction 
beats the hell out of my truth. 
A palm upturned burnt blue. 
Don't call it sunburn. 
You've been shaking on the job. 
Just one drink ahead of your past. 
There's a white light coming up. 
You draw the blinds hoping it'll pass. 
I kissed the bottle. 
I should've been kissing you. 
You wake up to an empty night. 
With tears for two. 
I kissed the bottle. 
I should've been kissing you. 
You wake up to an empty night. 
With tears for two. 
I kissed the bottle. 
I should've been kissing you. 
You wake up to an empty night.

Living a life of illusion 
Pow, right between the eyes 
Oh, how nature loves her little surprises 
Wow, it all seems so logical now 
It's just one of her better disguises 
And it comes with no warning 
Nature loves her little surprises 
Continual crisis 
Hey, don't you know it's a waste of your day 
Caught up in endless solutions 
That have no meaning, just another hunch 
Based upon jumping conclusions 
Caught up in endless solutions 
Backed up against a wall of confusion 
Living a life of illusion

Take your payroll 
And your lottery 
There's a place I know 
There's a robbery 
And I swear I'll never tell 
If you swear you'll never tell 
And we'll all make out so well 
We will all make out so well 
Chorus 
Head on with my hate 
Into the lights ahead 
I'm amazed that I'm still standing 
And I demand that we all blend in 
I'm amounted 
Verse 2 
Just the same old 
Glitter story 
From the sea floor 
Metamorphosis 
And I can't change back for you 
I will not change back for you 
I must live in skin that's new 
I'm a livid skin that's new 
Chorus 
Bridge 
Turn your insides out to the outside 
Turn the outside in to the inside 
Trade your outside in for the inside 
Turn it around again 
Repeat 
I'm amounted 
And I can't change back for you 
No I can't change back for you.</field>

Keep out of reach I'm your leadin' deletion 
Hide behind these masks 
Though they still see right through them 
Every now and then 
You're down and out my friend 
Down and out again 
Down and out again 
Down and out again 
One more time for the last time 
One more time for release 
One more time for the last time 
Everyone wants to believe 
Blame it on you thought these years I've been losin' 
Blame it on the past it's the last place I knew you 
Blame all the children their rage and their ruin 
Blame it on the black and the blue

You're down and out my friend 
Down and out again 
Down and out again 
Down and out again 
I'm down with you

Every now and then 
You're down and out my friend 
Down and out again 
Down and out again 
Down and out again 
But I'm done with you 
One more time for the last time 
One more time for release 
One more time for the last time 
Everyone wants to believe 
One more time for the last time 
One more time for release 
One more time for the last time 
Everyone wants to believe 
One more time for the last time

One more time for the very last time

Say have you heard the news today? 
One flag was taken down, to raise another in its place 
A heavy cross you bare 
A stubborn heart remains unchanged 
No home, no life, no love 
No stranger singing me your name 
It maybe the season, the colors change in the valleys skies 
'Dear God I've sealed my fate 
Running through hell 
heaven can wait' 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes 
Under the cold street lights 
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight 
Lets say we take this town 
No king no queen of any state 
Get up to shut it down 
Open the streets and raise the gates 
I know I want to still 
I know what I feel without a name 
Head on without a care 
Before its way too late 
It maybe the season, the colors change in the valleys skies 
'Oh God I've sealed my fate 
Running through hell 
heaven can wait' 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes 
Under the cold street lights 
No tomorrow, no dead ends 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes 
Under the cold street lights 
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight 
For every piece to fall in place 
Forever gone without a trace 
you'll rise it takes its shape 
No turning back, don't turn that page 
Come now im leavin here tonight 
Come now lets leave it all behind 
Is that the price you pay? 
Runnin through hell, heaven can wait 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes 
Under the cold street lights 
No tomorrow, no dead ends 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes 
Under the cold street lights 
No tomorrow, no dead end in 
Long road to ruin, there in your eyes 
Under the cold street lights 
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight</field>

Call and I'll answer 
At home in the lost and found 
You say that I'm much too proud 
Someone who's taken pleasure 
In breaking down 
Never mind the mannequins 
Drunk in their hollow town 
Drinking their spoils down 
Cheap imitations 
The revelation is now 
Chorus 
Yeah, you won't find me 
I'm going M.I.A. 
Tonight I'm leaving 
Going M.I.A. 
Getting lost in you again 
Is better than being numb 
Verse 2 
Counting every minute 
Till the feeling comes crashing down 
Run when it hits the ground 
I'm good at escaping, 
But better at flaking out 
Calling unanswered 
The center becomes blown out 
Stuck on the inside now 
It's fear I'm embracing 
I never could face you down 
Chorus 
Bridge 
Red, red, laced around your head 
Cold and rescued 
Repeat verse 1 
Yeah, you won't find me 
I'm going M.I.A. 
Tonight I'm leaving 
Going M.I.A. 
So you don't find me 
I'm going M.I.A. 
Tonight I'm leaving 
Going M.I.A. 
Say goodbye to me 
I'm going M.I.A. 
I can find relief 
I'm going M.I.A.

Better than playing dumb</field>

It disappeared with time and never made much sense 
Adolescent resident 
Wasting another night on planning my revenge 
One in ten, one in ten, one in ten

I'd rather leave then suffer this 
I'll never be your monkey wrench 
Always time to make amends 
What do you do when all your enemies are friends 
Now and then I"ll try to bend 
Under the pressure wind up snapping in the end 
One in ten, one in ten, one in ten 
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench 
One more indecent accident 
I'd rather leave then suffer this 
I'll never be your monkey wrench 
Temper, temper, temper, 
One last thing before I quit 
I never wanted anymore than I could fit into my head 
I still remember every single word you said 
And all the shit that somehow came along with it 
Still there's one thing that comforts me 
Since I was always caged but now I'm free 
Dont' wanna be your monkey wrench

Come again, one by one 
I lay awake and I count 'til I drown 
Turn up the room, it's getting too loud 
I know I don't have to say it 
Pick up and move 
And go find some new ground 
Somewhere I know I can make it 
But I won't give up 
When I want it enough 
No, I won't give up 
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday 
'Cause I figure it out 
Here and the now takes me day by day 
Refrão: 
Hey, will you come out tonight 
Will you back out, will you put up a fight 
Turn me around and make everything right 
Make me normal from now on 
Erased everyone I replace 
'Til the end, they're all gone 
The faces all fade as the time passes by 
What could I do, I was waiting for you 
Grown sick and tired of faking 
Give me those eyes when I'll give you the truth 
Finnaly here for be taken 
But I won't give up 
When I want it enough 
No, I won't give up 
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday 
'Cause I figure it out 
Here and the now takes me day by day

Hey, will you come out tonight 
Will you back out, will you put up a fight

Threw it up as it went down 
Strange enough it left me rude and turned around 
Watched as they all took their vows 
Fools were drawing trying to save that day 
I don't doubt that anyway 
Phase it out until the older ones return 
Have a seat and watch it burn 
Trace around the corner this is what I've learned 
Always waited for my turn 
Fools were drawing trying to save that day 
I don't doubt that anyway (x2)</field>

Beautiful earthling, dressed in kashmir 
All of your sound echoes in the canyons 
Down below they're dreaming 
Hear the sirens screaming 
Another time, another world 
Girls were boys and boys were girls 
Find the glitter in the litter 
Like a haunt, it's got to move 
Everybody needs some room 
There's something out there 
There's a long straight road, out of the cold 
And we can leave it all behind 
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside 
I wanna get outside, outside, of me 
Oh, I found the space between the spaces 
Standing in the nothing, and time will cling to 
And as the wind will beat you down 
And the wind the only sound 
There's something out there 
There's a long straight road, out of the cold 
And we can leave it all behind

Crippled in your arms 
Chase me through the dark

First to reach the stars 
Wins a broken heart 
One that broke apart 
Shattered from the start 
Are you there? 
Do you read me? 
Are you there? 
I don't feel you anymore 
Cages and alarms 
Keeping us from harm 
I will be the guard 
Hope to rest upon 
Could I be the one 
To break a will so strong 
Pray it won't be long 
Til your will is gone 
Everything is done 
Nothing left at all 
Are you there? 
Do you read me? 
Are you there? 
I don't feel you anymore 
Are you there? 
Will you give in? 
Are you there? 
If I give out 
Over and out 
Cages and alarms 
Keeping us from harm 
I will be the guard 
Hope to rest upon 
Everything is done 
Nothing left at all

Are you there? 
I don't feel you anymore

Will you give in? 
Are you there?

Once upon a time 
Dancing from across the room 
In another life 
A little bit of resolve 
Is what I need now 
Pin me down 
Show me how 
Looking back to find my way 
Never seemed so hard 
Yesterday’s been laid to rest 
Changing of the guard 
I would never change a thing 
Even if I could 
All the songs we used to sing 
Everything was good 
One more year that you’re not here 
Has gone and passed you by 
What happened to you? 
One more tear that you won’t hear 
Has gone and passed you by 
What happened to you?

Breathe oh breathe now smother me 
So clever me, I'm onto you 
My oh my, now testify 
I'm guilty by my clouds on you 
Where you been? 
How far'd you get? 
I got this sin I saved for you 
I don't need your remedy 
I wanna be right 
Sick of you 
[Chorus] 
Sweetest torture, at least we were alive 
Cringe and burns, well mark my words so 
Save your breath X3 
Cause it's mine 
Save your breath X3 
Cause it's mine 
[Verse 2] 
Open wide now, crucify 
I wanna ride my lungs on you 
Nervous we, oh jealousy 
It's gonna be their debt to you 
Bang bang bang 
Ain't no [?]

Twenty hours until I'm back home 
Been commiserating, me and Sean 
Think your face is getting long 
Yeah who you running from?

You've been waiting in the waves 
Waiting in the waves 
I've been sipping poison just for fun 
13 hours till I'm back home 
Been obliterated, me and Sean 
Getting good at getting gone 
Yeah who you running from?

Safe to say we will never know 
When our boat has sailed 
I don't mind, I can aways find you

so sick upon a Steinway 
the sailors drown 
see them talk and see them drown 
and see them drink and fall around 
upon the floor 
sister of mine, home again 
sister of mine, home again 
lonely in a crowded room 
the radio plays out of tune 
so silently 
the radio upon the floor 
is stupid it plays aznavour 
so out of key 
sister of mine 
home again 
sister of mine 
home again 
broken on a ship of fools 
even dreams must fall to rules 
so stupidly 
words are all just useless sound 
just like cards they fall around 
and we will be 
sister of mine 
home again 
sister of mine 
home again 
buy a car and watch it rust 
sister see them fall to dust 
they fall around 
in another crowded room 
paint me like the shirt I’m in 
honestly 
sister of mine 
home again 
sister of mine 
home again 
sister of mine

I'm cold as a match ready to strike 
So here I go 
Here lies a city on fire 
Singing along the arsonist choir 
Now here I go 
It started with a spark 
And burned into the dark 
Now here I go 
There's a river I've found 
Into the wild, under the ground 
So here I go 
A button on a string 
And I heard everything 
Now here I go 
Oh sweet ignition, be my fuse 
You had no choice you have to choose 
Bid farewell to yesterday 
Say goodbye I'm on my way 
But in the end we all 
Come from what's come before 
So here I go 
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse 
You have no choice you have to choose 
Bid farewell to yesterday 
Say goodbye I'm on my way 
I threw it all away because 
I had to be what never was 
Been so hungry I could lie 
You took my word, I took your wine 
And held you with my bloody hands 
These rattled bones and rubber bands 
Wash them in the muddy water 
Looking for a dime and found a quarter 
But you can't make me change my name 
You'll never make me change my name 
Pay no mind no ain't that something 
Fuck it all, I came from nothing 
I'm something 
From nothing 
You are my fuse 
I'm something 
From nothing 
You are my fuse 
It goes oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
It goes oh oh oh 
All rise 
No, you can't make me change my name 
You'll never make me change my name 
Pay no mind, now ain't that something 
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

Hey hey now, can you take it

Yeah, but things aren't always what they seem 
Your teary eyes, your famous disguise 
Never knowing who to believe 
See through, yeah but what do you do

We're just ordinary people 
You and me 
Time will turn us into statues, eventually 
We got by, though we're never needed much 
A sliver of hope 
No diamond rings 
We got high, it was heaven, it was hell 
Fly over them 
With broken wings 
We're just ordinary people 
You and me 
Time will turn us into statues, eventually 
Oh 
Just two ordinary people 
You and me 
Time will turn us into statues, eventually 
Our bones won't ever rest on monumental life 
To dust as everything must 
We'll fade away in time

Promise I will be forever yours 
Promise not to say another word 
Nevermind whats done is done 
Always was a lucky one 
Watch the sunrise all alone 
Sitting on the tracks 
Hear the train come roaring in 
Never coming back 
Laying quiet in the grass 
Everything is still 
River stones and broken bones 
Scattered on the hill 
Promise I will be forever yours 
Promise not to say another word

Moonshine in your hair

Come on over brave my storm 
Oceans overhead 
Come inside, my friend 
Getting bad out there 
Every moment we have stolen 
All we have to share 
No one wanted them 
But you know I did 
You know I did

Shinning once again 
Will you do 
The thing you've always done 
Tell me true 
I think you know the one 
One that makes me blurry 
Colors start to run 
Everytime I wonder 
I go under 
The deeper the blues 
The more I see black 
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back 
All the deepest blues are black 
How my mind is spinning 
And my head is going numb 
Right from the beginning 
Our ending had begun 
I can be your trouble 
Shiver into you 
Shaking like the thunder 
Sinking under 
The deeper the blues, the more I see black 
The sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back 
All the deepest blues are black 
When it comes closing in 
Reject 
Cause I gotta move 
And the simple things get in the openings 
Connect 
Become something new 
To remove 
The deeper the blues, the more I see black 
The sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back

            <field name="lyrics">That night they were burning of the truth 
Down on the corner of 14th and u 
They took your soul and they took you for fools 
Took all the windows to prisons and schools 
Now what's a poor man left to do? 
One heart now broken in two 
It started untying the hands of the youth 
New kids hear the sound of the drumming 
Mother nature your summer is coming 
Yesterday and today 
Revolution on it's way 
Amen! It was the feast and the famine 
Amen! It was the feast and the famine 
It was the feast and the famine 
Feast and the famine 
Crossroads with nothing to lose 
Out of the basement and into the news 
Come change now shit getting heavy 
Salvation at thel ready 
You look when I walk by 
Still screaming till I die 
You can't find peace if you can't find a home 
You can't survive as an island alone 
Black heart with a gaping wound 
Put back together by a troubled groove 
Check yourself, wreck your brans 
Where is that P.M.A.? 
Amen! It was the feast and the famine 
Amen! It was the feast and the famine 
It was the feast and the famine 
Feast and the famine 
Hey 
Where is the monument 
To the dream we forget? 
We need a monument 
And change will come 
Yeah, change will come 
Is there anybody there? (anybody there) 
Anybody there? (anybody there) 
Yeah! 
Amen! It was the feast and the famine 
Amen! It was the feast and the famine 
It was the feast and the famine 
Feast and the famine 
(Amen!) where is the monument 
To the dream we forget? 
(Amen!) we need a monument 
And change will come 
And change will come 
Is there anybody there? (anybody there) 
Anybody there? (anybody there) 
Yeah!</field>

You got to talk the talk, the talk, the talk

But you're out of tune 
You're so out of tune 
This is the last song (This is the last song) 
This is the last song 
That I will dedicate to you 
Something I've found 
Yea, That want to turn around 
You got to walk the walk, the walk, the walk 
To make any ground 
You're pushing 
You're pushing 
You're pushing 
But there ain't no room 
No there ain't no room 
This is The last song (This is the last song) 
This is the last song (This is the last song) 
That I will dedicate to you 
I made my peace 
And now I'm through 
This is the last song 
That I will dedicate to you 
And yours is a name 
I will never name again 
I will never name again 
We pretend it doesn't matter 
We pretend it all away 
We pretend it all away 
We pretend 
We pretend 
We pretend 
But it ain't no use 
This is the last song (This is the last song) 
This is the last song (This is the last song) 
That I will dedicate to you 
I made my peace 
And now I'm through 
This is the last song 
that i will dedicate to you 
to you 
to you

What is truth 
But a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue? 
I was wrong 
I was right 
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night 
Break my bones 
I don't care 
All I ever wanted was a body to share 
Heart's gone cold 
Brush ran dry 
Satellite searching for a sign of life 
Like you 
Somewhere? 
Are you there? 
The tears in your eyes 
Someday will dry 
We fight for our lives 
'Cause everything's on the line 
This time 
Listen close 
I can't hide 
I'm a page torn from a broken spine 
Sun gets low 
I get high 
Satellite searching for a sign of life 
Like you 
Somewhere? 
Are you there? 
The tears in your eyes 
Someday will dry 
We fight for our lives 
'Cause everything's on the line 
This time 
Are you there? 
Are you there? 
The tears in your eyes 
Someday will dry 
We fight for our lives 
'Cause everything's on the line 
This time 
The tears in your eyes 
Someday will dry 
We fight for our lives 
'Cause everything's on the line 
Yes or no?

Woe, it's me 
The end is near 
Thought you'd never leave 
Heart and teeth 
Just to taste bittersweet 
One last stain to get beneath the skin 
Beneath the skin 
[Chorus 1] 
The wish is drawn inside 
The neverending sigh 
No one lets everyone in 
No one lets everyone in 
My exit, no exit 
No one lets everyone in 
[Verse 2] 
Me and you 
Draw the line 
Now it's time they move 
Face to face 
Damn the luck messes with me 
Heaven, what's come over me? 
[Chorus 2] 
The wishes come inside 
The neverending sigh 
No one lets everyone in 
No one lets everyone in 
My exit, no exit 
Go on let everyone in 
No one lets everyone in

You're not the one but your the only one who could

Something never meant to be 
Everything you meant to me 
Wake me when this punishment is done 
Those who try and get away 
From the one who gets away 
Someone's always someone else's one 
You're not the one but you the only one who could make

You're not the one but you the only one who can make 
me feel like this

Until the end of time 
In another life 
Till the day i die 
Save it up for one more try 
Save it for the last goodbye 
We go ON 
and get OFF 
and get ON 
and get OFF 
You're not the one but your the only one who could 
make me feel like this 
You're not the one but your the only one who can make 
me feel like this

You know they all pretend 
Keep you in the dark 
And so it all began 
Send in your skeletons 
Sing as their bones go marching in...again 
They need you buried deep 
The secrets that you keep are ever ready 
Are you ready? 
I'm finished making sense 
Done pleading ignorance 
That whole...defense 
Spinning infinity, boy 
The wheel is spinning me 
It's never-ending, never-ending 
Same old story 
What if I say I'm not like the others? 
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? 
You're the pretender 
What if I say I will never surrender? 
What if I say I'm not like the others? 
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? 
You're the pretender 
What if I say that I'll never surrender? 
In time our soul untold 
I'm just another soul for sale.. 
oh, well 
The page is out of print 
We are not permanent 
We're temporary, temporary 
Same old story 
What if I say I'm not like the others?

What if I say I'm not like the others? 
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? 
You're the pretender 
What if I say I will never surrender? 
I'm the voice inside your head 
You refuse to hear 
I'm the face that you have to face 
Mirrored in your stare 
I'm what's left, I'm what's right 
I'm the enemy 
I'm the hand that will take you down 
Bring you to your knees 
So who are you? 
Yeah, who are you? 
Yeah, who are you? 
Yeah, who are you? 
Keep you in the dark 
You know they all pretend 
What if I say I'm not like the others?

Pretty eyed, pirate smile 
You married the music man 
Ballerina, you must've seen her dancing in the sand 
And now she's in me, always with me 
Tiny dancer in my hand 
Jesus freaks out in the street 
Handing tickets out for Gold 
Turning back she just laughs 
The boulevard is not that bad 
Piano man he makes his stand 
In the auditorium 
Looking on she sings the songs 
The words she knows 
The tunes she hums 
But oh how it feels so real 
Lying here with no one near 
Only you and you can hear me 
When I say softly, slowly 
Hold me closer tiny dancer 
Count the headlights on the highway 
Lay me down in sheets of linen 
You had a busy day today 
(repeat) 
Blue jean baby, L.A lady

Hanging on this wire 
Waiting for the day where I'll have to choose 
Cursed by love so dire 
One more boy for hire 
One more boy to lend a hand to you 
Is this just desire or the truth 
So shame on me for the ruse 
Shame on me for the blues 
Another one returned that I'll never use 
I won't go getting tired of you 
I won't go getting tired of you 
I'm not getting tired 
I won't go getting tired of you 
I won't go getting tired of you 
I'm not getting tired of you 
I can be your liar 
I can be your bearer of bad news 
Sick and uninspired by the diamonds in your fire 
Burning like a flame inside of you 
Is this just desire or the truth 
So shame on me for the ruse 
Shame on me for the blues 
Another one returned that I'll never use 
I won't go getting tired of you 
I won't go getting tired of you 
I'm not getting tired 
I won't go getting tired of you 
I won't go getting tired of you 
I'm not getting tired of you.</field>

Hear me callin' you, Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight

Your signal in the distance 
To whom it may concern 
I think I lost my way 
Getting good at starting over 
Everytime that I return 
I'm learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
I'm learning to talk again 
Can't you see I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
Do you remember the days 
We built these paper mountains and sat and watched them burn 
I think I found my place 
Can't you feel it growing stronger 
Little conquerors 
I'm learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
I'm learning to talk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
Now 
For the very first time 
Don't you pay no mind 
Set me free again 
You keep alive a moment at a time 
But still inside a whisper to a riot 
To sacrifice but knowing to survive 
The first to climb another state of mind 
I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign 
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die 
I never wanna die, I never wanna die 
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die 
I'm dancing on my grave, I'm running through the fire 
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die 
I never wanna leave, I'll never say goodbye 
Forever, whenever, forever, whenever 
I'm learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
I'm learning to talk again 
Can't you see I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
I'm learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
I'm learning to talk again 
Can't you see I've waited long enough?</field>

The other one is on the mend 
Feel it in my bones when you break my back 
Break it just to watch me bend. 
Anyone for once you admit it 
No matter what your good book says 
Never looking back cause I ain't no saint 
Just another teenage head. 
You gotta 
Wait for the feeling 
And you wait for the feeling 
And you wait and you shiver and you shake 
Crawling back and forth from the black and white 
Over and over again. 
Over and over and over again. 
Chorus: 
Ain't no turning back cause I'm walking a line 
Walking a line 
Walking a line 
Ain't no turning back cause I'm walking a line 
Walking a line 
Walking a line for you. 
Maybe if you swear you'll save me 
Maybe save myself instead 
Swear I cross my heart and I hope to die 
Maybe we can just play dead 
Running out of time, but I'm ready 
Run out when I run this round 
See you on the chase, I will track you down 
Even though you're miles ahead. 
You gotta 
Wait for the feeling 
And you wait for the feeling 
And you wait and you shiver and you shake 
Crawling back and forth from the black and white 
Over and over again. 
Over and over and over again.

Trapped within a contract 
Hey there boy while you were catching the black widow 
The rest of us were watching melrose 
I wanna swim in the wattershed 
I wanna listen to the flowerhead 
I lost a gallon and still I bled 
I keep on thinking I get ahead 
Pissed at all the disc jam 
Pissed about the 5-ham 
Pissed about the green state 
I miss it and I can't wait

What did I do to deserve you? 
Go on, tell me now what did I do? 
What did I do to deserve you? 
I heard every word coming from the 13th floor 
Your song came along 
And I heard the voices telling me to save yourself 
I'll behave yourself 
I stop, ask myself what can I do? 
What can I do to preserve you? 
Go on tell me now, what can I do? 
What can I do to conserve you? 
Your name, year of fame 
I could see the writing on the wall 
Come on, flip a coin, bet it's going to tell you 
To save yourself, I'll behave yourself 
Your man, channelin', knowing by the x on his hand 
You raise, runaways singing at the gate 
To save yourself, I'll behave yourself 
So here I go again 
Putting words into your mouth

All that trouble and I'm on about 
How you gonna know, til you hear it out loud

I'm lost, deliver me 
I crossed the river finally

Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight

I can feel the sinking

And nothing mattered anymore 
I looked into the sky 
Well I wanted something better man 
I wished for something new 
And I wanted something beautiful 
And wish for something true 
Been looking for a reason man 
Something to lose 
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down) 
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground) 
And you feel like it's all over 
There's another round for you 
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down) 
Know your head is spinning 
Broken hearts will mend 
This is our beginning 
Coming to an end 
Well, you wanted something better man 
You wished for something new 
Well, you wanted something beautiful 
Wished for something true

            <field name="lyrics">Leading everything along, never far from being wrong. 
Nevermind these things at all, it's nothing. 
Couldn't find a way to you, seems that's all I ever do. 
Turning up in black and blue, rewarded. 
All the static we all left. 
Wait 'til the time has come, figure that's where time comes from. 
Leaving all my senses numb, is heaven. 
Lifted up the fay to seen, anything could never be. 
Anything but play to me, in order. 
All the static we all left. 
Take it back for them to keep, fallen into something deep. 
Not that I had made that leap, annointed. 
All the static we all left. 
Where have all the wishes gone, now that all of that is done? 
Wish I would've felt I've won, for once..</field>

Seducing everyone 
Faded you 
Your diamond in the rough 
 
You don't have to tell me 
I know where you've been 
Shinning once again 
 
Will you do 
The thing you've always done 
Tell me true 
I think you know the one 
 
One that makes me blurry 
Colors start to run 
 
Every time I wonder 
I go under 
 
The deeper the blues 
The more I see black 
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back 
All the deepest blues are black</field>

It's over and I feel fine 
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind 
Waiting and I wait at the longest night 
Nothing like the taste to sweet decline 
 
I was down, I fell, I fell so fast 
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass 
Never say forever cause nothing last 
Dancing with the thorns of my buried past 
 
Nevermind there's nothing I can do 
Bet your life there's something killing you 
 
It's a shame we have to die my dear 
No ones getting out of here, alive 
This time 
 
What a way to go, they have no fear 
No ones getting out of here, alive 
This time 
 
Finished, I'm getting you off my chest 
Made you come clean in a dirty dress 
A promise is a promise you kept in check 
Heart across a heart that beats it's best 
 
Take a good hard look for the very last time 
The very last one in a very long line 
Only took a second to say goodbye 
Then the pleasure 'bout the pleasure's 
Been mine, all mine 
 
Ain't no way, DOA 
Ain't no way, DOA 
 
It's a shame we have to disappear 
No ones getting out of here, alive 
 
This time 
This time

I took a look around 
I believe that in these eyes

May be more than needed 
Now that we're old and worn 
A little ripped and torn 
One day we'll be reborn 
One day I will meet you up again

Maybe I just feel too much

Always stained my skin

Laying quiet in the grass 
Everything is still 
River stones and broken bones 
Scattered on the hill

Ruling my decision 
You are my religion 
Haven't got a prayer

When every angel's guarding you

I don't want to wait 
To save your life 
I think I know a way 
To make things right 
 
Just give me the sign and I'll come for you 
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby 
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me 
 
Give me the sign and I'll come for you 
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby 
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out for me 
 
Walking under ladders 
Nothing really matters 
There could be disaster 
I don't really care 
 
So just give me the sign and I'll follow you 
When every angel's guarding you 
There could be disaster

Right where I belong, just hangin' on

Somewhere so unknown, it heals the soul 
You ask for walls, I'll build them higher 
We'll lie in shadows of them all 
I'd stand, but they're much to tall 
And I fall

Is there somewhere you should be 
Was it something that I said the time I held you down

Don't say what I don't mean

No way you'll silence me 
You'll see 
 
What you up to now your mirror's gone 
Is there someone you should be 
Did you think I was just fooling 'round with you 
But honestly

Something borrowed something blue

All your mysteries 
Settle down and in good time 
We can solve all mine 
Tell me lies or tell me when 
Tear me up again

Had enough of you

Turn out all the lights and go to bed

Life belonged to runaways 
Nothing here to see 
No looking back 
Every sound monotone 
Every color monochrome 
Light began to fade 
Into the black 
 
Such a simple animal 
Sterilized with alcohol 
I could hardly 
Feel me anymore 
 
Desperate and meaningless 
All filled up with emptiness 
Felt like everything 
Was said and done 
 
I lay there in the dark 
And I close my eyes 
You saved me the day 
You came alive 
 
Still I tried to find my way 
Spinning now was end of days 
Burning like a flame 
Behind my eyes 
 
Drown it out 
Drink it in 
Crown the king of suffering 
Prisoner, slave to the disguise 
 
Disappear the only thing 
Bittersweet surrendering 
Knew that it was time 
To say goodbye 
 
I lay there in the dark 
And I close my eyes 
You saved me the day 
You came alive 
No reason left 
Me to survive 
You saved me 
The day you came alive 
 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive

You saved me the day 
You came alive

Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
 
Nothing wrong to give 
I can finally live 
Come alive 
Your life into me 
I can finally breathe 
Come alive 
 
Lay me down in the dark 
Open my eyes 
You saved me 
The day you came alive 
 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Come alive

I'm a field nigga with shined cutlery 
Gold-plated quarters where the butlers be 
I'mma play the corners where the hustlers be 
I told him, "Please don't die over the neighborhood 
That your momma rentin' 
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood 
That's how you rinse it" 
I bought every V12 engine 
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin' 
I coulda bought a place in Dumbo before it was Dumbo 
For like two million 
That same building today is worth twenty-five million 
Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it 
Financial freedom my only hope 
Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke 
I bought some artwork for one million 
Two years later, that shit worth two million 
Few years later, that shit worth eight million 
I can't wait to give this shit to my children 
Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine 
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for nine ninety-nine 
I turned that two to a four, four to an eight 
I turned my life into a nice first week release date, mm 
Y'all out here still takin' advances, huh? 
Me and my niggas takin' real chances, uh 
Y'all on the 'gram holdin' money to your ear 
There's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah

Fear of my heart absence of faith

Say have you heard the news today? 
One flag was taken down 
To raise another in it's place 
 
A heavy cross you bear 
A stubborn heart remains unchanged 
No home, no life, no love 
No stranger singing in your name 
 
Maybe the season 
The colors change in the valley skies 
Dear God I've sealed my fate 
Running through hell 
Heaven can wait 
 
Long road to ruin 
There in your eyes 
Under the cold streetlights 
No tomorrow 
No dead-end in sight 
 
Let's say we take this town 
No king or queen of any state 
Get up to shut it down 
Open the streets and raise the gates 
 
I know a wall to scale 
I know a field without a name 
Head on without a care 
Before it's way too late 
 
Maybe the season 
The colors change in the valley skies 
Oh God I've sealed my fate 
Running through hell 
Heaven can wait 
 
Long road to ruin 
There in your eyes 
Under the cold streetlights 
No tomorrow 
No dead-ends 
 
Long road to ruin 
There in your eyes 
Under the cold streetlights 
No tomorrow 
No dead-end in sight 
 
For every piece to fall in place 
Forever gone without a trace 
Your horizon takes its shape 
No turning back, don't turn that page 
 
Come now, I'm leaving here tonight 
Come now, let's leave it all behind 
Is that the price you pay 
Running through hell 
Heaven can wait 
 
Long road to ruin 
There in your eyes 
Under the cold streetlights 
No tomorrow 
No dead ends 
 
Long road to ruin

No dead ends

We're just ordinary people, you and me 
Time will turn us into statues, eventually 
 
We got by, though we never needed much 
A sliver of hope, no diamond rings 
We got high, it was heaven it was hell 
Flying over them, with broken wings 
 
[Chorus] 
We're just ordinary people, you and me 
Time will turn us into statues, eventually 
Oh, just two ordinary people, you and me 
Time will turn us into statues, eventually 
 
Our bones forever in stone 
Monuments of life 
To dust, as everything must 
We fade away in time, oh

Is it winter there? 
Is it winter there? 
This winter 
 
Meet me in the summer time 
We can move the air 
Sweet Virginia countryside 
I will meet you there 
Bloody lips and cherry wine 
Moonshine in your hair 
Just keep staring at the sun 
Pray for summer's end 
 
Come on over brave my storm 
Ocean's overhead 
Come inside my friend 
Getting bad out there 
Every moment we have stolen 
All we had to share 
No one wanted this 
But you know I did 
You know I did 
This moment 
 
Meet me in the summer time 
We can move the air 
Sweet Virginia countryside 
I will meet you there 
Bloody lips and cherry wine 
Moonshine in your hair 
Just keep staring at the sun 
Pray for summer's end 
 
Meet me in the summer time 
We can move the air 
Sweet Virginia countryside 
I will meet you there 
Bloody lips and cherry wine 
Moonshine in your hair

Safe to say we will never know

I don't mind 
I can always find you 
Waiting there for me

Same old city with a different name 
They?re not coming to take me away! 
I don?t know why, but I know I can?t stay 
Yeah 
 
There?s a weight that?s pressing down 
Late at night you can hear the sound 
Even the noise you make when you sleep 
Can?t swim across a river so deep 
They know my name 'cause I told it to them 
But they don?t know where and they don?t know when 
 
It?s coming 
When it?s coming 
 
There?s a weight that?s pressing me down 
Late at night you can hear the sound

But they don?t know where and they don?t know when 
 
It?s coming 
Or when 
But it?s coming, keep the car running 
 
There?s this fear I keep so deep 
Knew it's name since before I can speak, yeah 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 
They know my name I know them 
Can?t swim across a river so deep 
They know my name but I don't understand 
But they don?t know where, they don?t know when 
 
It?s coming

Keeps me coming, keep the car running

I'm finished making sense 
Done pleading ignorance

Spinning infinity, boy 
The wheel is spinning me

Say have you heard 
The poison in my heart voices in my head 
Years that I've waited these I owe you's

Became a shameful equation 
I flipped you station to station 
 
Hey, don't go and turn the other way 
Don't say there's nothing more to say 
Come on, hear me out, hush, hush, settle down 
Button up don't make a sound 
 
Shame, shame, go away 
Come again some other day 
You used to say I couldn't save you enough 
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up 
 
And when you said I couldn't give you enough, 
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up 
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria, 
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria 
Oh God you gotta make it stop 
 
Chase all of those memories away 
Save them all for another day 
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you 
 
Wait, I wanna see if you can change 
I wanna keep all I can take 
I feel much better now 
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down 
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day 
 
You used to say I couldn't save you enough

I'm the same as I was in your arms 
My sweet Virginia 
I'm the same as I was in your arms 
 
Shame, shame go away, come again some other day 
Memories keep haunting me, help me chase them all away 
Hush, now, settle down, button up, don't make a sound 
Close your eyes, turn around, help me burn this to the ground 
Come now, take the blame, that's OK I'll play the game 
I don't care it's all the same, watch it all go up in flames 
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down 
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day

In another life I saw myself 
Way back then, back when I was new 
 
Somewhere down the line I started to slip 
Years gone by, biting my lip 
All the while, all this time I knew 
 
Now you're on your own, one for the pages 
Over the hill and through the ages 
Does my heaven burn like hell on you? 
 
Out beneath the cracks they're coming in waves 
Rolling like an earthquake under the pavement 
Tell me now, tell me Mr. True 
You got a lot of nerve 
 
Now show a little backbone why don't you? 
I'm looking for some back and forth with you 
Are you feeling the same as I do? 
Now and now and then 
I'm looking for some back and forth with you 
Are you feeling the same as I do? 
Down and out 
 
Holding my breath, I waited and waited 
How'd this simple life get so complicated? 
Shoes to fill, secrets to spill down you 
Deer in the headlight, spoke in the wheel 
You all pretend, I need for real 
Taking it back, all my IOUs 
You got a lot of nerve 
 
Now show a little backbone why don't you? 
I'm looking for some back and forth with you 
Are you feeling the same as I do? 
Now and now and then 
I'm looking for some back and forth with you 
Are you feeling the same as I do?

Oh won't you let me twist your fate

And I don't wanna wait no more 
Oh may I have this dance of days 
Locked in your embrace 
You passed your test of faith 
 
Another time, another place, another line upon your face 
Another in your wake 
Down crooked stairs and sideway glances comes the king of second chances 
Now throw him in the flames 
 
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night) 
Whatever keeps you warm inside 
Your bridges are burning now 
They're all coming down 
It's all coming 'round 
 
You're burning them down 
It's all coming 'round 
They're all coming down 
Your bridges are burning now 
 
Oh let me put you in your place 
Love it when you say, I'm giving everything away, but 
Tell me what's in it for me 
 
Tell me now what's in it for me 
No one's getting this for free 
So tell me now what's in it for me 
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night) 
 
Whatever keeps you warm inside

Gathering the ashes 
Scatter as they blow away

If I had to lose 
Wouldn't take back one thing, never had much to choose 
Then it dawned on me 
Coming down on you 
Like a cold sky raining under a burning moon 
 
You've waited all your life 
Your wish is coming true 
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you 
 
Miss the misery 
Need a reason for a change 
Need a reason to explain 
So turn it on again 
Don't change your mind 
Your wasting light 
Get in and let's 
Go, go 
 
What a nice long leash 
What a nice tight noose 
Never worked for me but sure look good on you 
You've waited all your life 
Your wish is coming true 
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you 
 
Miss the misery 
Need a reason for a change 
Need a reason to refrain 
So turn it on again 
Don't change your mind

Get in and let's 
Go, go! 
 
Miss the misery 
Gimme a reason for a change 
Miss the misery 
Gimme a reason to refrain 
Miss your misery in a day 
Miss your misery in a day 
Come on and turn it on for me

Don't make this right

Been cheating gravity and waiting on the fall

Our hopes gone up in smoke, swallow your crown

Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you 
 
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you 
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now 
Give me some rope I'm coming, out of my head, into the clear when you, go, 
I, go, noose 
 
These premonitions got me crying up a storm 
Leave your condition, this position does no harm

Your signal in the distance 
To whom it may concern 
I think I lost my way 
Getting good at starting over 
Every time that I return 
 
Learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
Learning to talk again 
Can't you see I've waited long enough? 
Where do I begin? 
 
Do you remember the days? 
We built these paper mountains 
Then sat and watched them burn 
I think I found my place 
Can't you feel it growing stronger 
Little conquerors 
 
Learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
Learning to talk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
 
Now, 
For the very first time 
Don't you pay no mind 
Set me free, again 
To keep alive, a moment at a time 
That's still inside, a whisper to a riot 
The sacrifice, the knowing to survive 
The first decline, another state of mind 
I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign 
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die 
 
I never wanna die 
I never wanna die 
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die 
I'm dancing on my grave 
I'm running through the fire 
Forever, whenever 
I never wanna die 
I never wanna leave 
I'll never say goodbye 
Forever, whenever 
Forever, whenever 
 
Learning to walk again 
I believe I've waited long enough 
Where do I begin? 
Learning to talk again 
Can't you see I've waited long enough? 
Where do I begin? 
 
Learning to walk again

Take a ride somewhere 
 
Hey you got something

Hey you got something

Go, go, you should've never waste your lung 
Go, go, and the ride was shared 
Go limo, go limo 
 
I got you stuck in the habit trail 
You've grown to lovin' this shit 
Way out on a back shelf 
Yeah you don't know what you've done 
Look what you're doin' 
Now mama says it's ruined 
You've got a mollusk in the palm of your hand 
So it's a bad smell 
Your eyes wanna win

Down on the corner of 14th and U 
They took your soul and they took you for fools 
Took all the windows from prisons and schools 
Now what's a poor man left to do? 
 
One heart now broken in two 
You start untying the hands of the youth 
New kids hear the sound of the drumming 
Mother Nature your Summer is coming 
Yesterday and today 
Revolution on its way 
 
Amen 
It was The Feast and the Famine 
Amen 
It was The Feast and the Famine 
Feast and the Famine 
 
Crossroads with nothing to lose 
Out of the basement and in to the news 
Come change, now shit getting heavy 
Salvation at the ready 
You look when I walked by 
Still screaming 'til I die 
You can't find peace if you can't find a home 
You can't survive as an island alone 
Black heart with a gaping wound 
Put back together by a troubled groove 
Check yourself 
Wreck your brains 
Where is that P.M.A.? 
 
Amen 
It was The Feast and the Famine 
Amen 
It was The Feast and the Famine 
Feast and the Famine 
 
Hey, where is the monument?

And change will come 
Yeah change will come 
Is there anybody there? (Anybody there?) 
Anybody there? (Anybody there?) 
There?

Beautiful earthling, dressed in Kashmir 
All of your sound echoes in the canyons 
Down below they're dreaming 
Hear the sirens screaming 
Another time, another world 
Girls were boys and boys were girls 
Find the glitter in the litter 
Like a haunt, it's got to move 
Everybody needs some room 
There's something out there 
 
There's a long straight road, out of the cold 
And we can leave it all behind 
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside 
I wanna get outside, outside, of me 
 
Oh, I found the space between the spaces 
Standing in the nothing, and time will cling to 
And as the wind will beat you down 
And the wind the only sound 
There's something out there 
 
There's a long straight road, out of the cold 
And we can leave it all behind 
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside 
I wanna get outside, outside, of me

Here lies a city on fire 
Singing along 
The arsonist choir 
Now here I go 
 
It's started with a spark 
And burn into the dark 
Now here I go 
 
There is a river I've found 
Into the wild 
Under the ground 
So here I go 
 
A button on a string 
And I heard everything 
Now here I go 
 
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse 
You have no choice you have to choose 
Bid farewell to yesterday 
Say goodbye I'm on my way 
 
But in the end we all 
Come from what's come before 
So here I go 
 
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse 
You have no choice you have to choose 
Bid farewell to yesterday 
Say goodbye I'm on my way 
 
I threw it all away because 
I had to be what never was 
Been so hungry I could lie 
Took my word, I took your wine 
 
And held you in my bloody hands 
These rattled bones and rubber bands 
Washed them in the muddy water 
Looking for a dime and found a quarter 
 
But you can't make me change my name 
They'll never make me change my name 
Pay no mind now ain't that's something 
Fuck it all I came from nothing 
 
I'm something from nothing 
You are my fuse 
I'm something from nothing 
You are my fuse 
 
It goes oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh 
It goes oh, oh, oh 
All rise! 
 
No you can't make me change my name 
You'll never make me change my name 
Pay no mind no wait that's something 
Fuck it all I came from nothing

From nothing 
I'm something

But when your finger points so savagely

To hear my plea and take care of me? 
How can I go on 
From day to day 
Who can make me strong in every way 
Where can I be safe 
Where can I belong 
In this great big world of sadness 
How can I forget 
Those beautiful dreams that we shared 
They're lost and they're no where to be found 
How can I go on? 
Sometimes I start to tremble in the dark 
I cannot see 
When people frighten me 
I try to hide myself so far from the crowd 
Is anybody there to comfort me 
Precious Lord.. 
Hear my plea and take care of me 
How can I go on 
From day to day 
Who can make me strong in every way 
Where can I be safe 
Where can I belong 
In this great big world of sadness 
How can I forget 
Those beautiful dreams that we shared 
They're lost and no where to be found

I don't want to sleep with you 
I don't need the passion too 
I don't want a stormy affair 
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere 
All I want is the comfort and care 
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet - 
Mother Love 
I've walked too long in this lonely lane 
I've had enough of this same old game 
I'm a man of the world and the say that I'm strong 
But me heart is heavy, and my hope is gone 
Out in the city, in the cold world outside 
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide 
Mama please, let me back inside 
I don't want to make no waves 
But you can give me all the love that I crave 
I can't take it if you see me cry 
I long for peace before I die 
All I want is to know that you're there 
You're gonna give me all that sweet - 
Mother Love 
Me body's aching, but I can't sleep 
My dreams are all the company I keep 
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down 
I'm coming home to my sweet -

Viva! 
I had this perfect dream 
Un suenyo me envolvió 
This dream was me and you 
Tal vez estás aquí 
I want all the world to see 
Un instinto me guiaba 
A miracle sensation 
My guide and inspiration 
Now my dream is slowly coming true 
Wind is a gentle breeze 
El me habló ti 
The bells are ringing out 
El canto vuela 
They're calling us together 
Guiding us forever 
Wish my dream would never go away 
Barcelona! 
It was the first time that we met 
Barcelona! 
How can I forget 
The moment that you stepped in the room 
You took my breath away 
Barcelona! 
La música vibró 
Barcelona! 
Y ella nos unió 
if god is willing 
We will meet again 
Someday 
Let the songs begin 
Déjalo nacer 
Let the music play 
Ahhhhhhh... 
Make the voices sing 
Nace un gran amor 
Start the celebration 
Ven a mi 
And cry! 
Grita! 
Come alive 
Viva! 
And shake the foundations from the skies 
Shaking all our lives 
Barcelona! 
Such a beautiful horizon 
Barcelona! 
Like a jewel in the sun 
Por ti seré gaviota de tu bella mar 
Barcelona! 
Suenan las campanas 
Barcelona! 
Abre tus puertas al mundo 
If god is willing 
If god is willing 
If god is willing 
Friends to the end

Find my head is always up in the clouds in a dreamworld 
It's not easy - living on my own, my own, my own

Love me like there's no tomorrow 
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it 
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over 
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow 
I guess we drift alone in separate ways 
I don't have all that far to go 
God knows I learnt to play the lonely man 
I've never felt so low in all my life 
We were born to be just losers 
So I guess there's a limit on how far we go

Each morning I get up I die a little 
Can barely stand on my feet 
(Take a look at yourself)Take a look in the mirror and cry 
Lord what you're doing to me 
I have to spend all my years in believing you 
But I just can't get no relief Lord 
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody) 
Can anybody find me somebody to love? 
I work hard (he works hard) everyday of my life 
I work till I ache my bones 
At the end (at the end of the day) 
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own 
I get down (down) on my knees (knees) 
And I start to pray (praise the Lord) 
'Til the tears run down from my eyes 
Lord somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (please) 
Can anybody find me somebody to love? 
(He wants help) 
Every day - I try and I try and I try - 
But everybody wants to put me down 
They say I'm goin' crazy 
They say I got a lot of water in my brain 
Got no common sense 
I got nobody left to believe 
Yeah - yeah yeah yeah 
Ooh 
Somebody (somebody) 
Can anybody find me somebody to love? 
(Anybody find me someone to love) 
Got no feel I got no rhythm 
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing) 
I'm OK I'm alright (he's alright) 
I ain't gonna face no defeat 
I just gotta get out of this prison cell 
Some day I'm gonna be free Lord

We never listen enough never face the truth 
Then like a passing song 
Love is here and then it's gone

Round the corner now 
Outside the dawn is breaking 
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free 
The show must go on 
The show must go on, yeah yeah 
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking 
My make - up may be flaking 
But my smile still stays on 
Yeah yeah, whoa wo oh oh 
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies 
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die 
I can fly - my friends 
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on) yeah yeah 
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on) 
I'll face it with a grin 
I'm never giving in 
On - with the show 
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill 
I have to find the will to carry on 
On with the show 
On with the show 
The show - the show must go on 
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on 
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on 
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on 
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on

There must be more to life than this 
How do we cope in a world without love 
Mending all those broken hearts 
And tending to those crying faces 
There must be more to life than living 
A better way for us to survive 
Why should it be just a case of black or white 
There must be more to life than this 
Why is this world so full of hate 
People dying everywhere 
And we destroy what we create 
People fighting for their human rights 
But we just go on saying c'est la vie 
So this is life 
There must be more to life than killing 
A better way for us to survive 
What good is life, in the end we all must die 
There must be more to life than this 
There must be more to life than this 
There must be more than meets the eye 
I live and hope for a world filled with love 
Then we can all just live in peace 
There must be more to life, much more to life 
There must be more to life, more to life than this.</field>

You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong 
You know what's going on 
But it seems to me we've not cared enough 
Or confided in each other at all 
It seems that we've all got our backs 
Against the wall 
Time waits for nobody

We all must plan our hopes together 
Or we'll have no more future at all

I was back in the old days - long ago 
When we were kids when we were young 
Thing seemed so perfect - you know 
The days were endless we were crazy we were young 
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun 
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know 
The rest of my life's been just a show 
Those were the days of our lives 
The bad things in life were so few 
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true 
When I look and I find I still love you 
You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide 
Ain't that a shame 
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride 
When life was just a game 
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did 
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids 
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know 
Better sit back and go with the flow 
Cos these are the days of our lives 
They've flown in the swiftness of time 
These days are all gone now but some things remain 
When I look and I find no change 
Those were the days of our lives - yeah 
The bad things in life were so few 
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true 
When I look and I find 
I still love you

I'll still care, no mater where I'll still be there 
When you make to the other side 
Lord I'm going back, back to the light 
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold 
Back to the light 
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul 
Deep, deep in the night 
When the world fils with tears 
And the wind grows, colder and colder it grows 
And the fire dimes, with the same old fears 
I'll be there, no matter what you're going through 
In the dark I care, I'm holding on, I'm hoping on 
It's still the same old me inside# 
Lord I'm going back, back to the light 
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold 
Back to the light 
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul 
On and on, searching for the clearer view 
Winning and loosing an inner war 
Wondering what we do it for 
Though the road seems never ending 
Hold on to the hope I'm sending through 
No matter where you're going to 
I'll be there 
I'm holding on, believe it 
We'll be walking in the light 
'Cos there'll be no place left to hide 
Back to the light 
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold 
Back to the light 
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul</field>

Uuuhhh 
Barcelona! Barcelona! 
Viva! 
I had this perfect dream 
Un suenyo me envolvió 
This dream was me and you 
Tal vez estás aquí 
I want all the world to see 
Un instinto me guiaba 
A miracle sensation 
My guide and inspiration 
Now my dream is slowly coming true 
Wind is a gentle breeze 
El me habló ti 
The bells are ringing out 
El canto vuela 
They're calling us together 
Guiding us forever 
Wish my dream would never go away 
Barcelona! 
It was the first time that we met 
Barcelona! 
How can I forget 
The moment that you stepped in the room 
You took my breath away 
Barcelona! 
La música vibró 
Barcelona! 
Y ella nos unió 
if god is willing 
We will meet again 
Someday 
Let the songs begin 
Déjalo nacer 
Let the music play 
Ahhhhhhh... 
Make the voices sing 
Nace un gran amor 
Start the celebration 
Ven a mi 
And cry! 
Grita! 
Come alive 
Viva! 
And shake the foundations from the skies 
Shaking all our lives 
Barcelona! 
Such a beautiful horizon 
Barcelona! 
Like a jewel in the sun 
Por ti seré gaviota de tu bella mar 
Barcelona! 
Suenan las campanas 
Barcelona! 
Abre tus puertas al mundo 
If god is willing 
If god is willing 
If god is willing 
Friends to the end 
Viva! 
OOooohh

All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone 
Never dared to take a chance 
Goin' home alone 
But it gets so fucky cold 
When it's late at night 
Leave the foxholes on their own 
Do you sleep well at night? 
Body count, feeling hot 
Body count, keeping warm 
Friends are playing with danger 
They don't know where it's found 
With their casual letters 
It's just another chain 
You've lost the innocence 
That you've never found 
Standing in the DMZ 
Don't get turned around 
(chorus) 
Body count, feeling hot 
Body count, Vietnam 
It's not the game, it's a scar 
And they won't let you wear your khakis 
And your Izods anymore 
You can go get shot to hell 
They don't want you anymore because 
All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone 
Never dare to take a chance 
You're going home alone 
Military metaphors 
Are metaphors no more 
Keeping up with protocol 
You're dancin' off to war 
(repeat chorus) 
Do you sleep well at night? 
Body count, Vietnam 
They can say what they want 
But you have your doubts 
It's not what you've lost 
It's what your without 
When I ran so far 
And they just turned away 
I doesn't bother me by the light of day 
But at night, I hear your call 
Late at night, I hear your call 
I saw the mirror that you broke today 
I saw the ceiling falling down your way 
When they looked at you, you could turn away 
You didn't bother then by the light of day, you'll stay 
But at night, I hear your call 
Late at night, I hear your call 
You said that you could turn away 
I knew that you going to stay 
The walls are falling all around 
They pinned you down onto the ground 
But at night, I hear your call</field>

Come on closer, sweet release

Been sitting here all night 
I'm all alone at the party 
I don't feel all right 
Ain't got no black coat 
Ain't got no tie 
I gotta shape up now 
Come on baby you gotta know why 
Take off!

I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it 
Dancer dancer 
Ain't no doubt about it 
Dancer dancer 
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes 
And come and ride with me? Cool 
You're the life and soul of the funk-tion 
It took me all night 
To get hold of the right introduction 
Blew me out of sight 
I taste your lipstick 
I look in your eyes 
You feel fantastic 
My body cries 
Take off

Can't take you home

You even try to answer my telephone

Hello, John here 
I hope you're having a good time. 
And Jacky, in return for us doing this musical offering for you, 
is after we've finished she's going to come on and do a strip for you. 
Hey, I hope everybody's having a good time (good time good time good time) 
I hope everybody's having a having a good time (good time good time good time) 
Having a good time, yes, before I heard all this nonsense. 
Where's the microphone, which one? Hello it's Brian here. 
Fraid I've lost my voice because I've been bellowing. 
God, I wish someone would shut that bloody guitarist up, it's dreadful. 
Well actually we'd love to be with you, we're sorry we're not with you but we're too busy 
making silly noises and thinking up new chords like this one and having mid life crises and things. 
You see it's all very easy for you but we have a lot of work to do so we're going to play you this song instead. 
It does like this.</field>

Should be waiting for the skies to clear 
There ain't time in all the world

If you're searching out for something 
Don't try so hard 
If you're feeling kinda nothing 
Don't try so hard 
When your problems seem like mountains 
You feel the need to find some answers 
You can leave it for another day 
Don't try so hard 
But if you fall and take a tumble it won't be far 
If you fail you mustn't grumble 
Thank your lucky stars 
Just savour every mouthful 
And treasure every moment 
When the storms are raging round you 
Stay right where you are 
Oh don't try so hard 
Oh don't take it all to heart 
It's only fools they make these rules 
Don't try so hard 
One day you'll be a sergeant major 
Oh you'll be so proud 
Screaming out your bloody orders 
Hey but not too loud 
Polish all your shiny buttons 
Dress as lamb instead of mutton 
But you never had to try to stand out from the crowd 
Oh what a beautiful world 
This is the life for me 
Oh what a beautiful world 
It's the simple life for me 
Oh don't try so hard 
Oh don't take it all to heart 
It's only fools - they make these rules 
Don't try so hard

We burn and now I'm at your feet 
High speed,but you know you're in safe hands 
In the dark we make a brighter light 
From one spark to the horizon wide 
We trust and together we tame the land - yeah 
You'd be forgiven if you think you're dreaming 
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true 
- yeah 
Everything I do is driven by you 
Oh - come on babe 
Oh well it's tough to make a journey through 
The right stuff is dead ahead of you and me 
And you know we've still got time 
Hold on tight to the driving wheel 
This ride is really out of line 
Raw deal, but there's no other that's worth a dime 
You know I love you but you drive me crazy 
'Cos you're saying all the things I want to say to you 
You say 
Everything I do is driven by you 
Everything we do (4x) 
Everything we do is driven by you 
Inner children lost their way 
Now they know the price you pay 
I'm holding on to life with you 
'Cos life without you just won't do 
Driven by you 
You know I'm never going to know who's dreaming 
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true 
- yeah 
Everything I do is driven by you 
Everything we do (8x) 
Everything we do is driven by 
Driven by 
Driven by you</field>

It's the sad eyed goodbye 
Yesterday's moments I remember 
It's the bleak street,week kneed partings I recall 
It's the mistier mists the hazier days 
The brighter sun and the easier lays 
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying 
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all 
It's the fantastic drowse 
Of the afternoon Sundays 
That bored you to rages of tears 
The unending pleadings 
To waste all your good times 
In thoughts of your middle-aged years 
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told 
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero 
And there's all the more reason 
For living or dying when you're young 
And your troubles are all very small 
Out here on the street we'd gather and meet 
And scuff up the sidewalk 
With endlessly restless feet 
Half on the time we'd broaden our minds 
More in the pool hall 
Than we did in the school hall 
With the down town chewing gum bums 
Watching the night life the lights and the fun 
Never wanted to be the boy next door 
Always thought I'd be something more 
But it ain't easy for a small town boy 
It ain't easy at all 
Thinkin' it right and doin' it wrong 
It's easier from an arm chair 
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness 
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess 
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood 
Jimi Hendrix he was good 
Let's try William the Conqueror</field>

I might be at a table 
And suddenly I'll catch 
A fleeting vision of her crystal seas 
Or I might be standing in a crowded dockyard faraway 
Underneath the sun I've never seen 
'Cos I have seen many worlds 
For what it's worth 
But I'll never see again the planet earth 
My earth 
I might be chasing waves of light 
Out towards the rim 
Where stars are sparse 
And the cold of space seeps in 
But I might be in a bar room 
Drinking methylated gin 
And thinking of the places I have been 
Yes I have seen many worlds 
For what it's worth 
But I'll never see again the planet earth 
My earth 
I have seen many worlds 
For what it's worth 
But I'll never see again the planet earth 
My earth 
Cast adrift amongst the stars 
I float from sun to sun 
Dreaming of the world that gave me birth 
All the places I have been 
Remind me there is none 
To match the green living hills of earth 
'Cos I have seen many worlds 
For what it's worth 
But I'll never see again the planet earth</field>

Dislocate your spine if you don't sign 
He says I'll have you seeing double 
Mesmerize you when he's tongue tied 
Simply with those eyes ooh 
Synchronize your minds and see 
The beast within him rise 
Don't look back don't look back 
It's a rip off 
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby 
Blow him a kiss and you're mad 
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out 
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head 
He's taken an arm and taken a leg 
All this time honey baby you've been had 
Intoxicate your brain with what I'm sayin' 
If not you'll lie in knee deep trouble 
Prostitute yourself he says 
Castrate your human pride ooh 
Sacrifice your leisure days 
Let me squeeze you 'till you've dried 
Don't look back don't look back 
It's a rip off 
Work my fingers to my bones 
I scream with pain I still make no impression 
Seduce you with his money make machine 
Cross collateralise big time money money 
Reduce you to a muzak fake machine 
Then the last goodbye 
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby 
Blow him a kiss and you're mad 
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out 
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head 
He's taken an arm and taken a leg</field>

Foxy lady, you really are the greatest show in town 
You want to play 
You wanna eat your cake and have it your way

Fooling around, you just keep fooling around with me. 
Walking down the street, people watching closely 
Such a tease, you can turn on any man you want 
You masquerade 
You are the catch of the season every night and day 
You, you, you don't have any time for me 
You just keep fooling around with me 
Fooling around - everywhere I go you are the only, 
Only, only sexy lady 
Fooling around, all you do is keep me hanging around 
You are really so hard to please 
You've gotta really watch that, baby! 
You just, you just, fooling around with me 
You just, you just, fooling around with me 
You keep fooling, you keep fooling 
Fooling... 
Want to play, but you always want it all your own way 
You got it easy, but you don't give a damn

Funny how love is everywhere just look and see 
Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be 
Funny how love is every song in every key 
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea 
Funny funny funny oh 
Funny how love is the end of the lies 
When the truth begins tomorrow comes 
Tomorrow brings tomorrow brings love 
In the shape of things 
That's what love is that's what love is 
Funny how love can break your heart so suddenly 
Funny how love came tumbling down with Adam and Eve 
Funny how love is running wild feeling free 
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea 
Funny funny funny oh 
From the earth below to the heavens above 
That's how far and funny is love 
At any time anywhere 
If you gotta make love do it everywhere 
That's what love is that's what love is 
Funny how love is everywhere just look and see 
Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be 
Funny how love is every song in every key 
Funny how love is when you gotta hurry 
'Cause you're late for tea 
Funny funny funny oh 
Tommorrow comes tomorrow brings 
Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things 
At any time anywhere 
If you gotta make love do it everywhere 
That's what love is that's what love is</field>

Gimme the prize just gimme the prize 
Give me your kings let me squeeze then in my hands 
Your puny princes

I'll eat them whole before I'm done

I think I'm going back 
To the things I learnt so well in my youth 
I think I'm returning to 
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth 
Now there are no games 
To only pass the time 
No more colouring books 
No Christmas bells to chime 
But thinking young and growing older is no sin 
And I can't play the game of life to win 
I can recall a time 
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend 
And now I think I've got 
A lot more than just my toys to lend 
Now there's more to do 
Than watch my sailboat glide 
And every day can be 
My magic carpet ride 
And I can play hide and seek with my fears 
And live my days instead of counting my years 
Then everyone debates 
The true reality 
I'd rather see the world 
The way it used to be 
A little bit of freedom's all we lack 
So catch me if you can</field>

Take good care of what you've got 
My father said to me 
As he puffed his pipe and baby B 
He dandled on his knee 
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away 
Keep all good company oohoo oohoo 
Take care of those you call your own and keep good 
company 
Soon I grew and happy too 
My very good friends and me 
We'd play all day with Sally J 
The girl from number four 
And very soon I begged her 
Won't you keep me company? 
Oohoo oohoo oohoo oohoo 
Come marry me for evermore 
We'll be good company 
Now marriage is an institution sure 
My wife and I our needs and nothing more 
All my friends by a year by and by disappeared 
But we're safe enough behind our door 
I flourished in my humble trade my reputation grew 
The work devoured my waking hours but when my time 
was through 
Reward of all my efforts 
My own Limited Company 
I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company 
All through the years in the end it appears 
There was never really anyone but me 
Now I'm old I puff my pipe but no one's there to see 
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity 
Take care of those you call your own</field>

Great King Rat died today 
Born on the twenty first of May 
Died syphilis forty four on his birthday 
Every second word he swore 
Yes he was the son of a whore 
Always wanted by the law 
Wouldn't you like to know? 
Wouldn't you like to know people? 
Great King Rat was a dirty old man 
And a dirty old man was he 
Now what did I tell you 
Would you like to see? 
Now hear 
Where will I be tomorrow? 
Will I beg will I borrow? 
I don't care I don't care anyway 
Come on come on the time is right 
This man is evil and that is right 
I told you ah yes I told you 
And that's no lie oh no no no 
Wouldn't you like to know? 
Wouldn't you like to know? 
Wouldn't you like to know? 
Great King Rat was a dirty old man 
And a dirty old man was he 
How what did I tell you? 
Would you like to see? 
Show me 
Wouldn't you like to know? 
Wouldn't you like to know people? 
Great King Rat was a dirty old man 
And a dirty old man was he 
Now what did I tell you 
Would you like to see? 
Now listen all you people 
Put out the good and keep the bad 
Don't believe all you read in the Bible 
You sinners get in line 
Saints you leave far behind 
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple 
Don't listen to what mama says 
Not a word not a word mama says 
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival 
The great Lord before he died 
Knelt sinners by his side 
And said you're going to realise tomorrow 
No I'm not gonna tell you 
What you already know 
'Cause time and time again 
The old man said it all a long time ago 
Come come on the time is right 
This evil man will fight 
I told you once before 
Wouldn't you like to know? 
Wouldn't you like to know? 
Just like I said before 
Great King Rat was a dirty old man 
And a dirty old man was he 
The last time I tell you 
Would you like you see?</field>

Don't let go don't lose your mystique 
Wait a little longer 
Tomorrow brings another feast 
Don't let go don't lose your reputation 
Thank God you're still alive 
You're still in one piece 
Hang on in there don't lose your appetite 
Hang on in there forget the danger signs 
Pray for that magical moment (straight ahead) and it will 
appear 
Don't fight for lost emotions 
Wait for the sunrise 
And everything will seem so clear 
(Look straight ahead look straight ahead) 
Hang on in there (hang on in there) 
Hang on in there (hang on in there) 
Your wish will be granted 
All your problems will disappear 
Don't be a fool you haven't reached your peak 
You got a fast car racing up inside you 
Your life is incomplete 
Hang on in there hang on in there 
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear 
(Wait for that moment) 
Wait for the sunrise 
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear 
Let's go let's go 
OK now do the change now 
Yeah hang on in there 
Hang on in there</field>

            <field name="lyrics">And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal 
And you're rushing headlong out of control 
And you think you're so strong 
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin' 
You can do about it 
There's nothin' you can do 
No there's nothin' you can do about it 
No there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can 
Nothin' you can do about it 
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal 
And you're rushing headlong out of control 
And you think you're so strong 
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin' 
You can do about it 
He used to be a man with a stick in his hand 
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do 
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand 
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do 
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag 
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag 
You're gettin' in a fight 
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night 
Let me out of this cheap `B' movie 
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing 
Headlong out of control 
And you think you're so strong 
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin' 
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can 
Nothin' you can do about it 
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady 
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do 
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy 
They start freaking everyway you turn 
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned 
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right 
Cause reason's out the window 
Better hold on tight - you're rushin'..

Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day 
Just minding my business thinking my thoughts 
Nothing much to say 
When suddenly I got hit 
Imagine my suprise 
Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes 
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile 
I'd never seen anything that came within miles 
My heart got hijacked by you 
Stuck in the traffic 
Stuck at the lights what do I see 
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me 
She takes off 
Imagine my disgust 
Like a bat out of hell 
I get to eat her dust 
I never had known anything to compare with her laugh 
I'd never known anything that counted by half 
My heart got hijacked by you 
Hijack my heart 
Hijack my heart 
Steals my heart 
Hijack my heart 
Hijack my heart 
Look at the cities 
Look at the streets what do you see 
Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be 
Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose 
It comes out of nowhere 
Right out of the blue 
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile 
I'd never seen anything that came within miles 
My heart got hijacked by you 
Hijack my heart 
Now you really got a hold on me 
You hijacked my heart 
Don't you know you won't let me be 
Stole my heart 
Threw away the key 
Oooee baby what's become of me 
You hijacked my heart 
Now you really got a hold on me 
Hijack my heart</field>

When all the salt is taken from the sea

I'm naked and I bleed 
But when your finger points so savagely 
Is anybody there to believe in me? 
To hear my plea and take care of me? 
How can I go on 
From day to day 
Who can make me strong in every way 
Where can I be safe 
Where can I belong 
In this great big world of sadness 
How can I forget 
Those beautiful dreams that we shared 
They're lost and they're no where to be found 
How can I go on? 
Sometimes I start to tremble in the dark 
I cannot see 
When people frighten me 
I try to hide myself so far from the crowd 
Is anybody there to comfort me 
Precious Lord.. 
Hear my plea and take care of me 
How can I go on 
From day to day 
Who can make me strong in every way 
Where can I be safe 
Where can I belong 
In this great big world of sadness 
How can I forget 
Those beautiful dreams that we shared 
They're lost and no where to be found

The sound of the city baby

Sweet sweet music 
Whenever you touch me baby 
Whenever you're near 
Loving you 
It keeps me satisfied 
And I can't explain, oh no 
The way I'm feeling inside 
You look at me we kiss and then 
I close my eyes and here it comes again 
I can hear music

I can't live with you 
But I can't live without you 
I can't let you stay 
Ooh but I can't live if you go away 
I don't know just how it goes 
All I know is I can't live with you 
Yeah I'm having a hard time 
I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair 
You may think that I don't care 
But I travelled a long road to get hold of my sorrow 
I tried to catch a dream 
But nothing's what it seems 
Love is saying baby it's all right 
When deep inside you're really petrified 
Lover turns to hater 
On this escalator 
I can't live with you - yeah 
But I can't live without you 
I can't breathe if you stay 
But I can't bear you to go away 
I don't know what time it is 
All I know is I can't live with you 
We're stuck in a bad place 
We're trapped in a rat race 
And we can't escape 
Maybe there's been some mistake 
We're trying to make a high score 
We're walking through a closed door 
And nobody's winning 
We're just sinning against ourselves 
Hold on baby tell me it's all right 
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside 
Passions screaming hotter 
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah 
I can't live with you I can't live with you 
I can't live I can't live 
I can't I can't live with you 
But baby I'll never ever leave you 
I can't live with you 
But I can't live without you 
Cause I'm in love with you 
Ooh and everything about you 
I can't live with you 
No I just can't live I just can't live 
I can't live with you 
Yeah and I can't live without you 
Through the madness through the tears 
We've still got each other 
For a million years - yeah 
Ooh yeah 
Yeah - I can't live without you - yeah yeah 
I can't live without you 
Yeah yeah oh oh oh 
I can't live without you 
I can't live without you 
I can't live without you 
Oh oh I can't live without you baby baby baby

I took my baby dancing - to see a heavy band 
But I never saw my baby 'til the encore 
She had the singer by the hand 
I didn't wanna cry cos I had to be cool 
I didn't wanna tell you that you're much too cruel 
Did you have to run off with that doggone fool... 
All I gotta do is think about you 
Every night and day I go crazy 
All I gotta do is get my hands on you 
You better stay away from me baby... 
I wouldn't mind the postman - if the neighbours didn't know 
Or the gas man,electric man,man to fix the car 
I'd have to let it go 
But you had to bring me down for a rock'n'roll clone 
Leave me like a sucker standing all alone 
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone? 
Go ahead fool 
All I gotta do is think about you 
Every night and day I go crazy 
All I gotta do is get my hands on you 
You better stay away from me baby. 
So I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more 
I don't wanna go and see Queen no more no more 
I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more 
I don't wanna go and see Queen no more no more 
Now I don't wanna hurt you - like you been a-hurting me 
But you know I'll be watchin' 
Rolling on the floor next time you're on TV 
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at 
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoilt brat 
To think I nearly let you get away with all that 
No way man 
All I gotta do is think about you 
Every night and day I go crazy 
All I gotta do is get my hands on you 
You better stay away from me baby. 
Ooh you'd better stay away from me baby 
Baby baby crazy crazy crazy crazy...</field>

When the outside temperature rises 
And the meaning is oh so clear 
One thousand and one yellow daffodils 
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear 
Are they trying to tell you something 
You're missing that one final screw 
You're simply not in the pink my dear 
To be honest you haven't got a clue 
I'm going slightly mad 
I'm going slightly mad 
It finally happened - happened 
It finally happened - ooh oh 
It finally happened 
I'm slightly mad 
Oh dear 
I'm one card short of a full deck 
I'm not quite the shilling 
One wave short of a shipwreck 
I'm not my usual top billing 
I'm coming down with a fever 
I'm really out to sea 
This kettle is boiling over 
I think I'm a banana tree 
Oh dear 
I'm going slightly mad 
I'm going slightly mad 
It finally happened - happened 
It finally happened - uh huh 
It finally happened 
I'm slightly mad 
Oh dear 
Ooh ooh ah ah 
Ooh ooh ah ah 
I'm knitting with only one needle 
Unravelling fast it's true 
I'm driving only three wheels these days 
But my dear how about you 
I'm going slightly mad 
I'm going slightly mad 
It finally happened 
It finally happened - oh yes 
It finally happened 
I'm slightly mad 
Just very slightly mad</field>

Keep your chin up when you're feelin' lonely 
Don't let them get you down 
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone 
Hangin' around for someone to call 
Ooh they won't come knocking at all 
Don't run and hide 
Even if it hurts you inside 
So I said 
Give as good as you get 
If you can't beat 'em,join 'em 
You'd better do it 
'Cause it makes you feel good 
If you can't beat 'em,join 'em 
You're never gonna help yourself 
Come on 
Get up 
You're feelin' good 
Keep your fingers off my money 
Don't try and pull me down 
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me 
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around 
Invite me to your little contract Ha! Ha! 
Rumour has it that you could play dirty 
I'll tell you what I'll do about that 
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah! 
If you can't beat 'em,join 'em 
You'd better do it 
'Cause it makes you feel good 
If you can't beat 'em,join 'em 
You're never gonna help yourself 
If you can't beat 'em,join 'em

We never listen enough never face the truth 
Then like a passing song 
Love is here and then it's gone

Monday the start of my holiday 
Freedom for just one week 
Feels good to get away ooh 
Tuesday I saw her down on the beach 
I stood and watched a while 
And she looked and smiled at me 
Wednesday I didn't see her 
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow 
And then on Thursday 
My luck had changed 
She stood there all alone 
I went and asked her name 
I never thought that this could happen to me 
In only seven days 
It would take a hundred or more 
For memories to fade 
I wish Friday would last for ever 
I held her close to me 
I couldn't bear to leave her there 
Saturday just twenty four hours 
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday</field>

Oh how wrong can you be? 
Oh to fall in love 
Was my very first mistake 
How was I to know 
I was far too much in love too see? 
Oh jealousy look at me now 
Jealousy you got me somehow 
You gave me no warning 
Took me by surprise 
Jealousy you led me on 
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail 
You had suspicion on my trail 
How how how all my jealousy 
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride 
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy 
Oh how strong can you be 
With matters of the heart? 
Life is much too short 
To while away with tears 
If only you could see 
Just what you do to me 
Oh jealousy you tripped me up 
Jealousy you brought me down 
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain 
Jealousy when will you let go? 
Gotta hold of my possessive mind 
Turned me into a jealous guy 
How how how all my jealousy 
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride 
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy 
But now it matters not 
If I should live or die</field>

And then I saw Him in the crowd 
A lot of people had gathered round Him 
The beggars shouted the lepers called Him 
The old man said nothing 
He just stared about him 
All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
All going down 
Then came a man before His feet he fell 
Unclean said the leper and rang his bell 
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head 
Go now go now you're a new man instead 
All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
All going down 
It all began with the three wise men 
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem 
And made it heard throughout the land 
Born was a leader of man 
All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
All going down to see the Lord Jesus

This is the only life for me 
Surround myself around my own fantasy 
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself 
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need 
Love is all you need 
Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world 
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure? 
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night 
You think it's all been a waste of time 
It's been a bad year 
You start believing ev'rything's gonna be alright 
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back 
A brand new day is beginning 
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way 
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
Do you know how it feels when you don't have a friend 
Without a job and no money to spend? 
You're a stranger 
All you think about is suicide 
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight 
You'd better keep out of danger - yeah! 
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside 
Keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end 
Oh get yourself together 
Things are looking better everyday 
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
This is the only life for me 
Surround myself around my own fantasy 
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself 
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need 
Love is all you need 
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself 
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need - yeah 
Love is all you need 
Baby - love is all you need 
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows</field>

I was told a million times 
Of all the troubles in my way 
Tried to grow a little wiser 
Little better ev'ry day 
But if I crossed a million rivers 
And I rode a million miles 
Then I'd still be where I started 
Bread and butter for a smile 
Well I sold a million mirrors 
In a shop in Alley Way 
But I never saw my face 
In any window any day 
Well they say your folks are telling you 
To be a superstar 
But I tell you just be satisfied 
To stay right where you are 
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive 
It'll take you all your time and a money 
Honey you'll survive 
Well I've loved a million women 
In a belladonic haze 
And I ate a million dinners 
Brought to me on silver trays 
Give me ev'rything I need 
To feed my body and my soul 
And I'll grow a little bigger 
Maybe that can be my goal 
I was told a million times 
Of all the people in my way 
How I had to keep on trying 
And get better ev'ry day 
But if I crossed a million rivers 
And I rode a million miles 
Then I'd still be where I started 
Same as when I started 
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive 
It'll take you all your time and a money 
Honey you'll survive 
Keep yourself alive 
Keep yourself alive 
It'll take you all your time and a money 
To keep me satisfied 
Do you think you're better ev'ry day? 
No I think I'm two steps nearer to my grave 
Keep yourself alive 
Keep yourself alive mm 
You take your time and take more money 
Keep yourself alive 
Keep yourself alive 
Keep yourself alive 
All you people keep yourself alive 
Keep yourself alive 
Keep yourself alive 
It'll take you all your time and money 
To keep me satisfied 
Keep yourself alive 
Keep yourself alive 
All you people keep yourself alive 
Take you all your time and money 
Honey you'll survive 
Keep you satisfied 
Keep you satisfied</field>

Who said that my party was all over 
Huh huh I'm in pretty good shape 
The best years of my life are like a supernova 
Huh huh perpetual craze I said that 
Everybody drank my wine - you get my drift 
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's ship - well 
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy 
We was bad we was blitzed 
All in all it was a pretty good trip 
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head 
Wanted to get me I said go away 
I said kiss my ass honey 
He pulled out a gun wanted to arrest me 
I said uh uh uh babe 
Now listen no-one stops my party 
No-one stops my party 
No-one no-one no-one stops my party 
Just like I said 
We were phased we was pissed 
Just having a total eclipse 
That's good 
This one's on me so let us do it just right 
This here one party don't get started 'till midnight 
Everybody party to the left - party to the right 
????? do it all night alright alright 
Should I lay my hands on you all right (???????????) 
Left - right</field>

            <field name="lyrics">She keeps Möet et Chandon 
in her pretty cabinet 
'Let them eat cake' she says 
Just like Marie Antoinette 
A built-in remedy 
for Khrushchev and Kennedy 
And anytime an invitation 
you can't decline 
Caviar and cigarettes 
well versed in etiquette 
Extraordinarily nice 
She's a killer queen 
gunpowder gelatine 
Dynamite with a laser beam 
Guaranteed to blow your mind 
Anytime. 
Recommended at the price 
Insatiable an appetite 
wanna try? 
To avoid complications 
She never kept the same address 
In conversation 
she spoke just like a baroness 
Met a man from China 
went down to Geisha Minah 
Then again incidentally 
if you're that way inclined (she's a 
killer queen) 
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally) 
For cars she couldn't care less 
Fastidious and precise 
She's a killer queen 
gunpowder gelatine 
Dynamite with a laser beam 
Guaranteed to blow your mind 
Anytime 
Drop of a hat she's as willing as 
playful as a pussy cat 
Then momentarily out of action 
Temporarily out of gas 
To absolutely drive you wild, wild... 
She's all out to get you 
She's a killer queen 
gunpowder gelatine 
Dynamite with a laser beam 
Guaranteed to blow your mind 
Anytime

And all for fear and all for greed 
Speak any tongue 
But for God's sake we need

Let me hear the words of love 
Despacito mi amor 
Let me know this night and evermore 
This room is bare 
This night is cold 
We're far apart and I'm growing old 
But while we live 
We'll meet again 
So then my love 
We may whisper once more 
It's you I adore

Tuesday I go off to honeymoon 
I'll be back again before it's time for sunnydown 
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon 
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening 
Thursday I go waltzing to the Zoo 
I come from London town 
I'm just an ordinary guy 
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre 
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night 
There he goes again 
I'll be lazing on a Sunday lazing on a Sunday 
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon</field>

And I breath the air 
And I slam the door 
And I'm on my way 
I won't lay no blame 
I won't call you names 
'Cause I've made my break 
And I won't look back 
I've turned my back 
On those endless games 
I'm all through with ties 
I'm all tired of tears 
I'm a happy man 
Don't it look that way 
Shakin' dust from my shoes 
There's a road ahead 
And there's no way back home (no way back home) 
Oh but I have to say 
Leavin' home ain't easy 
Oh I never thought it would be easy 
Leavin' on your own 
Oh is the main thing calling me back 
Leavin' home ain't easy 
On the one you're leavin' home 
Stay my love my love please stay 
Stray my love what's wrong my love? 
What's right my love? 
Oh leavin' home ain't easy 
I thought how could I think of leavin' 
Leavin' on your own 
Still tryin' to persuade me that 
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way 
Leavin' home ain't easy 
But may be the only way</field>

Why don't you take another little piece of my heart 
Why don't you take it and break it 
And tear it all apart 
All I do is give 
All you do is take 
Baby why don't you give me 
A brand new start 
So let me live (so let me live) 
Let me live (leave me alone) 
Let me live, oh baby 
And make a brand new start 
Why don't you take another little piece of my soul 
Why don't you shape it and shake it 'till you're really in control 
All you do is take 
And all I do is give 
All that I'm askin' 
Is a chance to live 
(So let me live) - so let me live 
(Leave me alone) - let me live, let me live 
Why don't you let me make a brand new start 
And it's a long hard struggle 
But you can always depend on me 
And if you're ever in trouble - hey 
You know where I will be 
Why don't you take another little piece of my life 
Why don't you twist it, and turn it 
And cut it like a knife 
All I do is live 
All I do is die 
Why can't we just be friends 
Stop livin' a lie 
So let me live (so let me live) 
Let me live (leave me alone) 
Please let me live 
(Why don't you live a little) 
Oh yeah baby 
(Why don't you give a little love...?) 
Let me live 
Please let me live 
Oh yeah baby, let me live 
And make a brand new start 
Take another little piece of my heart now baby 
Take another little piece of my heart now baby 
Take another little piece of my soul now baby 
Take another little piece of my life now baby 
In your heart, oh baby

Serpent of the Nile relieve me for a while 
And cast me from your spell and let me go

Every night I'm tossed 
And I shake my fevered brow 
Thinking of my lost opportunity 
Yes every morning I face the sun 
I get so positive with everyone 
Every afternoon you'll find the cracks showing through 
They know what I'm going through 
Oh yes they do 
Every evening finds me

You always had the upper hand 
Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand 
You had to go and ruin all our plans 
Packed your bags and you're leaving home 
Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go 
But we have one more day together, so 
Love me like there's no tomorrow 
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it 
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over 
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow 
I guess we drift alone in separate ways 
I don't have all that far to go 
God knows I learnt to play the lonely man 
I've never felt so low in all my life 
We were born to be just losers 
So I guess there's a limit on how far we go 
But we only have one more day together so 
Love me like there's no tomorrow 
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it 
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over 
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow 
Tomorrow god knows just where I'll be 
Tomorrow who knows just what's in store for me 
Anything can happen but we only have one more day together, 
yeah 
Just one more day forever, so 
Love me like there's no tomorrow 
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it 
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over 
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow</field>

You'll remember when this is blown over, 
And everything's all by the way

How I still love you, I still love you...

Been here before a long time ago 
But this time I wear no sandals 
Ages past I gave all you people 
Food and water 
Three feet tall so very small I'm no trouble 
I bring thunder lightning sun and the rain 
For all the people in the land 
A message of love 
I bring you from up above 
All good children gather around 
Come join your hands and sing along 
They call me mad the swine 
I guess I'm mad the swine 
I've come to save you save you 
Mad the swine 
Mad the swine 
So all you people gather around 
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord 
I woke up on the water just as before 
I'll help the meek and the mild and believers and the blind 
And all the creatures great and small 
Let me take you to the river without a ford 
Oh and then one day you realise 
You're all the same we've been in life 
All I've come to say just like before 
They call me mad the swine 
I'm mad the swine 
I've come to save you save you 
Mad the swine 
Mad the swine 
So all you people gather around 
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord 
Ooh 
Oh now 
So all you people gather around 
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord 
Don't ever fail me 
Mad the swine 
Mad the swine 
I've come to save you save you 
Oh now 
Mad the swine 
Mad the swine 
So all you people gather around 
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord 
Hands and praise the Lord 
Praise the Lord 
I'll get down on my knees and praise the Lord</field>

Looking to find my goal 
Taking all this misery 
But giving it all my soul

Go crazy driving is the fast lane

She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely 
So come home come home 
If you don't you're gonna break my heart 
Man on the prowl 
You'd better watch out 
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble 
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah) 
I'm a man on the prowl 
I don't wanna be a rock'n'roll steady 
I just wanna be low down trash 
I wanna go to the movies 
All I wanna do is sit on my ass 
So honey come home (come home come home) 
Don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely 
Come home (yeah yeah) - come home (yeah yeah)

Do you mean it do you mean it do you mean it 
Why don't you mean it why do I follow you 
And where do you go? 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 
You've never seen nothing like it 
No never in your life 
Like going up to heaven 
And then coming back alive 
Let me tell you all about it 
Oooh give me a little time to choose 
Water babies singing in a lily pool delight 
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night 
Here comes the Black Queen poking in the pile 
Fi fo the Black Queen marching single file 
Take this take that bring them down to size 
March to the Black Queen 
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys 
Little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a-baby oil 
Black on black on every finger nail and toe 
We've only begun - begun 
Make this make that keep making all that noise 
Ooh march to the Black Queen 
Now I've got a belly full 
You can be my sugar baby 
You can be my honey chile 
A voice from behind me reminds me 
Spread out your wings you are an angel 
Remember to deliver with the speed of light 
A little bit of love and joy 
Everything you do bears a will 
And a why and a wherefore 
A little bit of love and joy 
In each and every soul lies a man 
And very soon he'll deceive and discover 
But even to the end of his life 
He'll bring a little love 
Ah ah ah ah ah 
I reign with my left hand I rule with my right 
I'm lord of all darkness I'm queen of the night 
I've got the power now to do 
The march of the Black Queen 
My life is in your hands I'll fo and I'll fie 
I'll be what you make me I'll do what you like 
I'll be a bad boy I'll be your bad boy 
I'll do the march of the Black Queen 
Ah ah ah ah ah 
Walking true to style she's vulgar abuse and vile 
The Black Queen tattoos all her pies 
She boils and she bakes 
And she never dots her I's 
La la la la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la 
Forget your sing a-longs and your lullabies 
Surrender to the city of the fireflies 
Dance to the devil in beat with the band 
To hell with all of you hand in hand 
But now it's time to be gone 
La la la la forever forever 
Ah ah ah ah ah</field>

Shoot me out of sight

There's only one bullet

Got to time it right 
Fire me through the night 
Come on take a shot 
Fire me higher

More no more of that jazz 
Give me no more

Only football gives us thrills 
Rock'n'roll just pays the bills 
Only our team is the real team 
Bring out the dogs get on your feet 
Lay on the floor

I don't need the passion too 
I don't want a stormy affair 
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere 
All I want is the comfort and care 
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet - 
Mother Love 
I've walked too long in this lonely lane 
I've had enough of this same old game 
I'm a man of the world and the say that I'm strong 
But me heart is heavy, and my hope is gone 
Out in the city, in the cold world outside 
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide 
Mama please, let me back inside 
I don't want to make no waves 
But you can give me all the love that I crave 
I can't take it if you see me cry 
I long for peace before I die 
All I want is to know that you're there 
You're gonna give me all that sweet - 
Mother Love 
Me body's aching, but I can't sleep 
My dreams are all the company I keep 
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down

In the land where horses born with eagle wings 
And honey bees have lost their stings 
There's singing forever 
Lions den with fallow deer 
And rivers made from wines so clear 
Flow on and on forever 
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air 
And baby lambs where Samson dares 
To go on on on on on on 
My fairy king can see things 
He rules the air and turns the tides 
That are not there for you and me 
Ooh yeah he guides the winds 
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong 
Then came man to savage in the night 
To run like thieves and to kill like knives 
To take away the power from the magic hand 
To bring about the ruin of the promised land 
They turn the milk into sour 
Like the blue in the blood of my veins 
Why can't you see it 
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming rain 
Son of heaven set me free and let me go 
Sea turn dry no salt from sand 
Seasons fly no helping hand 
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes 
Someone someone just drained the colour from my wings 
Broken my fairy circle ring 
And shamed the king in all his pride 
Changed the wings and wronged the tides

I cannot run 
I cannot hide</field>

Another party's over 
And I'm left cold sober 
My baby left me for somebody new 
I don't wanna talk about it 
Want to forget about it 
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew 
So come and get me 
Let me 
Get in that sinking feeling 
That says my heart is on an all time low - So 
Don't expect me 
To behave perfectly 
And wear that sunny smile 
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast 
Don't try and stop me 
'Cos I'm heading for that stormy weather soon 
I'm causing a mild sensation 
With this new occupation 
I'm permanently glued 
To this extraordinary mood so now move over 
Let me take over 
With my melancholy blues 
I'm causing a mild sensation 
With this new occupation 
I'm in the news 
I'm just getting used to my new exposure 
So come into my enclosure 
And meet my

There's no living in my life anymore 
The seas have gone dry 
And the rain's stopped falling 
Please don't you cry any more 
Can't you see 
Listen to the breeze 
Whisper to me please 
Don't send me to the path of nevermore 
Even the valley's below 
Where the rays of the sun 
Were so warm and tender 
Now haven't anything to grow 
Can't you see? 
Why did you have to leave me? (nevermore) 
Why did you deceive me? (nevermore) 
You sent me to the path of nevermore 
When you say you didn't love me anymore 
Ah ah nevermore nevermore</field>

Had a drink and I got uptight 
I fell over 
When the sun comes in inside 
When the tide comes in I'm alive 
I'm all over 
So move over 
Here I come New York 
New York, you're gaining on me 
New York, you're just that one step far away 
But I'm here to stay 
New York, you're (stop) gaining on me 
New York, you're just that one step far away 
But I'm here to stay 
You can't catch me New York</field>

            <field name="lyrics">A hand above the water 
An angel reaching for the sky 
Is it raining in heaven - 
Do you want us to cry? 
And everywhere the broken-hearted 
On every lonely avenue 
No-one could reach them 
No-one but you 
One by one 
Only the Good die young 
They're only flying too close to the sun 
And life goes on - 
Without you... 
Another Tricky Situation 
I get the drowin' in the Blues 
And I find myself thinkin' 
Well - what would you do? 
Yes! - it was such an operation 
Forever paying every due 
Hell, you made a sensation 
You found a way through - and 
One by one 
Only the Good die young 
They're only flyin' too close to the sun 
We'll remember - 
Forever... 
And now the party must be over 
I guess we'll never understand 
The sense of your leaving 
Was in the way it was planned? 
And so we grace another table 
And raise our glasses one more time 
There's a face at the window 
And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye... 
One by one 
Only the Good die young 
They're only flyin' too close to the sun 
Cryin' for nothing 
Cryin' for no-one</field>

Now I'm here (now I'm here..) 
Now I'm there (now I'm there..) 
I'm just a just a new man 
Yes you made me live again 
A baby I was when you took my hand 
And the light of the night burned bright 
And the people all stared didn't understand 
But you knew my name on sight 
Whatever came of you and me? 
America's new bride to be 
Don't worry baby I'm safe and sound 
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me 
Don't I love her so? 
Yes she made me live again Yeah! 
A thin moon me in the smoke screen sky 
Where the beams of your love light chase 
Don't move don't speak don't feel no pain 
With the rain running down my face 
Your matches still light up the sky 
And many a tear lives on in my eye 
Down in the city just Hoople and me 
Don't I love him so don't I love him so? 
Whatever comes of you and me 
I love to leave my memories with you 
Now I'm here (now I'm here.) 
Think I'll stay around around around 
(Around around around around..) 
Down in the city just you and me 
(Down in the city just you and me..) 
Don't I love you so?

Now once upon a time 
An old man told me a fable 
When the piper is gone 
And the soup is cold on the table 
And if the black crow flies 
To find a new destination 
That is the sign 
Come tonight 
Come to the ogre site 
Come to the ogre battle fight 
He gives a great big cry 
And he can swallow up the ocean 
With a mighty tongue he catches flies 
And the palm of his hand incredible size 
One great big eye has to focus in your direction 
Now the battle is on 
Yeah yeah yeah! 
Come tonight 
Come to the ogre site 
Come to the ogre battle fight 
Ah ah ah ah ah 
The ogre men are still inside 
The two way mirror mountain 
You gotta keep down 
Right out of sight 
You can't see in but they can see out 
Keep a look out 
The ogre men are coming out 
From the two way mirror mountain 
They're running up behind 
And they're coming all about 
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south 
Ogre men are coming home 
The great big fight is over 
Bugle blow let trumpet cry 
Ogre battle lives for ever more 
You can come along 
You can come along</field>

One sentimental moment in your arms 
Is like a shooting star right through my heart

I'm a prisoner of love inside you - 
I'm falling apart all around you - yeah 
My heart cries out to your heart 
I'm lonely but you can save me 
My hand reaches out for your hand 
I'm cold but you light the fire in me 
My lips search for your lips 
I'm hungry for your touch 
There's so much left unspoken 
And all I can do is surrender 
To the moment just surrender 
And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much 
(Oooh yes it hurts) 
And pain is so close to pleasure 
And all I can do is surrender to your love 
Just surrender to your love 
Just one year of love 
Is better than a lifetime alone

Is like a shooting star right through my heart

Sweep into my soul

Sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it 
We are mortal 
In the hands of gods who roll the dice 
We are mortal 
Victims of our weaknesses

Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure oh yeah 
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all 
your life 
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows 
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another 
all the time 
When I was young and just getting started 
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted 
Then I grew up and got my imagination 
And all I wanted was to start a new relation 
So in love but love had a bad reaction 
I was looking for some good old satisfaction 
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and 
affection 
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure yeah yeah 
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all 
your life 
Pain and pleasure 
Ooh ooh pain and pleasure 
When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light 
But inside of your mind you have to put up a fight 
Where are the answers that we're all searching for 
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore 
Some days you're feeling good some days you're feeling bad 
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad 
Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face 
For better for worse so let's make the best of the rest of our 
years 
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure I told you so 
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all 
your life 
Pain and pleasure 
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure yeah yeah 
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all 
your life 
All your life 
Pain - pleasure ....</field>

We had a good night jamming away 
There was a full moon showing 
And we wanted to play 
But in the cold light of day next morning 
Party was over uh uh 
The party was over 
We got love and we got style 
And we got sex and I know I know we got what it takes 
Oh oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh 
Why don't you come back and play 
Come back and play (hey hey) come back and play 
We got all night all day 
Everybody's gone away 
Why don't you come back and play come back and play 
Come back and play come back and play 
Play play it play it 
Go get 'em boy - let's party 
Yeah 
Give it give it 
We had a food fight in somebody's face 
We were up all night singing (singing) 
And giving a chase 
But in the cold light of day next morning 
Everybody was hung over 
Hey come back and play (come back and play) come back 
and play 
We got all night all day 
Everybody's gone away 
Why don't you come back and play (and play) come back 
and play 
We got all night we got all day 
We got all night to play 
Come back come back come back come back back and play 
Hey hey hey 
Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye the party is over</field>

Open up your mind and let me step inside 
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide 
It's so easy when you know the rules 
It's so easy all you have to do 
Is fall in love 
Play the game 
Everybody play the game of love 
When you're feeling down and your resistance is low 
Light another cigarette and let yourself go 
This is your life 
Don't play hard to get 
It's a free world 
All you have to do is fall in love 
Play the game everybody play the game of love 
My game of love has just begun 
Love runs from my head down to my toes 
My love is pumping through my veins (play the game) 
Driving me insane 
Come come come come play the game play the game play 
the game play the game 
Play the game everybody play the game of love 
This is your life - don't play hard to get 
It's a free free world all you have to do is fall in love 
Play the game yeah play the game of love 
Your life - don't play hard to get

In the bright shop window sits the polar bear 
Makes the children's eyes light up to see him there 
Amongst the tinsel he gives everyone a smile 
To see him as you'd see a star 
Love him from where you are 
He's not for, not for, not for sale 
Past an open window walks the pretty girl 
Does she see me at her feet it's hard to tell 
But if I ask her she might turn her smile away 
To see her as I'd see a star 
Love her from where you are 
She's not for, not for, not for sale 
I guess I'll learn to look 
Without a grasping hand 
Minor contentment wears a smile 
I love her from where I lie 
He's not for,not for,not for sale</field>

They called him a hero 
In the land of the free 
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy 
He disappointed me 
So I got my hand gun 
And I blew him away 
That critter was a bad guy 
And I had to make him pay 
You might fear for my reason 
I don't care what they say 
Look out baby it's the season 
For the mad masquerade 
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire 
Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head 
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire 
Don't believe what your grand-daddy said 
She was my lover 
It was a shame that she died 
But the constitution's right on my side 
'Cause I caught my lover in the neighbours bed 
I got retribution 
Filled 'em all full of lead 
I've been told it's the fashion 
To let me on the streets again 
It's nothing but a crime of passion 
And I'm not to blame 
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire 
You need a weapon like a hole in the head 
Put out the fire put out the fire baby put out the fire 
And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds 
You know a gun never killed nobody 
You can ask anyone 
People get shot by people 
People with guns 
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire 
You need a gun like a hole in the head 
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire 
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead

I can see it in your stars 
Life is so exciting 
Acting so bizzare 
Your world is so inviting 
Playing really cool 
And looking so mysterious honey 
Your every day is full of sunshine 
But into every life a little rain must fall 
No problem 
Uh 
Be cool now 
Anyone who imagines 
They can blind you with science 
Bully you all over 
With property and finance 
But you have the position 
To call the shots and name the price honey 
You found success and recognition 
But into every life a little rain must fall 
Flo Jo 
You lead a fairy tale existance 
But into every life a little rain must fall 
Be cool 
Hah 
Kiss kiss 
Others seem to think 
You are over dramatising 
Problems at work 
So it's hardly suprising 
There's little you can do 
To alter their opinions honey 
You want a clean reputation 
But now you're facing complications 
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall 
Be cool 
Get serious 
Alright 
Play it nice and cool 
Play it nice and cool 
That's good 
One more time 
Aha

Seaside whenever you stroll along with me 
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside 
Meanwhile I ask you to be my Clementine 
You say you will if you could but you can't 
I love you madly 
Let my imagination run away with you gladly 
A brand new angle highly commendable 
Seaside rendezvous 
I feel so romantic can we do it again? 
Can we do it again sometime I'd like that 
Fantastic c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs 
And at the peak of the season 
The Mediterranean 
This time of year it's so fashionable 
I feel like dancing in the rain 
Can I have a volunteer? 
Just keep right on dancing 
What a damn jolly good idea 
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact 
So 'tres charmant' my dear 
Underneath the moonlight 
Together we'll sail across the sea 
Reminiscing every night 
Meantime I ask you to be my Valentine 
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can 
I'll be your Valentino 
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino 
Get a new facial start a sensational 
Seaside rendezvous so adorable 
Seaside rendezvous ooh 
Seaside rendezvous</field>

Well she's gone dear gone this morning 
See what a fool I've been 
Oh Lord what a fool I've been 
Yes I did - too much 
Didn't leave didn't leave no letter 
Didn't leave no warning (you naughty thing you) 
I guess I'm all to blame oh Lord 
I guess I'm all to blame (see you later....right now you) - 
take it 
My little dog ain't too hungry no no he just kept on barking 
viciously 
Just don't seem the same oh no no 
It just don't seem the same (oh see you later) 
Now hit it - like that 
Coming on strong 
Well I got so lonely 
Went and told my neighbour 
She said mm mm mm mm mm 
Oh Lord what a fool I've been 
And she told me what to do 
She said go home 
Well she's gone gone this morning 
See what a fool I've been oh Lord</field>

I love she makes me 
She is my heart 
She is my love 
She is my love 
I know you're jealous of her 
She makes me need 
She is my love 
She is my love 
Who knows who she'll make me 
As I lie in her cocoon 
But the world will surely heal my ills 
I'm warm and terrified 
She makes me so 
I know the day I leave her 
I'd love her still 
She is my love 
She is my love 
Who knows where my dreams will end 
I'll follow as they grow 
But the world will know 
How long I'll take 
And if I'm very slow 
She makes me so 
She is my love 
She is my love</field>

I was nothin' but a city boy 
My trumpet was my only toy 
I've been blowin' my horn 
Since I knew I was born 
But there ain't nobody wants to know 
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk 
Rollin' down the road 
I may get hungry 
But I sure don't want to go home 
So round the corner comes a limousine 
And the biggest grin I ever seen 
Here sonny won't you sign 
Right along the dotted line 
What you sayin' are you playin' 
Sure you don't mean me? 
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk 
Rollin' down the road 
I may get hungry 
But I sure don't want to go home 
(Now I tell you what happened...) 
They took me to a room without a table 
They said 'blow your trumpet into here' 
I played around as well as I was able 
And soon we had the record of the year 
I was a legend all through the land 
I was blowin' to a million fans 
Nothin' was a missin' 
All the people want to listen 
You'd have thought I was a happy man 
And I was sleepin' like a princess 
Never touch the road 
I don't get hungry 
And I sure don't want to go home 
(Have to have some fun...) 
Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable 
An' I owe the man a million bucks a year 
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label 
It's just me and the road from here 
I'm back to playin' and layin' 
I'm back on the game 
I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk 
Rollin' down the road 
I sure get hungry and 
I sure do wanna go home 
(Yeah)</field>

You never heard my song before 
The music was too loud 
But now I think you hear me well 
For now we both know how 
No star can light our way 
In this cloud of dark and fear 
But someday one day 
Funny how the pages turn 
And hold us in between 
A misty castle waits for you 
And you shall be a queen 
Today the cloud it hangs 
Over us and all is grey 
But someday one day 
When I was you and you were me 
And we were very young 
Together took us nearly there 
The rest may not be sung 
So still the cloud it hangs 
Over us and we're alone 
But some day one day 
We'll come home</field>

Each morning I get up I die a little 
Can barely stand on my feet 
(Take a look at yourself)Take a look in the mirror and cry 
Lord what you're doing to me 
I have to spend all my years in believing you 
But I just can't get no relief Lord 
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody) 
Can anybody find me somebody to love? 
I work hard (he works hard) everyday of my life 
I work till I ache my bones 
At the end (at the end of the day) 
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own 
I get down (down) on my knees (knees) 
And I start to pray (praise the Lord) 
'Til the tears run down from my eyes 
Lord somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (please) 
Can anybody find me somebody to love? 
(He wants help) 
Every day - I try and I try and I try - 
But everybody wants to put me down 
They say I'm goin' crazy 
They say I got a lot of water in my brain 
Got no common sense 
I got nobody left to believe 
Yeah - yeah yeah yeah 
Ooh 
Somebody (somebody) 
Can anybody find me somebody to love? 
(Anybody find me someone to love) 
Got no feel I got no rhythm 
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing) 
I'm OK I'm alright (he's alright) 
I ain't gonna face no defeat 
I just gotta get out of this prison cell 
Some day I'm gonna be free Lord 
Find me somebody to love find me somebody to love 
Find me somebody to love find me somebody to love 
Find me somebody to love find me somebody to love 
Find me somebody to love find me somebody to love 
Find me somebody to love find me somebody to love 
Somebody somebody somebody somebody somebody

Sammy was low 
Just watching the show 
Over and over again 
Knew it was time 
He'd made up his mind 
To leave his dead life behind 
His boss said to him 
'Boy you'd better begin 
To get those crazy notions right out of your head 
Sammy who do you think that you are? 
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar' 
Spread your wings and fly away 
Fly away far away 
Spread your little wings and fly away 
Fly away far away 
Pull yourself together 
'Cos you know you should do better 
That's because you're a free man 
He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room 
Keeping his thoughts to himself he'd be leaving soon 
Wishing he was miles and miles away 
Nothing in this world nothing would make him stay 
Since he was small 
Had no luck at all 
Nothing came easy to him 
Now it was time 
He'd made up his mind 
'This could be my last chance' 
His boss said to him 'now listen boy 
You're always dreaming 
You've got no real ambition you won't get very far 
Sammy boy don't you know who you are? 
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald bar?' 
So honey 
Spread your wings and fly away 
Fly away far away 
Spread your little wings and fly away 
Fly away far away 
Pull yourself together 
'Cos you know you should do better 
That's because you're a free man 
Come on honey</field>

You're just a bad memory

My why could I never ever see she'd step on me 
Well I talked to your friend just the other day 
I was gonna look and raise a smile 
And she hid a smile and she ain't like you 
Been asleep from all the journeys a little while 
My life was going to be better 
My why could I never ever see she'd step on me 
Step on me,step on me,step on me 
Now it's so good I won't waste my time 
On a two year old picture of you 
Oh now that you're gone everything's fine 
But you probably think that we're through

A life of sacrifice controlled me 
But those promises I made no longer hold me 
Mercurial more wayward by the hour 
The shackles fall away, I'm in your power 
Free me, and free yourself 
Come to me and let me lead you 
I beg you, I beseech you to let go 
My heaven is yours and heaven is all I know 
We are mortal 
In the hands of Gods who roll the dice 
Searching for an earthly paradise 
So hard to find 
We are mortal 
We are victims of our weaknesses and passion 
We are reaching for the heights 
(I am falling, I am falling from the heights) 
But I promised I would serve 
I should be a rock against depravity and sin 
Oh no sin no sin 
Free yourself, let your life begin, oh 
To yourself be true 
I am a man of God 
I should not be here with you 
Free me we are mortal, ah 
Come a little closer to the fire 
To love and live that one desire 
Denial of that love is treason 
The love that we make 
The force of our lives and its reason 
We are mortal 
In the hands of Gods who roll the dice 
Searching for an earthly paradise 
So hard to find 
We are mortal 
Victims of our weaknesses and passion 
(I am falling, I am falling we, we are mortal) 
Why do I believe in you 
You're destroying my world 
Hold nothing back 
Give me all there is 
I want it all

            <field name="lyrics">The boy had a way with words, he sang, he moved with grace 
He entertained so naturally, no gesture out of place 
His road in life was clearly drawn, he didn't hesitate 
He played, they saw, he conquered as the master of, as the master of his 
fate 
The girl had an iron soul no-one could recognise 
Material ambition that her gentleness disguised 
She gave herself to him certain of his fame 
Wanted him for luxury, for limelight and his name 
And then he sang to her 
I love you for your silence, I love you for your peace 
The still and calm releases that sweep into my soul 
That slowly take control 
I love you for your passion, I love you for your fire 
The violent desire that burns me in its flame 
A love I dare not name 
His rise was irresistible (yeah) - he grew into the part 
His explanation simply that he suffered for his art 
No base considerations of some glittering reward 
The prize was knowing that his work was noticed and adored 
I love you (yes I love you) for your silence,(for your silence) 
I love you for your peace 
The still and calm releases that sweep into my soul 
That slowly slowly take control 
Yes he told the truth (he told the truth), yes! he told the truth 
Accepting every honour with (with)a masterly display (display) 
Of well rehearsed reluctance to be singled out this way 
He started to believe that he was all they said and more (and more) 
While she forgot, she forgot the reasons (reasons) 
She had wanted him before 
(I love you) I love you for your passion (for your passion) 
I love you for your fire 
The violent desire that burns me in its flame 
A love I dare not name 
The still and calm releases (releases) 
That sweep into my soul (sweep into my soul) 
That slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) 
Slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly)slowly (slowly) Slowly!! 
take control... 
And when at last they fell apart, she wished that she could be 
The hardened heart of yesterday, as cynical as he 
By changing for the better, she had changed things for the worse 
The words that made them happy once now echoed - echoed as a curse

Pretending I'm doing well 
My need is such 
I pretend too much 
I'm lonely but no one can tell 
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender 
Adrift in a world of my own 
I play the game but to my real shame 
You've left me to dream all alone 
Too real is this feeling of make-believe 
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal 
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender 
Just laughing and gay like a clown 
I seem to be what I'm not you see 
I'm wearing my heart like a crown 
Pretending that you're still around 
Too real when i feel what my heart can't conceal 
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender 
Just laughing and gay like a clown 
I seem to be what I'm not you see

So you feel that you ain't nobody 
Always needed to be somebody 
Put your feet on the ground 
Put your hand on your heart 
Lift your head to the stars 
And the world's for your taking 
So you feel it's the end of the story 
Find it all pretty satisfactory 
Well I tell you my friend 
This might seem like the end 
But the continuation 
Is yours for the making 
Yes you're a hero</field>

I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man 
Incredible how you can see right through me 
Freddie Mercury 
When you hear a sound that you just can't place 
Feel somethin' move that you just can't trace 
When something sits on the end of your bed 
Don't turn around when you hear me tread 
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man 
Incredible how you can see right through me 
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man 
It's criminal how I can see right through you 
John Deacon 
Now I'm in your room and I'm in your bed 
And I'm in your life and I'm in your head 
Like the CIA or the FBI 
You'll never get close never take me alive 
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man 
Incredible how you can see right through me 
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man 
It's criminal how I can see right through you 
Hah hah hah hello 
Hah hah hah OK 
Hah hah hah hello hello hello hello 
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or a girl 
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl 
So I make my mark from the edge of the world 
From the edge of the world 
From the edge of the world 
Brian May Brian May 
Now I'm on your track and I'm in your mind 
And I'm on your back but don't look behind 
I'm your meanest thought I'm your darkest fear 
But I'll never get caught you can't shake me shake me dear 
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man 
Incredible how you can see right through me 
Watch me 
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man 
It's criminal how I can see right through you 
Look at me look at me

Mama's got a problem 
She don't know what to say 
Her little baby boy 
Has just left home today 
She's got to be the loser in the end 
She's got to be the loser in the end 
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend 
She's ma on whom you can always depend ooh 
She washed and fed and clothed and cared 
For nearly twenty years 
And all she gets is Goodbye Ma 
And the night times for her tears 
She's got to be the loser in the end 
She's got to be the loser in the end 
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend 
She's ma on whom you can always depend ooh 
So listen mothers ev'rywhere 
To just one mothers son 
You'll get forgotten on the way 
If you don't let them have their fun 
Forget regrets and just remember 
It's not so long since you were young 
You're bound to be the loser in the end 
You're bound to be the loser in the end 
They'll chose their new shoes 
That's not far to bend</field>

When I was young it came to me 
And I could see the sun breakin' 
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling 
Holding the world inside 
Once I believed in ev'ryone 
Ev'ryone and anyone can see 
Oh oh the night comes down 
And I get afraid of losing my way 
Oh oh the night comes down 
Oooh and it's dark again 
Once I could laugh with ev'ryone 
Once I could see the good in me 
The black and the white distinctively colouring 
Holding the world inside 
Now all the world is grey to me 
Nobody can see you gotta believe it 
Oh oh the night comes down 
And I get afraid of losing my way 
Oh oh the night comes down 
Oooh and it's dark again 
And it's dark again 
And it's dark again</field>

Abandoned places - I guess we know the score 
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for... 
Another hero, another mindless crime 
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime 
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore 
The show must go on 
The show must go on, yeah 
Inside my heart is breaking 
My make - up may be flaking 
But my smile still stays on 
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance 
Another heartache, another failed romance 
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for ? 
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning learning learning) 
I must be warmer now 
I'll soon be turning (turning turning turning) 
Round the corner now 
Outside the dawn is breaking 
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free 
The show must go on 
The show must go on, yeah yeah 
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking 
My make - up may be flaking 
But my smile still stays on 
Yeah yeah, whoa wo oh oh 
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies 
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die 
I can fly - my friends 
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on) yeah yeah 
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on) 
I'll face it with a grin 
I'm never giving in 
On - with the show 
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill 
I have to find the will to carry on 
On with the show 
On with the show

A better way for us to survive 
Why should it be just a case of black or white 
There must be more to life than this 
Why is this world so full of hate 
People dying everywhere 
And we destroy what we create 
People fighting for their human rights 
But we just go on saying c'est la vie 
So this is life 
There must be more to life than killing 
A better way for us to survive 
What good is life, in the end we all must die 
There must be more to life than this 
There must be more to life than this 
There must be more than meets the eye 
I live and hope for a world filled with love 
Then we can all just live in peace 
There must be more to life, much more to life 
There must be more to life, more to life than this.</field>

I was back in the old days - long ago 
When we were kids when we were young 
Thing seemed so perfect - you know 
The days were endless we were crazy we were young 
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun 
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know 
The rest of my life's been just a show 
Those were the days of our lives 
The bad things in life were so few 
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true 
When I look and I find I still love you 
You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide 
Ain't that a shame 
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride 
When life was just a game 
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did 
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids 
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know 
Better sit back and go with the flow 
Cos these are the days of our lives 
They've flown in the swiftness of time 
These days are all gone now but some things remain 
When I look and I find no change 
Those were the days of our lives - yeah 
The bad things in life were so few 
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true 
When I look and I find 
I still love you 
I still love you</field>

What is there left for me to do in this life 
Did I achieve what I had set in my sights 
Am I a happy man or is this sinking sand 
Was it all worth it was it all worth it 
Yeah now hear my story let me tell you about it 
We bought a drum kit blew my own trumpet 
Played the circuit thought we were perfect 
Was it all worth it 
Giving all my heart and soul and staying up all night 
Was it all worth it 
Living breathing rock'n'roll a godforsaken life 
Was it all worth it was it all worth it all these years 
Put down our money without counting the cost 
It didn't matter if we won if we lost 
Yes we were vicious yes we could kill 
Yes we were hungry yes we were brill 
We served a purpose like a bloody circus 
We were so dandy we love you madly 
Was it all worth it 
Living breathing rock'n'roll this godforsaken life 
Was it all worth it was it all worth it 
When the hurly burly's done 
We went to Bali saw God and Dali 
So mystic surrealistic 
Was it all worth it yeah yeah 
Giving all my heart and soul staying up all night 
Was it all worth it 
Living breathing rock'n'roll this never ending fight 
Was it all worth it was it all worth it 
Yes it was a worthwhile experience</field>

So sad her eyes smiling dark eyes 
So sad her eyes as it began 
On such a breathless night as this 
Upon my brow the lightest kiss 
I walked alone 
And all around the air did sway 
My lady soon will stir this way 
In sorrow known 
The white queen walks 
And the night grows pale 
Stars of lovingness in her hair 
Heeding unheard pleading one word 
So sad my eyes she cannot see 
How did thee fare what have thee seen 
The mother of the willow green 
I call her name 
And 'neath her window have I stayed 
I loved the footsteps that she made 
And when she came 
White queen how my heart did ache 
And dry my lips no word would make 
So still I wait 
My goddess hear my darkest fear 
I speak too late 
It's for evermore that I wait 
Dear friend goodbye 
No tears in my eyes</field>

I make it half past six you come at seven 
Always try to keep me hanging round 
You little spoilt thing girl you kept me waiting 
Never contemplating my point of view 
This comes as no surprise 
I'm a fool for I believed your lies 
But now I've seen through your disguise 
Who needs well I don't need who needs you? 
Oh I believed you 
Went on my knees to you 
How I trusted you 
But you turned me down 
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race 
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face 
Reaching out reaching out for a helping hand 
Where is that helping hand? 
I like it I like it 
Well I don't need you 
How I was pushed around 
Don't let it get you down 
You walked all over me 
But don't you ever give in 
Taking one step forward slipping two steps back 
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget 
Reaching out for a helping hand 
When I met you you were always charming 
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine 
You were oh so so sophisticated 
Never interested in what I'd say 
I had to swallow my pride 
So naive you took me for a ride 
But now I'm the one to decide</field>

Boogie down with bassman 
Win love on the grandslam 
I'll be there waititng when you call. 
Just step right into my heart 
Come a little closer 
Don't tell me that it's over 
Make a brand new start 
We can work it out just next to nothing 
Work it out, work it out just next to nothing 
With feeling, feeling, feeling, with feeling 
We can work it out

We gotta talk it out man to man 
Make each other understand

You always had the upper hand 
Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand 
You had to go and ruin all our plans 
Packed your bags and you're leaving home 
Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go 
But we have one more day together, so 
 
Love me like there's no tomorrow 
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it 
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over 
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow 
 
I guess we drift alone in separate ways 
I don't have all that far to go 
God knows I learnt to play the lonely man 
I've never felt so low in all my life 
We were born to be just losers 
So I guess there's a limit on how far we go 
But we only have one more day together so 
 
Love me like there's no tomorrow 
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it 
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over 
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow 
 
Tomorrow god knows just where I'll be 
Tomorrow who knows just what's in store for me 
Anything can happen but we only have one more day together, yeah 
Just one more day forever, so 
 
Love me like there's no tomorrow 
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it 
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over

Why should it be just a case of black or white 
There must be more to life than this 
 
Why is this world so full of hate 
People dying everywhere 
And we destroy what we create 
People fighting for their human rights 
But we just go on saying see'est la vie 
So this is life 
 
There must be more to life than killing 
A better way for us to survive 
What good is life, in the end we all must die 
There must be more to life than this 
 
There must be more to life than this 
There must be more to life than this 
I live and hope for a world filled with love 
Then we can all just live in peace

Free me, and free yourself 
Come to me and let me lead you 
I beg you, I beseech you to let go 
My heaven is yours 
And heaven is all I know 
 
We are mortal 
In the hands of God who roll the dice 
Searching for an earthly paradise 
So hard to find 
We are mortal 
Victims of our weaknesses and passion 
We are reaching for the heights 
(I am falling from the heights) 
 
But I promise I would serve 
I should be a rock against depravity and sin 
Oh no sin no sin 
Free yourself, let your life begin 
Oh 
To yourself be true 
I am a man of God 
I should not be here with you 
 
Free me we are mortal ah 
 
Come a little closer to the fire 
To love and live that one desire 
Denial of that love is treason 
The love that we make 
The force of our lives and it's reason 
We are mortal 
In the hands of Gods who roll the dice 
Searching for an earthly paradise 
So hard to find 
We are mortal 
Victims of our weaknessess and passion. 
(I am falling, I am falling we, we are mortal) 
 
Why do I believe in you 
You're destroying my world 
Hold nothing back 
Give me all there is 
I want it all 
 
This is all there is

I love you for your peace (I love peace) 
Sweep into my soul 
Ooh, slowly take control 
 
Sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it

In the hands of gods who roll the dice 
We are mortal 
Victims of our weaknesses</field>

Un sueno me envolvio 
This dream was me and you 
Tal vez esta aqui 
I want all the world to see 
Un instinto me guiaba 
A miracle sensation 
My guide and inspiration 
Now my dream is slowly coming true 
The wind is a gentle breeze 
EI me hablo de ti 
The bells are ringing out 
EI canto vuela 
They're calling us together 
Guiding us forever 
Wish my dream would never go away 
 
Barcelona 
It was the first time that we met 
Barcelona 
How can I forget 
The moment that you stepped into the room 
You took my breath away 
 
Barcelona 
La musica vibro 
Barcelona 
Yella nos unio 
And if God is willing 
We will meet again 
Someday 
 
Let the songs begin 
Dejalo nacer 
Let the music play 
Ah 
Make the voices sing 
Nace un gran amor 
Start the celebration 
Ven a mi 
And cry 
Grita 
Come alive 
Vive 
And shake the foundations from the skies 
Shaking all our lives 
 
Barcelona 
Such a beautiful horizon 
Barcelona 
Like a jewel in the sun 
Por ti sere gaviota de tu bella mar 
Barcelona 
Suenan las campanas 
Barcelona 
Abre tus puertas al mundo 
If God is willing 
If God is willing 
If God is willing 
Friends until the end 
 
Viva! 
Barcelona!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">The boy had a way with words, he sang, he moved with grace 
He entertained so naturally, no gesture out of place 
His road in life was clearly drawn, he didn't hesitate 
He played, they saw, he conquered as the master of 
As the master of his fate 
 
The girl had an iron soul no-one could recognize 
Material ambition that her gentleness disguised 
She gave herself to him certain of his fame 
Wanted him for luxury for limelight and his name 
 
And then he sang to her 
 
I love you for your silence 
I love you for your peace 
The still and calm releases 
That sweep into my soul 
That slowly take control 
 
I love you for your passion 
I love you for your fire 
The violent desire 
That burns me in it's flame 
A love I dare not name 
 
His rise was irresistible - yeah, he grew into the part 
His explanation simply that he suffered for his art 
No base considerations of some glittering reward 
The prize was knowing that (his work) his work was noticed and adored 
 
Hey 
I love you (yes I love you) for your silence (for your silence) 
I love you for your peace (for your peace) 
The still and calm releases 
That sweep into my soul 
And slowly slowly takes control 
 
He told the truth 
Yes, he told the truth (and he told the truth) 
 
Accepting every honor with (with) a masterly display (display) 
Of well rehearsed reluctance to be singled out this way 
He started to believe that he was all they said and more (and more) 
She forgot, she forgot the reasons (reasons) she had wanted him before 
Yeah 
 
I love you for your passion (for your passion) 
I love you for your fire 
The violent desire 
That burns me in it's flame (burns me) 
A love I dare not name 
 
The still and calm releases (releases) 
That sweep into my soul (sweep into my soul) 
That slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) 
Slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) slowly take control 
 
And when at last they fell apart she wished that she could be 
The hardened heart of yesterday, as cynical as he 
By changing for the better she had changed things for the worse 
The words that made them happy once now echoed, echoed as a curse 
Aaahaaahaahaahaaa

I stand dethroned 
I'm naked and I bleed 
But when your finger points so savagely, 
Is anybody there to believe in me 
To hear my plea and take care of me? 
 
How can I go on 
From day to day 
Who can make me strong in every way 
Where can I be safe 
Where can I belong 
In this great big world of sadness 
How can I forget 
Those beautiful dreams that we shared 
They're lost and they're no where to be found 
How can I go on? 
 
Sometimes I tremble in the dark 
I cannot see 
When people frighten me 
I try to hide myself so far from the crowd 
Is anybody there to comfort me 
Lord, take care of me.

That's my destiny 
Mr bad guy, Mr bad guy, bad guy 
 
It's the only way for me 
It's my destiny, oh yeah 
 
Mr bad guy, yes I'm everybody's Mr bad guy 
Can't you see this is my destiny 
Oh, spread your wings and fly away with me

            <field name="lyrics">I feel so unsure 
As I take your hand and lead to the dance floor 
As the music dies, something in your eyes 
Calls to mind the silver screen 
And all its sad good-byes 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you are not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
Time can never mend 
The careless whispers of a good friend 
To the heart and mind 
Ignorance is kind 
There's no comfort in the truth 
Pain is all you'll find 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you are not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste this chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
Never without your love 
Tonight the music seems so loud 
I wish that we could lose this crowd 
Maybe it's better this way 
We'd hurt each other 
with the things we'd want to say 
We could have been so good together 
We could have lived this dance forever 
But now who's gonna dance with me 
Please stay 
And I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you're not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
(now that you're gone) now that you're gone 
(now that you're gone) what I did so wrong 
That you had to leave me alone</field>

I will not give you up 
Gotta have some faith in the sound 
It's the one good thing that I've got 
I won't let you down 
So please don't give me up 
Because I would really, really love to stick around 
Heaven knows I was just a young boy 
Didn't know what I wanted to be 
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy 
And I guess it was enough for me towin the race? 
A prettier face! 
Brand new clothes and a big fat place 
On your rock and roll TV 
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way 
Think I'm gonna get me some happy 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I told you so 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone else I've got to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Take back your singing in the rain 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies 
and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy 
What a kick just a buddy and me 
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy 
We were living in a fantasy 
We won the race 
Got out of the place 
I went back home got a brand new face 
For the boys on MTV 
But today the way I play the game has got to change 
Oh yeah 
Now I'm gonna get myself happy 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I stopped the show 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone I forgot to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Don't think that I'll be back again 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies 
and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Well it looks like the road to heaven 
But it feels like the road to hell 
When I knew which side my bread was buttered 
I took the knife as well 
Posing for another picture 
Everybody's got to sell 
But when you shake your ass 
They notice fast 
And some mistakes were built to last 
That's what you get 
I say that's what you get 
That's what you get for changing your mind 
And after all this time 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
I'll hold on to my freedom 
May not be what you want from me 
Just the way it's got to be 
Lose the face now 
I've got to live</field>

And people on the streets 
I'm looking out for angels 
Just trying to find some peace 
Now I think it's time 
That you let me know 
So if you love me 
Say you love me 
But if you don't 
Just let me go 
Cause teacher 
There are things that I don't want to learn 
And the last one I had 
Made me cry 
So I don't want to learn to 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because there ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Whose teacher has told him goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
When you were just a stranger 
And I was at your feet 
I didn't feel the danger 
Now I feel the heat 
That look in your eyes 
Telling me no 
So you think that you love me 
Know that you need me 
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong 
Just let me go 
And teacher 
There are things 
That I don't want to learn 
Oh the last one I had 
Made me cry 
So I don't want to learn to 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because there ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Whose teacher has told him goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
So when you say that you need me 
That you'll never leave me 
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong 
Let me go 
And teacher 
There are things 
That I still have to learn 
But the one thing I have is my pride 
Oh so I don't want to learn to 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because there ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who just isn't willing to try 
I'm so cold 
Inside 
Maybe just one more try</field>

Something special, something sacred 
In your eyes 
For just one moment 
To be bold and naked 
At your side 
Sometimes I think that you'll never

Maybe this time is forever 
Say it can be 
That's all you wanted 
Something special, someone sacred 
In your life 
Just for one moment 
To be warm and naked 
At my side 
Sometimes I think that you'll never 
Understand me 
But something tells me together 
We'd be happy 
(Baby) 
I will be your father figure 
(Oh baby) 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
(I'd love to) 
I will be your preacher teacher 
(Be your daddy) 
Anything you have in mind 
(It would make me) 
I will be your father figure 
(Very happy) 
I have had enough of crime 
(Please let me) 
I will be the one who loves you 
Until the end of time 
That's all I wanted 
But sometimes love can be mistaken 
For a crime 
That's all I wanted 
Just to see my baby's 
Blue eyed shine 
This time I think that my lover 
Understands me 
If we have faith in each other 
Then we can be 
Strong 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
I will be the one who loves you 
Until the end of time 
If you are the desert 
I'll be the sea 
If you ever hunger 
Hunger for me 
Whatever you ask for 
That's what I'll be 
So when you remember the ones who have lied 
Who said that they cared 
But then laughed as you cried 
Beautiful Darling 
Don't think of me 
Because all I ever wanted 
It's in your eyes baby, baby 
And love can't lie, no... 
(Greet me with the eyes of a child) 
My love is always tell me to... 
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile) 
Just hold on, hold on 
I won't let you go, my baby 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
(So I am gonna love you) 
Until the end of time 
I will be your father 
I will be your preacher 
I will be your daddy 
I will be the one who loves you until the end of time</field>

Listen to my simple story

How can the outside world 
Be a place that your heart can embrace 
Be good to yourself 
Because nobody else

He must have really hurt you 
To make those pretty eyes look so blue

Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more 
Someone who will protect you 
Love and respect you 
All those things

All my pictures seem to fade to black and white 
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me 
Frozen here on the ladder of my life 
It's much too late to save myself from falling 
I took a chance and changed your way of life 
But you misread my meaning when I met you 
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free 
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me 
I can't find, oh the right romantic line 
But see me once and see the way I feel 
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm 
But these cuts I have 
They need love to help them heal 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free 
Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion, 
Time to pick my heart up off the floor. 
And when that love comes down without devotion, 
Well, it takes a strong man baby, but I'm 
Showing you the door, 
Cause I gotta have Faith 
I gotta have.. 
Faith 
Yes, I've gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith 
I gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith. 
Baby, I know you're asking me to stay 
Saying please, please, please don't go away 
You say I'm giving you the blues. 
Maybe you mean every word you say 
Can't help but think of yesterday 
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules 
Before this river becomes an ocean 
Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
Oh baby, I reconsider my foolish notion 
Well, I need someone to hold me, 
But I'll wait for something more. 
Cause I gotta have Faith... 
(repeat chorus) 
Before this river 
Becomes an ocean 
Before you throw my heart back on the floor

I've reconsidered my foolish notion 
Yeah, I need someone to hold me, 
But I'll wait for something more....

To even make a start 
But you'll never find 
Peace of mind 
Till you listen to your heart 
People 
You can never change the way they feel 
Better let them do just what they want 
For they will 
If you let them 
Steal your heart from you 
People

We could have shown them all 
We should have seen love through 
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes 
Covered me with kisses and lies 
So goodbye 
But please don't take my heart 
You are far 
But I'm never gonna be your star 
I'll pick up the pieces

Maybe I'll be strong enough 
I don't know where to start

But remember this 
Every other kiss 
That you ever give 
Long as we both live 
When you need the hand of another man 
One you really can surrender with 
I will wait for you 
Like I always do 
There's something there 
That can't compare with any other 
You are far 
When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
Strange that I was wrong enough 
To think you'd love me too 
I guess you were kissing a fool 
You must have been kissing a fool</field>

They will not be the last 
Look around now 
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers 
This is the year of the hungry man 
Whose place is in the past 
Hand in hand with ignorance 
And legitimate excuses 
The rich declare themselves poor 
And most of us are not sure 
If we have too much 
But we'll take our chances 
Because god's stopped keeping score 
I guess somewhere along the way 
He must have let us all out to play 
Turned his back and all god's children 
Crept out the back door 
And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate 
Hanging on to hope 
When there is no hope to speak of 
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late 
Well maybe we should all be praying for time 
These are the days of the empty hand 
Oh you hold on to what you can 
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year 
This is the year of the guilty man 
Your television takes a stand 
And you find that what was over there 
Is over here 
So you scream from behind your door 
Say "what's mine is mine and not yours" 
I may have too much but I'll take my chances 
Because god's stopped keeping score 
And you cling to the things they sold you 
Did you cover your eyes when they told you 
That he can't come back 
Because he has no children to come back for 
It's hard to love, there's so much to hate</field>

Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 
Sadness in my eyes 
No one guessed and no one tried 
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
Loveless and cold 
With your last breath you saved my soul 
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child

I've waited for you all those years

But I still say 
Chorus 
So the words you could not say 
I'll sing them for you 
And the love we would have made 
I'll make it for two 
For every single memory 
Has become a part of me 
You will always be my love 
Well I've been loved so I know just what love is 
And the lover that I kissed is always by my side 
Oh the lover I still miss..

Asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life

As today I know I'm living for tomorrow 
Could make me the past 
But that I mustn't fear 
Cause you're here 
Now I know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've felt behind 
And I'll be loving you always 
Until the rainbow burns 
The stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers 
Every mountain high 
Until the dolphin fly 
And parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life 
And life becomes a dream 
(now ain't that loving you?) 
Until the day is night 
And night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas 
Just up and fly away 
Until the day that 
Eight times eight times eight is four 
Until the day that is the day 
That are no more 
Did you know that true love 
Asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life 
Has given love a guarantee 
To last forever 
And another day 
As around the sun 
The Earth knows she's revolving 
And the rosebuds know 
To bloom in early May 
Now I know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've left behind 
And I'll be loving you always 
Until the rainbow burns 
The stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers 
Every mountain high 
Until the dolphin fly 
And parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life 
And life becomes a dream 
(now ain't that loving you?) 
Until the day is night 
And night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas 
Just up and fly away 
Until the day that 
Eight times eight times eight is four 
Until the day that is the day 
That are no more</field>

Do we have to fight again 
Tonight? 
I just want to go to sleep 
Turn out the light 
But you want to carry grudges 
Oh, nine times out of ten 
Oh, I see the storm approaching 
Long before the rain starts falling 
Tonight 
Does it have to be the old thing 
Tonight? 
Oh, it's late, too late 
To chase the rainbow that you're after 
I'd like to find a compromise 
Oh, and place it in your hands 
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear 
Oh, and I cannot find the time 
Tonight 
Just let the curtains close in silence 
Tonight 
Why not approach with less defiance 
The man who'd love to see you smile 
Who'd love to see you smile 
Tonight 
Tonight 
Just let the curtains close in silence 
Tonight 
Why not approach with less defiance 
The man who'd love to see your smile 
The man who'd love to see your smile 
The man who'd love to see your smile

Made my way into the night 
All that bullshit conversation 
Well, baby, can't you read the signs? 
I won't bore you with the details baby 
I don't even want to waste your time 
Let's just say that maybe 
You could help to ease my mind 
Baby, I aint Mr.Right 
But if your looking for fastlove 
If that's love in your eyes 
It's more than enough 
Had some bad luck 
So fastlove, is all that I've got on my mind 
What's there to think about baby? 
Looking for some affirmation 
Made my way into the sun 
My friends got their ladies, 
They're all having babies 
But I just want to have some fun 
I won't bore you with the details baby 
Got to get there in your own sweet time 
Let's just say that maybe 
You could help to ease my mind 
Baby, I aint Mr.Right 
Chorus 
What's there to think about baby? 
Get yourself some lessons in love 
In the absence of security 
I made my way into the night 
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me 
But I see nothing in his eyes 
I miss my baby 
I miss my baby, oh yeah, tonight 
So, why don't we make a little room 
In my Bmw babe 
Searching for some peace of mind 
Hey I'll help you find it 
I do believe that we are practicing 
The same religion 
You really ought to get up now

You can't make your heart feel something it won't

I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power 
But you won't, no you won't 
And I can't make you love me 
If you don't 
I'll close my eyes and then I won't see 
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me 
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right 
Just give me till then, to give up this fight 
And I will give up this fight 
And I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel something it won't

Past the school that has no changed 
In all this time 
She thinks of when the boy was young 
All the battles she had won 
Just to give him life 
That man 
She loved that man 
For all his life 
But now we meet to bring him flowers 
And only God knows why 
For what's the use in pressing pamls 
When children fade in mother's arms 
It's a cruel world 
We've so much to loose 
And what we have to learn we rarely choose 
So if it's God who took her son 
He cannot be the one living in her mind 
Take care my love, she said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, she said 
You have been loved 
If I was weak, forgive me 
But I was terrified 
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love 
The kind that makes devils cry 
So these days 
My life has changed 
And I'll be fine 
But she just sits and counts the hours 
Searching for her crime 
So what's the use of pressing palms 
If you won't keep such love from harm 
It's a cruel world 
You've so much to prove 
And heaven helps the ones who wait for you 
Well I've no daughters, I've no sons 
Guess I'm the only one 
Living in my life 
Take care my love, he said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, he said 
You have been loved...</field>

When your heart`s in someone else`s hands 
Monkey see and monkey do 
Their wish is your command 
You`re not to blame 
Everyone`s the same 
All you do is love and love is all you do 
I should know by now the way I fought for you 
You`re not to blame 
Everyone`s the same 
I know you think that you`re safe 
Mister 
Harmless deception that keeps love at bay 
It`s the ones who resist that we most want to kiss 
Wouldn`t you say? 
Cowboys and angels 
They all have the time for you 
Why should I imagine 
That I`d be a find for you 
Why should I imagine 
That I`d have something to say 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
In your heart there`s a trace 
Of someone before 
When your heart`s in someone else`s plans 
Things you say and things you do 
They don`t understand 
It`s such a shame 
Always ends the same 
You can call it love but I don`t think it`s true 
You should know by now 
I`m not the boy for you 
You`re not to blame 
Always ends the same 
I know you think that you`re safe 
Sister 
Harmless affection that keeps things this way 
It`s the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss 
Who will pay 
Cowboys and angels 
They all take a shine to you 
Why should I imagine 
That I was designed for you 
Why should I believe 
That you would stay 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
Don`t you think that I know 
They hurt you before 
Take this man to your bed 
Maybe his hands 
Will help you forget 
Please be stronger than your past 
The future may still give you a chance</field>

CHORUS: 
Last Christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
CHORUS 
Once bitten and twice shy 
I keep my distance 
But you still catch my eye 
Tell me baby 
Do you recognize me? 
Well 
It's been a year 
It doesn't surprise me 
HAPPY CHRISTMAS 
I wrapped it up and sent it 
With a note saying "I love you" 
I meant it 
Now I know what a fool I've been 
But if you kissed me now 
I know you'd fool me again 
CHORUS 
Crowded room 
Runs with tired eyes 
I'm hiding from you 
And your solemn eyes 
My god I thought you were 
Someone to rely on 
Me? 
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man undercover but you tore me apart 
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again 
CHORUS 2x 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man undercover but you tore him apart 
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone.</field>

They crack a smile, talk a while 
Try to take your place 
My memory serves me far too well 
I just sit here on this mountain thinking to myself 
You're a fool boy 
Why don't you go down 
Find somebody 
Find somebody else 
My memory serves me far too well 
It's not as though we just broke up 
It's not as though it was yesterday 
But something I just can't explain 
Something in me needs this pain 
I know I'll never see your face again 
C'mon now 
I've got to be strong now 
Now everybody's talking about this new decade 
Like you say the magic numbers 
Then just say goodbye to 
The stupid mistakes you made 
Oh my memory serves me far too well 
Don't you know that 
The years will come and go 
Some of us will change our lives 
Some of us still have nothing to show 
Nothing baby 
But memories 
And if these wounds 
They are self-inflicted 
I don't really know 
How my poor heart could have protected me 
But if I have to carry this pain 
If you will not share the blame 
I deserve to see your face again 
C'mon now 
You don't have to be so strong now 
Come back 
Come back to me darling 
I will make it worth your while 
Come back to your baby 
I miss your kiss 
I miss your smile 
Seems to me the peace I search to find 
Ain't going to be mine until you say you will 
Don't you keep me waiting for that day 
I know, I know, I know 
You hear these words that I say 
You can't always get what you want

I wanna hit that high yeah yeah 
You put the grey skies out of my way 
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day 
Turn the bright spark into a flame 
My beats per minute never been the same 
'Cause you are my lady I'm your fool 
It makes me crazy when you act so cool 
Come on baby let's not fight 
We'll go dancing 
Everything will be alright

You insist my music goes against the rules 
Yes, but rules were never made for lovesick fools 
I wrote this song for you 
But you don't care 
It's a crooked song, ah, 
But my heart is there 
The thing that you would see if you would play the part 
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart 
I took your picture with my trusty Rolliflex 
And now all I have developed is complex 
Possibly in vain, I hope you weaken, oh my love 
And forget those rigid rules that undermine my dream of 
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand 
That even though I may be out of tune when I attempt to say 
How much I love you 
And all that matters is the message that I bring, 
Which is: my dear one, I love you.</field>

Racism in future kings can only lead to no good 
And besides, all our sons and daughters already 
Know that feels 
It was the third of september 
That day I?ll always remember, yes I will 
´Cause that was the day that my daddy died 
Never had a chance to see him, no 
Never heard nothin? but bad things about him 
Mama, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth 
Mama just hung her head and said 
(Chorus) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
Hey, mama, is it true what they say 
That papa never worked a day in his life 
Some bad talks going around sayin? 
Papa had three outside children 
And anouther wife 
That ain?t right 
Heard some talks about papa and his storefront 
Preachin? 
Talkin? about saving souls and all the time 
Leaching 
And dealing in the dirt 
Stealin? in the name of the lord 
But mama she just said 
(Chorus) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades 
Is that what sent papa to an early grave? 
Folks say papa would bag, borrow of steal just 
To pay his bills 
Hey, mama, folks say papa was ever much on thinkin? 
Spent most of this time chasin? women and drinkin? 
But mouther, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth 
But my mama she just said 
(Chorus 2x) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
But my mama she said 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Oh my mama said 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home

All he left us

All alone yeah

And things that you know 
There's boys you can trust 
And girls that you don't 
There's little things you hide 
And little things that you show 
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it 
But you don't and that's just the way it goes 
I swear I won't tease you 
Won't tell you no lies 
I don't need no bible 
Just look in my eyes 
I've waited so long baby 
Now that we're friends 
Every man's got his patience 
And here's where mine ends 
CHORUS 
I want your sex 
I want your love 
I want your sex 
I want your.. 
sex 
It's playin' on my mind 
It's dancin' on my soul 
It's takin' so much time 
So why don't you just let me go 
I'd really like to try 
Oh, I'd really like to know 
When you tell me you're gonna regret it 
Then I tell you that i love you but you still say no 
I swear I won't tease you 
Won't tell you no lies 
I don't need no bible 
Just look in my eyes 
I've waited so long baby 
Out in the cold 
I can't take much more girl 
I'm losing control 
CHORUS 
I want your sex 
I want your love 
I want your sex 
I want your.. 
sex 
It's natural 
It's chemical 
(Let's do it) 
It's logical 
Habitual 
(Can we do it?) 
It's sensual 
But most of all 
Sex is something that we should do 
Sex is something for me and you 
Sex is natural, sex is good 
Not everybody does it, but everybody should 
Sex is natural, sex is fun 
Sex is best when it's (one on one) 
(One on one) 
(Huaah) (Sex) 
I'm not your father 
(Huaah) (Sex) 
I'm not your brother 
(Huuah) (Sex) 
Talk to your sister 
(Huuah) (sex) 
I am a lover 
(Huuah) (sex)

Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot, 
Gonna make a lot of money,

Watch out boy, (watch out boy) 
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot, 
Gonna make a lot of money, 
Gonna break your heart. 
But I'm the only one with a key. 
And that's me. 
Sometimes, 
You wake up in the morning with the bass line, 
A Ray of Sunshine, 
Sometimes, 
You know today you're gonna have a good time, 
And you're ready to go. 
Move it move it baby 
Can't you see I'm ready to dance? 
And I can't keep my rhythm in my heart. 
Move it move it baby, 
Can't you see I'm ready to dance? 
Without this beat my life would fall apart. 
Shuffle to the beat, 
Gonna take a cut, 
There's money in your feet, 
Gimme what you got. 
Watch out boy, (watch out boy) 
Suffle to the beat, 
Gonna take a cut, 
There's money in your feet, 
Gonna stitch you up. 
Any other boy that you see, 
But not me. 
Sometimes, 
You wake up in the morning with the bass line, 
A Ray of Sunshine, 
Sometimes, 
You know today you're gonna have a good time, 
And you're ready to go. 
Turn the music up, 
Turn the music up, turn it up, 
because it's all I've- 
All that I've got. 
Shuffle to the beat 
Gonna take a cut, 
There's money in your feet, 
Gimme what you got. 
Watch out boy, (watch out boy) 
Suffle to the beat,

The next thing I felt was you

And now we fly through the stars. 
Want this night will last for ever. 
I've been waiting for you 
It's been so long. 
I knew just what I would do when I heard your song. 
I fill my heart with your kiss 
It gave me freedom. 
You knew I could not resist 
I needed someone. 
And now we're flying through the stars. 
I hope this night lasts for ever. 
Ain't nobody (NOBODY)

Can't believe I'm the one 
I was so lonely. 
I feel like noone can feel 
I must be dreamin'. 
I want this dream to be real 
I'm in this feeling. 
I make my whish upon a star 
And hope this night will last for ever.

And what we seek is no surprise.

Album: Patience (2004) 
 
I was mixed up when you came to me 
Too broke to fix 
Said 'daddy get you gone, I'm missing my baby' 
Still missing my baby 
I was stitched up by the hands of fate 
Said how you gonna make it on your own 
If luck is a lady? 
Maybe luck is a lady 
I was going down for the third time 
My heart was broken I was not open 
To your suggestions 
I had so many questions 
That you just kissed away 
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise 
The day you walked in and changed my life 
I think it's amazing 
The way that love can set you free 
So I walk in the midday sun 
I never thought that my saviour would come 
I think it's amazing 
I think it's amazing 
I think you're amazing 
You tried to save me from myself 
Said 'Darling kiss as many as you want! 
My love's still available 
And I know that you are insatiable' 
We're like victims of the same disease 
Look at your Big Bad Daddy, and your mom 
And your mom.. 
was always acting crazy 
I was going down for the third time 
My heart was broken, 
I thought that loving you was out of the question 
Then I saw my reflection 
Saying please don't let this go 
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise 
The day you walked in changed my life 
I think it's amazing 
The way love can set you free 
So now I walk in the midday sun 
I never thought that my saviour would come 
I think it's amazing 
I think you're amazing 
Celebrate the love of the one you're with 
Celebrate, this life with you baby 
I think you should celebrate yeah 
Don't put your love in chains baby 
No, no, walk in the midday sun 
I thought I was dreaming 
I think it's amazing 
I think you're amazing 
I said celebrate the love of the one you're with 
As this life gets colder 
And the devil inside 
tells you to give up</field>

Horny cowboy with yours stars and stripes 
Bringing the light into my day 
With that Texan smile 
Too afraid to love, to hope that you would stay 
So broken that I never saw you chase the past away 
My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight) 
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night 
Takes away thata fear that I carried forever 
You stopped to wipe away my tears 
And you stayed forever and more 
(I don't think that I...) 
Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December 
Allalone I watched the eagles fly 
Even the light seemed to have changed 
In the Californian sky 
Through all of those battles then you came 
Stepped out of the fading light 
Said, "Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again, 
Because I'm here to save your life" 
My American Angel, he desn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight) 
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night 
Takes away thata fear that I carried forever 
You stopped to wipe away my tears 
But you stayed forever amore 
And more, didn't you baby... 
Because I don't think that I could love and lose again 
I don't think I have the strength 
I don't think I have the strength 
I don't think that I...</field>

For the ones who love me 
To think I thought I could be some kind of family man 
I told myself I was straight 
But I shouldn’t have worried 
‘Cos my Maker had a better plan for me 
And I’m dancing with the freaks now 
I'm havin’, I’m havin’ so much fun 
What you sow is what you reap now 
I’ll do my dance with everyone 
I’ve been getting too much Sun 
(Yes I’m dancin’ with the freaks now) 
We’re havin’, we’re havin’ too much fun for them 
Look who’s talking Guilty feet now… 
Well let me tell you people 
It’s an easier affair 
Not living my life with other people on my mind 
No, got nothing to hide from anyone 
Yes, I’m walking on new air 
Just living my life 
Better believe I'm gonna get what’s mine 
See I don’t have the time 
For the haters 
And all the time that I wasted 
How careless of me 
Too young and stupid to see 
I put my life in their hands 
(Gonna look for Cupid, man) 
Oh, and I know that they want me to hate them 
There’s no hurry 
I’ll just have to be the bigger man 
Dancin’ with the freaks now 
I’m havin’, I’m havin’ so much fun 
What you sow is what you reap now 
I’ll do my dance with everyone 
I’ve been getting too much Sun 
If I turn the other cheek now 
Would that be, would that be too much fun for them? 
Look who’s talking 
Guilty feet now… 
Well let me tell you people 
It’s an easier affair 
Not livin’ my life with other people on my mind 
No, got nothing to hide from anyone 
‘Cos I’m walking on new air 
Just living my life 
Better believe I’m gonna get what’s mine 
See I don’t have the time for the haters 
Don’t let them tell you who you are is not enough 
Don’t let them tell you that it’s wrong 
Or that you won’t find love 
Don’t let them use my life to put your future down 
Don’t let them tell you that happiness can’t be found 
For my life 
Take it to the streets 
There are stories you can keep 
They’re just passing you by 
Don’t let them tell you who you are is not enough 
Don’t let them tell you that it’s wrong 
Or that you won’t find love 
Don’t let them use my life to put your future down 
Don’t let them tell you that happiness can’t be found</field>

Asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life 
Has given love a guarantee 
To last through forever 
And another day 
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow 
Could make me the past 
But that I mustn't fear 
Cause you're here 
Now I know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've felt behind 
And I'll be loving you always 
Until the rainbow burns 
The stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers 
Every mountain high 
Until the dolphin fly 
And parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life 
And life becomes a dream 
(now ain't that loving you?) 
Until the day is night 
And night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas 
Just up and fly away 
Until the day that 
Eight times eight times eight is four 
Until the day that is the day 
That are no more 
Did you know that true love 
Asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life 
Has given love a guarantee

Dear mummy, Dear Daddy, 
You had plans forme, I was your only son. 
And long before this baby boy could count to three, 
You knew just what he would become. 
Run along to school, 
No child of mine grows up a fool, 
Run along to school. 
When you tried to tell me what to do, 
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you, 
One thing that I know for sure- 
BAD BOYS 
Stick together, never Sad Boys 
GOOD GUYS 
They made rules for fools, so get wise... 
Dear Mummy, Dear Daddy, 
Now I'm nineteen as you see, 
I'm handsome, tall, and strong. 
So what the hell gives you the right to look at me, 
As if to say "Hell, what went wrong?" 
Where were you last night? 
You look as if you had a fight. 
Where were you last night? 
Well I think that you may just be right, 
But don't try to keep me in tonight, 
Because I'm big enough to break down the door. 
BAD BOYS 
Stick together, never Sad Boys 
GOOD GUYS 
They made rules for fools, so get wise... 
Boys like you, are bad through and through. 
Still, girls like me, always seem to be with you.... 
We can't help but worry, 
You're in such a hurry, 
Mixing with the wrong boys, 
Playing with the wrong toys. 
Easy girls, 
And late nights, 
Cigarettes, and love bites 
Why do you have to be so cruel? 
YOU'RE SUCH A FOOL

Stick together, never Sad Boys

They made rules for fools, so get wise....</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You ask too much of me 
You try my patience 
Your tongue - it's like a razor 
You choose your words like weapons 
Here we go - Battlestations 
I never have the guts to let you look inside 
I don't think you'd appreciate the things that I hide 
CHORUS: 
Monday was the worst day 
And Friday wasn't my day 
But Wednesday was the best day 
Because on Wednesday night we made love 
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey 
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head 
Used to be your baby when you had no money 
Now we spend more time in battle 
Than we ever do in bed 
(Than we ever do in bed) 
You don't know how much I hate that answer phone 
Are you standing there? 
But - you won't pick up the 'phone 
Why lie to my face? 
(When you can buy a tape machine to give me bullshit in your place) 
Today I did something I thought I'd never do 
I opened up your diary and read about you 
CHORUS 
Monday was the worst day 
Wednesday we made love 
And Friday - ooh but - 
Saturday, is today, is what I'm thinking of 
Come in baby- come in close 
(Take off your designer clothes) 
'Cos you know what I'm thinking of 
Do you remember me, do you remember us - 
Do you remember love? 
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey 
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head 
Used to be your baby when you had no money 
Now we spend more time in battle 
Than we ever do in bed 
(Than we ever do in bed) 
La premiere fois tu m'as fait beaucoup rire 
Tu etais si mignon, et tu jouais du piano 
Maintenant, mon mellieur ami c'est l'argent 
Au revoir, cheri.</field>

And every day, I seem to laugh a little less 
Living this way, it seems my sky's a little darker 
You went away and left me lonely in success 
(Can't you see I'm falling apart) (Repeat) 
Can't you see what's happenin' to me 
Take this hand and show my fingers where my heart is 
Understand, you may just save me from despair 
Watch this man, you'll see he can't stop what he has started 
Take this hand, you'll see right now there's no-one there 
(Can't you see I'm falling apart) 
You laugh at me as I fall 
(Can't you see I'm falling apart) 
Just tell me, tell me, give me one good reason 
Armed with love, I could save my heart 
But on my own I just can't make it 
I'm too weak to fight, so take it 
Armed with love, I could save my heart 
But instead I watch you die 
Armed with love, I could save my heart 
But on my own I just can't make it 
I'm too weak to fight, so take it 
Armed with love, I could save my heart 
Tell me why an I so blue..</field>

As I take your hand and lead to the dance floor 
As the music dies, something in your eyes 
Calls to mind the silver screen 
And all its sad good-byes 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you are not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
Time can never mend 
The careless whispers of a good friend 
To the heart and mind 
Ignorance is kind 
There's no comfort in the truth 
Pain is all you'll find 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you are not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste this chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
Never without your love 
Tonight the music seems so loud 
I wish that we could lose this crowd 
Maybe it's better this way 
We'd hurt each other 
with the things we'd want to say 
We could have been so good together 
We could have lived this dance forever 
But now who's gonna dance with me 
Please stay 
And I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you're not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given

From bastard to loser, hurt you, used you in every

When your heart`s in someone else`s hands 
Monkey see and monkey do 
Their wish is your command 
You`re not to blame 
Everyone`s the same 
All you do is love and love is all you do 
I should know by now the way I fought for you 
You`re not to blame 
Everyone`s the same 
I know you think that you`re safe 
Mister 
Harmless deception that keeps love at bay 
It`s the ones who resist that we most want to kiss 
Wouldn`t you say? 
Cowboys and angels 
They all have the time for you 
Why should I imagine 
That I`d be a find for you 
Why should I imagine 
That I`d have something to say 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
In your heart there`s a trace 
Of someone before 
When your heart`s in someone else`s plans 
Things you say and things you do 
They don`t understand 
It`s such a shame 
Always ends the same 
You can call it love but I don`t think it`s true 
You should know by now 
I`m not the boy for you 
You`re not to blame 
Always ends the same 
I know you think that you`re safe 
Sister 
Harmless affection that keeps things this way 
It`s the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss 
Who will pay 
Cowboys and angels 
They all take a shine to you 
Why should I imagine 
That I was designed for you 
Why should I believe 
That you would stay 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
Don`t you think that I know 
They hurt you before 
Take this man to your bed 
Maybe his hands 
Will help you forget 
Please be stronger than your past 
The future may still give you a chance</field>

But I'm so scared 
Got myself in trouble, so much trouble 
I know I've got to make it 
But I just can't take New York 
My middle name is fear 
I have a vacant stare 
And it's been so long since my body's been warm 
I know I've got to make it 
But I just can't take New York 
I came here 
All dreams and wide eyes in the big, big city 
No family, no money 
And I don't even know what's hit me 
He hasn't seen a doctor 
Since he got here in the spring 
Went to the Medicentre 
But they wouldn't let him in 
Without a green card 
Life can be so hard 
Take pity on a man without a home of his own 
How could he ever have known? 
Every street and every corner 
Watch them drowning 
Watch them do the Crazyman Dance 
Men and Women to the slaughter 
We just stand and watch them 
Do the Crazyman Dance 
It's been one whole year 
And it's just not fair 
For all the pushing and shoving 
I've still got nothing 
I'm never gonna make it 
And I'm stuck here in New York 
So people don't come near 
Unless you've a dollar to spare 
'Cause you know what they say 
About madmen on the subways of New York 
Believe it 
Yesterday's newspapers 
I wrap them around my body 
Outside these skyscrapers 
I wait for the night to hit me 
And boy, does it hit me 
Every street and every corner 
Watch them drowning 
Watch them do the Crazyman Dance 
For a nickel or a quarter 
For your pleasure 
Watch them do the Crazyman Dance 
I'm coming to London 
I'm coming to Paris 
I'm coming to make you good clean people embarrassed 
Why don't you look at my face 
Why don't you look in my eyes 
You'd rather look at your feet 
You'd rather look at the skies 
Oh, you'd look anywhere 
But at a man whose pure existence 
Says 'I ain't got time' 
And I don't care 
I don't care 
You just don't care.</field>

Merry Christmas 
May your every New Year dream come true 
Sweet December song 
The melody that saved me 
On those less than silent nights 
When snow would fall upon my bed 
White sugar from Jesus 
And take me to the day 
She could always smile 
The Virgin Child would always show, you see 
Just to save me 
(Just to save me) 
There was always Christmas time 
To wipe the year away 
I guess that morning they?d decided 
That the war would have to wait 
There was always Christmas time 
Jesus came to stay 
I could believe in peace on Earth 
And I could watch TV all day 
So I dreamed of Christmas 
Maybe since you?ve gone 
I went a little crazy 
God knows they can see (the child) 
But the snow that falls upon my bed 
That loving I needed 
Falls every single day 
For each and every child 
The Virgin smiles for all to see 
But you kept her from me 
There was always Christmas time 
To wipe the year away 
I guess that morning they?d decided 
That the war would have to wait 
There was always Christmas time 
Jesus came to stay 
I could believe in peace on Earth 
And I could watch TV all day 
And so I dreamed of Christmas 
Yes, I dreamed like you 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
May your every New Year dream come true</field>

You would hurt my feelings, don't you see, my love ? 
I wish I had an ear like yours, 
A voice that would behave 
All I have is feeling 
And the voice God gave 
You insist my music goes against the rules 
Yes, but rules were never made for lovesick fools 
I wrote this song for you 
But you don't care 
It's a crooked song, ah, 
But my heart is there 
The thing that you would see if you would play the part 
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart 
I took your picture with my trusty Rolliflex 
And now all I have developed is complex 
Possibly in vain, I hope you weaken, oh my love 
And forget those rigid rules that undermine my dream of 
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand 
That even though I may be out of tune when I attempt to say 
How much I love you 
And all that matters is the message that I bring, 
Which is: my dear one, I love you.</field>

Performed by Band Aid 
Recorded on November 25, 1986 
It's Christmastime 
There's no need to be afraid 
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade 
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy 
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime 
But say a prayer 
Pray for the other ones 
At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun 
There's a world outside your window 
And it's a world of dread and fear 
Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears 
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging 
chimes of doom 
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you 
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime 
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life 
(Oooh) Where nothing ever grows 
No rain nor rivers flow 
Do they know it's Christmastime at all? 
(Here's to you) raise a glass for everyone 
(Here's to them) underneath that burning sun 
Do they know it's Christmastime at all? 
Feed the world 
Feed the world 
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again 
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When I ask those questions, baby 
It's just to get them out of my head 
Cause they turn around inside it 
Then they spill off to our bed 
Do I really want to know? 
Do I really want to know your life? 
Would I have to let you go? 
Could I listen to my heart if my head stops to think twice? 
When I've been a good boy 
When I've been a bad boy 
I have too much fun 
But baby so did everyone 
I've never been an angel 
But things are gonna change, change, change 
So do you really want to know? 
Do you really want to know my life? 
Would you have to let me go? 
Could you listen to your heart if your head stopped to think twice? 
If you knew every woman 
And I knew every man 
We never would have made it past holding hands 
I guess the saying is no longer true 
That what you don't know can hurt you 
I guess there is just no question, baby 
You know what you're doing in bed 
If I want your touch 
Should I know too much 
Some things are better left unsaid 
So do I really want to know? 
Do I really want to know your life? 
Would I have to let you go? 
Could I listen to my heart if my head starts to think twice? 
(Tell me baby, Cause one thing to guess is one thing to know, 
and don't you think that maybe baby I've got secrets of my own?) 
If I knew every woman 
And you knew every man 
We never would have made it past holding hands 
I used to say it but it's no longer true 
Cause what you don't know can really hurt you (Can kill you baby) 
And even as we speak 
The world is full of lovers.</field>

All my pictures seem to fade to black and white 
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me 
Frozen here on the ladder of my life 
It's much too late to save myself from falling 
I took a chance and changed your way of life 
But you misread my meaning when I met you 
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free 
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me 
I can't find, oh the right romantic line 
But see me once and see the way I feel 
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm 
But these cuts I have 
They need love to help them heal 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free 
Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby 
Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me</field>

But I could not bear to hear you 
Screaming to be set free 
I would chain you up 
If I'd thought you'd swear 
The only one that mattered was me, me, me 
I would strap you up 
But don't worry baby 
You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to 
It's too late to stop 
Won't the heavens save me? 
My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
Tell me that my soul's forgiven 
Hide you baby's eyes and we can... 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
One last time might be forever 
When the passion dies - 
It's just a matter of time before my heart is 
Looking for a home 
I'm like a maniac, at the end of the day 
I'm like a doggie barking at your door 
So come take me back to the place you stay 
And maybe we can do it once more 
You say I'm dangerous 
But don't worry baby 
I get excited at the things that you do 
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie 
'Cos no-one does it better than me and you 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
Tell me that my soul's forgiven 
Hide your baby's eyes and we can... 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
One last time might be forever 
Please don't tell me lies 
It's just a matter of time before my heart is 
Looking for a home 
I ain't got no more worries 
I'm gonna spend some times with you 
Loving you takes such courage 
And don't you think that I know it 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
You tell me that my soul's forgiven 
Hide your baby's eyes and we can... 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
One last time might be forever 
Don't you tell me lies, because believe me baby 
One day you'll wake up on your own. 
I ain't got no more worries 
I ain't got no more time for you 
Loving you takes such courage 
Everyone's got their eyes on you 
I ain't got no more worries 
I ain't got no more time for you 
Loving you takes such courage.</field>

I guess I must have loved you 
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, baby 
And now we're six months older 
And everything you want and everything you see 
Is out of reach not good enough 
I don't know what the hell you want from me 
Somebody tell me 
(won't you tell me) 
Why I work so hard for you 
(To give you money, work to give you money) 
Some people work for a living 
Some people work for fun 
Girl I just work for you 
They told me marriage was give and take 
Well you've shown me you can take 
You've got some giving to do 
And now you tell me that your having my baby 
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to 
But one step further and my back will break 
If my best isn't good enough 
Then how can it be good enough for two 
I can't work any harder than I do 
Somebody tell me 
(won't you tell me) 
Why I work so hard for you 
(To give you money, work to give you money) 
Oh why do I do the things I do 
I'd tell you if I knew 
My God, I don't even think that I love you 
(Won't you tell me) 
(To give you money, work to give you money) 
How could you settle 
For a boy like me 
When all I could see 
Was the end of the week 
All the things we sign 
And the things we buy 
Ain't gonna keep us together 
It's just a matter of time 
My situation 
Never changes 
Walking in and out of that door 
Like a stranger 
For the wages 
I give you all 
You say you want more 
And all I could see

Ain't gonna keep us together.</field>

Because I play them, too. 
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion, 
Time to pick my heart up off the floor. 
And when that love comes down without devotion, 
Well, it takes a strong man baby, but I'm 
Showing you the door, 
Cause I gotta have Faith 
I gotta have.. 
Faith 
Yes, I've gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith 
I gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith. 
Baby, I know you're asking me to stay 
Saying please, please, please don't go away 
You say I'm giving you the blues. 
Maybe you mean every word you say 
Can't help but think of yesterday 
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules 
Before this river becomes an ocean 
Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
Oh baby, I reconsider my foolish notion 
Well, I need someone to hold me, 
But I'll wait for something more. 
Cause I gotta have Faith... 
(repeat chorus) 
Before this river 
Becomes an ocean 
Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
(I've just got to have faith) 
I've reconsidered my foolish notion 
Yeah, I need someone to hold me, 
But I'll wait for something more....

Performed by David Bowie 
Fame, makes a man take things over 
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow 
Fame, puts you there, where things are hollow 
Fame 
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame 
that burns the change to keep you insane 
Fame 
Fame, what you like is in the Limo 
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow 
Fame, what you need you have to borrow 
Fame 
Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line 
to bind your time, it drives you to, ah, crime 
Fame 
Could it be the best, could it be? 
Really be, really, babe? 
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe? 
Really be, really, babe? 
Is it any wonder 
I reject you first? 
Fame, fame, fame, fame 
Is it any wonder 
you're too cool to fool 
Fame 
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me 
Got to get a rain-check on pain

There ain't much point in hanging around (Yea). 
One day you make me feel like your love is in my hands 
One day you say you'll stay 
The next you're changing your plans 
Hey little baby 
Ain't much point in hanging around (Yea). 
Cause' if you ain't got time for me I'll find another Fantasy. 
It is kind of funny that you think that 
I am the boy to make you cry 
I can make you happy 
If only for a while 
Little baby I can give you all the loving that your heart desires 
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another Fantasy. 
It could be the price of love 
Could the price of hate 
What am I guilty of 
Why do you make me wait 
So long I don't know your intentions. 
Look to the sky's above 
I am in the hands of fate 
Push till it gets to shove 
I have got to know for heavens sake 
Is this love or invention 
Baby can't you see I'll find another Fantasy. 
You hang around with people who are sure to make you cry 
I can make you happy if only for a while 
Little baby oh, oh little baby 
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires 
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another Fantasy. 
You take someone's heart 
And you kick it around 
Keep on picking it up 
So you can watch it come down 
I don't know what I am suppose to do 
Why I wait for you to make up your mind 
Would you please be so kind 
When you know what to do I'll be in the next room

You could help to ease my mind 
Baby, I aint Mr.Right 
But if your looking for fastlove 
If that's love in your eyes 
It's more than enough 
Had some bad luck 
So fastlove, is all that I've got on my mind 
What's there to think about baby? 
Looking for some affirmation 
Made my way into the sun 
My friends got their ladies, 
They're all having babies 
But I just want to have some fun 
I won't bore you with the details baby 
Got to get there in your own sweet time 
Let's just say that maybe 
You could help to ease my mind 
Baby, I aint Mr.Right

What's there to think about baby? 
Get yourself some lessons in love 
In the absence of security 
I made my way into the night 
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me 
But I see nothing in his eyes 
I miss my baby 
I miss my baby, oh yeah, tonight 
So, why don't we make a little room 
In my Bmw babe 
Searching for some peace of mind 
Hey I'll help you find it 
I do believe that we are practicing 
The same religion

Until the end of time 
That's all I wanted 
But sometimes love can be mistaken 
For a crime 
That's all I wanted 
Just to see my baby's 
Blue eyed shine 
This time I think that my lover 
Understands me 
If we have faith in each other 
Then we can be 
Strong 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine

If you are the desert 
I'll be the sea 
If you ever hunger 
Hunger for me 
Whatever you ask for 
That's what I'll be 
So when you remember the ones who have lied 
Who said that they cared 
But then laughed as you cried 
Beautiful Darling 
Don't think of me 
Because all I ever wanted 
It's in your eyes baby, baby 
And love can't lie, no... 
(Greet me with the eyes of a child) 
My love is always tell me to... 
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile) 
Just hold on, hold on 
I won't let you go, my baby 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
(So I am gonna love you) 
Until the end of time 
I will be your father 
I will be your preacher 
I will be your daddy 
I will be the one who loves you until the end of time</field>

You've got to go to the city, 
They're going to find you there 
'Cause you're beautiful 
'Cause you're beautiful 
Sometimes it brings you down 
Sometimes it eats you up 
Sometimes you think that your head's going to blow and 
It doesn't get better  
. 
Don't you know, you've got to go to the city 
You've got to reach the other side of the glass 
I think you'll make it in the city baby 
I think you know that you are more than just 
Some fucked up piece of ass 
More than just ... 
Sid you've got to think of something 
'Cause your job pays you nothing 
But you've got the things God gave you 
So the music may yet be your saviour 
Do you want a saviour, saviour 
Say that you do, 
You know you're wasted here, wasted here 
And there ain't no miracles happening any time soon ...</field>

I will not give you up 
Gotta have some faith in the sound 
It's the one good thing that I've got 
I won't let you down 
So please don't give me up 
Because I would really, really love to stick around 
Heaven knows I was just a young boy 
Didn't know what I wanted to be 
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy 
And I guess it was enough for me towin the race? 
A prettier face! 
Brand new clothes and a big fat place 
On your rock and roll TV 
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way 
Think I'm gonna get me some happy 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I told you so 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone else I've got to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Take back your singing in the rain 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies 
and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy 
What a kick just a buddy and me 
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy 
We were living in a fantasy 
We won the race 
Got out of the place 
I went back home got a brand new face 
For the boys on MTV 
But today the way I play the game has got to change 
Oh yeah 
Now I'm gonna get myself happy 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I stopped the show 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone I forgot to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Don't think that I'll be back again 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies 
and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Well it looks like the road to heaven 
But it feels like the road to hell 
When I knew which side my bread was buttered 
I took the knife as well 
Posing for another picture 
Everybody's got to sell 
But when you shake your ass 
They notice fast 
And some mistakes were built to last 
That's what you get 
I say that's what you get 
That's what you get for changing your mind 
And after all this time 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
I'll hold on to my freedom 
May not be what you want from me 
Just the way it's got to be 
Lose the face now 
I've got to live</field>

Was a jolly happy soul 
With a corn cop pipe 
And a button nose 
And two eyes 
Made out of coal 
Frosty the snowman 
Is a fairy tale they say 
He was made out of snow 
But the children know how 
He came to life one day 
There must of been 
Some magic in 
That ol' silk cap 
They found 
For when they placed it 
On his head 
He began to dance around 
Frosty the snowman 
Was alive as he could be 
And the children say 
He could laugh and play 
Just the same 
As you and me 
Frosty the snowman 
Knew the snow 
Was hot that day 
So he said lets run 
And have some fun 
Before I melt away 
Down to the village 
With a broom stick 
In his hand 
Runnin' here and there 
All around the square 
Sayin' catch me 
If you can 
He led them down 
The streets of town 
Right 
To the traffic cop 
And he only 
Paused a moment 
When he heard him 
Holler stop 
Frosty the snowman 
Had to hurry on his way 
But he 
Waved goodbye sayin' 
Please don't cry 
I'll be back again 
Some day</field>

I'm so tired of you America 
Making my own way home 
Ain't gonna be alone 
I got a life to lead America 
I got a life to lead 
Tell me do you really think you go to hell for having loved? 
Tell me and not for thinking 
every thing that you've done is good 
(I really need to know) 
After soaking the body of Jesus Christ in blood 
I'm so tired of America 
(I really need to know) 
I may just never see you again or might as well 
You took advantage of a world that loved you well 
I'm going to a town that has already been burned down 
I'm so tired of you America

Ain't gonna be alone 
I got a life to lead America 
I got a life to lead

I got a dream to heed 
And that's all I need

With a gun that he polished for a rainy day 
A smile and a quote from a vigilante move 
Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away 
He said it made him crazy 
Twenty five years living 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep 
She needs her mother but her mother is dead 
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget 
Just another hooker 
It happens everyday 
She loved her little baby 
But she couldn't bear to see her living 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
I believe in the gods of America 
I believe in the land of the free 
But no one told me 
No one told me 
That the gods believe in nothing 
So with empty hands I pray 
And from day to hopeless day 
They still don't see me 
See me 
Everybody talks about the new generation 
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind 
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation 
Like to help you buddy but I haven't got the time 
Somebody shouted save me 
But everybody started living 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
There's a big white lady 
On a big white doorstep 
She asked her daddy and her daddy said yes 
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get 
Has to give a little they say its for the best 
Somebody shouted maybe 
But they kept on living 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
So she ran to the arms of America 
And she kissed the powers that be 
And someone told me 
Someone told me 
That the gods believe in nothing 
So with empty hands I pray 
And I tell myself one day 
They just might see me.</field>

Then you-take off those brand new shoes 
Say 'Hey George, what've you got to lose?'

But a whole lot more than you' 
I can make you happy (yeah, yeah)

I can make you happy 
Boys and Girls 
The ones who kiss and tell 
Why should we have to believe them? 
No, I don't understand 
How any woman, how any man 
Can say 'Lay me down, lay me down' 
For that big stash-cheap cash-think about the money 
I can make you happy (yeah, yeah) 
Don't you know that? 
He said 
I can make you happy 
I've seen you in the corner 
With your rub-it-on tan 
Hitching a ride 
Could be a woman or a man 
Gonna get what you want before too long 
Gonna take your opportunities 
Right or wrong 
Some poor cow with a seven-year itch?

A September morning with the sun and smell of the clover 
Down by the gates we sit and watch all our friends go by 
And pretend we don't hear the bell that rings through the 
summer sky 
I was happy with the kisses she gave me 
It's just that happy was she made me 
Happy that was until I saw you 
Chorus: 
Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you fail me now? 
You hurt me, desert me in my darkest hour 
Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you keep me here? 
How could I help but admire her beauty 
Standing on the line between desire and duty 
Heartbeat, heartbeat, it will end in tears 
I need a lover that loves such a dangerous place to be 
Oh, if we were meant for each other then why don't you answer me 
Don't keep me waiting, you know that I long to be by your side 
I was happy with the kisses she gave me 
Now there's nothing on earth that can save me 
Why should I care I can have you?.</field>

Here am I encased inside a hollow shell

Will open up our merging hearts 
And feed our empty souls 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 
Without despair, we will share 
And the joys of caring will not be erased 
What has been, must never end 
The joys of caring will not be replaced 
When the seeds of love have planted firm 
They won't be hard to find 
And the songs of love I sing to you 
Will echo in my mind 
Hey! 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 
I said. 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.

Turn down these voices inside my head 
Lay down with me, tell me no lies 
Just hold me close, don't patronize 
Don't patronize me 
'Cause I can't make you love me If you don't 
You can't make your heart feel something it won't 
Here in the dark in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power 
But you won't, no you won't 
And I can't make you love me 
If you don't 
I'll close my eyes and then I won't see 
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me 
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right 
Just give me till then, to give up this fight 
And I will give up this fight 
And I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel something it won't 
And here in the dark in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power 
But you won't, no, you won't 
And I can't make you love me 
If you don't 
Ain't no use in you trying 
It's no good for me baby without love 
All my tears, all these years, everything I believed in 
Baby 
Oh yeah 
Someone's gonna love me.</field>

And wins the battle 
I know the taste of victory 
Though I went through some nights 
Consumed by the shadows 
I was crippled emotionally 
Somehow I made it through the heartache 
Yes I did, I escaped 
I found my way out of the darkness, 
Kept my faith (I know you did) 
Kept my faith 
When the river was deep I didn't falter 
When the mountain was high I still believed 
When the valley was low iit didn't stop me, no no 
I knew you were waiting 
I knew you were waiting for me 
With and endless desire I kept on searching 
Sure in time our eyes would meet 
Like the bridge is on fire 
The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free 
No, I don't regret a single moment 
No I don't looking back 
When I think of all those disappointments 
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh 
When the river was deep I didn't falter 
When the mountain was high I still believed 
When the valley was low iit didn't stop me, no no 
I knew you were waiting 
I knew you were waiting for me 
So we were drawn together through destiny 
I know this love we share was meant to be 
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting</field>

And things that you know 
There's boys you can trust 
And girls that you don't 
There's little things you hide 
And little things that you show 
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it 
But you don't and that's just the way it goes 
I swear I won't tease you 
Won't tell you no lies 
I don't need no bible 
Just look in my eyes 
I've waited so long baby 
Now that we're friends 
Every man's got his patience 
And here's where mine ends 
CHORUS 
I want your sex 
I want your love 
I want your sex 
I want your.. 
sex 
It's playin' on my mind 
It's dancin' on my soul 
It's takin' so much time 
So why don't you just let me go 
I'd really like to try 
Oh, I'd really like to know 
When you tell me you're gonna regret it 
Then I tell you that i love you but you still say no 
I swear I won't tease you 
Won't tell you no lies 
I don't need no bible 
Just look in my eyes 
I've waited so long baby 
Out in the cold 
I can't take much more girl 
I'm losing control 
CHORUS 
I want your sex 
I want your love 
I want your sex 
I want your.. 
sex 
It's natural 
It's chemical 
(Let's do it) 
It's logical 
Habitual 
(Can we do it?) 
It's sensual 
But most of all 
Sex is something that we should do 
Sex is something for me and you 
Sex is natural, sex is good 
Not everybody does it, but everybody should 
Sex is natural, sex is fun 
Sex is best when it's (one on one) 
(One on one) 
(Huaah) (Sex) 
I'm not your father 
(Huaah) (Sex) 
I'm not your brother 
(Huuah) (Sex)

Baby, I'm your man 
You bet! 
If you're gonna do it, do it right - right? 
Do it with me 
So good... 
You're divine 
Wanna take you, wanna make you 
But they tell me it's a crime! 
Everybody knows where the good people go 
But where we're going baby 
Ain't no such word as no! 
Baby, I'm your man (don't you know who I am?) 
Baby, I'm your man 
You bet! 
If you're gonna do it, do it right - right?

Come on baby, (ooh, take me home 
Please don't leave me here, to do it on my own...) 
First class information 
I'll be your sexual inspiration 
And with some stimulation 
We can do it right... 
So why waste time 
With the other guys? 
When you can have mine 
I ain't askin' for no sacrifice 
Baby your friends do not need to know! 
I've got a real nice place to go 
Listen, 
I don't need you to care 
I don't need you to understand 
All I want is for you to be there 
And when I'm turned on 
If you want me- 
I'm your man! 
If you're gonna do it, do it right - right? 
Do it with me 
Now listen 
If you're gonna do it - you know what I say? 
If you're gonna do it don't throw it away 
Don't throw it baby 
Because 
I'll be your boy, I'll be your man 
I'll be the one who understands 
I'll be your first, I'll be your last 
I'll be the only one you ask 
I'll be your friend, I'll be your toy 
I'll be the one who brings you joy 
I'll be your hope, I'll be your pearl 
I'll take you halfway 'round the world! 
I'll make you rich - I'll make you poor 
Just don't use the door.</field>

Tripping on a high wire 
Bulldog stubborn, born uneven 
A classless creature, a man for all seasons 
But don't bet them 
They can't take him 
To the very bottom 
Because they made him and they'll waste him 
And I don't believe that I want to watch them 
`Cause the fifties shifted out of gear 
He was an idol then, now he's an idol here 
But his face has changed, he's not the same no more 
And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before 
He was tight-assed 
Walking on broken glass 
Highly prized in the wallet size 
The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes 
But don't pretend that it won't end 
In the depth of your despair 
You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes 
To peanuts from the lion's share</field>

No sign of life since '75 
Then one day he just, what do you know 
I guess God just called his number 
He called me up he called me up and said: 
"I've been awake about a week 
I'm thinking about asking the doctor 
If he could put me back to sleep" 
Then he laughed and said: 
"Hey all the girls they look the same" 
Don't they know just what their mothers 
Paid in blood, and tears to change 
But the words that made me cry 
The thing he softly said 
It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head 
He said: "If Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?" 
Youth, beautiful youth 
We walked through the walls until we found the truth 
And said: "Change it, it's ugly just change it" 
Everyone we used to know 
Must have given up, so long ago 
You can see it, it's written on their faces 
And the inside of their clothes 
But the words that made me cry 
'Cause I knew just what they meant 
He turned to me and said: 
"Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?" 
"Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come Marvin and Elvis are dead?" 
I said: "If Jesus Christ is going to save us from ourselves 
How come peace, love and Elvis are dead?"</field>

Racism in future kings can only lead to no good 
And besides, all our sons and daughters already 
Know that feels 
It was the third of september 
That day I?ll always remember, yes I will 
´Cause that was the day that my daddy died 
Never had a chance to see him, no 
Never heard nothin? but bad things about him 
Mama, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth 
Mama just hung her head and said 
(Chorus) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
Hey, mama, is it true what they say 
That papa never worked a day in his life 
Some bad talks going around sayin? 
Papa had three outside children 
And anouther wife 
That ain?t right 
Heard some talks about papa and his storefront 
Preachin? 
Talkin? about saving souls and all the time 
Leaching 
And dealing in the dirt 
Stealin? in the name of the lord 
But mama she just said 
(Chorus) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades 
Is that what sent papa to an early grave? 
Folks say papa would bag, borrow of steal just 
To pay his bills 
Hey, mama, folks say papa was ever much on thinkin? 
Spent most of this time chasin? women and drinkin? 
But mouther, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth 
But my mama she just said 
(Chorus 2x) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
But my mama she said 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Oh my mama said 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
And when he died 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
All he left us 
All he left us 
Can you believe he left us? 
All alone yeah 
All alone yeah 
All alone yeah 
Yeah.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You are far 
When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
Strange that you were strong enough 
To even make a start 
But you'll never find 
Peace of mind 
Till you listen to your heart 
People 
You can never change the way they feel 
Better let them do just what they want 
For they will 
If you let them 
Steal your heart from you 
People 
Will always make a lover feel a fool 
But you knew I loved you 
We could have shown them all 
We should have seen love through 
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes 
Covered me with kisses and lies 
So goodbye 
But please don't take my heart 
You are far 
But I'm never gonna be your star 
I'll pick up the pieces 
And mend my heart 
Maybe I'll be strong enough 
I don't know where to start 
But I'll never find 
Peace of mind 
While I listen to my heart 
People... 
You can never change the way they feel 
Better let them do just what they want 
For they will 
If you let them 
Steal your heart from you 
People 
Will always make a lover feel a fool 
But you knew I loved you 
We could have shown them all 
We should have seen love through 
But remember this 
Every other kiss 
That you ever give 
Long as we both live 
When you need the hand of another man 
One you really can surrender with 
I will wait for you 
Like I always do 
There's something there 
That can't compare with any other 
You are far 
When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
Strange that I was wrong enough 
To think you'd love me too 
I guess you were kissing a fool 
You must have been kissing a fool</field>

CHORUS: 
Last Christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
CHORUS 
Once bitten and twice shy 
I keep my distance 
But you still catch my eye 
Tell me baby 
Do you recognize me? 
Well 
It's been a year 
It doesn't surprise me 
HAPPY CHRISTMAS 
I wrapped it up and sent it 
With a note saying "I love you" 
I meant it 
Now I know what a fool I've been 
But if you kissed me now 
I know you'd fool me again 
CHORUS 
Crowded room 
Runs with tired eyes 
I'm hiding from you 
And your solemn eyes 
My god I thought you were 
Someone to rely on 
Me? 
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man undercover but you tore me apart 
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again 
CHORUS 2x 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man undercover but you tore him apart 
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You're top man on the scene 
You don't think life comes in between 
But hey, she's just seventeen 
She feels that she's a worldly girl 
But man you've been around the world 
She is just some worried daddy's girl 
Even though there's nothing I can say 
Its just human nature any way 
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on a dime 
Let her down easy 
And you'll grow up in time 
In her strawberry eyes 
The way she sees you signifies 
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies 
But if you must lay her down 
May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown 
And please do not lead her on when you leave town 
Even though there's nothing I can say 
Its just human nature any way 
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on the line 
Let her down easy 
And you'll grow up in time 
She's a woman now 
With a daughter to make her proud 
In her crayon world of paper clouds 
She still remembers you 
The first boy that she gave it to 
And she laughs at how little then she knew 
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on the line 
Let her down easy 
And you'll grow up in time</field>

Say goodbye, don't tell me why you have to go 
Loving you was as good as gold (as good as gold) 
I'd love to love you, really love you 
BUT you see, there's something you should know 
I really didn't think you'd go 
Because today 
I could have sworn I heard you say 
I love you 
I want you 
I need to be with you 
Today 
I saw something in your face 
Stay here 
Beside me 
I need your love to hide me 
You lied 
And now you've gone away.</field>

To find the right dress to wear

Heads turn around 
Here she comes 
To take her crown 
Is there a time to walk for cover 
A time for kiss and tell 
Is there a time for different colors 
Different names you find it hard to spell 
Is there a time for first communion 
A time for east 17 
Is there a time to turn the mecca 
Is there a time to be a beauty queen

Beauty plays the crown 
Here she comes 
Surreal in her crown

Oltre i confini

Dici che come fiume

L'amore 
E non so pi pregare 
E nell'amore non so pi sperare 
E quell'amore non so pi aspettare

Love

And I cannot hope in love anymore 
And I cannot wait for love anymore

His father's eyes 
He's a soldier waiting for war 
Time will come 
He'll hold a gun 
His father's son 
And as he grows 
He hears the band 
Takes the step from boy to man 
And at the shore she waves her son goodbye 
Like the man she did before 
Mothers pride 
Just a boy 
His country's eyes 
He's a soldier waving at the shore 
And in her heart the time has come 
To lose a son 
And all the husbands, all the sons, all the lovers gone 
They make no difference 
No difference in the end 
Still hear the woman say your daddy died a hero 
In the name of God and man 
Mothers pride 
Crazy boy 
His lifeless eyes 
He's a soldier now forevermore 
He'll hold a gun till kingdom come

I've seen things I never wanted to see 
I've got to get back on my feet 
I feel like I've been sleeping 
sweet, sweet time 
has been a real good friend of mine 
waiting for that change of season 
of the winter's been so long 
searching for that rhyme or reason 
you've just got to 
move on 
hold it together, move on 
life's so short, move on 
only time will set you free 
you put your fears behind you better get yourself where you wanna be 
I think of all the days and nights I spent crying 
and I move on 
I've been in and out of favour with love 
because I gotta tell you 
I've been things I never wanted to be 
and then some angel called me up 
he told me I was sleeping 
said don't waste time 
cos even angels say goodbye 
waiting for that change of season 
oh the winter's been so long 
searching for that rhyme or reason 
you've just got to 
move on... 
and oh, there goes another season 
getting hard to find a decent song to play 
but oh, I guess I got my reasons 
everybody thinks I'm doing a.o.k 
they ought to know by now

better get yourself where you wanna be

They say that I was born on the day that he died 
"Someone to cling to", she said 
"When all the noises and the shame came calling" 
My mother had a brother 
I thought I knew them all, I thought I knew 
But she lied 
I said: "Show me his face again, tell me again why he died" 
She said he couldn't wait for the things that I've seen 
She said he wasn't strong enough, he never dared to dream a life like mine 
My mother had a brother 
Over-sensitive and kind 
Seems it all became too much for him 
It seems he took his own life 
Mum, I can't imagine the joy and pain in equal measure 
Tears in the dirt, and all over your newborn treasure 
I guess he had to wait until my momma had me 
I guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free 
In endless sky..... 
But mama will you tell him from your boy 
The times they changed 
I guess the world was getting warmer 
And we got stronger 
Mother will you tell him about my joy 
I live each day for him 
The sun came out, yeah 
And I'm just breathing it in 
My mother had a brother 
Same desire, different time 
Seems the empty spaces tortured him 
Until he took his own life 
I don't know why I waited so long for love 
I just don't know what I was thinking of 
All that wasted time 
But mama will you tell him from your boy 
The times they changed 
I guess the world was getting warmer 
While we got stronger 
Mother will you tell him about my joy 
I live each day with him 
Your son came out, yeah 
And I'm still breathing it in 
And I swear now that freedom is here 
I'm gonna taste it all for you boy 
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn 
I'm making so much love 
(I'm making so much love) 
So those of us who have nothing to fear 
We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it 
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned 
I'm making so much love 
(I'm making so much love) 
I was a prisoner, but he saved me 
Broke into my dreams and said: "Who cares?" 
I was a prisoner, so disgrace me 
I'm glad to be home 
And I don't believe they care</field>

I touch your hair, I kiss your skin, 
And hope the morning sun won't wake you too soon. 
For when you wake, and look at me, 
You never know, you just might see, 
Another boy who crept in your room... 
Take your time...(that's what you told me), 
Take your time... 
But I fell head first, and I just don't know what to do. 
Chorus: 
Nothing looks the same in the light, 
Only a fool like me would take to heart, 
The things you said you meant last night. 
Nothing looks the same in the light, 
I'll keep my feet firm on the ground. 
Nothing looks the same in the light, 
There's danger in a stranger, 
With a warm hand and a kiss so right. 
Nothing looks the same in the light, 
It's been a pleasure, - see you around... 
I watch the sun, upon the sheets. 
I hear a car, out on the street, 
And gently pull you close, it's over too soon. 
What can I do, but wait and see, 
Hold on to you, please stay with me, 
Because you're the first, and I want to stay here with you.

Say you love me

Just let me go 
Cause teacher 
There are things that I don't want to learn 
And the last one I had 
Made me cry 
So I don't want to learn to 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because there ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Whose teacher has told him goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
When you were just a stranger 
And I was at your feet 
I didn't feel the danger 
Now I feel the heat 
That look in your eyes 
Telling me no 
So you think that you love me 
Know that you need me 
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong 
Just let me go 
And teacher 
There are things 
That I don't want to learn 
Oh the last one I had 
Made me cry

Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine

Goodbye 
Goodbye 
So when you say that you need me 
That you'll never leave me 
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong 
Let me go 
And teacher 
There are things 
That I still have to learn 
But the one thing I have is my pride 
Oh so I don't want to learn to 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because there ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who just isn't willing to try 
I'm so cold 
Inside 
Maybe just one more try</field>

Take me to the places that I love best 
So my angels she says, don't you worry

Got no friends in high places 
And the game that you gave away 
Wasn't worth playing

In the meantime 
Take me to the places that I love best

Doctor won't you do with me what you can 
You see I think about it all the time 
Twenty four seven 
You say you want it, you got it 
I never really said it before 
There's nothing here but flesh and bone 
There's nothing more, nothing more 
There's nothing more

Getting on back to -

There's nothing more, nothing more

Dancing on the d-train baby 
When the moon is high 
And the grass is jumpin' 
Come on, just keep on funkin' 
Keep on funkin', just keep on funkin'</field>

`Cause that was the day that my daddy died 
Never had a chance to see him, no 
Never heard nothin` but bad things about him 
Mama, I`m depending on you to tell me the truth 
Mama just hung her head and said 
Chorus 
"Papa was a rollin` stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
And when he died 
All he left us was alone" (repeat) 
Hey, Mama, is it true what they say 
That Papa never worked a day in his life 
Some bad talk going around sayin` 
Papa had there outside children 
And another wife 
That ain`t right 
Heard some talk about Papa and his storefront 
Preachin` 
Talkin` about saving souls and all the time 
Leaching 
And dealing in dirt 
Stealin` in the name of the Lord 
But Mama she just said 
Chorus 
Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades 
Is that what sent Papa to an early grave? 
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow or steal just 
To pay his bills. 
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin` 
Spent most of his time chansin` women and drinkin` 
But Mother, I`m depending on you to tell me the

Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table? 
Such destruction, and pure white castles in the sand 
No time for introduction 
With all that money changing hands 
And the satellite says, "Take a look at all we have" 
But the old man says, 
"You want my family, for your liberty...I can't do that." 
Look into the eyes of any patient man 
Whether they be amber, green or blue, 
There's a piece of God staring back at you 
But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves 
They see our broken women 
On imaginary shelves 
But the satellite says, "Won't you people look at all we have? 
Don't you want it? 
Can't you see the things that you lack?" 
Children in his arms, he turns his back.</field>

They will not be the last 
Look around now 
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers 
This is the year of the hungry man 
Whose place is in the past 
Hand in hand with ignorance 
And legitimate excuses 
The rich declare themselves poor 
And most of us are not sure 
If we have too much 
But we'll take our chances 
Because god's stopped keeping score 
I guess somewhere along the way 
He must have let us all out to play 
Turned his back and all god's children 
Crept out the back door 
And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate 
Hanging on to hope 
When there is no hope to speak of 
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late 
Well maybe we should all be praying for time 
These are the days of the empty hand 
Oh you hold on to what you can 
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year 
This is the year of the guilty man 
Your television takes a stand 
And you find that what was over there 
Is over here 
So you scream from behind your door 
Say "what's mine is mine and not yours" 
I may have too much but I'll take my chances 
Because god's stopped keeping score 
And you cling to the things they sold you 
Did you cover your eyes when they told you 
That he can't come back 
Because he has no children to come back for 
It's hard to love, there's so much to hate</field>

From the stars to my home, down through the stone, 
I could have been so alone, 
Without my precious box 
Have I a family? I guess not 
I’ve never seen a lot of beauty 
In my life. 
Well in your house there are servants, and the lights all dim 
Such a beautiful home, your agent’s on the phone, they never 
leave you alone 
The party never stops! 
You say that’s fantasy, I say “So what, I need a little beauty…” 
So let me in, 
You know you’ve kind of got under my skin 
You know we never see a lot of the action round here 
My dear 
You may want to strip again 
And you look so fine in your Gucci suit 
And you’re making more money than your daddy 
could have imagined 
But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time 
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb 
Don’t you know that the moment will come 
I will find someone like you 
But with something extra, I’m sorry baby 
I don’t know why 
I don’t know why that is 
The systematic breakdown of my community 
You know I hate my job, I try to save but God 
There’s just never enough 
Switch on, the pressure - stops 
You know the one for me, she’s on Fox 
And she’s a little beauty… 
Give me your life, give me your life, I want it 
Because lately, it’s so freezing out here 
(This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass) 
In so many ways, but you make it good 
Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could 
(This side of the glass…) 
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb 
Don’t you know that the moment will come 
I will find someone like you 
But with something extra, I’m so sorry baby 
I don’t know why 
I don’t know why that is 
Precious keeps me company 
Keeps me from being alone 
Because no-one comes in the morning 
No-one comes in the evening time 
I’d sit and wait for the phone to ring 
I could be waiting my whole damn life 
So sick of the same old faces 
In this street, where nobody talks to me 
And the funny side of the situation is 
I don’t care, I’ll always be there 
When you come down from the sky 
And make yourself at home 
In my house 
Because these days it’s the money the money 
The money, honey, or your life 
I said don’t you know you can’t have both 
Stop acting so dumb 
The moment will come 
I will find someone like you 
Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby 
I don’t know why (something) 
Said I don’t know why that is 
You may want to strip again 
You may want to let me in 
You may want to sacrifice 
More than you think is fair or right 
You may want to think again 
You may want to watch your friends 
You may want to change your mind 
You may wish you could turn back time</field>

I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game 
They went walking and she took his name 
Round here 
There was dancing in the afternoons those days 
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made 
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same 
Frightened little girl, she makes a break 
Into the arms of.. 
something better 
Round here 
I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park 
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark 
Waiting patiently to make my mark 
Round here 
And I remember my first day at school 
And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool 
I remember it all, like yesterday 
Don't you 
Every time I try to leave this place 
Something inside says: "You can do better" 
Round here 
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived 
I want to put my hands in this earth again 
Music fell like rain to the streets 
The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat 
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world 
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space 
Is the place of my birth 
When all that I wanted, was to be someone. 
Two little Hitlers in an old church hall 
Some cheesy covers and those neighbours that banged on the walls 
Andy says it's time to show them all 
Round here 
Please sir, we two have other plans 
Please sir you would not understand, 
What's going on 
Is magical, can't you see 
That some of us do more than dream 
Every time I try to leave this place 
Something inside says: "Keep on keeping, on and on..." 
Around here 
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived 
I want to put my hands in this earth again 
Music fell like rain to the streets 
The Specials and The Jam, ABC 
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world 
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space 
Is the place of my birth 
My birth, 
In this town, 
Yes I guess I got to be someone 
To be somebody 
In the Beautiful city 
This place I call home 
These streets of London 
It's everything I know (everything and everybody) 
On the streets of London 
I want to thank you 
My daddy got here on the gravy train</field>

that lived within the heart of me 
all too soon my secret love 
became impatient to be free 
so I told a friendly star 
the way that dreamers often do 
just how wonderful you are 
and why I'm so in love with you 
now I shout it from the highest hill 
I even told you the golden dafodill 
at least my heart's an open door 
and my secret love's no secret anymore 
now I shout it from the highest hill 
I even told you the golden dafodill 
at least my heart's an open door 
and my secret love's no secret 
my secret love's no secret 
my secret love's no secret anymore.</field>

Why can't you reach inside

Like I have for you

Don't tell me how a man should be 
Some would say if you knew 
You wouldn't be here with me 
I love you 
I still love you 
But I guess it's time to let you be 
'Cause I have no secrets from you 
And I have nothing left to hide 
And I'm so tired of all these questions 
'Cause maybe you just changed your mind 
Like I have 
Like I have 
Like I have 
Like I have 
When I was at your doorstep 
You told me to look around 
Said come in 
You and your heart sit down 
But you'd better watch your step 
'Cause you're not far from the ground 
And one fine day this all falls down 
Like I have 
Like I have

Five o'clock in the morning, 
you ain't home 
I can't help thinking that's strange 
Baby I just want you to know 
I won't go through it again 
Yes, those clouds are closing in 
[Chorus] 
And I will not accept this as a part of my life 
I will not live in fear, 
of what may be 
And the lessons I have learned... 
I would rather be alone than watch you, 
spinning that wheel for me 
You've got a thing about danger 
ain't you getting what you want from me 
You've got a thing about strangers 
baby that's what we used to be 
You've got a thing about danger baby 
I guess the hungry just can't see 
One of these days 
you're gonna bring some home to me 
 
Six o'clock in the morning 
you ain't phone 
I can't help thinking that's strange 
It seems that everybody takes their chances 
these days 
Oh yeah we're standing in the rain 
[Chorus] 
How can you love me 
When you are playing with my life 
You say give me time and I'll do better I swear 
Give me time and I'll lead you back to despair 
and I don't want to go back there

George Michael 
I’ve had enough of danger 
People are on the streets 
I’m looking out for Angels 
Just tryin’ to find some peace 
I think its time 
That you let me know 
So if you love me, say you love me 
But if you don’t just let me go 
Cuz teacher there are things that I don’t want to learn 
And the last one I had made me cry 
So I don’t wanna learn to hold you, touch you 
I think that your mine 
Because there ain’t no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who’s teacher has told him Good bye 
Goodbye...Goodbye 
When you were just a stranger 
And I was at your feet 
I didn’t feel the danger 
Now I feel the heat 
That look in your eyes 
Tellin’ me no 
So you think that you love me 
Know that you need me 
I wrote this song, I know its wrong, Just let me go 
Teacher there are things that I don’t want to learn 
And the last one I had made me cry 
So I don’t wanna learn to hold you, touch you 
I think that your mine 
Cuz there ain’t no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who’s teacher has told him Goodbye… 
So when you say that you need me 
That you'll never leave me 
I know your wrong, your not that strong 
Let me go 
And teacher there are things that I still have to learn 
But the one thing I have 
Is my pride 
Oh, so I don’t wanna learn to hold you, touch you 
I think that your mine 
Because there ain’t no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who just isn’t willing to try 
I’m so cold Inside 
Maybe Just one more try

Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors, 
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone. 
He's gone. 
When the wars of our nation did beckon, 
A man barely twenty did answer the calling. 
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation, 
He's gone, 
But Eternity knows him, and it knows what we've done. 
And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers 
Leaving brown, muddy clay where the earth had been dry. 
And deep in the trench he waited for hours, 
As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die. 
But the silence of night was shattered by fire 
As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air. 
And one after another his comrades were slaughtered. 
In morgue of Marines, alone standing there. 
He crouched ever lower, ever lower with fear. 
"They can't let me die! The can't let me die here! 
I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth. 
I'll cover myself! I know I'm not brave! 
The earth! the earth! the earth is my grave." 
The grave that they dug him had flowers 
Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors,

I was back in the old days - long ago 
When we were kids, when we were young 
Things seemed so perfect - you know? 
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were 
Young 
The sun was always shinin` - we just lived for fun 
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don`t know 
The rest of my life`s been - just a show. 
Those were the days of our lives 
The bad things in life were so few 
Those daays are all gone now but one thing is true- 
When I look and I find, I still love you. 
You can`t turn back the clock, you can`t turn 
Back the tide 
Ain`t that a shaame? (Ain`t that a shame?) 
I`d like to go back one time on a roller coaster 
Ride 
When life was just a game 
No use sitting and thinkin` on what you did 
When you can lay back and anjoy it through your 
Kids 
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don`t know 
Better sit back and go - -with the flow 
`Cause these are the days of our lives 
They`ve flown in the swiftness of time 
These days are all gone now but some things remain 
When I look and I find - no change 
Those were the days of our lives 
The bad things in life were so few 
Those days are all gone now but one thing is trrue- 
When I look and I find, I still love you 
I still llove you 
I love you 
I still love you 
I still love you 
I still love you.</field>

They will never see the sun 
For they can never show their faces 
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner 
Who will take more than he will give 
He ain't hardly gonna give 
The greed of man will be 
Far away from me 
And my soul will be free 
They won't go when I go 
Since my soul conceived 
All that I believe 
The kingdom I will see 
'Cause they won't go when I go 
When I go 
Where I'll go 
No one can keep me 
From my destiny.</field>

George: 
Don't kiss me, darling 
I want you to hear the things I say 
I loved you in my way 
But you know I'm gonna leave you 
Mutya: 
The clock was always ticking 
And your heart, 
Yes I know your heart is always on the run 
George: 
I hate what I've become 
But I'm still gonna leave you 
And I don't think you should stay for the night 
Mutya: 
Baby you know that my flesh is weak 
You know I simply 
Both: 
I cannot sleep without you 
My heart has simply nowhere to go 
Mutya: 
Nothing to hold 
Those tears you're crying 
George: 
Time and time again you take me back in baby 
Mutya: 
You don't have to make it plain 
Both: 
This is not real love 
Mutya: 
Look at us dancing baby 
Let's dance and show them all 
(Dance and show them all) 
How close we are 
The lies have worked so far 
So we go on deceiving 
George: 
But darling don't you know the time 
Baby, look at yourself, holding back the tide 
Like you've got something else up your sleeve 
That's why I've got to leave 
Both: 
And I don't think you should stay here tonight 
(Baby don't you know that my flesh is weak, you know) 
I simply I cannot sleep without you 
But someday I'll have nothing to show 
(Nothing to show) 
(Nothing to show) 
I've nothing to hold 
George: 
Oh, baby, crying 
All those simple things that won't come again 
Oh do I have to make it plain 
This is not real love 
And I said this is not real love 
Mutya: 
Real love 
Baby it don't glisten and shine the way it used to 
George: 
This is not real love (real love) 
Baby think of all the promises I made on the day that I seduced you 
Baby don't wait for me like some angel of tragedy 
I have to set you free 
Darling you should be long gone, oh long gone by now 
You should be with someone, someone 
Mutya: 
Glisten and shine 
You promised me 
George: 
You've gotta face it woman, you ain't ever gonna change me 
Mutya: 
Where will I go, what do I know 
About life without you 
You promised me you'd never leave me, no

You don't have to do without it 
(You) just have to believe (in) 
This kind of love 
Don't have to be so scared 
Don't have to hide what you can 
You just have to believe in this kind of love 
Everybody's telling me that these are dangerous times 
For you and me, can't you see baby? 
Maybe we have better take a little care 
With this love 
Ooh, I know 
Cos I can't be happy without you 
Then I'll be the one 
Now that I 've found you 
Now that I 've found you 
Now that I 've found you 
I don't have to hold you down 
I don't need to push you around 
I just want you to be 
This kind of love 
And if someone hurt you before 
Can't you see 
All that I wanna give you much more 
Just have faith in me 
This kind of love 
Everybody's telling me that these are dangerous times 
For you and me, can't you see baby? 
People got to take a little bit of care 
When they got doubt 
Don't let it go no, never no 
And all I know 
I don't have no reason to doubt you 
Don't you think it's time 
To believe in someone 
So I'm telling you 
Now that I found you 
Now that I found you 
I can't let you go 
Nobody's perfect 
All have a past 
When you look at me 
How can you ask if I love you 
Is it so hard to see? 
Now everyone has to get over I know 
But this empty house seems to get 
Colder and colder 
So won't you stay here with me? 
And all I know 
Is that I don't have no reason to doubt you 
Don't you think it's time 
To believe in someone 
So I'm telling you 
Now that I found you</field>

And they may strip me of the things that I've worked for 
But I've had my say 
So hear me now 
I've enough of these chains 
I know they're of my making 
No one else to blame for where I stand today 
I've no memory of truth 
But suddenly the audience is so cruel 
So God, hey God you know why I'm through 
Through 
I guess it's tough, I guess I'm older 
And everything must change 
But all this cruelty and money instead of love 
People, have we no shame? 
They may chase me to the ends of the earth 
But I've got you babe 
And they may take away the things that I've worked for 
But you'll pull me through 
It's so clear to me now 
I've enough of these chains 
Life is there for the taking 
What kind of fool would remain in this cheap gilded cage

it takes all that I have just to cry for help

tells me no 
I'm going down 
won't you help me 
save me from myself 
I look around for a fantasy 
maybe who can tell? 
let me live my life beside the river 
take me to places where a child can grow 
and then 
maybe the boy inside will forsake me 
maybe 
the child in me 
will just let me go 
I'm going down 
the cold, cold water is rushing in 
I'm going down 
and I would beg to be forgiven

Does it have to be the old thing 
Tonight? 
Oh, it's late, too late 
To chase the rainbow that you're after 
I'd like to find a compromise 
Oh, and place it in your hands 
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear 
Oh, and I cannot find the time 
Tonight 
Just let the curtains close in silence 
Tonight 
Why not approach with less defiance 
The man who'd love to see you smile 
Who'd love to see you smile 
Tonight

So won't you let me. 
I watch your fingers working overtime 
I've got to thinking that they should be mine (oooh) 
I'd love to see you naked baby 
I'd like to think that maybe tonight

You're never gonna have another lover in your bed. 
You're just too funky for me.

Where you'd be if I just walked on by 
What's your name, can I take your number 
Darling come with me, I'm going to change your life 
When you're young you think you're winning 
Why worry til the babies cry 
I was wrong, its the blues we're singing 
chasing after panties just to survive. 
And there's no way the gods are fearing me baby 
They don't even try, they don't even try 
And all the things I said I'd give you 
Just seem to pass me by, no matter how I try 
I hope you understand 
This is not what I had planned for us 
God only knows if my dreams are coming or gone 
dreams are coming or gone 
But you're still holding my hand sweetheart, sweetheart 
And for every single day you're here 
It's crystal clear 
That God isn't mad at me at all, He isn't mad at me at all 
And all this praying hard aint gonna save the day 
Maybe that's really what I'm guilty of 
I know we live in times when love is not enough 
its not enough no no no 
And there's no way the gods are fearing me 
baby they don't even try 
And all the things I thought I'd give you 
Just seem to pass me by, no matter how I try. 
I hope you understand 
This is not what I had planned for us 
Heaven only knows if our dreams are coming or gone 
coming or gone 
But you're still holding my hand sweetheart 
So for every single day that you're here 
It's crystal clear 
That God isn't mad at me at all 
He aint mad at me at all. 
There is a place in my mind 
Somewhere we could be fine 
where the children could play 
And we'd eat like kings every day</field>

Until you've got somewhere to go

I can't say I've found a cure for these 
But at least I know them 
So they're not so strong 
You look for your dreams in heaven 
But what the hell are you supposed to do 
When they come true? 
Well there's one year of my life in the songs 
And some of them are about you 
Now I know there's no way I can write those wrongs 
Believe me 
I would not lie you've hurt my pride 
And I guess there's a road without you 
But you once said 
There's a way back for every man 
So here I am 
Don't people change, here I am

You're a fool boy 
Why don't you go down 
Find somebody 
Find somebody else 
My memory serves me far too well 
It's not as though we just broke up 
It's not as though it was yesterday 
But something I just can't explain 
Something in me needs this pain 
I know I'll never see your face again 
C'mon now 
I've got to be strong now 
Now everybody's talking about this new decade 
Like you say the magic numbers 
Then just say goodbye to 
The stupid mistakes you made 
Oh my memory serves me far too well 
Don't you know that 
The years will come and go 
Some of us will change our lives 
Some of us still have nothing to show 
Nothing baby 
But memories 
And if these wounds 
They are self-inflicted 
I don't really know 
How my poor heart could have protected me 
But if I have to carry this pain 
If you will not share the blame 
I deserve to see your face again 
C'mon now 
You don't have to be so strong now 
Come back 
Come back to me darling 
I will make it worth your while 
Come back to your baby 
I miss your kiss 
I miss your smile 
Seems to me the peace I search to find 
Ain't going to be mine until you say you will 
Don't you keep me waiting for that day 
I know, I know, I know 
You hear these words that I say 
You can't always get what you want

Turn the bright spark into a flame

It makes me crazy when you act so cool 
Come on baby let's not fight

She's got a laugh that reminds me of why she's in love with me, 
She'd never let show she was lonely in case it had frightened me, 
She was carpet and stone, independent, alone, 
But her love always shone around me, 
Every time... 
Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again, 
Free from the seasons and this state I'm in, 
And oh, I can't hold it all under one love, 
It was so long ago when we kissed in the streets, 
Now you fly like an eagle above, 
While I waltz away anyway, 
I'll be waltzing my days away, 
Searching for this woman I love. 
She had a history of joy and pain in time, 
And she chose to leave, 
She had a thousand and one photographs, 
That you would not believe, 
She'll come to you in disguise, 
She's there in your children's eyes, 
Still our mother... 
She' still your wife, 
(So let her...) 
Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again 
Free from the reasons for this state I'm in, 
And oh, (trust me, she ain't going anywhere) 
I can't hold it all under one love, 
(Trust me, she told me, when you're ready she'll be there) 
It was so long ago, (no don't let go of her) 
When we kissed in the streets, 
Now you fly like an eagle above, 
While I waltz away anyway, 
I'll be waltzing my days away, 
Searching for this woman I love. 
And the moment you see me 
I will live in your life 
We will walk through my garden 
I will see through your eyes, 
I was in despair 'till she found me there, 
Every grown man cries with his mother's eyes, 
And when you're ready too, 
She'll come back to you, 
She's waiting,

In unlit alleyways 
By the church downtown 
Where Sally prays 
Come down sometime 
We'll share a rusty can of corn... 
And listen to the radio 
I love you, I love you, it says... 
CHORUS: 
Where did your heart go 
Did you put it on a train 
Did you leave it in the rain 
Or down in Mexico 
You cry, but I don't know 
I've heard it all before 
There it goes again, the slamming of the door 
Sometimes the river calls me 
And at night it calls my name 
Says "put your troubles down beside me" 
Things have always been the same... 
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me 
What the river said that night 
I jumped into this beauty 
And drifted out of sight...

Heartless pictures on TV 
Change that channel that could have been me

Maybe she just wanted to be free 
So I just kept breathing my friends 
Waiting for the man to choose 
Saying this ain't the day that it ends 
Because there's no white light

I'm alive 
I'm alive 
And I've got so much more

Was it music that saved me? 
Or the way that you prayed for me? 
Guess either way I thank you 
I'm alive 
Hotel, motel makes it clear 
One more voice we will never hear 
Again 
But maybe he just wanted to be free 
And I don't know what the hell 
What the gods, what the f*** I'm saying 
Half the time 
Something divine, oh divine 
Brought me back to you 
And I know it 
So I just kept breathing my friends 
Waiting for some god to choose 
Saying this ain't the day that it ends 
Because there's no white light 
And I'm not through 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
And I've got so much more 
That I want to do 
Was it music? 
Was it science that saved me? 
Or the way that you prayed for me? 
Guess either way I thank you 
I'm alive 
And tomorrow is mine 
I said tomorrow is mine 
Said I've just got to keep on breathing 
I said no 
Don't let go 
Keep on breathing 
Got to keep on, got to keep on, got to keep on 
I've just got to keep on breathing 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
And I've got so much more 
That I want to give 
Was it music? 
Was it science that saved me? 
Or the way that you prayed for me? 
Well I thank you 
I'm alive</field>

Until my life is through, 
Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world, 
In love you and I, you and I, you and I, 
I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through, 
But I found strength in you, 
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day, 
Because that's all that I am living for, you see, 
Don't worry what happens to me. 
Cause' in my mind, you will stay here always,

            <field name="lyrics">She takes the back road and the lane 
Past the school that has no changed 
In all this time 
She thinks of when the boy was young 
All the battles she had won 
Just to give him life 
That man 
She loved that man 
For all his life 
But now we meet to bring him flowers 
And only God knows why 
For what's the use in pressing pamls 
When children fade in mother's arms 
It's a cruel world 
We've so much to loose 
And what we have to learn we rarely choose 
So if it's God who took her son 
He cannot be the one living in her mind 
Take care my love, she said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, she said 
You have been loved 
If I was weak, forgive me 
But I was terrified 
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love 
The kind that makes devils cry 
So these days 
My life has changed 
And I'll be fine 
But she just sits and counts the hours 
Searching for her crime 
So what's the use of pressing palms 
If you won't keep such love from harm 
It's a cruel world 
You've so much to prove 
And heaven helps the ones who wait for you 
Well I've no daughters, I've no sons 
Guess I'm the only one 
Living in my life 
Take care my love, he said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, he said 
You have been loved...</field>

Hey, everybody's got some moment in their life 
They can't change ( don't they baby?) 
I know you don't care what's right or wrong 
All that I know 
Is that love don't belong here 
And so it's better to turn the page 
And watch me walk away, 
My dear, watch me walk away 
But you say 
I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you 
I want you baby (more than ever) 
I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you 
But it's never gonna be that easy child 
Lover don't love too much 
I'm a bad boy, I'm a sad boy 
And I'll never give you much 
Hey, everybody's got some moment in their life 
They can't change 
So I do not dare to take you home 
All that I know 
Is that something is so wrong with this heat 
Why do you touch the flame? 
You know you feel the pain, my dear 
You always find it here 
But you say 
I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you 
(please don't say it) 
I want you baby (more that ever) 
I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you

(What the hell's got into you?) 
Hey sucker 
(Now there's nothing you can do) 
Well I hadn't seen your face around town awhile, 
So I greeted you, with a knowing smile, 
When I saw that girl upon your arm, 
I knew she won your heart with a fatal charm. 
I said "Soul Boy, let's hit the town!" 
I said "Soul Boy, what's with the frown?" 
But in return, all you could say was 
"Hi George, meet my fiancee" 
Young Guns, 
Having some fun 
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run. 
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties. 
See me, single and free 
No tears, no fears, what I want to be. 
One, two, take a look at you 
Death by matrimony! 
Hey sucker, 
(What the hell's got into you?) 
Hey sucker! 
(Now there's nothing you can do.) 
A married man? you're out of your head 
Sleepless nights, on an H.P 
bed 
A daddy by the time you're twenty-one 
If your happy with a nappy then you're in for fun. 
But you're here- 
And you're there 
Well there's guys like you just everywhere 
Looking back on the good old days? 
Well this young gun says CAUTION PAYS! 
Chorus: 
Young Guns, 
Having some fun 
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run. 
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties. 
See me, single and free 
No tears, no fears, what I want to be. 
One, two, take a look at you 
Death by matrimony! 
I remember when he such fun and everthing was fine, 
I remember when we use to have a good time, 
Partners in crime. 
Tell me that's all in the past and I will gladly walk away, 
Tell me that you're happy now, 
Turning my back- 
Nothing to say! 
"Hey tell this jerk to take a hike, 
There's somethin' 'bout that boy I don't like" 
"Well sugar he don't mean the things he said" 
"Just get him outta my way, 'cause I'm seeing red 
We got plans to make, we got things to buy 
And you're wasting time on some creepy guy" 
"Hey shut up chick, that's a friend of mine, 
Just watch your mouth babe, you're out of line" 
OoooooH! 
GET BACK 
HANDS OFF 
GO FOR IT!

As I take your hand and lead to the dance floor 
As the music dies, something in your eyes 
Calls to mind the silver screen 
And all its sad good-byes 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you are not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
Time can never mend 
The careless whispers of a good friend 
To the heart and mind 
Ignorance is kind 
There's no comfort in the truth 
Pain is all you'll find 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you are not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste this chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
Never without your love 
Tonight the music seems so loud 
I wish that we could lose this crowd 
Maybe it's better this way 
We'd hurt each other 
with the things we'd want to say 
We could have been so good together 
We could have lived this dance forever 
But now who's gonna dance with me 
Please stay 
And I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you're not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
(now that you're gone) now that you're gone 
(now that you're gone) what I did so wrong

Gotta have some faith in the sound 
It's the one good thing that I've got 
I won't let you down 
So please don't give me up 
Because I would really, really love to stick around 
Heaven knows I was just a young boy 
Didn't know what I wanted to be 
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy 
And I guess it was enough for me towin the race? 
A prettier face! 
Brand new clothes and a big fat place 
On your rock and roll TV 
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way 
Think I'm gonna get me some happy 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I told you so 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone else I've got to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Take back your singing in the rain 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies 
and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy 
What a kick just a buddy and me 
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy 
We were living in a fantasy 
We won the race 
Got out of the place 
I went back home got a brand new face 
For the boys on MTV 
But today the way I play the game has got to change 
Oh yeah 
Now I'm gonna get myself happy 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I stopped the show 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone I forgot to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Don't think that I'll be back again 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies 
and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Well it looks like the road to heaven 
But it feels like the road to hell 
When I knew which side my bread was buttered 
I took the knife as well 
Posing for another picture 
Everybody's got to sell 
But when you shake your ass 
They notice fast 
And some mistakes were built to last 
That's what you get 
I say that's what you get 
That's what you get for changing your mind 
And after all this time 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
I'll hold on to my freedom 
May not be what you want from me 
Just the way it's got to be 
Lose the face now 
I've got to live</field>

Goodbye 
Goodbye

Telling me no

Let me go

Oh so I don't want to learn to

This time I think that my lover 
Understands me 
If we have faith in each other

I'll be the sea 
If you ever hunger 
Hunger for me 
Whatever you ask for 
That's what I'll be 
So when you remember the ones who have lied 
Who said that they cared 
But then laughed as you cried 
Beautiful Darling 
Don't think of me 
Because all I ever wanted 
It's in your eyes baby, baby 
And love can't lie, no... 
(Greet me with the eyes of a child) 
My love is always tell me to... 
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile) 
Just hold on, hold on 
I won't let you go, my baby 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
(So I am gonna love you) 
Until the end of time 
I will be your father 
I will be your preacher 
I will be your daddy 
I will be the one who loves you until the end of time</field>

But losing everything is like the sun going down on me 
I can't find, oh the right romantic line 
But see me once and see the way I feel 
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm 
But these cuts I have 
They need love to help them heal 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free 
Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby 
Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me</field>

If I could touch your body 
I know not everybody 
Has got a body like you. 
Oh, but I gotta think twice 
Before I give my heart away 
And I know all the games you play 
Because I play them, too. 
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion, 
Time to pick my heart up off the floor. 
And when that love comes down without devotion, 
Well, it takes a strong man baby, but I'm 
Showing you the door, 
Cause I gotta have Faith 
I gotta have.. 
Faith 
Yes, I've gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith 
I gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith. 
Baby, I know you're asking me to stay 
Saying please, please, please don't go away 
You say I'm giving you the blues. 
Maybe you mean every word you say 
Can't help but think of yesterday 
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules 
Before this river becomes an ocean 
Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
Oh baby, I reconsider my foolish notion 
Well, I need someone to hold me, 
But I'll wait for something more. 
Cause I gotta have Faith... 
(repeat chorus) 
Before this river 
Becomes an ocean 
Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
(I've just got to have faith) 
I've reconsidered my foolish notion 
Yeah, I need someone to hold me, 
But I'll wait for something more.... 
(pause) 
Cause I gotta have Faith

When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
Strange that you were strong enough 
To even make a start 
But you'll never find 
Peace of mind 
Till you listen to your heart 
People 
You can never change the way they feel 
Better let them do just what they want 
For they will 
If you let them 
Steal your heart from you 
People 
Will always make a lover feel a fool 
But you knew I loved you 
We could have shown them all 
We should have seen love through 
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes 
Covered me with kisses and lies 
So goodbye 
But please don't take my heart 
You are far 
But I'm never gonna be your star 
I'll pick up the pieces 
And mend my heart 
Maybe I'll be strong enough 
I don't know where to start 
But I'll never find 
Peace of mind 
While I listen to my heart 
People...

But you knew I loved you 
We could have shown them all 
We should have seen love through 
But remember this 
Every other kiss 
That you ever give 
Long as we both live 
When you need the hand of another man 
One you really can surrender with 
I will wait for you 
Like I always do 
There's something there 
That can't compare with any other 
You are far 
When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
Strange that I was wrong enough 
To think you'd love me too 
I guess you were kissing a fool 
You must have been kissing a fool</field>

            <field name="lyrics">These are the days of the open hand 
They will not be the last 
Look around now 
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers 
This is the year of the hungry man 
Whose place is in the past 
Hand in hand with ignorance 
And legitimate excuses 
The rich declare themselves poor 
And most of us are not sure 
If we have too much 
But we'll take our chances 
Because god's stopped keeping score 
I guess somewhere along the way 
He must have let us all out to play 
Turned his back and all god's children 
Crept out the back door 
And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate 
Hanging on to hope 
When there is no hope to speak of 
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late 
Well maybe we should all be praying for time 
These are the days of the empty hand 
Oh you hold on to what you can 
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year 
This is the year of the guilty man 
Your television takes a stand 
And you find that what was over there 
Is over here 
So you scream from behind your door 
Say "what's mine is mine and not yours" 
I may have too much but I'll take my chances 
Because god's stopped keeping score 
And you cling to the things they sold you 
Did you cover your eyes when they told you 
That he can't come back 
Because he has no children to come back for 
It's hard to love, there's so much to hate</field>

Chorus: 
When you find a love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 
When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 
Sadness in my eyes 
No one guessed and no one tried 
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
Loveless and cold 
With your last breath you saved my soul 
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
And what have I learned from all these tears 
I've waited for you all those years 
Then just when it began he took your love away 
But I still say 
Chorus 
So the words you could not say 
I'll sing them for you 
And the love we would have made 
I'll make it for two 
For every single memory 
Has become a part of me 
You will always be my love 
Well I've been loved so I know just what love is 
And the lover that I kissed is always by my side 
Oh the lover I still miss..

Asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life 
Has given love a guarantee 
To last through forever 
And another day 
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow 
Could make me the past

Cause you're here 
Now I know deep in my mind

Until the ocean covers

Until the dolphin fly 
And parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life 
And life becomes a dream

Until the day is night 
And night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas 
Just up and fly away 
Until the day that

You could help to ease my mind 
Baby, I aint Mr.Right 
But if your looking for fastlove 
If that's love in your eyes 
It's more than enough 
Had some bad luck 
So fastlove, is all that I've got on my mind 
What's there to think about baby? 
Looking for some affirmation 
Made my way into the sun 
My friends got their ladies, 
They're all having babies 
But I just want to have some fun

Got to get there in your own sweet time

Get yourself some lessons in love 
In the absence of security

I miss my baby, oh yeah, tonight 
So, why don't we make a little room 
In my Bmw babe

Hey I'll help you find it

The same religion

In all this time 
She thinks of when the boy was young 
All the battles she had won 
Just to give him life 
That man 
She loved that man 
For all his life 
But now we meet to bring him flowers 
And only God knows why 
For what's the use in pressing pamls 
When children fade in mother's arms 
It's a cruel world 
We've so much to loose 
And what we have to learn we rarely choose 
So if it's God who took her son 
He cannot be the one living in her mind 
Take care my love, she said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, she said 
You have been loved 
If I was weak, forgive me 
But I was terrified 
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love 
The kind that makes devils cry 
So these days 
My life has changed 
And I'll be fine 
But she just sits and counts the hours 
Searching for her crime 
So what's the use of pressing palms 
If you won't keep such love from harm 
It's a cruel world 
You've so much to prove 
And heaven helps the ones who wait for you 
Well I've no daughters, I've no sons 
Guess I'm the only one 
Living in my life 
Take care my love, he said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, he said

When your heart`s in someone else`s hands 
Monkey see and monkey do 
Their wish is your command 
You`re not to blame 
Everyone`s the same 
All you do is love and love is all you do 
I should know by now the way I fought for you 
You`re not to blame 
Everyone`s the same 
I know you think that you`re safe 
Mister 
Harmless deception that keeps love at bay 
It`s the ones who resist that we most want to kiss 
Wouldn`t you say? 
Cowboys and angels 
They all have the time for you 
Why should I imagine 
That I`d be a find for you 
Why should I imagine 
That I`d have something to say 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
In your heart there`s a trace 
Of someone before 
When your heart`s in someone else`s plans 
Things you say and things you do 
They don`t understand 
It`s such a shame 
Always ends the same 
You can call it love but I don`t think it`s true 
You should know by now 
I`m not the boy for you 
You`re not to blame 
Always ends the same 
I know you think that you`re safe 
Sister 
Harmless affection that keeps things this way 
It`s the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss 
Who will pay 
Cowboys and angels 
They all take a shine to you 
Why should I imagine 
That I was designed for you 
Why should I believe 
That you would stay 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
Don`t you think that I know 
They hurt you before 
Take this man to your bed 
Maybe his hands 
Will help you forget 
Please be stronger than your past 
The future may still give you a chance</field>

CHORUS: 
Last Christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
CHORUS 
Once bitten and twice shy 
I keep my distance 
But you still catch my eye 
Tell me baby 
Do you recognize me? 
Well 
It's been a year 
It doesn't surprise me 
HAPPY CHRISTMAS 
I wrapped it up and sent it 
With a note saying "I love you" 
I meant it 
Now I know what a fool I've been 
But if you kissed me now 
I know you'd fool me again 
CHORUS 
Crowded room 
Runs with tired eyes 
I'm hiding from you 
And your solemn eyes 
My god I thought you were 
Someone to rely on 
Me? 
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man undercover but you tore me apart 
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again 
CHORUS 2x 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man undercover but you tore him apart 
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone.</field>

They crack a smile, talk a while 
Try to take your place 
My memory serves me far too well 
I just sit here on this mountain thinking to myself 
You're a fool boy 
Why don't you go down 
Find somebody 
Find somebody else 
My memory serves me far too well 
It's not as though we just broke up 
It's not as though it was yesterday 
But something I just can't explain 
Something in me needs this pain 
I know I'll never see your face again 
C'mon now 
I've got to be strong now 
Now everybody's talking about this new decade 
Like you say the magic numbers 
Then just say goodbye to 
The stupid mistakes you made 
Oh my memory serves me far too well 
Don't you know that 
The years will come and go 
Some of us will change our lives 
Some of us still have nothing to show 
Nothing baby 
But memories 
And if these wounds 
They are self-inflicted 
I don't really know 
How my poor heart could have protected me 
But if I have to carry this pain 
If you will not share the blame 
I deserve to see your face again 
C'mon now 
You don't have to be so strong now 
Come back 
Come back to me darling 
I will make it worth your while 
Come back to your baby 
I miss your kiss 
I miss your smile 
Seems to me the peace I search to find 
Ain't going to be mine until you say you will 
Don't you keep me waiting for that day 
I know, I know, I know 
You hear these words that I say 
You can't always get what you want

have been with you instead 
* Wake me up before you go-go 
Don't leave me hanging on like a yoyo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high 
Wake me up before you go-go 
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
Take me dancing tonight 
I wanna hit that high yeah yeah 
You put the grey skies out of my way 
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day 
Turn the bright spark into a flame 
My beats per minute never been the same 
'Cause you are my lady I'm your fool 
It makes me crazy when you act so cool 
Come on baby let's not fight 
We'll go dancing 
Everything will be alright 
* Wake me up before you go-go 
Don't leave me hanging on like a yoyo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high 
Wake me up before you go-go 
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
Take me dancing tonight 
I wanna hit that high yeah yeah yeah 
Cuddle up baby move in tight 
We'll go dancing tomorrow night 
It's cold out there but it's warm in bed 
They can dance, we'll go home instead 
* Wake me up before you go-go 
Don't leave me hanging on like a yoyo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high 
Wake me up before you go-go 
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
Take me dancing tonight 
Wake me up before you go go 
don't you dare to leave me on like a yo yo yo 
take me dancin' 
boom boom boom.</field>

So won't you let me.

I've got to thinking that they should be mine (oooh) 
I'd love to see you naked baby 
I'd like to think that maybe tonight 
If that's alright, yeah.

Won't let you go (won't let you go)

I've got to know (I've got to know) 
I'm gonna be the kind of lover that you never had 
Hey, you're just too funky 
You're never gonna have another lover in your bed. 
You're just too funky for me. 
Would you like me to seduce you? 
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

You would hurt my feelings, don't you see, my love ? 
I wish I had an ear like yours, 
A voice that would behave 
All I have is feeling 
And the voice God gave 
You insist my music goes against the rules 
Yes, but rules were never made for lovesick fools 
I wrote this song for you 
But you don't care 
It's a crooked song, ah, 
But my heart is there 
The thing that you would see if you would play the part 
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart 
I took your picture with my trusty Rolliflex 
And now all I have developed is complex 
Possibly in vain, I hope you weaken, oh my love 
And forget those rigid rules that undermine my dream of 
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand 
That even though I may be out of tune when I attempt to say 
How much I love you 
And all that matters is the message that I bring, 
Which is: my dear one, I love you.</field>

Racism in future kings can only lead to no good 
And besides, all our sons and daughters already 
Know that feels 
It was the third of september 
That day I?ll always remember, yes I will 
´Cause that was the day that my daddy died 
Never had a chance to see him, no 
Never heard nothin? but bad things about him 
Mama, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth 
Mama just hung her head and said 
(Chorus) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
Hey, mama, is it true what they say 
That papa never worked a day in his life 
Some bad talks going around sayin? 
Papa had three outside children 
And anouther wife 
That ain?t right 
Heard some talks about papa and his storefront 
Preachin? 
Talkin? about saving souls and all the time 
Leaching 
And dealing in the dirt 
Stealin? in the name of the lord 
But mama she just said 
(Chorus) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades 
Is that what sent papa to an early grave? 
Folks say papa would bag, borrow of steal just 
To pay his bills 
Hey, mama, folks say papa was ever much on thinkin? 
Spent most of this time chasin? women and drinkin? 
But mouther, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth 
But my mama she just said 
(Chorus 2x) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
But my mama she said 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Oh my mama said 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
And when he died 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
All he left us 
All he left us 
Can you believe he left us?

Album: Patience (2004) 
 
I was mixed up when you came to me 
Too broke to fix 
Said 'daddy get you gone, I'm missing my baby' 
Still missing my baby 
I was stitched up by the hands of fate 
Said how you gonna make it on your own 
If luck is a lady? 
Maybe luck is a lady 
I was going down for the third time 
My heart was broken I was not open 
To your suggestions 
I had so many questions 
That you just kissed away 
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise 
The day you walked in and changed my life 
I think it's amazing 
The way that love can set you free 
So I walk in the midday sun 
I never thought that my saviour would come 
I think it's amazing 
I think it's amazing 
I think you're amazing 
You tried to save me from myself 
Said 'Darling kiss as many as you want! 
My love's still available 
And I know that you are insatiable' 
We're like victims of the same disease 
Look at your Big Bad Daddy, and your mom 
And your mom.. 
was always acting crazy 
I was going down for the third time 
My heart was broken, 
I thought that loving you was out of the question 
Then I saw my reflection 
Saying please don't let this go 
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise 
The day you walked in changed my life 
I think it's amazing 
The way love can set you free 
So now I walk in the midday sun 
I never thought that my saviour would come 
I think it's amazing 
I think you're amazing 
Celebrate the love of the one you're with 
Celebrate, this life with you baby 
I think you should celebrate yeah 
Don't put your love in chains baby 
No, no, walk in the midday sun 
I thought I was dreaming 
I think it's amazing 
I think you're amazing 
I said celebrate the love of the one you're with 
As this life gets colder 
And the devil inside 
tells you to give up</field>

Bringing the light into my day

So broken that I never saw you chase the past away 
My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight) 
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night 
Takes away thata fear that I carried forever 
You stopped to wipe away my tears 
And you stayed forever and more 
(I don't think that I...) 
Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December 
Allalone I watched the eagles fly 
Even the light seemed to have changed 
In the Californian sky 
Through all of those battles then you came 
Stepped out of the fading light 
Said, "Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again, 
Because I'm here to save your life" 
My American Angel, he desn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight) 
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night 
Takes away thata fear that I carried forever 
You stopped to wipe away my tears 
But you stayed forever amore 
And more, didn't you baby... 
Because I don't think that I could love and lose again 
I don't think I have the strength

For the ones who love me 
To think I thought I could be some kind of family man 
I told myself I was straight 
But I shouldn’t have worried 
‘Cos my Maker had a better plan for me 
And I’m dancing with the freaks now 
I'm havin’, I’m havin’ so much fun 
What you sow is what you reap now 
I’ll do my dance with everyone 
I’ve been getting too much Sun 
(Yes I’m dancin’ with the freaks now) 
We’re havin’, we’re havin’ too much fun for them 
Look who’s talking Guilty feet now… 
Well let me tell you people 
It’s an easier affair 
Not living my life with other people on my mind 
No, got nothing to hide from anyone 
Yes, I’m walking on new air 
Just living my life 
Better believe I'm gonna get what’s mine 
See I don’t have the time 
For the haters 
And all the time that I wasted 
How careless of me 
Too young and stupid to see 
I put my life in their hands 
(Gonna look for Cupid, man) 
Oh, and I know that they want me to hate them 
There’s no hurry 
I’ll just have to be the bigger man 
Dancin’ with the freaks now 
I’m havin’, I’m havin’ so much fun 
What you sow is what you reap now 
I’ll do my dance with everyone 
I’ve been getting too much Sun 
If I turn the other cheek now 
Would that be, would that be too much fun for them? 
Look who’s talking 
Guilty feet now… 
Well let me tell you people 
It’s an easier affair 
Not livin’ my life with other people on my mind 
No, got nothing to hide from anyone 
‘Cos I’m walking on new air 
Just living my life 
Better believe I’m gonna get what’s mine 
See I don’t have the time for the haters 
Don’t let them tell you who you are is not enough 
Don’t let them tell you that it’s wrong 
Or that you won’t find love 
Don’t let them use my life to put your future down 
Don’t let them tell you that happiness can’t be found 
For my life 
Take it to the streets 
There are stories you can keep 
They’re just passing you by 
Don’t let them tell you who you are is not enough 
Don’t let them tell you that it’s wrong 
Or that you won’t find love 
Don’t let them use my life to put your future down 
Don’t let them tell you that happiness can’t be found</field>

Until the rainbow burns 
The stars out of the sky 
Until the ocean covers 
Every mountain high 
Until the day that 
Eight times eight times eight is four 
Until the day that is the day

Did you know that true love 
Asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life 
Has given love a guarantee 
To last through forever 
And another day 
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow 
Could make me the past 
But that I mustn't fear 
Cause you're here 
Now I know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've felt behind 
And I'll be loving you always 
Until the rainbow burns 
The stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers 
Every mountain high 
Until the dolphin fly 
And parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life 
And life becomes a dream 
(now ain't that loving you?) 
Until the day is night 
And night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas 
Just up and fly away 
Until the day that 
Eight times eight times eight is four 
Until the day that is the day 
That are no more 
Did you know that true love 
Asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life 
Has given love a guarantee

Dear mummy, Dear Daddy, 
You had plans forme, I was your only son. 
And long before this baby boy could count to three, 
You knew just what he would become. 
Run along to school, 
No child of mine grows up a fool, 
Run along to school. 
When you tried to tell me what to do, 
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you, 
One thing that I know for sure- 
BAD BOYS 
Stick together, never Sad Boys 
GOOD GUYS 
They made rules for fools, so get wise... 
Dear Mummy, Dear Daddy, 
Now I'm nineteen as you see, 
I'm handsome, tall, and strong. 
So what the hell gives you the right to look at me, 
As if to say "Hell, what went wrong?" 
Where were you last night? 
You look as if you had a fight. 
Where were you last night? 
Well I think that you may just be right, 
But don't try to keep me in tonight, 
Because I'm big enough to break down the door. 
BAD BOYS 
Stick together, never Sad Boys 
GOOD GUYS 
They made rules for fools, so get wise... 
Boys like you, are bad through and through. 
Still, girls like me, always seem to be with you.... 
We can't help but worry, 
You're in such a hurry, 
Mixing with the wrong boys, 
Playing with the wrong toys. 
Easy girls, 
And late nights, 
Cigarettes, and love bites 
Why do you have to be so cruel? 
YOU'RE SUCH A FOOL 
BAD BOYS 
Stick together, never Sad Boys

They made rules for fools, so get wise....</field>

Monday was the worst day 
And Friday wasn't my day 
But Wednesday was the best day 
Because on Wednesday night we made love 
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey 
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head 
Used to be your baby when you had no money 
Now we spend more time in battle 
Than we ever do in bed 
(Than we ever do in bed) 
You don't know how much I hate that answer phone 
Are you standing there? 
But - you won't pick up the 'phone 
Why lie to my face? 
(When you can buy a tape machine to give me bullshit in your place) 
Today I did something I thought I'd never do 
I opened up your diary and read about you 
CHORUS 
Monday was the worst day 
Wednesday we made love 
And Friday - ooh but - 
Saturday, is today, is what I'm thinking of 
Come in baby- come in close 
(Take off your designer clothes) 
'Cos you know what I'm thinking of 
Do you remember me, do you remember us - 
Do you remember love? 
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey 
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head 
Used to be your baby when you had no money 
Now we spend more time in battle 
Than we ever do in bed

Tu etais si mignon, et tu jouais du piano 
Maintenant, mon mellieur ami c'est l'argent

As I take your hand and lead to the dance floor 
As the music dies, something in your eyes

I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you are not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
Time can never mend 
The careless whispers of a good friend 
To the heart and mind 
Ignorance is kind 
There's no comfort in the truth 
Pain is all you'll find 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you are not a fool 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste this chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again

Never without your love 
Tonight the music seems so loud 
I wish that we could lose this crowd 
Maybe it's better this way 
We'd hurt each other 
with the things we'd want to say 
We could have been so good together 
We could have lived this dance forever 
But now who's gonna dance with me 
Please stay 
And I'm never gonna dance again

When your heart`s in someone else`s hands 
Monkey see and monkey do 
Their wish is your command 
You`re not to blame 
Everyone`s the same 
All you do is love and love is all you do 
I should know by now the way I fought for you 
You`re not to blame 
Everyone`s the same 
I know you think that you`re safe 
Mister 
Harmless deception that keeps love at bay 
It`s the ones who resist that we most want to kiss 
Wouldn`t you say? 
Cowboys and angels 
They all have the time for you 
Why should I imagine 
That I`d be a find for you 
Why should I imagine 
That I`d have something to say 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
In your heart there`s a trace 
Of someone before 
When your heart`s in someone else`s plans 
Things you say and things you do 
They don`t understand 
It`s such a shame 
Always ends the same 
You can call it love but I don`t think it`s true 
You should know by now 
I`m not the boy for you 
You`re not to blame 
Always ends the same 
I know you think that you`re safe 
Sister 
Harmless affection that keeps things this way 
It`s the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss 
Who will pay 
Cowboys and angels 
They all take a shine to you 
Why should I imagine 
That I was designed for you 
Why should I believe 
That you would stay 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
Don`t you think that I know 
They hurt you before 
Take this man to your bed 
Maybe his hands 
Will help you forget 
Please be stronger than your past 
The future may still give you a chance</field>

Got myself in trouble, so much trouble 
I know I've got to make it

My middle name is fear 
I have a vacant stare 
And it's been so long since my body's been warm 
I know I've got to make it 
But I just can't take New York 
I came here 
All dreams and wide eyes in the big, big city 
No family, no money 
And I don't even know what's hit me 
He hasn't seen a doctor 
Since he got here in the spring 
Went to the Medicentre 
But they wouldn't let him in 
Without a green card 
Life can be so hard 
Take pity on a man without a home of his own 
How could he ever have known? 
Every street and every corner 
Watch them drowning 
Watch them do the Crazyman Dance 
Men and Women to the slaughter 
We just stand and watch them 
Do the Crazyman Dance 
It's been one whole year 
And it's just not fair 
For all the pushing and shoving 
I've still got nothing 
I'm never gonna make it 
And I'm stuck here in New York 
So people don't come near 
Unless you've a dollar to spare 
'Cause you know what they say 
About madmen on the subways of New York 
Believe it 
Yesterday's newspapers 
I wrap them around my body 
Outside these skyscrapers 
I wait for the night to hit me 
And boy, does it hit me 
Every street and every corner 
Watch them drowning 
Watch them do the Crazyman Dance 
For a nickel or a quarter 
For your pleasure 
Watch them do the Crazyman Dance 
I'm coming to London 
I'm coming to Paris 
I'm coming to make you good clean people embarrassed 
Why don't you look at my face 
Why don't you look in my eyes 
You'd rather look at your feet 
You'd rather look at the skies 
Oh, you'd look anywhere 
But at a man whose pure existence 
Says 'I ain't got time' 
And I don't care 
I don't care 
You just don't care.</field>

Thought that it was true 
You said that you needed me 
And baby I believe that too 
I thought that you were shy 
But you put me straight

I should have known better 
I know 
But now my hand's in my pocket 
Every time I see you cry 
People think that you're so sweet 
But they don't know you 
Quite like I do 
I guess they think 
I'm a lucky guy

Off my heart

I'm not giving any love away 
Do you think I'm crazy 
All I know is what I see

When you pretend that you're in love with me 
Baby 
You tell me you love me 
'Cause I know that it's not true 
Just tell me 
You need my money 
Girl 
You know I'll give it to you 
Between the ocean and sky 
There are things 
That you can't buy 
And if you look you'll see 
One of them is me 
Take your hands out of my pockets 
Dig until the day you die

Merry Christmas 
May your every New Year dream come true 
Sweet December song 
The melody that saved me 
On those less than silent nights 
When snow would fall upon my bed 
White sugar from Jesus 
And take me to the day 
She could always smile 
The Virgin Child would always show, you see 
Just to save me 
(Just to save me) 
There was always Christmas time 
To wipe the year away 
I guess that morning they?d decided 
That the war would have to wait 
There was always Christmas time 
Jesus came to stay 
I could believe in peace on Earth 
And I could watch TV all day 
So I dreamed of Christmas 
Maybe since you?ve gone 
I went a little crazy 
God knows they can see (the child) 
But the snow that falls upon my bed 
That loving I needed 
Falls every single day 
For each and every child 
The Virgin smiles for all to see 
But you kept her from me 
There was always Christmas time 
To wipe the year away 
I guess that morning they?d decided 
That the war would have to wait 
There was always Christmas time 
Jesus came to stay 
I could believe in peace on Earth 
And I could watch TV all day 
And so I dreamed of Christmas 
Yes, I dreamed like you 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
May your every New Year dream come true</field>

You would hurt my feelings, don't you see, my love ? 
I wish I had an ear like yours, 
A voice that would behave 
All I have is feeling 
And the voice God gave 
You insist my music goes against the rules 
Yes, but rules were never made for lovesick fools 
I wrote this song for you 
But you don't care 
It's a crooked song, ah, 
But my heart is there 
The thing that you would see if you would play the part 
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart 
I took your picture with my trusty Rolliflex 
And now all I have developed is complex 
Possibly in vain, I hope you weaken, oh my love 
And forget those rigid rules that undermine my dream of 
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand 
That even though I may be out of tune when I attempt to say 
How much I love you 
And all that matters is the message that I bring, 
Which is: my dear one, I love you.</field>

Performed by Band Aid 
Recorded on November 25, 1986 
It's Christmastime 
There's no need to be afraid 
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade 
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy 
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime 
But say a prayer 
Pray for the other ones 
At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun 
There's a world outside your window 
And it's a world of dread and fear 
Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears 
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging 
chimes of doom 
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you 
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime 
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life 
(Oooh) Where nothing ever grows 
No rain nor rivers flow 
Do they know it's Christmastime at all? 
(Here's to you) raise a glass for everyone 
(Here's to them) underneath that burning sun 
Do they know it's Christmastime at all? 
Feed the world 
Feed the world 
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again 
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When I ask those questions, baby 
It's just to get them out of my head 
Cause they turn around inside it 
Then they spill off to our bed 
Do I really want to know? 
Do I really want to know your life? 
Would I have to let you go? 
Could I listen to my heart if my head stops to think twice? 
When I've been a good boy 
When I've been a bad boy 
I have too much fun 
But baby so did everyone 
I've never been an angel 
But things are gonna change, change, change 
So do you really want to know? 
Do you really want to know my life? 
Would you have to let me go? 
Could you listen to your heart if your head stopped to think twice? 
If you knew every woman 
And I knew every man 
We never would have made it past holding hands 
I guess the saying is no longer true 
That what you don't know can hurt you 
I guess there is just no question, baby 
You know what you're doing in bed 
If I want your touch 
Should I know too much 
Some things are better left unsaid 
So do I really want to know? 
Do I really want to know your life? 
Would I have to let you go? 
Could I listen to my heart if my head starts to think twice? 
(Tell me baby, Cause one thing to guess is one thing to know, 
and don't you think that maybe baby I've got secrets of my own?) 
If I knew every woman 
And you knew every man 
We never would have made it past holding hands 
I used to say it but it's no longer true 
Cause what you don't know can really hurt you (Can kill you baby) 
And even as we speak 
The world is full of lovers.</field>

All my pictures seem to fade to black and white 
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me 
Frozen here on the ladder of my life 
It's much too late to save myself from falling 
I took a chance and changed your way of life 
But you misread my meaning when I met you 
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free 
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me 
I can't find, oh the right romantic line 
But see me once and see the way I feel 
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm 
But these cuts I have 
They need love to help them heal 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free 
Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me 
Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby 
Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I would lock you up 
But I could not bear to hear you 
Screaming to be set free 
I would chain you up 
If I'd thought you'd swear 
The only one that mattered was me, me, me 
I would strap you up 
But don't worry baby 
You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to 
It's too late to stop 
Won't the heavens save me? 
My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
Tell me that my soul's forgiven 
Hide you baby's eyes and we can... 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
One last time might be forever 
When the passion dies - 
It's just a matter of time before my heart is 
Looking for a home 
I'm like a maniac, at the end of the day 
I'm like a doggie barking at your door 
So come take me back to the place you stay 
And maybe we can do it once more 
You say I'm dangerous 
But don't worry baby 
I get excited at the things that you do 
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie 
'Cos no-one does it better than me and you 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
Tell me that my soul's forgiven 
Hide your baby's eyes and we can... 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
One last time might be forever 
Please don't tell me lies 
It's just a matter of time before my heart is 
Looking for a home 
I ain't got no more worries 
I'm gonna spend some times with you 
Loving you takes such courage 
And don't you think that I know it 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
You tell me that my soul's forgiven 
Hide your baby's eyes and we can... 
You take me to the edge of heaven 
One last time might be forever 
Don't you tell me lies, because believe me baby 
One day you'll wake up on your own. 
I ain't got no more worries 
I ain't got no more time for you 
Loving you takes such courage 
Everyone's got their eyes on you 
I ain't got no more worries 
I ain't got no more time for you 
Loving you takes such courage.</field>

I guess I must have loved you 
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, baby 
And now we're six months older 
And everything you want and everything you see 
Is out of reach not good enough 
I don't know what the hell you want from me 
Somebody tell me 
(won't you tell me) 
Why I work so hard for you 
(To give you money, work to give you money) 
Some people work for a living 
Some people work for fun 
Girl I just work for you 
They told me marriage was give and take 
Well you've shown me you can take 
You've got some giving to do 
And now you tell me that your having my baby 
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to 
But one step further and my back will break 
If my best isn't good enough 
Then how can it be good enough for two 
I can't work any harder than I do 
Somebody tell me 
(won't you tell me) 
Why I work so hard for you 
(To give you money, work to give you money) 
Oh why do I do the things I do 
I'd tell you if I knew 
My God, I don't even think that I love you 
(Won't you tell me) 
(To give you money, work to give you money) 
How could you settle 
For a boy like me 
When all I could see 
Was the end of the week 
All the things we sign 
And the things we buy 
Ain't gonna keep us together 
It's just a matter of time 
My situation 
Never changes 
Walking in and out of that door 
Like a stranger 
For the wages 
I give you all 
You say you want more 
And all I could see 
Was the end of the week 
All the things we sign 
And the things we buy 
Ain't gonna keep us together.</field>

Because I play them, too. 
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion, 
Time to pick my heart up off the floor. 
And when that love comes down without devotion, 
Well, it takes a strong man baby, but I'm 
Showing you the door, 
Cause I gotta have Faith 
I gotta have.. 
Faith 
Yes, I've gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith 
I gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith. 
Baby, I know you're asking me to stay 
Saying please, please, please don't go away 
You say I'm giving you the blues. 
Maybe you mean every word you say 
Can't help but think of yesterday 
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules 
Before this river becomes an ocean 
Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
Oh baby, I reconsider my foolish notion 
Well, I need someone to hold me, 
But I'll wait for something more. 
Cause I gotta have Faith... 
(repeat chorus) 
Before this river 
Becomes an ocean 
Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
(I've just got to have faith) 
I've reconsidered my foolish notion 
Yeah, I need someone to hold me, 
But I'll wait for something more....

Performed by David Bowie 
Fame, makes a man take things over 
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow 
Fame, puts you there, where things are hollow 
Fame 
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame 
that burns the change to keep you insane 
Fame 
Fame, what you like is in the Limo 
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow 
Fame, what you need you have to borrow 
Fame 
Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line 
to bind your time, it drives you to, ah, crime 
Fame 
Could it be the best, could it be? 
Really be, really, babe? 
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe? 
Really be, really, babe? 
Is it any wonder 
I reject you first? 
Fame, fame, fame, fame 
Is it any wonder 
you're too cool to fool 
Fame 
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me 
Got to get a rain-check on pain

One day you say you'll stay 
The next you're changing your plans 
Hey little baby 
Ain't much point in hanging around (Yea). 
Cause' if you ain't got time for me I'll find another Fantasy. 
It is kind of funny that you think that 
I am the boy to make you cry 
I can make you happy 
If only for a while 
Little baby I can give you all the loving that your heart desires 
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another Fantasy. 
It could be the price of love 
Could the price of hate 
What am I guilty of 
Why do you make me wait 
So long I don't know your intentions. 
Look to the sky's above 
I am in the hands of fate 
Push till it gets to shove 
I have got to know for heavens sake 
Is this love or invention 
Baby can't you see I'll find another Fantasy. 
You hang around with people who are sure to make you cry 
I can make you happy if only for a while 
Little baby oh, oh little baby 
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires 
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another Fantasy. 
You take someone's heart 
And you kick it around 
Keep on picking it up 
So you can watch it come down 
I don't know what I am suppose to do 
Why I wait for you to make up your mind 
Would you please be so kind 
When you know what to do I'll be in the next room 
But if you make it to late I may be in the next day.</field>

If you ain't got time for me I'll find another Fantasy 
You take someone's heart 
And you kick it around 
Keep on picking it up 
So you can watch it come down 
I don't know what I am suppose to do 
Why I wait for you to make up your mind 
Would you please be so kind 
When you know what to do I'll be in the next room 
But if you make it to late I may be in the next day</field>

Made my way into the night 
All that bullshit conversation 
Well, baby, can't you read the signs? 
I won't bore you with the details baby 
I don't even want to waste your time 
Let's just say that maybe 
You could help to ease my mind 
Baby, I aint Mr.Right 
But if your looking for fastlove 
If that's love in your eyes 
It's more than enough 
Had some bad luck 
So fastlove, is all that I've got on my mind 
What's there to think about baby? 
Looking for some affirmation 
Made my way into the sun 
My friends got their ladies, 
They're all having babies 
But I just want to have some fun 
I won't bore you with the details baby 
Got to get there in your own sweet time 
Let's just say that maybe 
You could help to ease my mind 
Baby, I aint Mr.Right 
Chorus 
What's there to think about baby? 
Get yourself some lessons in love 
In the absence of security 
I made my way into the night 
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me 
But I see nothing in his eyes 
I miss my baby 
I miss my baby, oh yeah, tonight 
So, why don't we make a little room 
In my Bmw babe 
Searching for some peace of mind 
Hey I'll help you find it 
I do believe that we are practicing 
The same religion 
You really ought to get up now 
Looking for some affirmation?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">That's all I wanted 
Something special, something sacred 
In your eyes 
For just one moment 
To be bold and naked 
At your side 
Sometimes I think that you'll never 
Understand me 
Maybe this time is forever 
Say it can be 
That's all you wanted 
Something special, someone sacred 
In your life 
Just for one moment 
To be warm and naked 
At my side 
Sometimes I think that you'll never 
Understand me 
But something tells me together 
We'd be happy 
(Baby) 
I will be your father figure 
(Oh baby) 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
(I'd love to) 
I will be your preacher teacher 
(Be your daddy) 
Anything you have in mind 
(It would make me) 
I will be your father figure 
(Very happy) 
I have had enough of crime 
(Please let me) 
I will be the one who loves you 
Until the end of time 
That's all I wanted 
But sometimes love can be mistaken 
For a crime 
That's all I wanted 
Just to see my baby's 
Blue eyed shine 
This time I think that my lover 
Understands me 
If we have faith in each other 
Then we can be 
Strong 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
I will be the one who loves you 
Until the end of time 
If you are the desert 
I'll be the sea 
If you ever hunger 
Hunger for me 
Whatever you ask for 
That's what I'll be 
So when you remember the ones who have lied 
Who said that they cared 
But then laughed as you cried 
Beautiful Darling 
Don't think of me 
Because all I ever wanted 
It's in your eyes baby, baby 
And love can't lie, no... 
(Greet me with the eyes of a child) 
My love is always tell me to... 
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile) 
Just hold on, hold on 
I won't let you go, my baby 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
(So I am gonna love you) 
Until the end of time 
I will be your father 
I will be your preacher 
I will be your daddy 
I will be the one who loves you until the end of time</field>

I will not give you up 
Gotta have some faith in the sound 
It's the one good thing that I've got 
I won't let you down 
So please don't give me up 
Because I would really, really love to stick around 
Heaven knows I was just a young boy 
Didn't know what I wanted to be 
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy 
And I guess it was enough for me towin the race? 
A prettier face! 
Brand new clothes and a big fat place 
On your rock and roll TV 
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way 
Think I'm gonna get me some happy 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I told you so 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone else I've got to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Take back your singing in the rain 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies 
and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy 
What a kick just a buddy and me 
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy 
We were living in a fantasy 
We won the race 
Got out of the place 
I went back home got a brand new face 
For the boys on MTV 
But today the way I play the game has got to change 
Oh yeah 
Now I'm gonna get myself happy 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I stopped the show 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone I forgot to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Don't think that I'll be back again 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies 
and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Well it looks like the road to heaven 
But it feels like the road to hell 
When I knew which side my bread was buttered 
I took the knife as well 
Posing for another picture 
Everybody's got to sell 
But when you shake your ass 
They notice fast 
And some mistakes were built to last 
That's what you get 
I say that's what you get 
That's what you get for changing your mind 
And after all this time 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
I'll hold on to my freedom 
May not be what you want from me 
Just the way it's got to be 
Lose the face now 
I've got to live</field>

Was a jolly happy soul 
With a corn cop pipe 
And a button nose 
And two eyes 
Made out of coal 
Frosty the snowman 
Is a fairy tale they say 
He was made out of snow 
But the children know how 
He came to life one day 
There must of been 
Some magic in 
That ol' silk cap 
They found 
For when they placed it 
On his head 
He began to dance around 
Frosty the snowman 
Was alive as he could be 
And the children say 
He could laugh and play 
Just the same 
As you and me 
Frosty the snowman 
Knew the snow 
Was hot that day 
So he said lets run 
And have some fun 
Before I melt away 
Down to the village 
With a broom stick 
In his hand 
Runnin' here and there 
All around the square 
Sayin' catch me 
If you can 
He led them down 
The streets of town 
Right 
To the traffic cop 
And he only 
Paused a moment 
When he heard him 
Holler stop 
Frosty the snowman 
Had to hurry on his way 
But he 
Waved goodbye sayin' 
Please don't cry 
I'll be back again

With a gun that he polished for a rainy day 
A smile and a quote from a vigilante move 
Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away 
He said it made him crazy 
Twenty five years living 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep 
She needs her mother but her mother is dead 
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget 
Just another hooker 
It happens everyday 
She loved her little baby 
But she couldn't bear to see her living 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
I believe in the gods of America 
I believe in the land of the free 
But no one told me 
No one told me 
That the gods believe in nothing 
So with empty hands I pray 
And from day to hopeless day 
They still don't see me 
See me 
Everybody talks about the new generation 
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind 
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation 
Like to help you buddy but I haven't got the time 
Somebody shouted save me 
But everybody started living 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
There's a big white lady 
On a big white doorstep 
She asked her daddy and her daddy said yes 
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get 
Has to give a little they say its for the best 
Somebody shouted maybe 
But they kept on living 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth 
So she ran to the arms of America 
And she kissed the powers that be 
And someone told me 
Someone told me 
That the gods believe in nothing 
So with empty hands I pray 
And I tell myself one day 
They just might see me.</field>

Put it in your heart and keep it 
There's something that I want you to know 
Do something for me 
Listen to my simple story 
And maybe we'll have someting to show 
You tell me you're cold on the inside 
How can the outside world 
Be a place that your heart can embrace 
Be good to yourself 
Because nobody else 
Has the power to make you happy 
How can I help you? 
Please let me try to 
I can heal the pain 
That you're feeling inside 
Whenever you want me 
You know that I will be 
Waiting for the day 
That you say you'll be mine 
He must have really hurt you 
To make you say the things that you do 
He must have really hurt you 
To make those pretty eyes look so blue 
He must have known 
That he could 
That you'd never leave him 
Now you can't see my love is good 
And that I'm not him 
How can I help you? 
Please let me try to 
I can heal the pain 
Won't you let me inside 
Whenever you want me 
You know that I will be 
Waiting for the day 
That you say you'll be mine 
Won't you let me in 
Let this love begin 
Won't you show me your heart now 
I'll be good to you 
I can make this thing true 
Show me the heart right now 
Who needs a lover 
That can't be a friend 
Something tells me I'm the one you've been looking for 
If you ever should see him again 
Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more 
Someone who will protect you 
Love and respect you 
All those things 
That he never could bring to you 
Like I do 
Or rather I would 
Won't you show me your heart 
Like you should 
How can I help you? 
Please let me try to 
I can heal the pain 
Won't you let me inside 
Whenever you want me 
You know that I will be 
Waiting for the day 
That you say you'll be mine 
Won't you let me in 
Let this love begin 
Won't you show me your heart now 
I'll be good to you 
I can make this thing true 
And get to your heart somehow</field>

A September morning with the sun and smell of the clover 
Down by the gates we sit and watch all our friends go by 
And pretend we don't hear the bell that rings through the 
summer sky 
I was happy with the kisses she gave me 
It's just that happy was she made me 
Happy that was until I saw you 
Chorus: 
Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you fail me now? 
You hurt me, desert me in my darkest hour 
Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you keep me here? 
How could I help but admire her beauty 
Standing on the line between desire and duty 
Heartbeat, heartbeat, it will end in tears 
I need a lover that loves such a dangerous place to be 
Oh, if we were meant for each other then why don't you answer me 
Don't keep me waiting, you know that I long to be by your side 
I was happy with the kisses she gave me 
Now there's nothing on earth that can save me 
Why should I care I can have you?.</field>

I still want you baby 
Heaven help me heaven help me 
Talk to strangers talk to strangers 
Heaven help me 
Over you 
Help me over you 
I can't seem to take these changes 
Everything reminds my heart of you 
Thought the first time was the last time 
Of being apart 
Now I find I'm having to search again 
It'll happen 
It's gotta happen 
Come together 
I just wish somebody would tell me when 
Oh such a waste of time

Get on the floor and move your booty mama

Hey shorty, I know you wanna party 
And the way your body look really make me feel naughty

I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew 
But everything I do, I do just for you 
I’m a little bit of Old, and a bigger bit of New 
The true niggers know that the peas come thrue 
We never decease, we never die no we never decease 
We multiply like we mathematice 
And then drop bombs like we in the middle east 
The bomb bombas, the base boom dramas 
Naw y’all know who we are 
Y’all know, we, the stars 
Steady rockin’ on y’alls boulevards

I do what I can 
Y’all come thru will.i.am 
And still I stand with still mic in hand 
So come on mama (hey) dance to the druma

So shake your bambama, come on now mama 
(repeat chorus) 
We the big town stompas, and big sound pumpas 
The beat bump bumpas in your trunk trunkas 
The girl is in the club with the big plump plumpas 
And when I’m makin’ love, my hip hump hump humps 
It never quits we never need to carry 9mm clips 
Don’t wanna squeeze trigger, just wanna squeeze tits 
Cause we the show stoppas 
And the chief rockas number one chief rockas 
Naw y’all know who we are 
Y’all know, we the stars 
Steady rockin’ on y’alls boulevards 
She be, Fergie, from the crew 
BEP, come and take heat, as we take the lead

Shake that thing like we in the city of sin and 
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party

But the race is not for the swift 
But for who can endure it 
And tippa Irie and the black eyed peas will be there

The sights our eyes befall 
Will open up our merging hearts 
And feed our empty souls 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 
Without despair, we will share 
And the joys of caring will not be erased 
What has been, must never end 
The joys of caring will not be replaced 
When the seeds of love have planted firm 
They won't be hard to find 
And the songs of love I sing to you 
Will echo in my mind 
Hey! 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 
I said. 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever. 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever

Turn down these voices inside my head 
Lay down with me, tell me no lies 
Just hold me close, don't patronize 
Don't patronize me 
'Cause I can't make you love me If you don't 
You can't make your heart feel something it won't 
Here in the dark in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power 
But you won't, no you won't 
And I can't make you love me 
If you don't 
I'll close my eyes and then I won't see 
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me 
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right 
Just give me till then, to give up this fight 
And I will give up this fight 
And I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel something it won't 
And here in the dark in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power

Ain't no use in you trying 
It's no good for me baby without love

I know the taste of victory 
Though I went through some nights 
Consumed by the shadows 
I was crippled emotionally 
Somehow I made it through the heartache 
Yes I did, I escaped 
I found my way out of the darkness, 
Kept my faith (I know you did) 
Kept my faith 
When the river was deep I didn't falter 
When the mountain was high I still believed 
When the valley was low iit didn't stop me, no no 
I knew you were waiting 
I knew you were waiting for me 
With and endless desire I kept on searching 
Sure in time our eyes would meet 
Like the bridge is on fire 
The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free 
No, I don't regret a single moment 
No I don't looking back 
When I think of all those disappointments 
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh 
When the river was deep I didn't falter 
When the mountain was high I still believed 
When the valley was low iit didn't stop me, no no 
I knew you were waiting 
I knew you were waiting for me 
So we were drawn together through destiny 
I know this love we share was meant to be 
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting</field>

I want your sex 
I want your love 
I want your sex

It's playin' on my mind 
It's dancin' on my soul

So why don't you just let me go 
I'd really like to try 
Oh, I'd really like to know 
When you tell me you're gonna regret it 
Then I tell you that i love you but you still say no 
I swear I won't tease you 
Won't tell you no lies

Just look in my eyes 
I've waited so long baby 
Out in the cold 
I can't take much more girl 
I'm losing control

It's natural 
It's chemical

It's logical 
Habitual

It's sensual

Sex is something that we should do 
Sex is something for me and you 
Sex is natural, sex is good 
Not everybody does it, but everybody should 
Sex is natural, sex is fun 
Sex is best when it's (one on one)

I'll be your first, I'll be your last 
I'll be the only one you ask 
I'll be your friend, I'll be your toy 
I'll be the one who brings you joy 
I'll be your hope, I'll be your pearl 
I'll take you halfway 'round the world! 
I'll make you rich - I'll make you poor

`Cause the fifties shifted out of gear 
He was an idol then, now he's an idol here 
But his face has changed, he's not the same no more 
And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before 
He was tight-assed 
Walking on broken glass 
Highly prized in the wallet size 
The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes 
But don't pretend that it won't end

how many reasons call 
it doesn't really matter at all 
It doesn't matter that I failed to 
break down your father's wall 
it doesn't really matter at all 
why tell me you don't understand when you do 
I thought I had something to say 
but it doesn't really matter at all... 
I changed my name 
to be rid of the things that I want from you 
it's strange 
but a name is a name and the truth is the truth 
oh, there is always 
always someone there to remind me 
so I learn to live with shame 
tell myself I feel no pain 
but I do 
and if I have to tell you 
then it really doesn't matter at all... 
and it's no good looking back 
because time's thief and I believe that 
I'm too old for that 
we're just saying the things that we have said 
forever 
it doesn't really matter that I loved you 
how many seasons fall 
it's too bad 
it really doesn't matter at all.</field>

Heaven sent and heaven stole 
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
And what have I learned from all this pain 
I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again 
But now I know 
Chorus: 
When you find a love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 
When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 
Sadness in my eyes 
No one guessed and no one tried 
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
Loveless and cold 
With your last breath you saved my soul 
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
And what have I learned from all these tears 
I've waited for you all those years 
Then just when it began he took your love away 
But I still say 
Chorus 
So the words you could not say 
I'll sing them for you 
And the love we would have made 
I'll make it for two 
For every single memory 
Has become a part of me 
You will always be my love 
Well I've been loved so I know just what love is 
And the lover that I kissed is always by my side 
Oh the lover I still miss..

No sign of life since '75 
Then one day he just, what do you know 
I guess God just called his number 
He called me up he called me up and said: 
"I've been awake about a week 
I'm thinking about asking the doctor 
If he could put me back to sleep" 
Then he laughed and said: 
"Hey all the girls they look the same" 
Don't they know just what their mothers 
Paid in blood, and tears to change 
But the words that made me cry 
The thing he softly said 
It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head 
He said: "If Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?" 
Youth, beautiful youth 
We walked through the walls until we found the truth 
And said: "Change it, it's ugly just change it" 
Everyone we used to know 
Must have given up, so long ago 
You can see it, it's written on their faces 
And the inside of their clothes 
But the words that made me cry 
'Cause I knew just what they meant 
He turned to me and said: 
"Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?" 
"Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come Marvin and Elvis are dead?" 
I said: "If Jesus Christ is going to save us from ourselves 
How come peace, love and Elvis are dead?"</field>

´Cause that was the day that my daddy died 
Never had a chance to see him, no 
Never heard nothin? but bad things about him 
Mama, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth 
Mama just hung her head and said 
(Chorus) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
Hey, mama, is it true what they say 
That papa never worked a day in his life 
Some bad talks going around sayin? 
Papa had three outside children 
And anouther wife 
That ain?t right 
Heard some talks about papa and his storefront 
Preachin? 
Talkin? about saving souls and all the time 
Leaching 
And dealing in the dirt 
Stealin? in the name of the lord 
But mama she just said 
(Chorus) 
Papa was a rollin? stone 
Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
(And when he died) 
All he left us was alone (repeat) 
Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades 
Is that what sent papa to an early grave? 
Folks say papa would bag, borrow of steal just 
To pay his bills 
Hey, mama, folks say papa was ever much on thinkin? 
Spent most of this time chasin? women and drinkin? 
But mouther, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth 
But my mama she just said

When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
Strange that you were strong enough 
To even make a start 
But you'll never find 
Peace of mind 
Till you listen to your heart 
People 
You can never change the way they feel 
Better let them do just what they want 
For they will 
If you let them 
Steal your heart from you 
People 
Will always make a lover feel a fool 
But you knew I loved you 
We could have shown them all 
We should have seen love through 
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes 
Covered me with kisses and lies 
So goodbye 
But please don't take my heart 
You are far 
But I'm never gonna be your star 
I'll pick up the pieces 
And mend my heart 
Maybe I'll be strong enough 
I don't know where to start 
But I'll never find 
Peace of mind 
While I listen to my heart 
People... 
You can never change the way they feel 
Better let them do just what they want

If you let them 
Steal your heart from you 
People 
Will always make a lover feel a fool 
But you knew I loved you 
We could have shown them all 
We should have seen love through 
But remember this 
Every other kiss 
That you ever give 
Long as we both live 
When you need the hand of another man 
One you really can surrender with 
I will wait for you 
Like I always do 
There's something there 
That can't compare with any other 
You are far 
When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
Strange that I was wrong enough 
To think you'd love me too 
I guess you were kissing a fool 
You must have been kissing a fool</field>

Last Christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
CHORUS 
Once bitten and twice shy 
I keep my distance 
But you still catch my eye 
Tell me baby 
Do you recognize me? 
Well 
It's been a year 
It doesn't surprise me 
HAPPY CHRISTMAS 
I wrapped it up and sent it 
With a note saying "I love you" 
I meant it 
Now I know what a fool I've been 
But if you kissed me now 
I know you'd fool me again 
CHORUS 
Crowded room 
Runs with tired eyes 
I'm hiding from you 
And your solemn eyes 
My god I thought you were 
Someone to rely on 
Me? 
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man undercover but you tore me apart 
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again 
CHORUS 2x 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man undercover but you tore him apart 
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone.</field>

You don't think life comes in between 
But hey, she's just seventeen 
She feels that she's a worldly girl 
But man you've been around the world 
She is just some worried daddy's girl 
Even though there's nothing I can say 
Its just human nature any way 
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on a dime 
Let her down easy 
And you'll grow up in time 
In her strawberry eyes 
The way she sees you signifies 
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies 
But if you must lay her down 
May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown 
And please do not lead her on when you leave town 
Even though there's nothing I can say 
Its just human nature any way 
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on the line 
Let her down easy 
And you'll grow up in time 
She's a woman now 
With a daughter to make her proud 
In her crayon world of paper clouds 
She still remembers you 
The first boy that she gave it to 
And she laughs at how little then she knew 
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on the line 
Let her down easy

Here she comes 
Heads turn around 
Here she comes 
To take her crown 
Is there a time to walk for cover 
A time for kiss and tell 
Is there a time for different colors 
Different names you find it hard to spell 
Is there a time for first communion 
A time for east 17 
Is there a time to turn the mecca 
Is there a time to be a beauty queen 
Here she comes 
Beauty plays the crown 
Here she comes 
Surreal in her crown 
(Pavarotti) 
Dici che il fiume 
trova la via al mare 
E come il fiume 
giungerai a me 
Oltre i confini 
e le terre assetate 
Dici che come fiume 
come fiume 
L'amore giunger 
L'amore 
E non so pi pregare 
E nell'amore non so pi sperare 
E quell'amore non so pi aspettare 
English translation: 
You say that the river 
finds the way to the sea 
And as the river 
you'll come to me 
Beyond the borders 
and the thirsty lands 
You say that as river 
As river 
Love will come 
Love 
And I cannot pray anymore 
And I cannot hope in love anymore 
And I cannot wait for love anymore

Is there a time for tying ribbons 
A time for Christmas trees 
Is there a time for laying tables

Why can't you set your monkey free? 
Always giving into it - 
Do you love your monkey or do you love me? 
Why can't you do it 
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
Oh, I count to ten 
But I don't know how and I don't know when 
To open my eyes 
If you kiss me again 
Like you did just now, like you did just then 
I've had the rest 
Now it's time I had the best 
So you tell me that you won't do anymore 
Well I'd write your heart a letter 
But I think you know me better 
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe 
I'll get what I'm askin' for 
Why can't you do it? 
Why can't you set your monkey free? 
Always giving in to it - 
Do you love your monkey or do you love me? 
Why can't you do it 
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
Oh I hate your friends 
But I don't know how and I don't know when 
To open your eyes 
Yes the monkey's back again 
Do you want him now like you did back then? 
I tried my best 
But your head is such a mess 
So I guess that I don't want you anymore 
Well you say you care about me 
That you just can't do without me 
But you keep on dancin' baby 
'Til that monkey has you on the floor 
Why can't you do it? 
Why can't you set your monkey free? 
Always giving into it 
Do you love the monkey or do you love me? 
Why can't you do it 
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
Don't look now 
There's a monkey on your back 
Don't look now 
There's a monkey on you....</field>

In the clothes that daddy wore 
Mothers pride 
Baby Boy 
His father's eyes 
He's a soldier waiting for war 
Time will come 
He'll hold a gun 
His father's son 
And as he grows 
He hears the band 
Takes the step from boy to man 
And at the shore she waves her son goodbye 
Like the man she did before 
Mothers pride 
Just a boy 
His country's eyes 
He's a soldier waving at the shore 
And in her heart the time has come 
To lose a son 
And all the husbands, all the sons, all the lovers gone 
They make no difference 
No difference in the end 
Still hear the woman say your daddy died a hero 
In the name of God and man 
Mothers pride 
Crazy boy 
His lifeless eyes 
He's a soldier now forevermore 
He'll hold a gun till kingdom come

I gotta tell you 
I've seen things I never wanted to see 
I've got to get back on my feet 
I feel like I've been sleeping 
sweet, sweet time 
has been a real good friend of mine 
waiting for that change of season 
of the winter's been so long 
searching for that rhyme or reason 
you've just got to 
move on 
hold it together, move on 
life's so short, move on 
only time will set you free 
you put your fears behind you better get yourself where you wanna be 
I think of all the days and nights I spent crying 
and I move on 
I've been in and out of favour with love 
because I gotta tell you 
I've been things I never wanted to be 
and then some angel called me up 
he told me I was sleeping 
said don't waste time 
cos even angels say goodbye 
waiting for that change of season 
oh the winter's been so long 
searching for that rhyme or reason 
you've just got to 
move on... 
and oh, there goes another season 
getting hard to find a decent song to play 
but oh, I guess I got my reasons 
everybody thinks I'm doing a.o.k 
they ought to know by now

you put your tears behind you 
better get yourself where you wanna be

before my angel set me free

            <field name="lyrics">My mother had a brother 
They say that I was born on the day that he died 
"Someone to cling to", she said 
"When all the noises and the shame came calling" 
My mother had a brother 
I thought I knew them all, I thought I knew 
But she lied 
I said: "Show me his face again, tell me again why he died" 
She said he couldn't wait for the things that I've seen 
She said he wasn't strong enough, he never dared to dream a life like mine 
My mother had a brother 
Over-sensitive and kind 
Seems it all became too much for him 
It seems he took his own life 
Mum, I can't imagine the joy and pain in equal measure 
Tears in the dirt, and all over your newborn treasure 
I guess he had to wait until my momma had me 
I guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free 
In endless sky..... 
But mama will you tell him from your boy 
The times they changed 
I guess the world was getting warmer 
And we got stronger 
Mother will you tell him about my joy 
I live each day for him 
The sun came out, yeah 
And I'm just breathing it in 
My mother had a brother 
Same desire, different time 
Seems the empty spaces tortured him 
Until he took his own life 
I don't know why I waited so long for love 
I just don't know what I was thinking of 
All that wasted time 
But mama will you tell him from your boy 
The times they changed 
I guess the world was getting warmer 
While we got stronger 
Mother will you tell him about my joy 
I live each day with him 
Your son came out, yeah 
And I'm still breathing it in 
And I swear now that freedom is here 
I'm gonna taste it all for you boy 
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn 
I'm making so much love 
(I'm making so much love) 
So those of us who have nothing to fear 
We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it 
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned 
I'm making so much love 
(I'm making so much love) 
I was a prisoner, but he saved me 
Broke into my dreams and said: "Who cares?" 
I was a prisoner, so disgrace me 
I'm glad to be home 
And I don't believe they care</field>

You never know, you just might see, 
Another boy who crept in your room... 
Take your time...(that's what you told me), 
Take your time... 
But I fell head first, and I just don't know what to do. 
Chorus: 
Nothing looks the same in the light, 
Only a fool like me would take to heart, 
The things you said you meant last night. 
Nothing looks the same in the light, 
I'll keep my feet firm on the ground. 
Nothing looks the same in the light, 
There's danger in a stranger, 
With a warm hand and a kiss so right. 
Nothing looks the same in the light, 
It's been a pleasure, - see you around... 
I watch the sun, upon the sheets. 
I hear a car, out on the street, 
And gently pull you close, it's over too soon. 
What can I do, but wait and see, 
Hold on to you, please stay with me, 
Because you're the first, and I want to stay here with you.

Made me cry

For an uptown boy 
Whose teacher has told him goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
When you were just a stranger 
And I was at your feet 
I didn't feel the danger 
Now I feel the heat 
That look in your eyes 
Telling me no 
So you think that you love me 
Know that you need me 
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong 
Just let me go

There are things

But the one thing I have is my pride 
Oh so I don't want to learn to

You say you want it, you got it

That Papa never worked a day in his life 
Some bad talk going around sayin` 
Papa had there outside children 
And another wife 
That ain`t right 
Heard some talk about Papa and his storefront 
Preachin` 
Talkin` about saving souls and all the time 
Leaching 
And dealing in dirt 
Stealin` in the name of the Lord 
But Mama she just said 
Chorus 
Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades 
Is that what sent Papa to an early grave? 
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow or steal just 
To pay his bills. 
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin` 
Spent most of his time chansin` women and drinkin`

No time for introduction

And the satellite says, "Take a look at all we have" 
But the old man says, 
"You want my family, for your liberty...I can't do that." 
Look into the eyes of any patient man 
Whether they be amber, green or blue, 
There's a piece of God staring back at you 
But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves 
They see our broken women 
On imaginary shelves 
But the satellite says, "Won't you people look at all we have? 
Don't you want it? 
Can't you see the things that you lack?" 
Children in his arms, he turns his back.</field>

They will not be the last 
Look around now 
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers 
This is the year of the hungry man 
Whose place is in the past 
Hand in hand with ignorance 
And legitimate excuses 
The rich declare themselves poor 
And most of us are not sure 
If we have too much 
But we'll take our chances 
Because god's stopped keeping score 
I guess somewhere along the way 
He must have let us all out to play 
Turned his back and all god's children 
Crept out the back door 
And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate 
Hanging on to hope 
When there is no hope to speak of 
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late 
Well maybe we should all be praying for time 
These are the days of the empty hand 
Oh you hold on to what you can 
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year 
This is the year of the guilty man 
Your television takes a stand 
And you find that what was over there 
Is over here 
So you scream from behind your door 
Say "what's mine is mine and not yours" 
I may have too much but I'll take my chances 
Because god's stopped keeping score 
And you cling to the things they sold you 
Did you cover your eyes when they told you 
That he can't come back 
Because he has no children to come back for 
It's hard to love, there's so much to hate</field>

            <field name="lyrics">In my house there’s a circle, where the life comes in 
From the stars to my home, down through the stone, 
I could have been so alone, 
Without my precious box 
Have I a family? I guess not 
I’ve never seen a lot of beauty 
In my life. 
Well in your house there are servants, and the lights all dim 
Such a beautiful home, your agent’s on the phone, they never 
leave you alone 
The party never stops! 
You say that’s fantasy, I say “So what, I need a little beauty…” 
So let me in, 
You know you’ve kind of got under my skin 
You know we never see a lot of the action round here 
My dear 
You may want to strip again 
And you look so fine in your Gucci suit 
And you’re making more money than your daddy 
could have imagined 
But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time 
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb 
Don’t you know that the moment will come 
I will find someone like you 
But with something extra, I’m sorry baby 
I don’t know why 
I don’t know why that is 
The systematic breakdown of my community 
You know I hate my job, I try to save but God 
There’s just never enough 
Switch on, the pressure - stops 
You know the one for me, she’s on Fox 
And she’s a little beauty… 
Give me your life, give me your life, I want it 
Because lately, it’s so freezing out here 
(This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass) 
In so many ways, but you make it good 
Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could 
(This side of the glass…) 
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb 
Don’t you know that the moment will come 
I will find someone like you 
But with something extra, I’m so sorry baby 
I don’t know why 
I don’t know why that is 
Precious keeps me company 
Keeps me from being alone 
Because no-one comes in the morning 
No-one comes in the evening time 
I’d sit and wait for the phone to ring 
I could be waiting my whole damn life 
So sick of the same old faces 
In this street, where nobody talks to me 
And the funny side of the situation is 
I don’t care, I’ll always be there 
When you come down from the sky 
And make yourself at home 
In my house 
Because these days it’s the money the money 
The money, honey, or your life 
I said don’t you know you can’t have both 
Stop acting so dumb 
The moment will come 
I will find someone like you 
Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby 
I don’t know why (something) 
Said I don’t know why that is 
You may want to strip again 
You may want to let me in 
You may want to sacrifice 
More than you think is fair or right 
You may want to think again 
You may want to watch your friends 
You may want to change your mind 
You may wish you could turn back time</field>

            <field name="lyrics">My daddy got here on the gravy train 
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game 
They went walking and she took his name 
Round here 
There was dancing in the afternoons those days 
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made 
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same 
Frightened little girl, she makes a break 
Into the arms of.. 
something better 
Round here 
I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park 
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark 
Waiting patiently to make my mark 
Round here 
And I remember my first day at school 
And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool 
I remember it all, like yesterday 
Don't you 
Every time I try to leave this place 
Something inside says: "You can do better" 
Round here 
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived 
I want to put my hands in this earth again 
Music fell like rain to the streets 
The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat 
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world 
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space 
Is the place of my birth 
When all that I wanted, was to be someone. 
Two little Hitlers in an old church hall 
Some cheesy covers and those neighbours that banged on the walls 
Andy says it's time to show them all 
Round here 
Please sir, we two have other plans 
Please sir you would not understand, 
What's going on 
Is magical, can't you see 
That some of us do more than dream 
Every time I try to leave this place 
Something inside says: "Keep on keeping, on and on..." 
Around here 
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived 
I want to put my hands in this earth again 
Music fell like rain to the streets 
The Specials and The Jam, ABC 
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world 
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space 
Is the place of my birth 
My birth, 
In this town, 
Yes I guess I got to be someone 
To be somebody 
In the Beautiful city 
This place I call home 
These streets of London 
It's everything I know (everything and everybody) 
On the streets of London 
I want to thank you 
My daddy got here on the gravy train</field>

But your don't know the days 
Since somebody loved me 
You came 
And led me through that door again 
You say you want to stay 
But you don't know me (no you don't) 
You make me feel safe 
Someday 
My darkest fears will find their way 
After all 
Somebody loves me 
All day 
My heart tells strangers how I feel 
And it's hard not to feel this way

George Michael 
I’ve had enough of danger 
People are on the streets 
I’m looking out for Angels 
Just tryin’ to find some peace 
I think its time 
That you let me know 
So if you love me, say you love me 
But if you don’t just let me go 
Cuz teacher there are things that I don’t want to learn 
And the last one I had made me cry 
So I don’t wanna learn to hold you, touch you 
I think that your mine 
Because there ain’t no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who’s teacher has told him Good bye 
Goodbye...Goodbye 
When you were just a stranger 
And I was at your feet 
I didn’t feel the danger 
Now I feel the heat 
That look in your eyes 
Tellin’ me no 
So you think that you love me 
Know that you need me 
I wrote this song, I know its wrong, Just let me go 
Teacher there are things that I don’t want to learn 
And the last one I had made me cry 
So I don’t wanna learn to hold you, touch you 
I think that your mine 
Cuz there ain’t no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who’s teacher has told him Goodbye… 
So when you say that you need me 
That you'll never leave me 
I know your wrong, your not that strong 
Let me go 
And teacher there are things that I still have to learn 
But the one thing I have 
Is my pride 
Oh, so I don’t wanna learn to hold you, touch you 
I think that your mine 
Because there ain’t no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who just isn’t willing to try 
I’m so cold Inside 
Maybe Just one more try

I thought the sun rose in your eyes 
and the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave 
to the dark and endless skies, my love 
to the dark and empty skies 
the first time ever I kissed your mouth 
I felt the earth move in my hands 
like the trembling heart of a captive bird 
that was there at my command, my love 
that was there at my command 
the first time I ever lay with you 
and felt you heart so close to mine 
and I knew our joy would fill the world 
and would last till the and of time, my love 
it would last till the end of time 
the first time ever I saw your face 
your face, your face.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">The grave that they dug him had flowers 
Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors, 
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone. 
He's gone. 
When the wars of our nation did beckon, 
A man barely twenty did answer the calling. 
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation, 
He's gone, 
But Eternity knows him, and it knows what we've done. 
And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers 
Leaving brown, muddy clay where the earth had been dry. 
And deep in the trench he waited for hours, 
As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die. 
But the silence of night was shattered by fire 
As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air. 
And one after another his comrades were slaughtered. 
In morgue of Marines, alone standing there. 
He crouched ever lower, ever lower with fear. 
"They can't let me die! The can't let me die here! 
I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth. 
I'll cover myself! I know I'm not brave! 
The earth! the earth! the earth is my grave." 
The grave that they dug him had flowers 
Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors, 
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone..</field>

nobody told me 
the seeds that are sown 
they still control me 
there's a liar in my head 
there's a thief upon my bed 
and the strangest thing 
is I cannot get my eyes open 
take my hand 
lead me to some peaceful land 
that I cannot find 
inside my head 
wake me with love 
it's all I need 
but in all this time 
still no one said... 
if I had not asked 
would you have told me 
if you call this love 
why don't you hold me 
there's a liar in my head 
there's a thief upon my bed 
and the strangest thing

give something I can hold 
give me something to believe in 
I am frightened for my soul, please, please

I was back in the old days - long ago 
When we were kids, when we were young 
Things seemed so perfect - you know? 
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were 
Young 
The sun was always shinin` - we just lived for fun 
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don`t know 
The rest of my life`s been - just a show. 
Those were the days of our lives 
The bad things in life were so few 
Those daays are all gone now but one thing is true- 
When I look and I find, I still love you. 
You can`t turn back the clock, you can`t turn 
Back the tide 
Ain`t that a shaame? (Ain`t that a shame?) 
I`d like to go back one time on a roller coaster 
Ride 
When life was just a game 
No use sitting and thinkin` on what you did 
When you can lay back and anjoy it through your 
Kids 
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don`t know 
Better sit back and go - -with the flow 
`Cause these are the days of our lives 
They`ve flown in the swiftness of time 
These days are all gone now but some things remain 
When I look and I find - no change 
Those were the days of our lives 
The bad things in life were so few 
Those days are all gone now but one thing is trrue- 
When I look and I find, I still love you 
I still llove you 
I love you 
I still love you 
I still love you 
I still love you.</field>

And I'll go where I've longed

George: 
Don't kiss me, darling 
I want you to hear the things I say 
I loved you in my way 
But you know I'm gonna leave you 
Mutya: 
The clock was always ticking 
And your heart, 
Yes I know your heart is always on the run 
George: 
I hate what I've become 
But I'm still gonna leave you 
And I don't think you should stay for the night 
Mutya: 
Baby you know that my flesh is weak 
You know I simply 
Both: 
I cannot sleep without you 
My heart has simply nowhere to go 
Mutya: 
Nothing to hold 
Those tears you're crying 
George: 
Time and time again you take me back in baby 
Mutya: 
You don't have to make it plain 
Both: 
This is not real love 
Mutya: 
Look at us dancing baby 
Let's dance and show them all 
(Dance and show them all) 
How close we are 
The lies have worked so far 
So we go on deceiving 
George: 
But darling don't you know the time 
Baby, look at yourself, holding back the tide 
Like you've got something else up your sleeve 
That's why I've got to leave 
Both: 
And I don't think you should stay here tonight 
(Baby don't you know that my flesh is weak, you know) 
I simply I cannot sleep without you 
But someday I'll have nothing to show 
(Nothing to show) 
(Nothing to show) 
I've nothing to hold 
George: 
Oh, baby, crying 
All those simple things that won't come again 
Oh do I have to make it plain 
This is not real love 
And I said this is not real love 
Mutya: 
Real love 
Baby it don't glisten and shine the way it used to 
George: 
This is not real love (real love) 
Baby think of all the promises I made on the day that I seduced you 
Baby don't wait for me like some angel of tragedy 
I have to set you free 
Darling you should be long gone, oh long gone by now 
You should be with someone, someone 
Mutya: 
Glisten and shine 
You promised me 
George: 
You've gotta face it woman, you ain't ever gonna change me 
Mutya: 
Where will I go, what do I know 
About life without you 
You promised me you'd never leave me, no

Don't have to be so scared 
Don't have to hide what you can 
You just have to believe in this kind of love 
Everybody's telling me that these are dangerous times 
For you and me, can't you see baby? 
Maybe we have better take a little care 
With this love 
Ooh, I know 
Cos I can't be happy without you 
Then I'll be the one 
Now that I 've found you 
Now that I 've found you 
Now that I 've found you 
I don't have to hold you down 
I don't need to push you around 
I just want you to be 
This kind of love 
And if someone hurt you before 
Can't you see 
All that I wanna give you much more 
Just have faith in me 
This kind of love 
Everybody's telling me that these are dangerous times 
For you and me, can't you see baby? 
People got to take a little bit of care 
When they got doubt 
Don't let it go no, never no 
And all I know 
I don't have no reason to doubt you 
Don't you think it's time 
To believe in someone 
So I'm telling you 
Now that I found you 
Now that I found you 
I can't let you go 
Nobody's perfect 
All have a past 
When you look at me 
How can you ask if I love you 
Is it so hard to see? 
Now everyone has to get over I know 
But this empty house seems to get 
Colder and colder 
So won't you stay here with me? 
And all I know 
Is that I don't have no reason to doubt you 
Don't you think it's time 
To believe in someone 
So I'm telling you 
Now that I found you</field>

And they may strip me of the things that I've worked for 
But I've had my say 
So hear me now 
I've enough of these chains 
I know they're of my making 
No one else to blame for where I stand today 
I've no memory of truth 
But suddenly the audience is so cruel 
So God, hey God you know why I'm through 
Through 
I guess it's tough, I guess I'm older 
And everything must change 
But all this cruelty and money instead of love 
People, have we no shame? 
They may chase me to the ends of the earth 
But I've got you babe 
And they may take away the things that I've worked for 
But you'll pull me through 
It's so clear to me now 
I've enough of these chains 
Life is there for the taking 
What kind of fool would remain in this cheap gilded cage

I look around for a fantasy 
maybe who can tell? 
let me live my life beside the river 
take me to places where a child can grow 
and then 
maybe the boy inside will forsake me 
maybe 
the child in me 
will just let me go

I'm going down

My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear 
Oh, and I cannot find the time

Just let the curtains close in silence

Why not approach with less defiance

Why worry til the babies cry 
I was wrong, its the blues we're singing

And there's no way the gods are fearing me baby 
They don't even try, they don't even try

Just seem to pass me by, no matter how I try 
I hope you understand 
This is not what I had planned for us 
God only knows if my dreams are coming or gone 
dreams are coming or gone 
But you're still holding my hand sweetheart, sweetheart 
And for every single day you're here 
It's crystal clear 
That God isn't mad at me at all, He isn't mad at me at all 
And all this praying hard aint gonna save the day 
Maybe that's really what I'm guilty of 
I know we live in times when love is not enough 
its not enough no no no 
And there's no way the gods are fearing me 
baby they don't even try 
And all the things I thought I'd give you

Somewhere we could be fine 
where the children could play 
And we'd eat like kings every day</field>

I can't say I've found a cure for these

So they're not so strong 
You look for your dreams in heaven 
But what the hell are you supposed to do 
When they come true? 
Well there's one year of my life in the songs 
And some of them are about you 
Now I know there's no way I can write those wrongs 
Believe me 
I would not lie you've hurt my pride 
And I guess there's a road without you 
But you once said 
There's a way back for every man 
So here I am 
Don't people change, here I am

Don't you know that 
The years will come and go 
Some of us will change our lives 
Some of us still have nothing to show 
Nothing baby 
But memories 
And if these wounds 
They are self-inflicted 
I don't really know 
How my poor heart could have protected me 
But if I have to carry this pain 
If you will not share the blame 
I deserve to see your face again 
C'mon now 
You don't have to be so strong now 
Come back 
Come back to me darling 
I will make it worth your while 
Come back to your baby 
I miss your kiss 
I miss your smile 
Seems to me the peace I search to find 
Ain't going to be mine until you say you will 
Don't you keep me waiting for that day 
I know, I know, I know 
You hear these words that I say 
You can't always get what you want

You sent my soul sky high 
When your loving starts 
A Jitterbug into my brain (yeah, yeah) 
It goes bang bang bang 
Till my feet do the same 
but something's bugging me 
Something's ain't right 
My best friend told me what 
you did last night 
Left me sleeping in my bed 
I was dreaming but I should 
have been with you instead 
* Wake me up before you go-go 
Don't leave me hanging on like a yoyo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high 
Wake me up before you go-go 
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
Take me dancing tonight 
I wanna hit that high yeah yeah 
You put the grey skies out of my way 
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day 
Turn the bright spark into a flame 
My beats per minute never been the same 
'Cause you are my lady I'm your fool 
It makes me crazy when you act so cool 
Come on baby let's not fight 
We'll go dancing 
Everything will be alright 
* Wake me up before you go-go 
Don't leave me hanging on like a yoyo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high 
Wake me up before you go-go 
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
Take me dancing tonight 
I wanna hit that high yeah yeah yeah 
Cuddle up baby move in tight 
We'll go dancing tomorrow night 
It's cold out there but it's warm in bed 
They can dance, we'll go home instead 
* Wake me up before you go-go 
Don't leave me hanging on like a yoyo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high 
Wake me up before you go-go 
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo 
Wake me up before you go-go 
Take me dancing tonight 
Wake me up before you go go 
don't you dare to leave me on like a yo yo yo 
take me dancin'

            <field name="lyrics">She's got a song in her head and she'll sing to me, 
She's got a laugh that reminds me of why she's in love with me, 
She'd never let show she was lonely in case it had frightened me, 
She was carpet and stone, independent, alone, 
But her love always shone around me, 
Every time... 
Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again, 
Free from the seasons and this state I'm in, 
And oh, I can't hold it all under one love, 
It was so long ago when we kissed in the streets, 
Now you fly like an eagle above, 
While I waltz away anyway, 
I'll be waltzing my days away, 
Searching for this woman I love. 
She had a history of joy and pain in time, 
And she chose to leave, 
She had a thousand and one photographs, 
That you would not believe, 
She'll come to you in disguise, 
She's there in your children's eyes, 
Still our mother... 
She' still your wife, 
(So let her...) 
Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again 
Free from the reasons for this state I'm in, 
And oh, (trust me, she ain't going anywhere) 
I can't hold it all under one love, 
(Trust me, she told me, when you're ready she'll be there) 
It was so long ago, (no don't let go of her) 
When we kissed in the streets, 
Now you fly like an eagle above, 
While I waltz away anyway, 
I'll be waltzing my days away, 
Searching for this woman I love. 
And the moment you see me 
I will live in your life 
We will walk through my garden 
I will see through your eyes, 
I was in despair 'till she found me there, 
Every grown man cries with his mother's eyes, 
And when you're ready too, 
She'll come back to you, 
She's waiting, 
Father....</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I spend my nights down on the wharf 
In unlit alleyways 
By the church downtown 
Where Sally prays 
Come down sometime 
We'll share a rusty can of corn... 
And listen to the radio 
I love you, I love you, it says... 
CHORUS: 
Where did your heart go 
Did you put it on a train 
Did you leave it in the rain 
Or down in Mexico 
You cry, but I don't know 
I've heard it all before 
There it goes again, the slamming of the door 
Sometimes the river calls me 
And at night it calls my name 
Says "put your troubles down beside me" 
Things have always been the same... 
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me 
What the river said that night 
I jumped into this beauty 
And drifted out of sight...

I'm back 
Prouder than ever baby 
Louder than ever maybe 
One more pill 
Just one more beer 
One less star in the atmosphere 
For us 
But maybe she just wanted to be free 
Heartless pictures on TV 
Change that channel that could have been me 
I said 
Maybe she just wanted to be free 
So I just kept breathing my friends 
Waiting for the man to choose 
Saying this ain't the day that it ends 
Because there's no white light 
And I'm not through 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
And I've got so much more 
That I want to do 
With the music 
Was it music that saved me? 
Or the way that you prayed for me? 
Guess either way I thank you 
I'm alive 
Hotel, motel makes it clear 
One more voice we will never hear 
Again 
But maybe he just wanted to be free 
And I don't know what the hell 
What the gods, what the f*** I'm saying 
Half the time 
Something divine, oh divine 
Brought me back to you 
And I know it 
So I just kept breathing my friends 
Waiting for some god to choose 
Saying this ain't the day that it ends 
Because there's no white light 
And I'm not through 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
And I've got so much more 
That I want to do 
Was it music? 
Was it science that saved me? 
Or the way that you prayed for me? 
Guess either way I thank you 
I'm alive 
And tomorrow is mine 
I said tomorrow is mine 
Said I've just got to keep on breathing 
I said no 
Don't let go 
Keep on breathing 
Got to keep on, got to keep on, got to keep on 
I've just got to keep on breathing 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
And I've got so much more 
That I want to give 
Was it music? 
Was it science that saved me? 
Or the way that you prayed for me? 
Well I thank you

            <field name="lyrics">She takes the back road and the lane 
Past the school that has no changed 
In all this time 
She thinks of when the boy was young 
All the battles she had won 
Just to give him life 
That man 
She loved that man 
For all his life 
But now we meet to bring him flowers 
And only God knows why 
For what's the use in pressing pamls 
When children fade in mother's arms 
It's a cruel world 
We've so much to loose 
And what we have to learn we rarely choose 
So if it's God who took her son 
He cannot be the one living in her mind 
Take care my love, she said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, she said 
You have been loved 
If I was weak, forgive me 
But I was terrified 
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love 
The kind that makes devils cry 
So these days 
My life has changed 
And I'll be fine 
But she just sits and counts the hours 
Searching for her crime 
So what's the use of pressing palms 
If you won't keep such love from harm 
It's a cruel world 
You've so much to prove 
And heaven helps the ones who wait for you 
Well I've no daughters, I've no sons 
Guess I'm the only one 
Living in my life 
Take care my love, he said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, he said 
You have been loved...</field>

My dear, watch me walk away

I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you

I'm a bad boy, I'm a sad boy 
And I'll never give you much 
Hey, everybody's got some moment in their life 
They can't change 
So I do not dare to take you home 
All that I know 
Is that something is so wrong with this heat 
Why do you touch the flame? 
You know you feel the pain, my dear 
You always find it here 
But you say 
I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you

Young Guns, 
Having some fun 
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run. 
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties. 
See me, single and free 
No tears, no fears, what I want to be. 
One, two, take a look at you 
Death by matrimony!

Hey sucker!

A married man? you're out of your head 
Sleepless nights, on an H.P 
bed 
A daddy by the time you're twenty-one 
If your happy with a nappy then you're in for fun. 
But you're here- 
And you're there 
Well there's guys like you just everywhere 
Looking back on the good old days? 
Well this young gun says CAUTION PAYS!

Death by matrimony! 
I remember when he such fun and everthing was fine, 
I remember when we use to have a good time, 
Partners in crime. 
Tell me that's all in the past and I will gladly walk away, 
Tell me that you're happy now, 
Turning my back- 
Nothing to say!

With a gun that he polished for a rainy day 
A smile and a quote from a vigilante movie 
Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away 
He said it made him crazy 
Twenty five years living hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 
Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep 
She needs her mother but her mother is dead 
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget 
Just another hooker 
It happens everyday 
She loved her little baby 
But she couldn't bare to see her living 
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 
I believe in the gods of America 
I believe in the land of the free 
But no one told me 
(No one told me) 
That the gods believe in nothing 
So with empty hands I pray 
And from day to hopeless day 
They still don't see me 
(See me) 
 
Everybody talks about the new generation 
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind 
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation 
Like to help you buddy, but I haven't got the time 
Somebody shouted save me 
And everybody started living hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 
There's a big white lady 
On a big white doorstep 
She asked her daddy and her daddy said 'yes' 
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get 
Has to give a little 
They say it's for the best 
Somebody shouted 
Maybe 
But they kept on living from hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 
So she ran to the arms of America 
And she kissed the powers that be 
And someone told me 
(Someone told me) 
That the gods believe in nothing 
So with empty hands I pray 
And I tell myself 
One day

            <field name="lyrics">There's things that you guess 
And things that you know 
There's boys you can trust 
And girls that you don't 
There's little things you hide 
And little things that you show 
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it 
But you don't and that's just the way it goes 
 
I swear I won't tease you 
Won't tell you no lies 
I don't need no bible 
Just look in my eyes 
I've waited so long baby 
Now that we're friends 
Every man's got his patience 
And here's where mine ends 
 
I want your sex 
I want your love 
I want your sex 
I want your, sex 
 
It's playing on my mind 
It's dancing on my soul 
It's taken so much time 
So why don't you just let me go 
I'd really like to try 
Oh I'd really love to know 
When you tell me you're gonna regret it 
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say no! 
 
I swear I won't tease you 
Won't tell you no lies 
I don't need no bible 
Just look in my eyes 
I've waited so long baby 
Out in the cold 
But I can't take much more girl 
I'm losing control 
 
I want your sex 
I want your love 
I want your sex 
I want your, sex, sex 
 
It's natural 
It's chemical (let's do it) 
It's logical 
Habitual (can we do it?) 
It's sensual 
But most of all 
Sex is something that we should do 
Sex is something for me and you 
 
Sex is natural, sex is good 
Not everybody does it 
But everybody should 
Sex is natural, sex is fun 
Sex is best when it's, one on one 
One on one 
 
I'm not your father 
I'm not your brother 
Talk to your sister 
I am a lover 
 
C-c-c-c-come on 
 
What's your definition of dirty baby 
What do you consider pornography 
Don't you know I love you till it hurts me baby 
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me 
 
What's your definition of dirty baby 
What do you call pornography 
Don't you know I love you till it hurts me baby 
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me 
 
Sex with me 
Sex with me 
Have sex with me 
 
C-c-c-c-come on 
 
Oh so much love 
That you've never seen 
Let's make love 
Put your trust in me 
 
Don't you listen to what they told you 
Because I love you 
Let me hold you 
Oh 
 
I'm not your brother 
I'm not your father 
Oh will you ever change your mind 
I'm a gentle lover with a heart of gold 
But baby you've been so unkind 
 
Come on 
I want your sex 
Come on 
I want your sex 
That's right, all night 
Oh I want your sex 
I want your, sex 
 
Sexy baby's 
Sexy body 
Keeps me guessing 
With a promise 
I know we can come together 
But the question is 
Will we ever ever?

            <field name="lyrics">You are far 
When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death and from my heart 
Strange that you were strong enough 
To even make a start 
But you'll never find 
Peace of mind 
Til you listen to your heart 
 
People 
You can never change the way they feel 
Better let them do just what they will 
For they will 
If you let them 
Steal your heart from you 
People 
Will always make a lover feel a fool 
But you knew I loved you 
We could have shown them all 
We should have seen love through 
 
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes 
Covered me with kisses and lies 
So goodbye 
But please don't take my heart 
 
You are far 
I'm never gonna be your star 
I'll pick up the pieces 
And mend my heart 
Maybe I'll be strong enough 
I don't know where to start 
But I'll never find 
Peace of mind 
While I listen to my heart 
 
People 
You can never change the way they feel 
Better let them do just what they will 
For they will 
If you let them 
Steal your heart 
 
And people 
Will always make a lover feel a fool 
But you knew I loved you 
We could have shown them all 
 
But remember this 
Every other kiss 
That you ever give 
Long as we both live 
When you need the hand of another man 
One you really can surrender with 
I will wait for you 
Like I always do 
There's something there 
That can't compare with any other 
 
You are far 
When I could have been your star 
You listened to people 
Who scared you to death and from my heart 
Strange that I was wrong enough 
To think you'd love me too 
I guess you were kissing a fool 
You must have been kissing a fool</field>

But look at you now 
You're in somebody else's bed 
I loved you once 
So I don't know how 
You're with a man like that 
You'd be better off dead 
He don't care 
He don't treat you right 
It's not fair 
I still want you at night 
Can't you see you made a mistake, girl 
He treats you like dirt and I hate it 
 
Na na na na na na lady look at your hands 
You got two fat children and a drunken man 
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like your life 
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like it 
Ma ma ma ma baby look at your hands 
You should have been my woman when you had the chance 
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like your life 
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like your life now 
 
He hits you once 
He hits you twice 
He don't care about the blood on his hands 
But that's okay 
'Cause it's his wife 
"It's the only thing she understands," he says 
 
Say you're gonna leave him 
Say you're gonna try 
But you're only talking (you're only talking) 
Oh I know you think I'm a young boy 
But I'm good and I think we can make it 
 
Na na na na na na lady look at your hands

Well excuse me baby but it's making me mad 
The only one you want is the only one you'll never have 
It's so sad 
The only one you'll never have 
It's too bad 
Only one you'll never have 
 
Na na na na na na lady look at your hands 
You've got two fat children and a drunken man

Always giving into it 
Do you love your monkey or do you love me? 
 
Why can't you do it? 
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
(Monkey, monkey, monkey, yeah, y-yeah) 
 
Oh, I count to ten 
But I don't know how, and I don't know when to open my eyes 
 
Baby, if you kiss me again 
Like you did just now, like you did just then (then, then, then) 
Just, just, just (do it again) 
 
I've had the rest 
Now it's time I had the best 
So you tell me that you won't do anymore 
 
Well, I'd write your heart a letter 
But I think you know me better 
If I keep on asking baby, maybe I'll get what I'm asking for 
 
Why can't you do it? 
Why can't you set your monkey free? 
Always giving in to it 
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?

Oh, I hate your friends 
But I don't know how and I don't know when to open your eyes 
Yes, your monkey's back again 
Do you want him now like you did back then? (back then, back then) 
(D-do it again) 
 
I tried my best but your head is such a mess 
So I guess that I don't want you anymore 
Well you say you care about me, that you just can't do without me 
But you keep on dancin' baby 'til that monkey has you on the floor 
 
Why can't you do it? 
Why can't you set your monkey free? 
Always giving into it 
Do you love the monkey or do you love me? 
 
Why can't you do it? 
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?

Don't look now, there's a monkey on your back 
Don't look now there's a monkey on you 
Don't look now there's a monkey on your back 
Don't look now there's a monkey on you 
 
So you tell me that you won't do anymore 
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe I'll get what I'm askin' for 
 
Why can't you do it? 
Why can't you set your monkey free? 
Always giving into it 
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

And people on the streets 
I'm looking out for angels 
Just trying to find some peace 
Now I think it's time 
That you let me know 
So if you love me 
Say you love me 
But if you don't just let me go 
 
'Cause teacher 
There are things that I don't want to learn 
And the last one I had 
Made me cry 
So I don't want to learn to 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because it ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
 
When you were just a stranger 
And I was at your feet 
I didn't feel the danger 
Now I feel the heat 
That look in your eyes 
Telling me no 
So you think that you love me 
Know that you need me 
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong 
Just let me go 
 
And teacher 
There are things 
That I don't want to learn 
Oh the last one I had 
Made me cry 
So I don't want to learn to 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because it ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
 
So when you say that you need me 
That you'll never leave me 
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong 
Let me go 
 
And teacher 
There are things 
That I still have to learn 
But the one thing I have is my pride 
Oh so I don't want to learn 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because there ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who just isn't willing to try 
 
I'm so cold 
Inside 
Maybe just one  more try</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Jimmy Got Nothing made himself a name 
With a gun that he polished for a rainy day 
A smile and a quote from a vigilante movie 
Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away 
 
He said it made him crazy 
Twenty-five years living hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 
Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep 
She needs her mother but her mother is dead 
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget 
Just another hooker, it happens everyday 
 
She loved her little baby 
But she couldn't bear to see her living hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 
I believe in the gods of America 
I believe in the land of the free 
But no one told me 
That the gods believe in nothing 
 
So with empty hands I pray 
And from day to hopeless day 
They still don't see me 
 
Everybody talks about the new generation 
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind 
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation 
Like to help you buddy but I haven't got the time 
 
Somebody shouted, "Save me" 
But everybody started living hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 
There's a big white lady on a big white doorstep 
She asked her daddy and her daddy said, "Yes" 
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get 
Has to give a little, they say it's for the best 
 
Somebody shouted, "Maybe" 
But they kept on living from hand to mouth 
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 
So she ran to the arms of America 
And she kissed the powers that be 
And someone told me 
That the Gods believe in nothing 
 
So with empty hands I pray 
And I tell myself one day 
They just might see me 
They just might see me</field>

Something special, something sacred 
In your eyes 
For just one moment 
To be bold and naked 
At your side 
Sometimes I think that you'll never 
Understand me 
Maybe this time is forever 
Say it can be, whoa 
 
That's all you wanted 
Something special, someone sacred 
In your life 
Just for one moment 
To be warm and naked 
At my side 
 
Sometimes I think that you'll never 
Understand me 
But something tells me together 
We'd be happy, oh oh 
 
(Baby) 
I will be your father figure 
(Oh baby) 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
(I'd love to) 
I will be your preacher teacher 
(Be your daddy) 
Anything you have in mind 
(It would make me) 
I will be your father figure 
(Very happy) 
I have had enough of crime 
(Please let me) 
I will be the one who loves you 
'Til the end of time 
 
That's all I wanted 
But sometimes love can be mistaken 
For a crime 
That's all I wanted 
Just to see my baby's 
Blue eyes shine 
This time I think that my lover 
Understands me 
If we have faith in each other 
Then we can be 
Strong, baby 
 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
I will be the one who loves you 
'Til the end of time 
 
If you are the desert 
I'll be the sea 
If you ever hunger 
Hunger for me 
Whatever you ask for 
That's what I'll be 
 
So when you remember the ones who have lied 
Who said that they cared 
But then laughed as you cried 
Beautiful darling 
Don't think of me 
 
Because all I ever wanted 
It's in your eyes, baby 
And love can't lie, no 
(Greet me with the eyes of a child) 
My love is always tellin' me so 
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile) 
Just hold on, hold on 
I won't let you go, my baby 
 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind, baby 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
(So I am gonna love you) 
'Til the end of time 
I will be your father 
I will be your preacher 
I will be your daddy, whoa 
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time</field>

Harsh words can get you into hot water

Trust me, I want you to trust me, trust me, tru-tru-tru-tru

Do you trust me (yeah)

You had a hard day, such a hard day

            <field name="lyrics">That's all I wanted 
Something special, something sacred 
In your eyes 
For just one moment 
To be bold and naked 
At your side 
Sometimes I think that you'll never 
Understand me 
Maybe this time is forever 
Say it can be, whoh 
 
That's all you wanted 
Something special, someone sacred 
In your life 
Just for one moment 
To be warm and naked 
At my side 
 
Sometimes I think that you'll never 
Understand me 
But something tells me together 
We'd be happy, oh oh 
 
(Baby) 
I will be your father figure 
(Oh baby) 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
(I'd love to) 
I will be your preacher teacher 
(Be your daddy) 
Anything you have in mind 
(It would make me) 
I will be your father figure 
(Very happy) 
I have had enough of crime 
(Please let me) 
I will be the one who loves you 
'Til the end of time 
 
That's all I wanted 
But sometimes love can be mistaken 
For a crime 
That's all I wanted 
Just to see my baby's 
Blue eyes shine 
This time I think that my lover 
Understands me 
If we have faith in each other 
Then we can be 
Strong, baby 
 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
I will be the one who loves you 
'Til the end of time 
 
If you are the desert 
I'll be the sea 
If you ever hunger 
Hunger for me 
Whatever you ask for 
That's what I'll be 
 
So when you remember the ones who have lied 
Who said that they cared 
But then laughed as you cried 
Beautiful darling 
Don't think of me 
 
Because all I ever wanted 
It's in your eyes, baby, 
And love can't lie, no 
(Greet me with the eyes of a child) 
My love is always tellin' me so 
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile) 
Just hold on, hold on 
I won't let you go, my baby 
 
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind, baby 
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
(So I am gonna love you) 
'Til the end of time 
I will be your father 
I will be your preacher 
I will be your daddy, whoa 
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time</field>

Something that I want you to know

Listen to my simple story 
And maybe we'll have something to show 
 
You tell me you're cold on the inside 
How can the outside world 
Be a place that your heart can embrace 
Be good to yourself 
'Cause nobody else 
Has the power to make you happy 
 
How can I help you? 
Please let me try to 
I can heal the pain

You know that I will be 
Waiting for the day 
That you say you'll be mine 
 
He must have really hurt you 
To make you say the things that you do 
He must have really hurt you 
To make those pretty eyes look so blue 
 
He must have known 
That he could 
That you'd never leave him 
Now you can't see my love is good 
And that I'm not him 
 
How can I help you? 
Please let me try to

Won't you show me your heart now 
I'll be good to you 
I can make this thing true 
Show me that heart right now 
 
Who needs a lover 
That can't be a friend  
Something tells me I'm the one you've been looking for 
Oh, if you ever should see him again 
Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more 
Someone who will protect you 
Love and respect you 
All those things 
That he never could bring to you 
Like I do  
Or rather I would 
Won't you show me your heart 
Like you should

You can't make your heart feel something it won't

But you won't, no you won't 
And I can't make you love me 
If you don't 
 
I'll close my eyes and then I won't see 
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me 
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right 
Just give me till then, to give up this fight 
And I will give up this fight

Time has been twisting the knife 
I don't recognize 
People I care for 
 
Take my dreams 
Childish and weak at the seams 
Please don't analyze 
Please just be there for me 
 
The things that I know 
Nobody told me 
The seeds that are sown 
They still control me 
 
There's a liar in my head 
There's a thief upon my bed 
And the strangest thing 
Is I cannot get my eyes open 
 
Take my hand 
Lead me to some peaceful land 
That I cannot find 
Inside my head 
 
Wake me, with love 
It's all I need 
But in all this time 
Still no one said 
 
If I had not asked 
Would you have told me 
If you call this love 
Why don't you hold me? 
 
There's a liar in my head 
There's a thief upon my bed 
And the strangest thing 
Is I cannot get my eyes open 
 
Give me something I can hold 
Give me something to believe in 
I am frightened for my soul, please, please 
Make love to me, send love through me 
 
Heal me with your crime 
The only one who ever knew me 
We've wasted so much time

            <field name="lyrics">She takes the back road and the lane 
Past the school that has not changed 
In all this time  
She thinks of when the boy was young 
All the battles she had won 
Just to give him life 
 
That man 
She loved that man 
For all his life 
But now we meet to take him flowers 
And only god knows why 
 
For what's the use in pressing palms  
When children fade in mother's arms 
It's a cruel world, we've so much to lose 
And what we have to learn, we rarely choose 
 
So if it's god who took her son 
He cannot be the one living in her mind 
 
Take care my love, she said 
Don't think that god is dead 
Take care my love, she said 
 
You have been loved 
 
If I was weak, forgive me 
But I was terrified 
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love 
The kind that makes devils cry 
 
So these days 
My life has changed 
And I'll be fine (and I'll be fine) 
But she just sits and counts the hours 
Searching for her crime 
 
So what's the use in pressing palms  
If you won't keep such love from harm 
It's a cruel world, you've so much to prove 
And heaven help the ones who wait for you 
 
No, I've no daughters, I've no sons 
Guess I'm the only one 
Living in my life 
 
Take care my love, he said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, he said 
 
You have been loved</field>

Gotta have some faith in the sound 
It's the one good thing that I've got 
I won't let you down 
So please don't give me up 
Because I would really, really love to stick around, oh yeah 
 
Heaven knows I was just a young boy 
Didn't know what I wanted to be 
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy 
And I guess it was enough for me 
To win the race? A prettier face! 
Brand new clothes and a big fat place 
On your rock and roll TV 
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way 
Think I'm gonna get me some happy 
 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I told you so 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone else I've got to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Take back your singing in the rain 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah 
 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
 
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy 
What a kick just a buddy and me 
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy 
We were living in a fantasy 
We won the race 
Got out of the place 
I went back home got a brand new face 
For the boys at MTV 
But today the way I play the game has got to change 
Oh yeah 
Now I'm gonna get myself happy 
 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I stopped the show 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone I forgot to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Don't think that I'll be back again 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah 
 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
 
Well it looks like the road to heaven 
But it feels like the road to hell 
When I knew which side my bread was buttered 
I took the knife as well 
Posing for another picture 
Everybody's got to sell 
But when you shake your ass 
They notice fast 
And some mistakes were built to last 
 
That's what you get 
I say that's what you get 
That's what you get for changing your mind 
And after all this time 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes 
Do not make the man 
 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah 
 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom, freedom, freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
 
Yeah you've gotta do what you do, what you do 
May not be what you want from me 
Just the way it's got to be 
Lose the face now 
I've got to live, got to live, got to live</field>

Baby boy 
His fathers eyes 
He's a soldier waiting for war 
Time will come 
He'll hold a gun 
His father's son 
 
And as he grows 
He hears the band 
Takes the step from boy to man 
And at the shore she waves her son goodbye 
Like the man she did before 
 
Mother's pride 
Just a boy 
His country's eyes 
He's a soldier waving at the shore 
And in her heart the time has come 
To lose a son 
 
And all the husbands, all the sons, all the lovers gone 
They make no difference  
No difference in the end 
Still hear the woman say your father died a hero 
In the name of God and man 
 
Mother's pride 
Crazy boy 
His lifeless eyes 
He's a soldier now forevermore 
He'll hold a gun 'till kingdom come</field>

They will not be the last 
Look around now 
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers 
 
This is the year of the hungry man 
Whose place is in the past 
Hand in hand with ignorance 
And legitimate excuses 
 
The rich declare themselves poor 
And most of us are not sure 
If we have too much 
But we'll take our chances 
'Cause God's stopped keeping score 
 
I guess somewhere along the way 
He must have let us all out to play 
Turned his back and all God's children 
Crept out the back door 
 
And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate 
Hanging on to hope 
When there is no hope to speak of 
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late 
Well, maybe we should all be praying for time 
 
These are the days of the empty hand 
Oh, you hold on to what you can 
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year 
 
This is the year of the guilty man 
Your television takes a stand 
And you find that what was over there is over here 
 
So you scream from behind your door 
Say, "What's mine is mine and not yours" 
I may have too much but I'll take my chances 
'Cause God's stopped keeping score 
 
And you cling to the things they sold you 
Did you cover your eyes when they told you 
That he can't come back 
'Cause he has no children to come back for 
 
It's hard to love, there's so much to hate 
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of 
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late 
So maybe we should all be praying for time</field>

you'd have no other woman, you'd be weak as a lamb. 
If you had the strength to walk out that door, 
My love would over rule my sense, and I'd call you back for more, 
If I were your woman. 
If I were your woman, and you were my man. Um baby. 
  
She tears you down darlin', says you're nothing at all. 
But, I'll pick you up darling, when she lets you fall. 
You're like a diamond but she treats you like glass. 
Yet you beg her to love you, but, me you don't ask. 
If I were your woman, If I were your woman. 
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do, 
I'd never, no, no, stop loving you. 
Yeah, yeah, um 
  
Life is so crazy, a love is unkind. 
Because she came first, darling, will she hang on your mind? 
You're a part of me, and you don't even know it. 
I'm what you need, but I'm too afraid to show it. 
If I were your woman, If I were your woman,  
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do. 
Never, no, no, no, stop loving you, ah, yeah. 
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do. 
Never, never stop loving you if

I won't go through it again 
Yes, those clouds are closing in 
 
And I will not accept this as a part of my life 
I will not live in fear 
Of what may be 
And the lessons I have learned 
I would rather be alone than watch you 
Spinning that wheel for me 
 
You've got a thing about danger 
Ain't you getting what you want from me 
You've got a thing about strangers 
Baby that's what we used to be 
You've got a thing about danger baby 
I guess the hungry just can't see 
One of these days 
You're gonna bring some home to me 
 
Six o'clock in the morning 
You ain't home 
I can't help thinking that's strange 
It seems that everybody takes their chances 
These days 
Oh yeah we're standing in the rain 
 
And I will not accept this as part of my life 
 
How can you love me 
When you are playing with my life 
You say give me time and I'll do better I swear 
Give me time and I'll lead you back to despair

It takes all that I have just to cry for help 
Then that voice in my head tells me no 
 
I'm going down  
Won't you help me 
Save me from myself 
I hear the sound of the memory 
Maybe, who can tell ? 
 
Let me live my life beside the river 
Take me to places where a child can grow 
And then maybe the boy inside will forsake me 
Maybe the child in me will just let me go 
 
I'm going down  
The cold, cold water is rushing in 
I'm going down 
And I would beg to be forgiven

George Michael 
  
I won't let you down 
I will not give you up 
Gotta have some faith in the sound 
It's the one good thing that I've got 
I won't let you down 
So please don't give me up 
Because I would really, really love to stick around 
 
Heaven knows I was just a young boy 
Didn't know what I wanted to be 
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy 
And I guess it was enough for me 
To win the race? A prettier face! 
Brand new clothes and a big fat place 
On your rock and roll TV 
But today the way I play the game is not the same  
No way 
Think I'm gonna get me some happy 
 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I told you so 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone else I've got to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Take back your singing in the rain 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
 
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy 
What a kick just a buddy and me 
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy 
We were living in a fantasy 
We won the race 
Got out of the place 
I went back home got a brand new face 
For the boys on MTV 
But today the way I play the game has got to change 
Oh yeah 
Now I'm gonna get myself happy 
 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I stopped the show 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone I forgot to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Don't think that I'll be back again 
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me 
Freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom 
You've gotta give for what you take 
 
Well it looks like the road to heaven 
But it feels like the road to hell 
When I knew which side my bread was buttered 
I took the knife as well 
Posing for another picture 
Everybody's got to sell 
But when you shake your ass 
They notice fast 
And some mistakes were built to last 
 
That's what you get 
 
I say that's what you get 
 
That's what you get for changing your mind 
 
And after all this time 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes 
Do not make the man 
 
I'll hold on to my freedom 
May not be what you want from me 
Just the way it's got to be 
Lose the face now  
I've got to live</field>

Why tell me you don't understand when you do 
I thought I had something to say 
 
But it doesn't really matter at all... 
I changed my name to be rid of the things that I want from you 
It's strange but the name is a name and the truth is a truth 
 
Oh, there is always, always someone there to remind me 
So I learn to live with shame 
I tell myself I feel no pain 
But I do and if I have to tell you 
 
Then it doesn't really matter at all... 
And it's no good looking back 
Because time is a thief and I believe that I'm too old for that 
We're just saying the things that we have said forever

How many reasons fall 
It's too bad

I'm blessed

Heaven sent  
And Heaven stole  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
 
And what have I learned  
From all this pain  
I thought I'd never feel the same  
About anyone  
Or anything again  
 
But now I know  
When you find your love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
 
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
 
Sadness  
In my eyes  
No one guessed  
Or no one tried  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
 
Loveless and cold  
With your last breath  
You saved my soul  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
 
And what have I learned  
From all these tears  
I've waited for you all those years  
And just when it began  
He took you away  
 
But I still say  
When you find love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
 
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
 
So the words you could not say  
I'll sing them for you  
And the love we would have made  
I'll make it for two  
 
For every single memory  
Has become a part of me  
You will always be  
My love  
 
Well, I've been loved  
So I know just what love is  
And the lover that I kissed  
Is always by my side  
 
Oh, the lover I still miss  
Was Jesus to a child</field>

And I move on

Said "don't waste time 'cause even angels say goodbye"

Counting the cost of your desire to be seen 
 
I do not count myself among you 
I may be living in a dream 
It's just seem to many of you 
Can't help but hope 
There's a difference between, you and me 
 
You're a star

You're a star 
 
Maybe your mama gave you up boy 
(It's the same old same old) 
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough girl 
 
Star people 
Never forget your secret safe with me 
Just look at all wonderful people 
Trying to forget they had to pay for what you see 
 
It's a dream 
With a nightmare stuck in the middle 
But where would you be 
Without all of that attention 
You'd die 
I'd die 
We'd die wouldn't we 
(Well wouldn't we) 
 
Big, big star 
Should go far 
 
Talk about your mother 
Talk about your father 
Talk about the people 
Who have made you what you are 
Talk about your teacher 
The bully boy who beat you 
Talk about the people who have paid 
For that new sports car 
 
Did you get off on a bad foot, baby 
Do you have a little tale to tell 
Is that why you're a star? 
Is that what makes a star? 
Nothing comes for nothing, baby 
That fame and fortune's heaven sent 
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling 
When you can pay the rent 
 
How much is enough?</field>

Inside my head 
 
Wake me with love 
It's all I need 
But in all this time 
Still no one said 
 
If I had not asked 
Would you have told me 
If you call this love 
Why don't you hold me

            <field name="lyrics">Sweet thing 
I know how strong I can appear 
But your don't know the days 
Since somebody loved me 
You came 
And led me through that door again 
You say you want to stay 
But you don't know me (no you don't) 
 
You make me feel safe 
 
Someday 
My darkest fears will find their way 
After all 
Somebody loves me 
All day 
My heart tells strangers how I feel 
And it's hard not to feel this way 
When you thought your future was on prescription 
 
You make me feel safe</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Lover don't love too much 
It's a bad thing, a sad thing 
It is heaven to the touch 
Hey everybody's got a moment in their lives 
They can't change 
(don't they baby) 
 
I know you don't care 
What's right or wrong 
All that I know 
Is that love don't belong heer 
So it's better to turn the page 
Watch me walk away my dear 
Watch me walk away 
You say 
 
[Chorus] 
I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you 
I want you baby 
More than ever 
I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you 
 
But it's never gonna be that easy 
I don't want to waste your time 
 
Lover don't love too much 
I'm a bad boy, a sad boy 
And I'll never give you much 
Hey everybody's got some moment in their lives 
They can't change 
Yeah 
 
So I do not dare 
Take you home 
All that I know 
Is that something's so wrong with this heat 
Why do you touch the flame 
You know you feal the pain my dear 
You always find it here 
You say 
 
[Chorus] 
 
But it's never gonna 
So what happens everytime 
It's so easy to forget myself where 
A little while you want a boy 
In a place you will be all mine 
Can't you see 
 
Oh, I'm losing you baby 
Chorus 
But it's never gonna be that easy 
You want a lover, I am just a friend</field>

I will not give you up 
Gotta have some faith in the sound 
It's the one good thing that I've got 
I won't let you down 
So please don't give me up 
'Cause I would really, really love to stick around, oh yeah 
 
Heaven knows I was just a young boy 
Didn't know what I wanted to be (Didn't know what I wanted to be) 
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy 
And I guess it was enough for me (said I guess it was enough for me) 
To win the race? A prettier face! 
Brand new clothes and a big fat place 
On your rock and roll T.V. 
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way 
Think I'm gonna get myself happy 
 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I told you so 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone else I've got to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Take back your singing in the rain 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah 
 
Freedom! (I won't let you down) 
Freedom! (I will not give you up) 
Freedom! (Have some faith in the sound) 
You've gotta give for what you take (It's the one good thing that I've got) 
Freedom! (I won't let you down) 
Freedom! (So please don't give me up) 
Freedom! ('Cause I would really, really love to stick around) 
You've gotta give for what you take 
 
Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy 
What a kick just a buddy and me (what a kick just a buddy and me) 
We had every big-shot good time band on the run, boy 
We were living in a fantasy (we were living in a fantasy) 
We won the race, got out of the place 
I went back home, got a brand new face 
For the boys on MTV 
But today the way I play the game has got to change, oh yeah 
Now I'm gonna get myself happy 
 
I think there's something you should know 
I think it's time I stopped the show 
There's something deep inside of me 
There's someone I forgot to be 
Take back your picture in a frame 
Don't think that I'll be back again 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah 
 
Freedom! (I won't let you down) 
Freedom! (I will not give you up) 
Freedom! (Have some faith in the sound) 
You've gotta give for what you take (It's the one good thing that I've got) 
Freedom! (I won't let you down) 
Freedom! (So please don't give me up) 
Freedom! ('Cause I would really, really love to stick around) 
You've gotta give for what you take 
 
Well it looks like the road to heaven 
But it feels like the road to hell 
When I knew which side my bread was buttered 
I took the knife as well 
Posing for another picture 
Everybody's got to sell 
But when you shake your ass 
They notice fast 
And some mistakes were build to last 
 
That's what you get (That's what you get) 
That's what you get (I say that's what you get) 
That's what you get (for changing your mind) 
That's what you get for changing your mind 
 
That's what you get 
That's what you get (And after all this time) 
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make me, oh yeah 
 
All we have to do now 
Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
All we have to see 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah 
 
Freedom!  
Freedom! (oh freedom) 
Freedom! (my freedom) 
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom! (hold on to my freedom) 
Freedom!  
Freedom! (my freedom) 
You've gotta give for what you take 
Give for what you, give for what you take yeah 
Yeah, you've got to give for what you, give for what you, give 
 
May not be what you want from me 
Just the way it's got to be 
Lose the face now

I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
All I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 
 
It's so unreal 
Didn't look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know 
I wasted it all just to watch you go 
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me 
Will eventually be a memory of a time when 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try, 
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme, 
To remind myself of a time when 
I tried so hard 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I'm surprised it got so 
Things aren't the way they were before 
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then 
But it all comes back to me in the end 
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
For all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
For all this 
There's only one thing you should know 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter</field>

Counting your money until your soul turns green 
Star people 
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen 
 
I do not count myself among you 
I may have been living in a dream 
It's just there seem so many of you 
Can't help but hope there's a difference between 
 
And if I live to be a hundred and one 
I will never understand what you are, honey? 
 
I'm looking for sympathy 
Just get me on NBC 
And where's the hell's my dumb ass PR? 
 
I said maybe your mama gave you up boy 
(It's the same old same old) 
I said maybe your daddy didn't love you enough girl 
(How much is enough) 
 
Star people 
Never forget your secrets safe with me 
Just look at all the wonderful people 
Trying to forget just who and what they have been 
 
Oh, it's a dream 
With a nightmare stuck in the middle 
Are you serious? I'm just curious 
Without all this attention 
You'd die 
I'd die 
We'd die (Wouldn't we baby) 
 
And if I live to be a hundred and one 
I will never understand what you are  
(I'm talking to you) 
You're looking for sympathy from people who work to eat 
And they don't really seem to mind 
 
I said maybe your mama gave you up boy 
(It's the same old same old) 
I said maybe baby your daddy didn't love you enough girl 
 
How much is enough? 
How much is enough? 
How much is enough? 
Are you serious? I'm just curious 
Are you serious? I'm just curious 
 
Yeah more glycerin 
Let's go back to the day 
DJ (Why do you wanna tell me that?) 
DJ (Get yourself some Oprah cash) 
Is that what makes a star? 
 
Did you get off on a bad foot, baby 
Do you have a little tale to tell 
Did you get off on a bad foot, bad, bad foot? 
Is that why you're a star? 
 
Do you really think you've got it so hard? 
Do you think it might do you some good to look around you 
And decide how you might feel 
If the pain you felt was real 
Tell me 
 
Now nothing comes for nothing, baby 
That fame and fortune's heaven sent 
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling 
'Cause you can pay the rent 
You can pay</field>

They crack a smile, talk a while 
Try to take your place 
My memory serves me far too well 
 
I just sit here on this mountain thinking to myself 
You're a fool boy 
Why don't you go down 
Find somebody 
Find somebody else 
My memory serves me far too well 
 
It's not as though we just broke up 
It's not as though it was yesterday, yeah 
But something I just can't explain 
Something in me needs this pain 
I know I'll never see your face again 
 
C'mon now 
I've got to be strong now 
 
Now everybody's talking about this new decade 
Like you say the magic numbers 
Then just say goodbye to the stupid mistakes you made 
Oh my memory serves me far too well 
 
Don't you know that 
The years will come and go 
Some of us will change our lives 
Some of us still have nothing to show 
Nothing, baby (nothing, baby) 
But memories (but memories) 
 
And if these wounds 
They are self-inflicted 
I don't really know 
How my poor heart could have protected me 
But if I have to carry this pain 
If you will not share the blame 
I deserve to see your face again 
 
C'mon now 
You don't have to be so strong now 
Come back, come back, come back, come back 
Come back, come back, come back, come back 
 
Oh, come back to me darling 
I will make it worth your while 
Come back to your baby 
I miss your kiss 
I miss your smile 
Seems to me the peace I search to find 
Ain't going to be mine until you say you will 
Don't you keep me waiting for that day 
I know, I know, I know you hear these words that I say 
 
I know, I know, I know  
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want, oh</field>

            <field name="lyrics">As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving 
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may 
Just as hate knows love's the cure 
You can rest your mind assure 
That I'll be loving you always 
 
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow 
But in passing will grow older every day 
Just as all that's born is new 
You know what I say is true 
That I'll be loving you always 
 
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky) 
Always 
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high) 
Always 
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea) 
Always 
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream) 
 
Did you know that true love asks for nothing 
No no her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee 
To last through forever and another day 
 
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning 
And the seasons know exactly when to change 
Just as kindness knows no shame 
Know through all your joy and pain 
That I'll be loving you always 
 
As today I know I'm living 
But tomorrow could make me the past 
But that I mustn't fear 
For I'll know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've left behind 
'Cause I'll be loving you always 
 
(Until the day is night and night becomes the day) 
Always 
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away) 
Always 
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four) 
Always 
(Until the day that is the day that are no more) 
Did you know you're loved by somebody 
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left) 
Always 
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself) 
I'll be lovin' you forever 
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through) 
Always 
(Until the day that you are me and I am you) 
Always 
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean severs every mountain high) 
Always mm mm 
 
We all know sometimes life hates and troubles 
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space 
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double 
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed 
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it 
You're not helpin' to make this earth 
A place sometimes called hell 
Change your words into truths 
And then change that truth into love 
And maybe our children's grandchildren 
And their great grandchildren will tell 
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky</field>

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor 
As the music dies, something in your eyes 
Calls to mind the silver screen 
And all its sad good-byes 
 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you're not a fool 
 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
 
Time can never mend 
The careless whispers of a good friend 
To the heart and mind 
Ignorance is kind 
There's no comfort in the truth 
Pain is all you'll find 
 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you're not a fool 
 
I should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 
 
Never without your love 
 
Tonight the music seems so loud 
I wish that we could lose this crowd 
Maybe it's better this way 
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say 
 
We could have been so good together 
We could have lived this dance forever 
But no one's gonna dance with me 
Please stay 
 
And I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you're not a fool 
 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again

It is kind of funny that you think that 
I am the boy to make you cry 
I can make you happy 
If only for a while 
Little baby I can give you all the loving that your heart desires 
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy 
 
It could be the price of love 
Could the price of hate 
What am I guilty of 
Why do you make me wait 
So long I don't know your intentions 
Look to the sky's above 
I am in the hands of fate 
Push till it gets to shove 
I have got to know for heavens sake 
Is this love or invention 
Baby can't you see I'll find another fantasy 
 
You hang around with people who are sure to make you cry 
I can make you happy if only for a while 
Little baby oh, oh little baby 
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires 
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy 
 
You take someone's heart 
And you kick it around 
Keep on picking it up 
So you can watch it come down 
I don't know what I am suppose to do 
Why I wait for you to make up your mind 
Would you please be so kind 
When you know what to do I'll be in the next room 
But if you make it to late I may be in the next day

Be good to yourself 
'Cause nobody else

Someone who will protect you 
Love and respect you 
All those things

Or rather I would 
Won't you show me your heart 
Like you should 
 
How can I help you? 
Please let me try to 
I can heal the pain 
That you're feeling inside? 
Whenever you want me 
You know that I will be 
Waiting for the day 
That you say you'll be mine 
 
Won't you let me in 
Let this love begin 
Won't you show me your heart now 
I'll be good to you 
I can make this thing true 
And get to your heart somehow</field>

Turn down these voices inside my head 
Lay down with me, tell me no lies 
Just hold me close, don't patronize 
Don't patronize me 
 
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel something it won't 
Here in the dark, in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power 
But you won't, no you won't 
And I can't make you love me 
If you don't 
 
I'll close my eyes and then I won't see 
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me 
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right 
Just give me till then, to give up this fight 
And I will give up this fight 
 
And I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel something it won't 
And here in the dark, in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart, I'll feel the power 
But you won't, no, you won't 
And I can't make you love me 
If you don't 
 
Ain't no use in you trying 
It's no good for me baby without love

The next you're changing your plans 
 
Hey little baby 
Ain't much point in hanging around  
Cause' if you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy. 
 
It is kind of funny that you think that 
I am the boy to make you cry 
I can make you happy 
If only for a while 
Little baby I can give you all the loving that your heart desires 
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy. 
 
It could be the price of love 
Could the price of hate 
What am I guilty of? 
Why do you make me wait 
So long I don't know your intentions 
 
Look to the sky's above 
I am in the hands of fate 
Push till it gets to shove 
I have got to know for heavens sake 
Is this love or invention 
Baby can't you see I'll find another fantasy 
 
You hang around with people who are sure to make you cry 
I can make you happy if only for a while 
Little baby oh, oh little baby 
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires 
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy. 
 
You take someone's heart 
And you kick it around 
Keep on picking it up 
So you can watch it come down 
 
I don't know what I am suppose to do 
Why I wait for you to make up your mind 
Would you please be so kind 
When you know what to do I'll be in the next room 
But if you make it to late I may be in the next day</field>

And why I'm so in love with you 
 
Now I shout it from the highest hill 
I even told you the golden dafodill 
At least my heart's an open door 
And my secret love's no secret anymore

He takes off her dress now

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea

I think it's amazing 
I think it's amazing 
 
I think you're amazing 
 
You tried to save me from myself 
Said 'darling, kiss as many as you want! 
My love's still available 
And I now you're insatiable' 
 
We're like victims of the same disease 
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom 
And your mom, was always acting crazy 
 
I was going down for the third time

Then I say my reflection 
Saying please don't let this go

Don't put your love in chains baby 
No no, walk in the midday sun 
I thought I was dreaming 
I think it's amazing

Horny cowboy with your stars and stripes 
Bringing the light into my day 
With that Texan smile 
 
Too afraid to love, to hope that you would stay 
So broken that I never saw you chase the past away 
 
My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight) 
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night 
Takes away that fear that I carried forever 
You stopped to wipe away my tears 
And you stayed forever and more 
 
(I don't think that I) 
 
Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December 
All alone I watched the eagles fly 
Even the light seemed to have changed 
In the Californian sky 
 
Through all of those battles then you came 
Stepped out of the fading light 
Said, "Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again, 
Because I'm here to save your life" 
 
My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight) 
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night 
Takes away that fear that I carried forever 
You stopped to wipe away my tears 
But you stayed forever amore 
 
And more, didn't you baby 
 
Because I don't think that I could love and lose again 
I don't think I have the strength 
I don't think I have the strength

This time, you won't end in tears 
I find myself, with a new daddy 
My mama needs love you see 
Guess she don't wanna be lonely 
 
And nobody's keeping score 
I don't say hi to those guys no more 
Said mama can't you feel me 
Holding my breath as they knock, knock, knock on our door 
 
You're just taking your ass to the top of that building 
Throwing yourself under cars and trains 
Taking the pill that you know will kill you 
Under the wheels, 
The same, the same 
 
Johnny's gone and got himself a new man 
He gets laid, every day 
Johnny please please, stop pretending 
This time, may just end in tears 
Take care of yourself 
Because you won't find 'daddy' 
When you're popping those pills 
Oh Johnny, is the danger just part of the thrill? 
 
And nobody's keeping score 
Johnny those guys that you shake it for 
I said "Johnny can't you hear them 
Saying mama knows best as they knock, knock, 
Knock on your door" 
 
You're just taking your ass to the top of that building 
Throwing yourself under cars and trains 
Taking the pill that you know will kill you 
Under the wheels, the same, the same 
 
Taking your ass to the top of that building 
Throwing yourself under cars and trains 
Taking the pill that you know will kill you 
Under the wheels, wheels, wheels 
 
Taking your ass to the top of that building 
Under cars and trains 
Taking the pill that you know will kill you 
The same, the same, the same 
 
Pretty girl, little girl, what were you thinking 
Just 18 at the time 
You were a mother and child, at the same time 
You were a mother and child 
So young and fucked up baby 
Always higher than a child should see 
Forgive me 
 
To the top of that building 
Under cars and trains 
Taking the pill that you know will kill you 
Under the wheels, wheels, wheels 
 
Mama don't you let him stay 
 
From bastard to loser, hurt you, used you in every way, 
Mama, don't let him stay, please 
Don't let him stay 
 
I said Jesus, Mary, and the Saints above, 
Won't you show him love?

            <field name="lyrics">My mother had a brother 
They say that I was born on the day that he died 
Someone to cling to, she said 
When all the noises and the shame came calling 
 
My mother had a brother 
I thought I knew them all, I thought I knew 
But she lied 
I said, "Show me his face again, tell me again why he died" 
 
She said he couldn't wait for the things that I've seen 
She said he wasn't strong enough, he never dared to dream a life like mine 
 
My mother had a brother 
Over-sensitive and kind 
Seems it all became too much for him. 
It seems he took his own life 
Mum, I can't imagine the joy and pain in equal measure 
Tears in the dirt, and all over your newborn treasure 
 
I guess he had to wait until my momma had me 
I guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free 
In endless sky 
 
But mama will you tell him from your boy 
The times they changed 
I guess the world was getting warmer 
And we got stronger 
Mother will you tell him about my joy 
I live each day for him 
The sun came out, yeah, and I'm just breathing it in 
 
My mother had a brother 
Same desire, different time 
Seems the empty spaces tortured him 
Until he took his own life 
 
I don't know why I waited so long for love 
I just don't know what I was thinking of 
All that wasted time 
 
But mama will you tell him from your boy 
The times they changed 
I guess the world was getting warmer 
While we got stronger 
Mother will you tell him about my joy 
I live each day with him 
Your son came out, yeah, 
And I'm still breathing it in 
 
And I swear now that freedom is here 
I'm gonna taste it all for you boy 
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn 
I'm making so much love 
 
So those of us who have nothing to fear 
We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it 
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned 
I'm making so much love 
 
I was a prisoner, but he saved me 
Broke into my dreams and said, "Who cares?" 
I was a prisoner, so disgrace me 
I'm glad to be home 
And I don't believe they care.</field>

It's like a conversation, where no-one stops to breathe 
Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table? 
Such destruction, and pure white castles in the sand 
No time for introduction 
With all that money changing hands 
 
And the satellite says, "Take a look at all we have" 
But the old man says, 
"You want my family, for your liberty, I can't do that." 
 
Look into the eyes of any patient man 
Whether they be amber, green or blue, 
There's a piece of God staring back at you 
But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves 
They see our broken women 
On imaginary shelves 
 
But the satellite says, "Won't you people look at all we have? 
Don't you want it? 
 
Can't you see the things that you lack?" 
 
Children in his arms, he turns his back.</field>

A space that you left in my heart 
Just give me something that will pull me back from the blue

            <field name="lyrics">In my house there's a circle, where the life comes in 
From the stars to my home, down through the stone, 
I could have been so alone, 
Without my precious box 
Have I a family? I guess not 
I've never seen a lot of beauty 
In my life. 
 
Well in your house there are servants, and the lights all dim 
Such a beautiful home, your agent's on the phone, they never 
Leave you alone 
The party never stops! 
You say that's fantasy, I say "So what, I need a little 
Beauty" 
 
So let me in, 
You know you've kind of got under my skin 
You know we never see a lot of the action round here 
My dear 
You may want to strip again 
 
And you look so fine in your Gucci suit 
And you're making more money than your daddy 
Could have imagined 
But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time 
 
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb 
Don't you know that the moment will come 
I will find someone like you 
But with something extra, I'm sorry baby 
I don't know why 
I don't know why that is 
 
The systematic breakdown of my community 
You know I hate my job, I try to save but God 
There's just never enough 
Switch on, the pressure, stops 
You know the one for me, she's on Fox 
And she's a little beauty 
 
Give me your life, give me your life, I want it 
Because lately, it's so freezing out here 
(This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass) 
In so many ways, but you make it good 
Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could 
(This side of the glass) 
 
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb 
Don't you know that the moment will come 
I will find someone like you 
But with something extra, I'm so sorry baby 
I don't know why 
I don't know why that is 
 
Precious keeps me company 
Keeps me from being alone 
 
Because no-one comes in the morning 
No-one comes in the evening time 
I'd sit and wait for the phone to ring 
I could be waiting my whole damn life 
 
So sick of the same old faces 
In this street, where nobody talks to me 
And the funny side of the situation is 
I don't care, I'll always be there 
 
When you come down from the sky 
And make yourself at home 
In my house 
 
Because these days it's the money the money 
The money, honey, or your life 
I said don't you know you can't have both 
 
Stop acting so dumb 
The moment will come 
I will find someone like you 
Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby 
I don't know why (something) 
Said I don't know why that is 
 
You may want to strip again 
You may want to let me in 
You may want to sacrifice 
More than you think is fair or right 
 
You may want to think again 
You may want to watch your friends 
You may want to change your mind 
You may wish you could turn back time.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">My daddy got here on the gravy train 
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game 
They went walking and she took his name 
Round here 
 
There was dancing in the afternoons those days 
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made 
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same 
 
Frightened little girl, she makes a break 
Into the arms of, something better 
Round here 
 
I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park 
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark 
Waiting patiently to make my mark 
Round here 
 
And I remember my first day at school 
And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool 
I remember it all, like yesterday 
 
Don't you 
 
Every time I try to leave this place 
Something inside says, "You can do better" 
Round here 
 
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived 
I want to put my hands in this earth again 
Music fell like rain to the streets 
The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat 
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world 
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space 
Is the place of my birth 
 
When all that I wanted, was to be someone. 
 
Two little Hitlers in an old church hall 
Some cheesy covers and those neighbors that banged on the walls 
Andy says it's time to show them all 
Round here 
 
Please sir, we two have other plans 
Please sir you would not understand, 
What's going on 
Is magical, can't you see 
That some of us do more than dream 
 
Every time I try to leave this place 
Something inside says, "Keep on keeping, on and on...." 
Around here 
 
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived 
I want to put my hands in this earth again 
Music fell like rain to the streets 
The Specials and The Jam, ABC 
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world 
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space 
Is the place of my birth 
 
My birth, 
In this town, 
Yes I guess I got to be someone 
 
To be somebody 
In the Beautiful city 
 
This place I call home 
These streets of London 
It's everything I know (everything and everybody) 
On the streets of London 
I want to thank you 
 
My daddy got here on the gravy train.</field>

I want you to hear the things I say 
I loved you in my way 
But you know I'm gonna leave you 
 
The clock was always ticking 
And your heart, 
Yes I know your heart is always on the run 
 
I hate what I've become 
But I'm still gonna leave you 
And I don't think you should stay for the night 
 
Baby you know that my flesh is weak 
You know I simply 
 
I cannot sleep without you 
My heart has simply nowhere to go 
 
Nothing to hold 
Those tears you're crying 
 
Time and time again you take me back in baby 
 
You don't have to make it plain 
 
This is not real love 
 
Look at us dancing baby 
Let's dance and show them all 
(Dance and show them all) 
How close we are 
The lies have worked so far 
So we go on deceiving 
 
But darling don't you know the time 
Baby, look at yourself, holding back the tide 
Like you've got something else up your sleeve 
That's why I've got to leave 
 
And I don't think you should stay here tonight 
(Baby don't you know that my flesh is weak, you know) 
I simply I cannot sleep without you 
But someday I'll have nothing to show 
(Nothing to show) 
(Nothing to show) 
I've nothing to hold 
 
Oh, baby, crying 
All those simple things that won't come again 
Oh do I have to make it plain 
This is not real love 
And I said this is not real love 
 
Real love 
Baby it don't glisten and shine the way it used to 
 
This is not real love (real love) 
Baby think of all the promises I made on the day that I seduced you 
Baby don't wait for me like some angel of tragedy 
I have to set you free 
Darling you should be long gone, oh long gone by now 
You should be with someone, someone 
 
Glisten and shine 
You promised me 
 
You've gotta face it woman, you ain't ever gonna change me 
 
Where will I go, what do I know 
About life without you 
You promised me you'd never leave me, no 
This is not real love</field>

And all the things I said I'd give you  
Just seem to pass me by 
No matter how I try  
 
I hope you understand  
This is not what I had planned for us  
God only knows if my dreams are coming or gone  
(Are coming or gone) 
 
But you're still holding my hand 
Sweetheart (sweetheart)  
And for every single day you're here  
It's crystal clear  
That God isn't mad at me at all 
He ain't mad at me at all  
 
And all this praying hard ain't gonna save the day  
Maybe that's really what I'm guilty of  
I know we live in times when love is not enough  
It's not enough 
(no no no no no)  
 
And there's no way the gods are hearing me  
Baby, they don't even try 
They don't even try  
And all the things I said I'd give you  
Just seem to pass me by 
(No matter how I try) 
 
I hope you understand  
This is not what I had planned for us  
Heaven only knows if our dreams are coming or gone  
(Coming or gone, coming or gone)  
But you're still holding my hand 
Sweetheart (Sweetheart)  
 
So for every single day that you're here  
It's crystal clear  
That God isn't mad at me at all  
He ain't mad at me at all  
 
There's a place in my mind  
Somewhere we could be fine  
Where the children would play  
And we'd eat like kings every day  
 
(Some more promises) 
 
(Like kings on Christmas Day)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving 
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May 
Just as hate knows love's the cure 
You can rest your mind assure 
That I'll be loving you always 
 
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow 
But in passing will grow older every day 
Just as all that's born is new 
You know what I say is true 
That I'll be loving you always 
 
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky) 
Always 
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high) 
Always 
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four) 
Always 
(Until the day that is the day that are no more) 
 
Did you know that true love asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee 
To last through forever and another day 
 
As today I know I'm living 
But tomorrow could make me the past 
But that I mustn't fear, 'cause you're here 
 
And now I know deep in my mind 
The love of me I felt behind 
And I'll be loving you always 
 
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky) 
Lovin' you 
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high) 
Lovin' you 
(Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea) 
Lovin' you 
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream) 
Now ain't that lovin' you 
(Until the day is night and night becomes the day) 
Always 
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away) 
I be loving you forever 
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four) 
Always 
(Until the day that is the day that are no more) 
 
Did you know that true love asks for nothing (True love don't want a thing) 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee 
To last forever, another day 
 
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving 
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May 
Now I know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've left behind 
And I'll be loving you always 
 
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky) 
Lovin' you 
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high) 
Always 
(Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea) 
Lovin' you 
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream) 
Now ain't that lovin' you 
(Until the day is night and night becomes the day) 
Now ain't that lovin' you 
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away) 
I be loving you forever 
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)

For the ones who love me 
To think I thought I could be some kind of family man 
I told myself I was straight 
But I shouldn't have worried 
'Cos my Maker had a better plan for me 
 
And I'm dancing with the freaks now 
I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun 
What you sow is what you reap now 
I'll do my dance with everyone 
I've been getting too much Sun 
(Yes I'm dancin' with the freaks now) 
We're havin', we're havin' too much fun for them 
Look who's talking Guilty feet now' 
 
Well let me tell you people 
It's an easier affair 
Not living my life with other people on my mind 
No, got nothing to hide from anyone 
Yes, I'm walking on new air 
Just living my life 
Better believe I'm gonna get what's mine 
See I don't have the time 
For the haters 
 
And all the time that I wasted 
How careless of me 
Too young and stupid to see 
I put my life in their hands 
(Gonna look for Cupid, man) 
Oh, and I know that they want me to hate them 
There's no hurry 
I'll just have to be the bigger man 
 
Dancin' with the freaks now 
I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun 
What you sow is what you reap now 
I'll do my dance with everyone 
I've been getting too much Sun 
If I turn the other cheek now 
Would that be, would that be too much fun for them' 
Look who's talking 
Guilty feet now' 
 
Well let me tell you people 
It's an easier affair 
Not livin' my life with other people on my mind 
No, got nothing to hide from anyone 
'Cos I'm walking on new air 
Just living my life 
Better believe I'm gonna get what's mine 
See I don't have the time for the haters 
 
Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough 
Don't let them tell you that it's wrong 
Or that you won't find love 
 
Don't let them use my life to put your future down 
Don't let them tell you that happiness can't be found 
 
For my life 
 
Take it to the streets 
There are stories you can keep 
They're just passing you by 
 
Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough 
Don't let them tell you that it's wrong 
Or that you won't find love 
 
Don't let them use my life to put your future down

Because I play them too 
 
Oh but I 
Need some time off from that emotion 
Time to pick my heart up off the floor 
Oh when that love comes down 
Without devotion 
Well it takes a strong man, baby 
But I'm showing you the door 
 
'Cause I gotta have faith 
I gotta faith 
Because I gotta to have faith faith 
I gotta to have faith, faith, faith 
 
Baby 
I know you're asking me to stay 
Say please, please, please, don't go away 
You say I'm giving you the blues 
Maybe 
You mean every word you say 
Can't help but think of yesterday 
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules 
 
Before this river 
Becomes an ocean 
Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
Oh baby I reconsider 
My foolish notion 
Well I need someone to hold me 
But I wait for something more 
 
Yes I've gotta have faith 
Unh I gotta faith 
Because I gotta to have faith, faith, faith 
I gotta to have faith, faith, faith 
 
I just got to wait 
Because I got to have faith 
I gotta have faith

            <field name="lyrics">Close friend of mine as a child fell into a slumber 
No sign of life since '75 
Then one day he just, what do you know 
I guess God just called his number 
 
He called me up he called me up and said 
"I've been awake about a week 
I'm thinking about asking the doctor 
If he could put me back to sleep" 
Then he laughed and said 
"Hey all the girls they look the same" 
Don't they know just what their mothers 
Paid in blood, and tears to change 
 
But the words that made me cry 
The thing he softly said 
It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head 
He said, "If Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?" 
 
Youth, beautiful youth 
We walked through the walls until we found the truth 
And said "Change it, it's ugly just change it" 
Everyone we used to know 
Must have given up, so long ago 
You can see it, it's written on their faces 
And the inside of their clothes 
 
But the words that made me cry 
'Cause I knew just what they meant 
He turned to me and said 
"Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?" 
 
"Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come Marvin and Elvis are dead?" 
 
I said "If Jesus Christ is going to save us from ourselves 
How come peace, love and Elvis are dead?"</field>

And people on the streets 
I'm looking out for angels 
Just trying to find some peace 
Now I think it's time 
That you let me know 
So if you love me 
Say you love me 
But if you don't just let me go 
 
'Cause teacher 
There are things that I don't want to learn 
And the last one I had 
Made me cry 
So I don't want to learn to 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because it ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
 
When you were just a stranger 
And I was at your feet 
I didn't feel the danger 
Now I feel the heat 
That look in your eyes 
Telling me no 
So you think that you love me 
Know that you need me 
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong 
Just let me go 
 
And teacher 
There are things 
That I don't want to learn 
Oh the last one I had 
Made me cry 
So I don't want to learn to 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because it ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
 
So when you say that you need me 
That you'll never leave me 
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong 
Let me go 
 
And teacher 
There are things 
That I still have to learn 
But the one thing I have is my pride 
Oh so I don't want to learn 
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine 
Because there ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Who just isn't willing to try 
 
I'm so cold

Don't kiss me, darling 
I want you to hear the things I say 
I loved you in my way 
But you know I'm gonna leave you

The clock was always ticking 
And your heart, 
Yes I know your heart is always on the run 
 
[George:] 
I hate what I've become 
But I'm still gonna leave you 
And I don't think you should stay for the night 
 
[Mutya:] 
Baby you know that my flesh is weak 
You know I simply 
 
[Both:] 
I cannot sleep without you 
My heart has simply nowhere to go

Nothing to hold 
Those tears you're crying

Time and time again you take me back in baby

You don't have to make it plain

This is not real love

Look at us dancing baby 
Let's dance and show them all 
(Dance and show them all) 
How close we are 
The lies have worked so far 
So we go on deceiving 
 
[George:] 
But darling don't you know the time 
Baby, look at yourself, holding back the tide 
Like you've got something else up your sleeve 
That's why I've got to leave 
 
[Both:] 
And I don't think you should stay here tonight 
(Baby don't you know that my flesh is weak, you know) 
I simply I cannot sleep without you 
But someday I'll have nothing to show 
(Nothing to show)

I've nothing to hold

Oh, baby, crying 
All those simple things that won't come again 
Oh do I have to make it plain 
This is not real love 
 
And I said this is not real love 
 
[Mutya:] 
Real love 
Baby it don't glisten and shine the way it used to 
 
[George:] 
This is not real love (real love) 
Baby think of all the promises I made on the day that I seduced you 
Baby don't wait for me like some angel of tragedy 
I have to set you free 
Darling you should be long gone, oh long gone by now 
You should be with someone, someone 
 
[Mutya:] 
Glisten and shine 
You promised me 
 
[George:] 
You've gotta face it woman, you ain't ever gonna change me

Where will I go, what do I know 
About life without you 
You promised me you'd never leave me, no

In your eyes, I guess  
You heard me cry  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
 
I'm blessed  
I know  
Heaven sent  
And Heaven stole  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
 
And what have I learned  
From all this pain  
I thought I'd never feel the same  
About anyone  
Or anything again  
 
But now I know  
When you find your love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
 
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
 
Sadness  
In my eyes  
No one guessed  
Or no one tried  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
 
Loveless and cold  
With your last breath  
You saved my soul  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
 
And what have I learned  
From all these tears  
I've waited for you all those years  
And just when it began  
He took you away  
 
But I still say  
When you find love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
 
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
 
So the words you could not say  
I'll sing them for you  
And the love we would have made  
I'll make it for two  
 
For every single memory  
Has become a part of me  
You will always be  
My love  
 
Well, I've been loved  
So I know just what love is  
And the lover that I kissed  
Is always by my side  
 
Oh, the lover I still miss  
Was Jesus to a child</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When your heart's in someone else's hands 
Monkey see and monkey do 
Their wish is your command 
Not to blame 
Everyone's the same 
 
All you do is love and love is all you do 
I should know by now the way I fought for you 
You're not to blame, everyone's the same 
 
I know you think that you're safe 
Mister 
Harmless deception 
That keeps love at bay 
It's the ones who resist that we most want to kiss 
Wouldn't you say? 
 
Cowboys and angels 
They all have the time for you 
Why should I imagine that I'd be a find for you 
Why should I imagine 
That I'd have something to say 
 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
In your heart there's a trace 
Of someone before 
 
When your heart's in someone else's plans 
Things you say and things you do 
That they don't understand 
You're not to blame 
Always ends the same 
 
You can call it love but I don't think it's true 
You should know by now 
I'm not the boy for you 
You're not to blame 
Always ends the same 
 
I know you think that you're safe 
Sister 
Harmless affection that keeps things this way 
It's the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss 
Who will pay and pay 
Cowboys and angels 
They all have the time for you 
Why should I imagine that I was designed for you 
Why should I believe 
That you would stay 
 
But that scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
Don't you think that I'd know 
They've hurt you, before 
 
Take this man to your place 
Maybe his hands can help you forget 
Please be stronger than your past 
The future may still give you a chance 
The future, the future, not the past 
 
That scar on your face 
That beautiful face of yours 
Don't you think that I know 
They hurt you before</field>

But flies on having fun 
You know what I need 
Sleep in peace when the day is done

That was there at my command, my love 
That was there 
 
And the first time ever I lay with you 
And felt you heart so close to mine, 
And I knew our joy would fill the earth 
It would last till the end of time, my love 
It would last till the end of time

Tripping on a high wire 
Bulldog stubborn 
Born uneven 
A classless creature 
A man for all seasons 
 
But don't bet them 
They can't take him 
To the very bottom 
Because they made him 
And they'll waste him 
And I don't believe 
That I want to watch them 
 
'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear 
He was an idol then 
Now he's an idol here 
But his face has changed 
Oh he's not the same no more 
And I have to say 
That I like the way his music sounded before 
 
He was tight-assed 
Walking on broken glass 
Highly prized in the wallet size 
The number one crush 
In a schoolgirl's eyes 
 
But don't pretend 
That it won't end 
In the depth of your despair 
You went from lame suits 
Right down to tennis shoes 
To peanuts 
From the lion's share 
 
'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear 
He was an idol then 
Now he's an idol here 
But his face has changed 
Oh he's not the same no more

No sign of life since '75 
Then one day he just, what do you know 
I' guessing God just called his number 
 
He called me up he called me up and said 
"I've been awake about a week 
I'm thinking about asking the doctor 
If he could put me back to sleep" 
Then he laughed and said 
"Hey all the girls they look the same" 
Don't they know just what their mothers 
Paid in blood, and tears to change 
 
But the words that made me cry 
The thing he softly said 
It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head 
He said, "If Jesus Christ is alive and well 
And how come John and Elvis are dead?" 
 
Youth, beautiful youth 
We walked through the walls until we found the truth 
And said "Change it, it's ugly just change it" 
Everyone we used to know 
Must have given up, so long ago 
You can see it, it's written on their faces 
And the inside of their clothes 
 
But the words that made me cry 
'Cause I knew just what they meant 
He turned to me and said 
"Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?" 
 
"Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
Then how come Marvin and Elvis are dead?" 
 
I said, if Jesus Christ is gonna save us from ourselves 
Then, how come peace, love and Elvis are dead? 
How come?</field>

You don't think life comes in between 
But hey, she's just seventeen 
She feels like she's a worldly girl 
But man you've been around the world 
She is just some worried daddy's girl 
Even though there's nothing I can say 
To cheat you and nature any way 
 
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on a dime 
Let her down easy 
And she'll grow up in time 
 
In her strawberry eyes 
The way she sees you signifies 
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies 
But if you must lay her down 
May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown 
Please do not lead her on when, oh when you leave town 
Even though there's nothing I can say 
To cheat you and nature any way 
 
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on the line 
Let her down easy 
And you'll grow up in time 
 
She's a woman now 
With a daughter to make her proud 
In her crayon world of paper clouds 
She still remembers you 
The first boy that she gave it to 
And she laughs at how little then she knew 
Even though there's nothing I can say 
To cheat you and nature any way 
 
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on a dime 
Let her down easy

No one else to blame for where I stand today

So God, hey God you know why I'm through 
 
Through 
 
I guess it's tough, I guess I'm older 
And everything must change 
But all this cruelty and money instead of love 
People, have we no shame?

And they may take away the things that I've worked for 
But you'll pull me through, babe 
 
It's so clear to me now 
I've enough of these chains 
Life is there for the taking 
What kind of fool would remain in this, in this cheap gilded cage 
I've no memory of truth

Past the school that has not changed 
In all this time  
She thinks of when the boy was young 
All the battles she had won 
Just to give him life 
 
That man 
She loved that man 
For all his life 
But now we meet to take him flowers 
And only god knows why 
 
For what's the use in pressing palms  
When children fade in mother's arms 
It's a cruel world, we've so much to lose 
And what we have to learn, we rarely choose 
 
So if it's god who took her son 
He cannot be the one living in her mind 
 
Take care my love, she said 
Don't think that god is dead 
Take care my love, she said 
 
You have been loved 
 
If I was weak, forgive me 
But I was terrified 
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love 
The kind that makes devils cry 
 
So these days 
My life has changed 
And I'll be fine (and I'll be fine) 
But she just sits and counts the hours 
Searching for her crime 
 
So what's the use in pressing palms  
If you won't keep such love from harm 
It's a cruel world, you've so much to prove 
And heaven help the ones who wait for you 
 
No, I've no daughters, I've no sons 
Guess I'm the only one 
Living in my life 
 
Take care my love, he said 
Don't think that God is dead 
Take care my love, he said

When you find your love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
 
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
 
Sadness  
In my eyes  
No one guessed  
Or no one tried  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
 
Loveless and cold  
With your last breath  
You saved my soul  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
 
And what have I learned  
From all these tears  
I've waited for you all those years  
And just when it began  
He took you away  
 
But I still say  
When you find love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
 
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
 
So the words you could not say  
I'll sing them for you  
And the love we would have made  
I'll make it for two  
 
For every single memory  
Has become a part of me  
You will always be  
My love  
 
Well, I've been loved  
So I know just what love is  
And the lover that I kissed  
Is always by my side  
 
Oh, the lover I still miss  
Was Jesus to a child</field>

            <field name="lyrics">She's got a smile that it seems to me 
Reminds me of childhood memories 
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
Now and then when I see her face 
She takes me away to that special place 
And if I stare too long 
I'd probably break down and cry 
Oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Sweet love of mine 
She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
As if they thought of rain 
I hate to look into those eyes 
And see an ounce of pain 
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
Where as a child I'd hide 
And pray for the thunder 
And the rain to quietly pass me by 
Oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Sweet love of mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Uh, uh, uh, uh 
Sweet love of mine

            <field name="lyrics">When I look into your eyes 
I can see a love restrained 
But darlin' when I hold you 
Don't you know I feel the same? 
'Because nothing' last forever 
And we both know hearts can change 
And it's hard to hold a candle 
In the cold November rain 
We've been through this such a long long time 
Just tryin' to kill the pain 
But lovers always come and lovers always go 
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today 
Walking away 
If we could take the time to lay it on the line 
I could rest my head 
Just knowin' that you were mine 
All mine 
So if you want to love me 
Then darlin' don't refrain 
Or I'll just end up walkin' 
In the cold November rain 
Do you need some time on your own? 
Do you need some time all alone? 
Everybody needs some time on their own 
Don't you know you need some time all alone? 
I know it's hard to keep an open heart 
When even friends seem out to harm you 
But if you could heal a broken heart 
Wouldn't time be out to charm you 
Sometimes I need some time on my own 
Sometimes I need some time all alone 
Everybody needs some time on their own 
Don't you know you need some time all alone? 
And when your fears subside 
And shadows still remain 
I know that you can love me 
When there's no one left to blame 
So never mind the darkness 
We still can find a way 
Nothing lasts forever 
Even a cold November rain 
Don't ya think that you need somebody? 
Don't ya think that you need someone? 
Everybody needs somebody 
You're not the only one 
You're not the only one</field>

Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you 
I'm still alright to smile 
Girl, I think about you every day now 
Was a time when I wasn't sure 
But you set my mind at ease 
There is no doubt you're in my heart now 
Said, woman, take it slow 
And it'll work itself out fine 
All we need is just a little patience 
Said, sugar, make it slow 
And we'll come together fine 
All we need is just a little patience (Patience) 
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone 
If I can't have you right now I'll wait, dear 
Sometimes I get so tense 
But I can't speed up the time 
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider 
Said, woman, take it slow 
And things will be just fine 
You and I'll just use a little patience 
Said, sugar, take the time 
'Cause the lights are shining bright 
You and I've got what it takes to make it 
We won't fake it 
Oh, I'll never break it 
'Cause I can't take it 
Little patience, yeah 
Need a little patience, yeah 
Just a little patience, yeah 
Some more patience, yeah 
I've been walking the streets at night 
Just trying to get it right 
(Need some patience, yeah) 
It's hard to see with so many around 
You know, I don't like being stuck in the crowd 
(Could use some patience, yeah) 
And the streets don't change but, baby, the names 
I ain't got time for the game 
(Gotta have some patience, yeah) 
'Cause I need you, yeah 
Yeah, but I need you 
(All it takes is patience, yeah) 
Oh, I need you (Just a little patience) 
Oh, I need you (Is all you need)

Just an urchin livin' under the street, 
hard case that's tough to beat 
I'm your charity case, 
so buy me somethin' to eat, 
I'll pay you at another time 
Take it to the end of the line 
Ragz to richez or

ya gotta-keep pushin' for the fortune and fame 
It's all a gamble when it's just a game,

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber 
Why I'm here I can't quite remember 
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe 
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see 
Tell me who you're gonna believe 
Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty 
Take me home, yeah 
Take me down to the paradise city

Oh, won't you please take me home 
So far away, so far away, 
so far away, so far away 
Captain America's been torn apart 
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart 
He said- turn me around and take me back to the start 
I must be losin' my mind- "Are you blind?" 
I've seen it all a million times 
Take me down to the paradise city

You'll take it eventually 
You can have anything you want 
But you better not take it from me

I wanna watch you bleed 
When you're high you never 
Ever want to come down, so down, so down, so down, yeah! 
You know where you are?

Some men you just can't reach 
So you get what we had here last week 
Which is the way he wants it, well, he gets it 
I don't like it any more than you men" 
Look at your young men fighting 
Look at your women crying 
Look at your young men dying 
The way they've always done before 
Look at the hate we're breeding 
Look at the fear we're feeding 
Look at the lives we're leading 
The way we've always done before 
My hands are tied 
The billions shift from side to side 
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride 
For the love of God and our human rights 
And all these things are swept aside 
By bloody hands time can't deny 
And are washed away by your genocide 
And history hides the lies of our civil wars 
Did you wear a black armband 
When they shot the man 
Who said, peace could last forever 
And in my first memories 
They shot Kennedy 
I went numb when I learned to see 
So I never fell for Vietnam 
We got the wall of D.C 
to remind us all 
That you can't trust freedom 
When it's not in your hands 
When everybody's fighting 
For their promised land 
And I don't need your civil war 
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
You're power hungry selling soldiers 
In a human grocery store, ain't that fresh 
I don't need your civil war 
Look at the shoes you're filling 
Look at the blood we're spilling 
Look at the world we're killing 
The way we've always done before 
Look in the doubt we've wallowed 
Look at the leaders we've followed 
Look at the lies we've swallowed 
And I don't want to hear no more 
My hands are tied 
For all I've seen has changed my mind 
But still the wars go on as the years go by 
With no love of God or human rights 
Cause all these dreams are swept aside 
By bloody hands of the hypnotized 
Who carry the cross of homicide 
And history bears the scars of our civil wars 
"We practice selective anihilation 
Of mayors and government officials 
For example to create a vacuum then we fill that vacuum 
As popular war advances, peace is closer" 
I don't need your civil war 
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
You're power hungry selling soldiers 
In a human grocery store, ain't that fresh 
And I don't need your civil war 
I don't need your civil war 
I don't need your civil war 
You're power hungry selling soldiers 
In a human grocery store, ain't that fresh 
I don't need your civil war 
I don't need one more war

And nobody's home 
You can fool yourself 
You came in this world alone 
[Alone] 
So nobody ever told you baby 
How it was gonna be 
So what'll happen to you baby 
Guess we'll have to wait and see 
One, two 
Old at heart but I'm only 28 
And I'm much too young 
To let love break my heart 
Young at heart but it's getting much too late 
To find ourselves so far apart 
I don't know how you're supposed 
To find me lately 
And what more could you ask from me 
How could you say that I never needed you 
When you took everything 
Said you took everything from me 
Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait 
When no one I know can seem to help me now 
Old at heart but I musn't hesitate 
If I'm to find my own way out 
Still talkin' to myself 
And nobody's home 
[Alone] 
So nobody ever told us baby 
How it was gonna be 
So what'll happen to us baby 
Guess we'll have to wait and see 
When I find out all the reasons 
Maybe I'll find another way 
Find another day 
With all the changing seasons of my life 
Maybe I'll get it right next time 
And now that you've been broken down 
Got your head out of the clouds, 
back down on the ground 
And you don't talk so loud 
An you don't walk so proud 
Any more, and what for 
Well I jumped into the river 
Too many times to make it home 
I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone 
If it doesn't show give it time 
To read between the lines 
'Cause I see the storm getting closer 
And the waves they get so high 
Seems everything we've ever known's here 
Why must it drift away and die 
I'll never find anyone to replace you 
Guess I'll have to make it through, this time 
Oh this time 
Without you 
I knew the storm was getting closer 
And all my friends said I was high 
But everything we've ever known's here 
I never wanted it to die</field>

And I'll rip your heart in two. 
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed. 
I'll be out the door before you wake, 
It's nothin' new to you. 
'cause I think we've seen that movie too. 
'cause you could be mine. 
But you're way out of line. 
With your bitch slap rappin' 
And your cocaine tongue you get nothin' done. 
I said you could be mine. 
Now hollydays come, and then they go. 
It's nothin' new today. 
Collect another memory. 
When I come home late at night 
Don't ask me where I've been. 
Just count your stars I'm home again. 
'cause you could be mine. 
But you're way out of line. 
With your bitch slap rappin 
And your cocaine tongue you get nothin' done. 
I said you could be mine. 
You could be mine. 
You could be mine. 
You could be mine. 
You could be mine. 
You could be mine. 
You've gone sketchin' too many times. 
Why don't ya give it a rest. 
Why must you find another reason to cry. 
While you're breakin' down my back 
N' I been racin' out my brain. 
It don't matter how we make it 
'cause it always ends the same. 
You can push it for more mileage 
But your flaps r' wearin' thin. 
And I could sleep on it' til morning 
But this nightmare never ends. 
Don't forget to call my lawyers 
with ridiculous demands. 
An you can take the pity so far 
But it's more than I can stand. 
'cause this couchtrip's gettin' older 
Tell me how long has it been. 
'cause 5 years is forever and you haven't grown up yet. 
You could be mine. 
But you're way out of line. 
With your bitch slap rappin' 
And your cocaine tongue you get nuthin' done. 
I said you could be, you should be, you could be mine. 
You could be mine 
(you could be mine) 
You could be mine 
(you could be mine) 
You could be mine 
(you could be mine) 
You could be mine 
(you could be mine) 
You could be mine

You could be mine

You could be mine

            <field name="lyrics">And now I don't know why 
She wouldn't say goodbye 
But then it seems that I 
Had seen it in her eyes. 
And it might not be wise 
I'd still have to try 
With all the love I have inside 
I can't deny 
I just can't let it die 
Cause her heart's just like mine 
And she holds her pain inside 
So if you ask me why 
She wouldn't say goodbye 
I know somewhere inside 
There is a special light 
Still shining bright 
And even on the darkest night 
She can't deny 
So if she's somewhere near me 
I hope to God she hears me 
There's no one else 
Could ever make me feel 
I'm so alive 
I hoped she'd never leave me 
Please God you must believe me 
I've searched the universe 
And found myself 
Within' her eyes 
No matter how I try 
They say it's all a lie 
So what's the use of my 
Confessions to a crime 
Of passions that won't die 
In my heart 
So if she's somewhere near me 
I hope to God she hears me 
There's no one else 
Could ever make me feel 
I'm so alive 
I hoped she'd never leave me 
Please God you must believe me 
I've searched the universe 
And found myself

So if she's somewhere near me

Please God you must believe me 
I've searched the universe 
And found myself 
Within' her eyes 
And now I don't know why 
She wouldn't say goodbye 
It just might be that I 
Had seen it in her eyes 
And now it seems that I 
Gave up my ghost of pride 
I'll never say goodbye</field>

For you to be 
If you need a shoulder 
Or if you need a friend 
I'll be here standing 
Until the bitter end 
No one needs the sorrow 
No one needs the pain 
I hate to see you 
Walking out there 
Out in the rain 
So don't chastise me 
Or think I, I mean you harm 
Like those that take you 
Leave you strung out 
Much too far 
Baby, yeah 
Don't ever leave me 
Say you'll always be there

Was for you

Now that I startin' to learn

Time just fades the pages 
In my book of memories 
Prayers in my pocket 
And no hand in destiny 
I'll keep on movin' along 
With no time to plan my feet 
'cause yesterday's got nothing for me 
Old pictures that I'll always see 
Some things could be better 
If we'd all just let them be 
Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Got nothin' for me 
Yesterday 
there were so many things 
I was never shown 
Suddenly this time I found 
I'm on the streets and I'm all alone 
Yesterday's got nothin' for me

I ain't got time 
to reminisce old novelties

No one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better 
The hardest part this troubled heart 
has never yet been through now 
We've healed the scars that got their start inside 
Someone like you now 
Well had I known or I'd been shown back 
when I longed 
you'd take me 
To break the charge that brought me home 
and all that won't erase me 
I never would know that I could 
No matter what you'd pay me. 
Replay the part, you stole my heart 
I should have known you're crazy 
If all I knew was that with you 
I'd want someone to save me 
It'd be enough, but just my luck 
I fell in love and baby all that I wanted was 
Now I know you better 
You know I'd know better, 
Now I know you better 
So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution 
This melody inside of me still searches for solution 
A twist of fate, A change of heart 
Kills my infatuation 
Of a broken heart 
To provide the spark for my determination 
No one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better 
Ooh, no one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better 
All that I wanted was 
I know you know you know better 
You know I know you know better 
Now you know me better 
(Solo) 
I never wanted you to be so full of anger, 
I never wanted you to be somebody else 
I never wanted you to be someone 
afraid to know themselves 
I only wanted you to see things for yourself 
All that I wanted was 
Now I know you better 
Now we all know better 
All that I wanted was 
(Solo) 
If I were you 
I'd manage to abhor the invitation 
Of Promised love that can't keep up 
with your adoration 
Just use your head and in the end 
You'll find your inspiration, 
To choose your steps, I won't regret 
This kind of aggravation 
No one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better 
No one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better</field>

From somebody else 
You think you got it all locked up inside 
And if you beat them enough, they'll die 
It's like a walk in the park from a cell 
And now you're keeping your own kind in hell 
When your Great Wall rocks, blame yourself 
While their arms reach up for your help

I've been around for a long, long year 
Stole many man's soul and faith

Made damn sure that Pilate 
Washed his hands and sealed his fate 
Pleased to meet you

I stuck around St

I killed the Czar and his ministers 
Anastasia screamed in vain 
I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank 
When the Blitzkrieg raged

Hope you guess my name, oh yeah 
What's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

As your kings and queens 
Fought for ten decades 
For the Gods they made 
I shouted out 
"Who killed the Kennedys?" 
When after all 
It was you and me 
So let me please introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
And I laid traps for troubadors 
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah

Is just the nature of my game 
Just as every cop is a criminal 
And all the sinners saints 
As heads is tails 
Just call me Lucifer 
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 
So if you meet me 
Have some courtesy 
Have some sympathy, and some taste 
Use all your well-learned politics 
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah

Hope you guessed my name, um yeah

I'm on the nightrain 
I can never get enough 
I'm on the nightrain 
Never to return-no 
Loaded like a freight train 
Flyin' like an aeroplane 
Feelin' like a space brain 
One more time tonight 
I'm on the nightrain 
And I'm lookin' for some 
I'm on the nightrain 
So's I can leave this slum 
I'm on the nightrain 
And I'm ready to crash and burn 
Nightrain 
Bottoms up 
I'm on the nightrain 
Fill my cup 
I'm on the nightrain 
I'm on the nightrain 
Love that stuff 
I'm on the nightrain 
An I can never get enough 
Ridin' the nightrain 
I guess I 
I guess, I guess, I guess 
I never learn 
On the nightrain 
Float me home 
Oohh I'm on the nightrain 
Ridin' the nightrain 
Never to return 
Nightrain</field>

How could it be she might be mine 
How could she be so cool 
I've been taken for a fool so many times 
It's a story of a man 
Who works as hard as he can 
Just to be a man who stands on his own 
But the book always burns 
As the story takes it turn 
An leaves a broken man 
How could she be so cool 
How could she be so fine 
I owe a favor to a friend 
My friends they always come through for me 
Yeah 
It's a story of a man 
Who works as hard as he can 
Just to be a man who stands on his own 
But the book always burns 
As the story takes it turn 
An leaves a broken man 
If you could only live my life 
You could see the difference you make to me 
To me 
I'd look right up at night 
And all I'd see was darkness 
Now I see the stars alright 
I wanna reach right up and grab one for you 
When the lights went down in your house 
Yeah that made me happy 
The sweat I make for you 
Yeah...I think you know where that comes from 
Guitar, come on 
Well I'd look right up at night 
And all I'd see was darkness 
Now I see the stars alright 
I wanna reach right up and grab one for you 
When the lights went down in your house 
Yeah that made me happy 
The sweat I make for you 
I think you know where that comes from 
How could she look so good(So good) 
How could she be so fine 
How could she be so cool 
How could it be she might be mine</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Hey you caught me in a coma 
And i don't think i wanna 
Ever come back to this...world again 
Kinda like it in a coma 
'cause no one's ever gonna 
Oh, make me come back to this...world again 
Now I feel as if i'm floating away 
I can't feel all the pressure 
And I like it this way 
But my body's callin' 
Won't ya come back to this...world again 
Suspended deep in a sea of black 
I've got the light at the end 
I've got the bones on the mast 
Well i've gone sailin', I've gone sailin' 
I could leave so easily 
While friends are calling back to me 
I said they're 
They're leaving it all up to me 
When all i needed was clarity 
An someone to tell me 
What the fuck is going on 
Goddamn it! 
Slippin' farther an farther away 
It's a miracle how long we can stay 
In a world our minds created 
In a world that's full of shit 
Help me 
Help me 
Help me 
Help me 
Bastard 
Please understand me 
I'm climbin' through the wreckage 
Of all my twisted dreams 
But ithis cheap investigation just can't 
Stifle all my screams 
And i'm waitin' at the crossroads 
Waiting for you 
Waiting for you 
Where are you? 
No one's gonna bother me anymore 
No one's gonna mess with my head no more 
I can't understand what all the fightin's for 
But it's so nice here down off the shore 
I wish you could see this 
'Cause there's nothing to see 
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me 
Not like the world where i used to live 
I never really wanted to live 
Zap him again 
Zap the son of a bitch again 
Ya live your life like it's a coma 
So won't you tell me why we'd wanna 
With all the reasons you give it's 
It's kinda hard to believe 
But who am i to tell you that i've seen 
Any reason why you should stay 
Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway 
You got a one way ticket 
On your last chance ride 
Gotta one way ticket 
To your suicide 
Gotta one way ticket 
An there's no way out alive 
An all this crass communication 
That has left you in the cold 
Isn't much for consolation 
When you feel so weak and old 
But if home is where the heart is 
Then there's stories to be told 
No you don't need a doctor 
No one else can heal your soul 
Got your mind in submission 
Got your life on the line 
But nobody pulled the trigger 
They just stepped aside 
They be down by the water 
While you watch 'em waving goodbye 
They be callin' in the morning 
They be hangin' on the phone 
They be waiting for an answer 
But you know nobody's home 
And when the bell's stopped ringing 
It was nobody's fault but your own 
There were always ample warnings 
There were always subtle signs 
And you would have seen it comin' 
But we gave you too much time 
And when you said that no one's listening 
Why'd your best friend drop a dime 
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting 
For a way to spend our time 
An "it's so easy" to be social 
"it's so easy" to be cool 
Yeah it's easy to be hungry 
When you ain't got shit to lose 
And i wish that i could help you 
With what you hope to find 
But i'm still out here waiting 
Watching reruns of my life 
When you reach the point of breaking 
Know it's gonna take some time 
To heal the broken memories 
That another man would need 
Just to survive</field>

You bring the rain 
You try and hold me down 
With your complaints 
You cry and moan and complain 
You wine an tear 
Up to my neck in sorrow 
The touch you bring 
You just don't step inside to 14 years 
So hard to keep my own head.. 
that's what I say 
You know.. 
I've been the beggar... 
I've played the thief 
I was the dog.. 
they all tried to beat 
But it's been 
14 years of silence 
It's been 
14 years of pain 
It's been 
14 years that are gone forever 
And I'll never have again, well... 
Your stupid girlfriends tell you 
That I'm to blame 
Well - they're all used-up has-beens 
Out of the game 
This time I'll have the last word 
Hear what I say 
I tried to see it your way 
It won't work today 
You just don't step inside to 14 years 
So hard to keep my own head.. 
that's what I say 
You know.. 
I've been the dealer... 
Hangin' on your street 
I was the dog.. 
they all tried to beat 
But it's been 
14 years of silence 
It's been 
14 years of pain 
It's been 
14 years that are gone forever 
And I'll never have again, well... 
Let's get naughtier! 
Bullshit and contemplation 
Gossip's their trade 
If they knew half the real truth 
What would they say 
Well I'm past the point of concern 
It's time to play 
These last 4 years of madness 
Sure put me straight 
Don't get back 14 years 
In just one day 
So hard to keep my own head 
Just go away 
You know.. 
just like a hooker she said 
Nothing's for free 
Oh I tried to see it your way 
I tried to see it your way...</field>

Ooh, I'll be dancing when you're dying

You got me out of indecision 
You can slash me out of fear 
Good intentions get me nowhere 
It's always nothing, all your love 
Tell me about your overview,

No! 
I can see your true colors 
I see red 
When you hide all of your lovers under the bed 
Instigate a simple life 
And who's to say what's black or white? 
Just because, you're curious, I've earned another 
brought me near 
Through all the dreams that I could use 
Now I know there's nothing I could do 
For you!

Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun 
Ain't it fun when you just can't seem to find your tongue 
Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung 
It's such fun 
 
Well, so you come up to me and spit right in my face 
I didn't even feel it 
It was such a disgrace 
 
I punched my fist right through the glass 
I didn't even feel it 
It happened so fast 
 
Such fun [12 times] 
 
Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt 
Ain't it fun when you she splits you and leaves you on the run 
Well, Ain't it fun when you broken up every band that you ever begun

I got a headache like a mother 
Twice the price of my thrills 
An it's a cold day it's a continental drift 
I said this traffic is hell 
Can you give me a lift 
An I'll try to paint a story 
Got your pictures to tell 
Yeah you got to make a living

I got some genuine 
Imitation 
Bad apples 
Free sample 
For your peace of mind 
Only $9.95 
I got my camera back from customs 
Got my law fees up to date 
Hell they musta seen me comin' 
Ain't this life so fuckin' great 
When the shit hit the fan 
It was all I could stand 
Yeah, well I'm a frequent flyer 
My body's breathing while it can 
But what I don't understand is that 
My world ain't gettin' no brighter 
If I could touch the sky 
Well I would float on by 
While everybody's talkin' 
Hell I'm just another guy 
If it were up to me 
I'd say just let me be 
Why let one bad apple 
Spoil the whole damn bunch 
Gold and caviar 
Now why'nt you pour my apathy 
I'd have all my bases covered 
If I could teach my hands to see 
But now we're down in the deep end 
Where they'd love to watch you drown 
I said your laundry could use washing 
We'll hang it up all over town 
I said hollywood's like a dryer 
An we're down on sunset strip 
An yuo'll be suckin' down the clorox 
'til your life's all nice and crisp 
When the shit hit the fan

But I already left you 
And you're better off left behind

They just thought I'd know better, better. 
No one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better 
The hardest part this troubled heart 
has never yet been through now 
We've healed the scars that got their start inside 
Someone like you now 
Well had I known or I'd been shown back 
when I longed 
you'd take me 
To break the charge that brought me home 
and all that won't erase me 
I never would know that I could 
No matter what you'd pay me. 
Replay the part, you stole my heart 
I should have known you're crazy 
If all I knew was that with you 
I'd want someone to save me 
It'd be enough, but just my luck 
I fell in love and baby all that I wanted was 
Now I know you better 
You know I'd know better, 
Now I know you better 
So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution 
This melody inside of me still searches for solution 
A twist of fate, A change of heart 
Kills my infatuation 
Of a broken heart 
To provide the spark for my determination 
No one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better 
Ooh, no one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better 
All that I wanted was 
I know you know you know better 
You know I know you know better 
Now you know me better 
(Solo) 
I never wanted you to be so full of anger, 
I never wanted you to be somebody else 
I never wanted you to be someone 
afraid to know themselves 
I only wanted you to see things for yourself 
All that I wanted was 
Now I know you better 
Now we all know better 
All that I wanted was 
(Solo) 
If I were you 
I'd manage to abhor the invitation 
Of Promised love that can't keep up 
with your adoration 
Just use your head and in the end 
You'll find your inspiration, 
To choose your steps, I won't regret 
This kind of aggravation 
No one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better 
No one ever told me when I was alone 
They just thought I'd know better, better</field>

We come down from the wire 
An everybody warms themselves 
To a different fire 
When sometimes we get burned 
You'd think sometime we'd learn 
The one you love is the one 
That should take you higher 
You ain't got no one 
You better go back out and find her 
Just like children hidin' in a closet 
Can't tell what's goin' on outside 
Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track 
We'll get taken for a ride 
By a parlor trick or some words of wit 
A hidden hand up a sleeve 
To think that the one you love 
Could hurt you now 
Is a little hard to believe 
But everybody darlin' sometimes 
Bites the hand that feeds 
When I look around 
Everybody always brings me down 
Well is it them or me well I just can't see 
But there ain't no peace to be found 
But if someone really cared, 
Well they'd take the time to spare 
A moment to try to understand 
Another one's despair 
Remember in this game we call life that no one 
Said it's fair 
Breakdown 
Let me hear it now 
Breakdown 
Let me hear it now 
Yeah 
Breakdown 
Let me hear it now 
Breakdown 
Let me hear it now 
Get down with yo' bad self 
Alright 
I've come to know the cold 
I think of it as home 
When there ain't enough of me to go around 
I'd rather be left alone 
But if I call you out of habit I'm out of love and 
I gotta have it 
Would you give it to me if I fit your needs 
Like when we both knew we had it 
But now the damage's done 
And we're back out on the run 
Funny how ev'rything was roses 
When we held on to the guns 
Just because you're winnin' 
Don't mean you're the lucky ones 
Breakdown 
Let me hear it now 
Breakdown 
Yeah 
Breakdown 
Breakdown 
Let me hear it now 
"there goes the challenger being chased 
By the blue blue meanies on wheels 
The vicious traffic squad cars are after 
Our lone driver 
The last american hero 
The-the electric sintar 
The demi-god, 
The super driver of the golden west! 
Two nasty nazi cars are close behind 
The beautiful lone driver 
The police cars are getting closer-closer... 
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile, 
Yeah baby! 
They about to strike him, they gonna get him, 
Smash! rape! 
The last beautiful free soul on this planet 
But...it is written if the evil spirit arms 
The tiger with claws 
Brahman provided wings for the dove 
Thus spake the super guru"

Bring it back home to me 
Woman little standing, dreaming to forget him 
Bring it back home to me? 
Brown-eyed stunner, come on, 
Bring it home to me 
Kiss a little, fishing for your lover, 
Won’t you bring it down home to me 
See a sky lit on fire, seen the dog it here 
She lit her lips, with a passion, in the third degree 
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl’s grin 
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her things 
You can see the love, like check an ounce of pain, 
Darling won’t you wanna; 
Sorry to resent, you said; Gimme back 
Keep your teeth 
Never wanna hold you, 
Never wanna kiss you, 
I bet she’s taking away from me 
Never will repeat it, on never reprimand it, 
Will you bring it back home to me 
Take care before my baby, 
When your baby gives it up for free 
She just puts around, being lazy, 
But since she brings her love to me 
Don’t need nothing to save me, say for a piece of your luxury 
Like the doorfoot, you’ll never gage it 
I’ll tell you just how it’s gonna be 
I call your lover in the morning, 
When you have your cup of tea 
You never give me your warning, 
So you better give her right up for me 
Guess who’s coming over, on your thinks; 
That’s such a surprise 
If you’re saying you never know her, 
Honey, you better open your eyes 
Look out 
See a real long fire, she’s the dog in here 
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree 
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl’s grin 
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her things 
Can’t take care before my baby, 
When your baby gives it up for free 
She just gets around being lazy 
Until she brings me her loving to me 
I don’t need nothing to save me, 
Say for a piece of your luxury 
Lock the door, but you’ll never gage me 
I tell you just how it’s gonna be 
I call your lover in the morning, 
When you have your cup of tea 
You never give me your warning, 
So get yourself a letter from me 
Ohhhh, where’re you going, tell me; 
Who’re you to see? 
I’ve been sleeping on your doorstep, 
Baby, won’t you bring it back ho to me 
Get me something for my jealous mind, 
You don’t get something for free 
You just bring it down home to me

Makes me wish I had a gun 
If I thought that I was crazy 
Well I guess I'd have more fun 
Guess I'd have more fun 
Ooh the Catcher in the Rye again 
Ooh won't let you get away from his gun 
It's just another day like today 
You decide 
If I don't have to 
Then they'll find 
And I won't ask you 
At anytime 
Or long thereafter 
If it's cold outside 
And I'll be wrapped 
Up in to me 
Oh oh 
Not at all (repeat) 
(Solo) 
Ooh the Catcher in the Rye again, 
Ooh won't let ya get away from his gun 
It's just another day like today 
When all is said and done 
We're not the only ones 
Who look at life this way 
That's what the young folk's say 
As if they'd ever change 
As time went by the same 
But every time I'd see them 
Makes me wish I had a gun 
If I thought that I was crazy 
Well I guess I'd have more fun 
It's what used to be's not there for me 
I'm off to find someone that belongs insane like I do 
Not at all (repeat) 
On an ordinary day 
Not in an ordinary way 
All at once, this song I heard 
No longer would it play for anybody 
Or anyone 
That needed comfort from somebody 
Needed comfort from someone who cared 
To be 
Not like you 
And unlike me 
And then the boy took that away 
From me 
So that it set the wheels in motion 
To alter our memories 
You were the instrument 
You were the one 
How a body took the body 
Gave that boy a gun 
You took our innocence 
Beyond our stance 
Sometimes we own will 
There we got it 
All alone and I can tell you..

Some men you just can't reach 
So you get what we had here last week 
Which is the way he wants it, well, he gets it 
I don't like it any more than you men" 
Look at your young men fighting 
Look at your women crying 
Look at your young men dying 
The way they've always done before 
Look at the hate we're breeding 
Look at the fear we're feeding 
Look at the lives we're leading 
The way we've always done before 
My hands are tied 
The billions shift from side to side 
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride 
For the love of God and our human rights 
And all these things are swept aside 
By bloody hands time can't deny 
And are washed away by your genocide 
And history hides the lies of our civil wars 
Did you wear a black armband 
When they shot the man 
Who said, peace could last forever 
And in my first memories 
They shot Kennedy 
I went numb when I learned to see 
So I never fell for Vietnam 
We got the wall of D.C 
to remind us all 
That you can't trust freedom 
When it's not in your hands 
When everybody's fighting 
For their promised land 
And I don't need your civil war 
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
You're power hungry selling soldiers 
In a human grocery store, ain't that fresh 
I don't need your civil war 
Look at the shoes you're filling 
Look at the blood we're spilling 
Look at the world we're killing 
The way we've always done before 
Look in the doubt we've wallowed 
Look at the leaders we've followed 
Look at the lies we've swallowed 
And I don't want to hear no more 
My hands are tied 
For all I've seen has changed my mind 
But still the wars go on as the years go by 
With no love of God or human rights 
Cause all these dreams are swept aside 
By bloody hands of the hypnotized 
Who carry the cross of homicide 
And history bears the scars of our civil wars 
"We practice selective anihilation 
Of mayors and government officials 
For example to create a vacuum then we fill that vacuum 
As popular war advances, peace is closer" 
I don't need your civil war 
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
You're power hungry selling soldiers 
In a human grocery store, ain't that fresh 
And I don't need your civil war 
I don't need your civil war 
I don't need your civil war 
You're power hungry selling soldiers 
In a human grocery store, ain't that fresh 
I don't need your civil war 
I don't need one more war 
I don't need one more war

And i don't think i wanna 
Ever come back to this...world again 
Kinda like it in a coma 
'cause no one's ever gonna 
Oh, make me come back to this...world again 
Now I feel as if i'm floating away 
I can't feel all the pressure 
And I like it this way 
But my body's callin' 
Won't ya come back to this...world again 
Suspended deep in a sea of black 
I've got the light at the end 
I've got the bones on the mast 
Well i've gone sailin', I've gone sailin' 
I could leave so easily 
While friends are calling back to me 
I said they're 
They're leaving it all up to me 
When all i needed was clarity 
An someone to tell me 
What the fuck is going on 
Goddamn it! 
Slippin' farther an farther away 
It's a miracle how long we can stay 
In a world our minds created 
In a world that's full of shit 
Help me 
Help me 
Help me 
Help me 
Bastard 
Please understand me 
I'm climbin' through the wreckage 
Of all my twisted dreams 
But ithis cheap investigation just can't 
Stifle all my screams 
And i'm waitin' at the crossroads 
Waiting for you 
Waiting for you 
Where are you? 
No one's gonna bother me anymore 
No one's gonna mess with my head no more 
I can't understand what all the fightin's for 
But it's so nice here down off the shore 
I wish you could see this 
'Cause there's nothing to see 
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me 
Not like the world where i used to live 
I never really wanted to live 
Zap him again 
Zap the son of a bitch again 
Ya live your life like it's a coma 
So won't you tell me why we'd wanna 
With all the reasons you give it's 
It's kinda hard to believe 
But who am i to tell you that i've seen 
Any reason why you should stay 
Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway 
You got a one way ticket 
On your last chance ride 
Gotta one way ticket 
To your suicide 
Gotta one way ticket 
An there's no way out alive 
An all this crass communication 
That has left you in the cold 
Isn't much for consolation 
When you feel so weak and old 
But if home is where the heart is 
Then there's stories to be told 
No you don't need a doctor 
No one else can heal your soul 
Got your mind in submission 
Got your life on the line 
But nobody pulled the trigger 
They just stepped aside 
They be down by the water 
While you watch 'em waving goodbye 
They be callin' in the morning 
They be hangin' on the phone 
They be waiting for an answer 
But you know nobody's home 
And when the bell's stopped ringing 
It was nobody's fault but your own 
There were always ample warnings 
There were always subtle signs 
And you would have seen it comin' 
But we gave you too much time 
And when you said that no one's listening 
Why'd your best friend drop a dime 
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting 
For a way to spend our time 
An "it's so easy" to be social 
"it's so easy" to be cool 
Yeah it's easy to be hungry 
When you ain't got shit to lose 
And i wish that i could help you 
With what you hope to find 
But i'm still out here waiting 
Watching reruns of my life 
When you reach the point of breaking 
Know it's gonna take some time 
To heal the broken memories 
That another man would need 
Just to survive</field>

Cornchucker 
A real buttfucker 
Gonna stick my dick 
Right up her ass 
She's a cornchucker 
A real buttfucker 
Gonna wash my dick 
(Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!) 
After she makes me buttfuck her 
Cornchucker

I wanna be deep inside of you 
One more time! 
She's a cornchucker 
A real butt fucker 
Gonna watch my dick 
As I make her butt pucker 
She's a cornchucker

Gonna stick my dick

            <field name="lyrics">Crash diet of reds'n'ludes 
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze 
Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose 
In your one track mind now 
Where's that leave you? 
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster baby 
Takin' your last ride 
Now better be so careful or you'll be dead before you time 
Sorry you took mother's car now 
Tears in my eyes, baby please don't go 
You bet one in too many, Havin' one for the road 
fresh from detox, fresh from jail 
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell 
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster hmm 
Takin' your last ride 
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time 
Sorry you took mother's car now 
Too soon, for those who didn't mean it 
Too late for the pressure and blame 
Too bad for those who don't believe it 
Ruby street still calls your name 
Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive 
Smokin' a cig while you drink'n'drive 
With no control in your life ahead 
You're never gonna see if you wind up dead 
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster 
Takin' your last ride 
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time 
Drink'n'drive white lightning baby 
It's always on your mind 
when you Put your a limit baby, do it one more time 
Take it down 
Break it down 
Somethin's changin', somethin's breakin' 
You gotta be abroad outta your family 
baby one more time to make it 
Sweet history, Ooohhhh 
If you don't care about yourself 
Would you please take me alive 
Oooohhhh... 
You gonna 
You gonna drink'n'drive

            <field name="lyrics">Sick of this life 
Not that you'd care 
I'm not the only one with 
Whom these feelings I share 
Nobody understands, 
Quite why we're here 
We're searchin' for answers 
That never appear 
But maybe if I looked real hard I'd 
I'd see your tryin' too 
To understand this life, 
That we're all goin' through 
(Then when she said she was gonna like 
Wreck my car...I didn't know what to do) 
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse 
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down 
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more 
It may sound funny but you'd think by now 
I'd be smilin' 
I guess some things never change 
Never change 
I met an old cowboy 
I saw the look in his eyes 
Somethin' tells me he's been here before 
'Cause experience makes you wise 
I was only a small child 
When the thought first came to me 
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son 
That brought back the devil in me 
I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul 
Still wet behind the ears 
I been around this track a couple o' times 
But now the dust is startin' to clear 
Oh yeah!</field>

What of your plans 
No one can live in sorrow 
Ask all your friends

And all love is real 
Don't you cry tonight 
Don't you cry tonight 
Don't you cry tonight 
There's a heaven above you baby 
And don't you cry tonight

As years all went by 
With all the voices I've heard 
Something has died 
And when you're in need of someone 
My heart won't deny you 
So many seem so lonely 
With no one left to cry to baby 
And don't you cry 
Don't you ever cry 
Don't you cry tonight 
Baby maybe someday 
Don't you cry 
Don't you ever cry 
Don't you cry

            <field name="lyrics">Don't damn me 
When I speak a piece of my mind 
'cause silence isn't golden 
When I'm holding it inside 
'cause I've been where I have been 
An I've seen what I have seen 
I put the pen to the paper 
'cause it's all a part of me 
Be it a song or a casual conversation 
To hold my tounge speaks 
Of quiet reservations 
Your words once heard 
They can place you in a faction 
My words may disturb 
But at least there's some reaction 
Sometimes I wanna kill 
Sometimes I wanna die 
Sometimes I wanna destroy 
Sometimes I wanna cry 
Sometimes I could get even 
Sometimes I could give up 
Sometimes I could give 
Sometimes I never give a fuck 
It's only for a while 
I hope you understand 
I never wanted this to happen 
Didn't wanna be a man 
So I hid inside my world 
I took what I could find 
I cried when I was lonely 
I fell down when I was blind 
But don't damn me when I speak 
A piece of my mind 
'cause silence isn't golden 
When I'm holding it inside 
'cause I've been where I have been 
An I've seen what I have seen 
I put the pen to the paper 
'cause it's all a part of me 
How can I ever satisfy you 
An how can I ever make you see 
That, deep inside we're all somebody 
An it don't matter who you wanna be 
But now I gotta smile 
I hope you comprehend 
For this man can say it happened 
'cause this child has been condemned 
So I stepped into your world 
I kicked you in the mind 
An I'm the only witness 
To the nature of my crime 
But look at what we've done 
To the innocent and young 
Whoa listen to who's talking 
'cause we're not the only ones 
The trash collected by the eyes 
And dumped into the brain 
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts 
You tell me who's to blame 
I know you don't wanna hear me crying 
An I know you don't wanna hear me deny 
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions 
But your delusions are yours an not mine 
We take for granted that we know the whole story 
We judge a book by it's cover 
And read what we want 
Between selected lines 
Don't hail me 
An don't idolize the ink 
Or I've failed in my attentions 
Can you find the missing link 
Your only validation is in living your own life 
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time 
So I send this song to the offended 
I said what I meant and I've never pretended 
As so many others do intending just to please 
If I damned your point of view 
Could you turn the other cheek 
Don't damn me 
when I speak a piece a mind 
'cause silence isn't golden 
When im holding it inside 
I've been where I have been 
An I've seen what I have seen 
Put the pen to the paper 
'cause it's all a part of me 
Don't damn me 
I said don't damn me 
I said hail damn me 
Don't damn me</field>

Before I do somebody some harm 
I feel just like a vegetable 
Down here on the farm 
Nobody comes to see me 
Nobody here to turn me on 
I ain't even got a lover 
Down here on the farm 
They told me to get healthy 
They told me to get some sun 
But boredom eats me like cancer 
Down here on the farm 
Drinking lemonade shanty 
Ain't no body gonna do me harm 
But I'm like a fish out of water 
Down here on the farm 
I write a thousand letters 
'til my fingers all gone numb 
But I never see no postman 
Down here on the farm 
I call my baby on the telephone 
I say come down and have some fun 
But she knows what the score is 
Down here on the farm 
I can't fall in love with a wheat field 
I can't fall in love with a barn 
When everything smells like horse shit 
Down here on the farm 
Blue skies and swimming pools 
Add so much charm 
But I'd rather be back in Soho 
Than down here on the farm 
On the fucking farm! 
Are you born in a fucking barn or what?

The world outside looks so unkind 
I'm countin' on you to carry me through 
And when my mind is free 
You know a melody can move me 
And when I'm feelin' blue 
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me

We live an hope to see the next day

Sometimes these things they are so cold 
Sometimes these things just seem to 
Rip you right in two 
Oh no man don't let 'em get ta you 
She loved him yesterday 
He laid her sister 
She said o.K. 
An that's all right 
Buried her things today 
Way back out deep 
Behind the driveway 
And that's all right 
Sometimes these women are so easy 
Sometimes these women are so cold 
Sometimes these women seem to 
Rip you right in two 
Only if you let 'em get to you 
Ya get out on your own 
And you / take all that you own 
And you / forget about your home 
And then you're / just fuckin' gone 
There's no logic here today 
Do as you got to, go your own way

And nobody's home 
You can fool yourself 
You came in this world alone 
[Alone] 
So nobody ever told you baby 
How it was gonna be 
So what'll happen to you baby 
Guess we'll have to wait and see 
One, two 
Old at heart but I'm only 28 
And I'm much too young 
To let love break my heart 
Young at heart but it's getting much too late 
To find ourselves so far apart 
I don't know how you're supposed 
To find me lately 
And what more could you ask from me 
How could you say that I never needed you 
When you took everything 
Said you took everything from me 
Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait 
When no one I know can seem to help me now 
Old at heart but I musn't hesitate 
If I'm to find my own way out 
Still talkin' to myself 
And nobody's home 
[Alone] 
So nobody ever told us baby 
How it was gonna be 
So what'll happen to us baby 
Guess we'll have to wait and see 
When I find out all the reasons 
Maybe I'll find another way 
Find another day 
With all the changing seasons of my life 
Maybe I'll get it right next time 
And now that you've been broken down 
Got your head out of the clouds, 
back down on the ground 
And you don't talk so loud 
An you don't walk so proud 
Any more, and what for 
Well I jumped into the river 
Too many times to make it home 
I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone 
If it doesn't show give it time 
To read between the lines 
'Cause I see the storm getting closer 
And the waves they get so high 
Seems everything we've ever known's here 
Why must it drift away and die 
I'll never find anyone to replace you 
Guess I'll have to make it through, this time 
Oh this time 
Without you 
I knew the storm was getting closer 
And all my friends said I was high 
But everything we've ever known's here 
I never wanted it to die</field>

You got a glass jawed toothache

An they be runnin' round back 
See 'em line up on their knees 
'Cause the kiss ass sycophants 
Throwin' penance at your feet 
When they got nowhere to go 
Watch 'em come in off the streets 
While they're bangin' out front 
Inside their slammin' to the cruch 
Go on an throw me to the lions 
And the whole damn screamin' bunch 
'Cause the pissed-off rip-offs 
'R' everywhere you turn 
Tell me how a generation's 
Ever s'posed to learn 
This fire is burnin' 
and it's out of control 
It's not a problem you can stop 
It's rock n' roll 
I read it on a wall 
It went straight to my head 
It said "Dance to the tension 
of a world on edge" 
We got racial violence 
And who'll cast the first stone 
And sex is used anyway it can be 
Sometimes when I look out 
It's hard to see the day 
It's a feelin' you can have it 
It's not mine to take away 
Lost in the garden of Eden 
Yeah we're lost in the garden of Eden 
And there's no one's gonna believe this 
But we're lost in the garden of Eden 
This fire is burnin' and it's out of control 
It's not a problem you can stop 
It's rock n' roll 
Suck on that 
Looking through this point of view 
There's no way I'm gonna fit in 
Don't ya tell me what my eyes see 
Don't ya tell me who to believe in 
I ain't superstitious 
But I know when somethin's wrong 
I've been draggin' my heels 
With a bitch called hope 
Let the undercurrent drag me along 
Lost in the garden of Eden 
Yeah we're lost in the garden of Eden 
And there's no one's gonna believe this 
But we're lost in the garden of Eden 
Most organized religions make 
A mockery of humanity 
Our governments are dangerous And out of control 
The garden of Eden is just another graveyard 
Said if they had someone to buy it 
Said I'm sure they'd sell my soul 
This fire is burnin' and it's out of control 
It's not a problem you can stop 
It's rock n' roll 
Lost in the garden of Eden 
(An we ain't talkin' about no 
poison apple or some missin' rib ya hear) 
Yeah we're lost in the garden of Eden 
Said there's no one's gonna believe this 
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden 
This fire is burnin' and it's out of control

Why should I look at you 
When you make me hate you too 
I sense a smell of retribution in the air 
I don't even understand why the fuck you even care 
And I don't need your jealousy yeah 
Why drag me down in your misery 
And when you stare you don't think I feel it 
But I'm gonna deal it back to you in spades 
When I'm havin' fun 
ya know I can't conceal it 
'cause I know you'd never cut it in my game 
Oh no 
And when you're talkin' about a vasectomy 
Yeah 
I'll be writin' down your obituary 
History 
You got your bitches with The silicone injections 
Crystal meth and yeast infections 
Bleached blond hair, collagen lip projections 
Who are you to criticize my intentions 
Got your subtle manipulative devices 
Just like you I got my vices 
I got a thought that would be nice 
I'd like to crush your head tight in my vice 
Pain!!! 
And that goes for all you punks in the press 
That want to start shit by printin' lies 
Instead of the things we said 
That means you 
Andy sercher at hit parader 
Circus magazine 
Mick wall at kerrang 
Bob guccione jr; at spin, 
What you pissed off cuz your dad gets more 
Pussy than you? 
Fuck you 
Suck my fuckin' dick 
You be rippin' off the fuckin' kids 
While they be payin' their hard earned Money 
to read about the bands They want to know about 
Printin' lies startin' controversy 
You wanta antagonize me 
Antagonize me motherfucker 
Get in the ring motherfucker 
And I'll kick you bitchy little ass 
Punk

I'm gonna kick your ass, oh yeah! oh yeah!

We built a world out of anarchy oh yeah 
And in this corner weighing in at 850 pounds, 
Guns n' roses

All the guns n' fuckin' roses Fans

And to all those opposed...

It's a crown of thorns 
That never seems to break the skin 
There's no blood in the scars 
Just your broken heart 
You used to be so sweet 
You walked with a smile 
Life tastes funny and the coffee's cold 
Amuse yourself, make you useful 
You've got nothing good to say 
Keep your mouth shut 
Nothing good to do 
Keep it to yourself 
Nothing's ever good enough for you 
Sick of everything that you say 
It's going down 
Sorry for everything 
Sick of everything that you do 
It's going down 
You look like a fool 
You never mean to hurt no one 
They just happen to be there next to you 
'Cause you're going down 
I know this dark place 
I heard these words 
On the tip of a million tongues 
I've heard them yelled 
I've even heard them sung 
Get into your car and drive 
Just as fast as you can 
You've had your 15 minutes 
You tried to take an hour but 
Now no one, hears your call 
You've got nothing good to say 
Keep your mouth shut 
Nothing good to do 
Keep it to yourself 
Nothing's ever good enough for you 
Sick of everything that you say

And a man with no legs crawlin' down 
Fifth Street tryin' just to get somethin' to eat.

Is it true? 
What they say of you 
Gonna call the President 
Gonna call up the Private Eye 
Gonna get the I.R.S. 
Gonna need the F.B.I. 
There's not anymore that I can do 
All the reasons that you give 
I follow you 
So when you plead the fifth, 
Baby, every time, 
It's true 
Wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong 
Wouldn't be the last I'm sure I've known 
Through all the rumors I can tell, 
Some things didn't work so well 
Well anyway, it feels the same 
When you first told me you were gone 
So long ago, but I feel it head on 
Through all the emotions and having a fit 
And that's the truth and here's the worst yet 
Wouldn't even matter the things that I say 
You made your mind up and are gone anyway 
There's no use now in dragging it on 
Should've seen it coming all along 
Well it's true.. 
ooh 
I had 
My doubts of you 
Gonna call the President 
Gonna call myself a Private Eye 
Gonna get the I.R.S. 
Gonna need the F.B.I. 
Gonna make this a federal case 
Gonna wave it right down in your face 
Read it daily with your morning news 
With a sweet hangover, and the headlines true now 
I feel your doing this all for my health 
I should've looked again then at somebody else 
Feel like I done way more than wrong 
Feelin' like I never gonna get ya outta this song 
Feelin like I'm just too tired to care 
Feelin like I done more than my share 
Could it be the weight that I've carried on 
Like a broken record for so long 
And I do 
Ooh, oh 
I'm gonna call the President, 
I'm gonna call a private eye 
Gonna get the I.R.S., 
Gonna need myself the F.B.I. 
Ooh, what shall I do 
If I gave my heart to you 
It's such a crime you know it's true 
Gonna call the president 
Gonna get myself a private eye 
Gonna need the I.R.S. 
Gonna get the F.B.I.

But I’ve been screaming in my bed late at night 
A space a little, little and your stack of pain 
Makes it grip that skull, to me child that you’ll stay 
You’ve been in my life so long, can I get through to you 
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
There’s something I need to say before it’s to late 
But I won’t hold you back, while I’m begging you to stay 
Just another Sunday 
Just another Sunday 
Oh yaaa, Just another Sunday 
Just another Sunday, Oh yaaa 
There’s too many games in a day for a simple man to face 
That desperate moment in your life where you can’t be afraid 
Don’t thing your second change will break around the bend 
‘Con hearts don’t always share love, or the person on the other end 
You’re been in my life so long, can I get through to you 
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
There’s something I need to say before it’s to late 
But I won’t hold you back, while I’m begging you to stay ya 
Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me 
‘Cos felling the same pain makes half the luxury 
Take a walk away won’t end the carousel 
But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well 
You’re been in my life so long, can I get through to you 
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
There’s something I need to say before it’s to late 
But I won’t hold you back, while I’m begging you to stay.</field>

Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain 
If I said that you're my friend

How long before I had your trust again 
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside 
Hopin' that you'd find your own way in 
But how can I protect you 
Or try not to neglect you 
When you won't take the love I have to give 
I bought me an illusion 
An I put it on the wall 
I let it fill my head with dreams 
And I had to have them all 
But oh the taste is never so sweet 
As what you'd believe it is- 
Well I guess it never is 
It's these prejudiced illusions 
That pump the blood 
To the heart of the biz 
You know I never thought 
That it could take so long 
You know I never knew how to be strong 
Yeah, I let you shape me 
But I feel as though you raped me 
'Cause you climbed inside my world 
And in my songs 
So now I've closed the door 
To keep the cold outside 
Seems somehow I've found the will to live 
But how can I forget you 
Or try not to reject you 
When we both know it takes time to forgive 
Sweetness is a virtue 
And you lost your virtue long ago 
You know I'd like to hurt you 
But my conscience always tells me no 
You could sell your body on the street 
To anyone whom you might meet 
Who'd love to try and get inside 
And bust your innocence open wide 
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive 
My baby's gone off the track 
My baby's got a locomotive 
Got ta peel the bitch off my back 
I know it looks like I'm insane 
Take a closer look I'm not to blame 
No 
Gonna have some fun with my frustration 
Gonna watch the big screen in my head 
I'd rather take a detour 
'Cause this road ain't gettin' clearer 
Your train of thought has cut me off again 
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one 
Better tame that boy for he's a man 
Sweetheart don't make me laugh 
You's gettin' too big for your pants 
And I's think maybe you should 
Cut out while you can 
You can use you illusion- 
Let it take you where it may 
We live and learn 
And then sometimes it's best to walk away 
Me I'm just here hangin' on 
It's my only place to stay at least 
For now anyway 
I've worked too hard for my illusions 
Just to throw them all away 
I'm taking time for quiet consolation 
In passing by this love that's passed away 
I know it's never easy- 
So why should you believe me 
When I've always got so many things to say 
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made 
'Cause playful hearts 
Can sometimes be enraged 
You know I tried to wake you- 
I mean how long could it take you 
To open up your eyes and turn the page 
Kindness is a treasure- 
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown 
So I'll say it for good measure 
To all the ones like you I've known 
Ya know I'd like to shave your head 
And all my friends could paint it red 
'Cause love to me's a two way street 
An all I really want is peace 
But my baby's got a locomotive 
My baby's gone off the track 
My baby's got a locomotive 
Got ta peel the bitch off my back 
I know it looks like I'm insane 
Take a closer look I'm not to blame 
No 
Affection is a blessing 
Can you find it in your sordid heart 
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether 
But the tremor tore my pad apart 
Yeah I know it's hard to face 
When all we've worked for's gone to waste 
But you're such a stupid woman 
And I'm such a stupid man 
But love like time's got its own plans 
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive 
My baby's gone off the track 
My baby's got a locomotive 
Got ta peel the bitch off my back 
I know it looks like I'm insane 
Take a closer look I'm not to blame 
Yeah 
If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane 
Love's so strange</field>

Time keeps on flying 
Think you're loving baby 
But all your doing is crying 
Can you feel 
Are those feelings real 
Look at your game, girl 
Look at your game, girl 
What a mad delusion 
Living in that confusion 
Frustration and doubt 
Can you ever live without the game 
The sad, sad game 
Mad game 
Just to say loves' not enough 
If it can't be true 
Oh, you can tell those lies baby 
but you're only fooling you 
Can you feel 
I know those feelings ain't real 
Then you better stop trying 
Or you're gonna play crying 
Stop trying 
Or you're gonna play crying 
Stop trying 
That is the game 
Sad, Sad game 
Mad game 
Sad game

You used to lure me in 
Oh, I've found the ways 
Oh, why it had to be 
My'd own denial and so afraid

Oh, free of all the chains, we have together

Tell ya, honey, how it feels 
I've been dreamin' floatin' down stream

Whole lotta lover, keepin' undercover 
Never knowin' where you been 
You've been fadin', always out paradin' 
Keep the touch with mama kin 
 
You've always got your tail on the wag 
Stittin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon 
You act like a perpetual drag 
You better check it out or someday soon 
You're gonna climb back on the wagon 
 
It ain't easy livin'like you wanna 
It's so hard to find peace of mind (Yes, it is) 
The way I see it 
You got to say sheeit 
But don't forget to drop me a line 
 
Bald as an egg et eighteen 
And workin' for your daddy's just a drag 
You still stuff your mouth with those beans 
You better check it out or someday soon 
You're gonna climb back on the wagon

Yo' family life is one big pain 
When ya gonna move to the city 
To the city where it all began 
You gotta move you gotta move 
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma 
You gotta move 
You stole your mama's car 
And your daddy's plastic credit card 
You're sixteen and you can't get a job 
You're not goin' very far 
You're always ridin' with the teachers and the police 
This life is much too insane 
When are you, you gonna move to the city 
To the city where it all began 
You gotta move you gotta move 
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma 
You gotta move 
To the city 
With the real nitty gritty 
Aw child ain't it a pity 
Sometimes it gets too shitty 
Come on and hit me 
You're on the streets and it ain't so pretty 
At least you get ta do what you please 
You do what you gotta do for the money 
At times you end up on your knees 
I'm always buyin'with local desert junkies 
This city life is one big pain 
But you, you had to move to the city

And you do your coke for free

Sowin' all your wild oats 
In another's luxuries

Maybe Thursday you can sleep 
But school starts much too early 
And this hotel wasn't free 
So party till your connection calls 
Honey I'll return the key 
Well, well, well you just can't tell 
Well, well, well my Michelle 
Well, well, well you never can tell 
Well, well, well my Michelle 
Everyone needs love 
You know that it's true 
Someday you'll find someone 
That'll fall in love with you 
But oh the time it takes 
When you're all alone 
Someday you'll find someone 
That you can call your own 
But till then ya better... 
Now you're clean 
And so discreet 
I won't say a word 
But most of all this song is true 
Case you haven't heard 
So c'mon and stop your cryin' 
'Cause we both know money burns 
Honey don't stop tryin;

I got a new rose, I got it good 
Yes, I knew that I always would 
I can't stop to mess around 
I got a brand new rose in town 
See the sun, see the sunny skies 
Don't get too close, it'll burn your eyes 
Don't you run away that way 
Come back another day 
(Chorus) 
I never thought this could happen to me 
I'm a strange washing machine 
I never served somebody this sane 
I'll never, never, never be too late

Smellin' sweet, sweet perfume 
The color faded the petals died 
Down in the city no one cried 
In the streets garbage lies 
Protected by a million flies 
The roaches so big you know that they got bones 
Moved in and made a tenement home I said 
(Chorus:) 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
I'm not a nice boy! 
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean 
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene 
She met the man and she did the smack 
She paid the price layin' flat on her back 
Wanted so bad just to please the boys 
They ended up just being a toy 
Played so hard burned her life away 
Lies were told no promises made 
You know 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
I'm not a nice boy! 
And I never was 
Young and fresh when she hit town 
Hot for kicks just to get around 
But now she lays in a filthy room 
She kills the pain with a fuck and a spoon 
In the streets garbage lies 
Protected by a million flies 
You know the roaches so big 
You know that they got bones 
Moved in and made a tenement home

Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll

One bad mother 
Got a rattlesnake suitcase

Said I'm a mean machine 
Been drinkin' gasoline

In a nine live cat 
I got a dog eat dog smile 
I got a Molotov cocktail

I smoke my cigarette with style 
An I can tell you honey

I can see a love restrained 
But darlin' when I hold you 
Don't you know I feel the same? 
'Because nothing' last forever 
And we both know hearts can change 
And it's hard to hold a candle 
In the cold November rain 
We've been through this such a long long time 
Just tryin' to kill the pain 
But lovers always come and lovers always go 
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today 
Walking away 
If we could take the time to lay it on the line 
I could rest my head 
Just knowin' that you were mine 
All mine 
So if you want to love me 
Then darlin' don't refrain 
Or I'll just end up walkin' 
In the cold November rain 
Do you need some time on your own? 
Do you need some time all alone? 
Everybody needs some time on their own 
Don't you know you need some time all alone? 
I know it's hard to keep an open heart 
When even friends seem out to harm you 
But if you could heal a broken heart 
Wouldn't time be out to charm you 
Sometimes I need some time on my own 
Sometimes I need some time all alone 
Everybody needs some time on their own 
Don't you know you need some time all alone? 
And when your fears subside 
And shadows still remain 
I know that you can love me 
When there's no one left to blame 
So never mind the darkness 
We still can find a way 
Nothing lasts forever 
Even a cold November rain 
Don't ya think that you need somebody? 
Don't ya think that you need someone? 
Everybody needs somebody

You're not the only one</field>

Just knowin' that you were mine 
All mine 
So if you want to love me 
then darlin' don't refrain 
Or I'll just end up walkin' 
In the cold November rain 
So I'll just keep on walking 
Again and again and again and again and 
again and again and again and again and 
I know, I'll just keep on walking 
Again and again and again and again and 
again and again and again and again 
So if you want to love me 
Then darling don't refrain 
Or I'll just keep on walking

Right in your mind 
You live in a shade of 
Believe your oppression 
Believe your enslavery and drain out your soul 
What can I do when there's so many liars 
That crawl through your veins 
Like millions of spiders 
That seek out their victims 
And ruin the wiser 
Watch out 
Gotcha 
Oh my god 
I can't deny this 
I've been taught just to kill and fight this 
To bury it deeper where no one can find it 
Like nobody wanted to know 
So give it away 
Like they're not gonna fuck you 
How long can you beg them 
To come back and haunt you 
To burn past your feelings 
And cause you to suffer 
You're starting to bleed 
They don't give cover 
Before its too late 
What will you offer 
In way of a healing 
I'm so confused, abused, misused 
Oh my god 
I can't deny this 
I've been taught just to kill and fight this 
To bury it deeper where no one can find it 
Like nobody wanted to know 
Ooh, if it opens your eyes 
This is better than a strong compromise 
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle 
If only you had let me know 
Ooh, if it opens your eyes 
This is better than any less compromise 
I was willing to be lost in the shadows 
If only you had let me know 
And they won't give in 
Cause they know what they're after 
A kick in the face 
Like its all that would matter 
Ohh 
Oh my god 
I can't deny this 
I've been taught just to murder and fight this 
To bury it deeper where no one can find it 
'Cause nobody wanted to know 
Ooh, if it opens your eyes 
This is better than a good compromise 
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle 
If only you had let me know 
Ooh, well it's on with the show 
Like you're tied down on the ocean 
The waves already set in motion 
The only one in the game that's lost is you</field>

Sometime to get away 
I needed some peace of mind 
Some peace of mind that'll stay 
So I thumbed it 
Down to sixth and L.A. 
Maybe your greyhound 
Could be my way 
Police and niggers 
That's right 
Get out of my way 
Don't need to buy none of your 
Goldchains today 
I don't need no bracelets 
Clamped in front of my back 
Just need my ticket till then 
Won't you cut me some slack

You're one in a million 
Yeah, that's what you are 
You're one in a million, babe 
You are a shooting star 
Maybe someday we'll see you 
Before you make us cry 
You know we tried to reach you 
But you were much to high 
Much to high 
Much to high 
Much to high 
Immigrants and faggots 
They make no sense to me 
They come to our country 
And think they'll do as they please 
Like start some mini Iran 
Or spread some fucking disease 
They talk so many goddamn ways 
It's all greek to me 
Well some say I'm lazy 
And others say that's just me 
Some say I'm crazy 
I guess I'll always be 
But it's been such a long time 
Since I knew right from wrong 
It's all the means to an end, I, 
I keep on movin' along 
You're one in a million 
Yeah, that's what you are 
You're one in a million, babe 
You are a shooting star 
Maybe someday we'll see you 
Before you make us cry 
You know we tried to reach you

Much to high, much to high 
Much to high 
Radicals and racists 
Don't point your finger at me 
I'm a small town white boy 
Just tryin' to make ends meet 
Don't need your religion 
Don't watch that much TV 
Just makin' my livin', baby, 
Well that's enough for me 
You're one in a million 
Yeah, that's what you are 
You're one in a million, babe

Well you can always find 
a place to go 
If you can keep your sanity

They won't touch me 
They scream and yell 
And fight all night 
You can't tell me 
I lose my head 
I close my eyes 
They won't touch me 
'Cause I got somethin' 
I been buildin' up inside 
For so fuckin' long 
They're out ta get me 
They won't catch me 
I'm fuckin' innocent 
They won't break me 
Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin' 
Sometimes it's harder to leave 
And everytime you think you know just what you're doin' 
That's when your troubles exceed 
They push me in a corner 
Just to get me to fight but 
They won't touch me 
They preach and yell

They won't catch me 
Cause I'm innocent 
They won't break me 
No, no, no... 
Let's see you try 
Some people got a chip on their shoulder 
An some would say it was me 
But I didn't buy that fifth of whisky 
That you gave me 
So I'd be quick to disagree 
They're out ta get me 
They won't catch me 
I'm fuckin' innocent 
They won't break me 
They're out to get me 
They won't catch me

I'd have another cigarette but I can't see 
Tell me who you're gonna believe

Take me home, yeah 
Take me down to the paradise city

so far away, so far away

Now he's a court jester with a broken heart 
He said- turn me around and take me back to the start 
I must be losin' my mind- "Are you blind?"

Was a time when I wasn't sure 
But you set my mind at ease 
There is no doubt you're in my heart now 
Said, woman, take it slow 
And it'll work itself out fine 
All we need is just a little patience 
Said, sugar, make it slow 
And we'll come together fine 
All we need is just a little patience (Patience) 
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone 
If I can't have you right now I'll wait, dear 
Sometimes I get so tense 
But I can't speed up the time 
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider 
Said, woman, take it slow 
And things will be just fine 
You and I'll just use a little patience 
Said, sugar, take the time

You and I've got what it takes to make it

Oh, I'll never break it

Just a little patience, yeah

I've been walking the streets at night 
Just trying to get it right 
(Need some patience, yeah) 
It's hard to see with so many around 
You know, I don't like being stuck in the crowd 
(Could use some patience, yeah) 
And the streets don't change but, baby, the names 
I ain't got time for the game 
(Gotta have some patience, yeah) 
'Cause I need you, yeah 
Yeah, but I need you

Oh, I need you (Just a little patience)

Who's sorry now old timer

Scroungin' for change 
To put some money in you pocket 
My how scratch does burn 
Laughin' at the suckers as you pissed it away 
But I got the time and I got the muscle 
I got the need to lie it all on the line 
I ain't afraid of you smoke screen hustle

Goddmamn it's a perfect crime 
Mother fucker it's a perfect crime 
I said it's perfect 
Keep the demons down 
And drag the skeletons out 
I got a blind man followin' me in chains 
I said he's fun to watch 
When the world has stopped 
An I think he's got somethin' to say 
"You wanna fuck with me, don't fuck with me 
'Cause I'm what you'll be so don't fuck with me 
If you had better sense 
You'd step aside from the bad side of me 
Don't fuck wit'da bad side o' me 
Stay away from the bad side o' me 
Don't fuck wit'da bad side"

Ostracized but thats all right 
I was thinkin' about somethig' myself

Said it's better if you locked'em away 
Runnin' through the visions

I know this chick she lives down on melrose 
She ain't satisfied without some pain 
Friday night is goin' up inside her...again 
Well crack the whip 
'cause that bitch is just insane 
I'm serious 
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down 
She's pretty tied up and you can ride her 
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down 
I can't tell you she's the right one 
Oh no, oh no, oh no 
Once there was this rock n' roll band 
Rollin' on the streets 
Time went by and it became a joke 
We just needed more and more fulfilling... 
Uh-huh 
Time went by and it all went up in smoke 
But check it out 
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down 
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her 
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down 
Ohh I can't tell you she's the right one 
Oh no, oh no, oh no 
Once you made that money it costs more now 
It might cost a lot more than you'd think 
I just found a million dollars 
That someone forgot 
It's days like this that push me o'er the brinks 
Cool and stressing 
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down 
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her

The envy of youth 
Why would they 
Tell me to please those 
That laugh in my face 
When all of the reasons 
They've taught us 
Fall over themselves 
To give way 
It's not a question 
Whether my heart is true 
Streamlined 
I had to pull thought 
Look for a new 
Beginning on you 
Oh I got a message for you 
Up and away 
It's what I gotta do 
Forgive what you have 
For what you might lose 
What would you say 
If I told you that I'm to blame 
And what would you do 
If I had to deny your name 
Where would you go if I told you 
I love you 
And then walked away 
N' who should I turn to 
If not for the ones 
You could not save 
I told you when I found you 
If there were doubts you 
Should be careful and unafraid 
Now 
They surround you 
And all that amounts to 
Is love that you fed by 
Perversion and pain 
So if my affections 
Are misunderstood 
And you decide 
I'm up 
To no good 
Don't ask me to 
Enjoy them 
Just for you 
Ask yourself 
Why I would choose 
To prostitute myself 
To live with fortune and shame 
Oh yeah

have turned to the hearts 
Of the ones 
That you would not save

            <field name="lyrics">I'll take a nicotine, caffeine, sugar fix 
Jesus don't ya get tired of turnin' tricks 
But when your innocence dies 
You'll find the blues 
Seems all our heroes were born to lose 
Just walkin' through time 
You believe this heat 
Another empty house another dead end street 
Gonna rest my bones an sit for a spell 
This side of heaven this close to hell 
Right next door to hell 
Why don't you write a letter to me yeah 
I said i'm right next door to hell 
An so many eyes are on me 
Right next door to hell 
I got nowhere else to be 
Right next door to hell 
Feels like the walls are closing in on me 
My mama never really said much to me 
She was much to young and scared ta be 
Hell "freud" might say that's what i need 
But all i really ever get is greed 
An most my friends they feel the same 
Hell we don't even have ourselves to blame 
But times are hard and thrills are cheaper 
As your arms get shorter 
Your pockets get deeper 
Right next door to hell 
Why don't you write a letter to me 
I said i'm right next door to hell 
An so many eyes are on me 
Right next door to hell 
I never thought this is where i'd be 
But i'm right next door to hell 
Thinkin' time'll stand still for me 
Fuck you 
Bitch 
Not bad kids just stupid ones 
Yeah thought we'd own the world 
An gettin' used was havin' fun 
I said we're not sad kids just lucid ones eah 
Flowin' through life not collectin' anyone 
So much out there 
Still so much to see 
Time's too much to handle 
Time's too much for me 
It drives me up the walls 
Drives me out of my mind 
Can you tell me what this means...huh?</field>

I can say these things to you 
'Cause I can turn on anyone 
Just like I turned on you 
I got a tongue like a razor 
A sweet switchblade knife 
And I can do you favors 
But then you'll do whatever I like 
Here I am 
And you're a Rocket Queen 
I might be a little young 
But honey I ain't naive 
Here I am 
And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah 
I might be too much 
But honey you're a bit obscene 
I've seen everything imaginable 
Pass before these eyes 
I've had everything that's tangible 
Honey you'd be surprised 
I'm a sexual innuendo 
In this burned out paradise 
If you turn me on to anything 
You better turn me on tonight 
Here I am 
And you're a Rocket Queen 
I might be a little young 
But honey I ain't naive

And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah 
I might be too much 
But honey you're a bit obscene 
I see you standing 
Standing on your own 
It's such a lonely place for you 
For you to be 
If you need a shoulder 
Or if you need a friend 
I'll be here standing 
Until the bitter end 
No one needs the sorrow 
No one needs the pain 
I hate to see you 
Walking out there 
Out in the rain 
So don't chastise me 
Or think I, I mean you harm 
Like those that take you 
Leave you strung out 
Much too far 
Baby, yeah 
Don't ever leave me 
Say you'll always be there 
All I ever wanted 
Was for you 
To know that I care</field>

Don't you try to stop us now 
I just refuse 
Ohhh 
Don't you try to stop us now 
'Cause I just won't let you... 
Sometimes I feel like 
The world is on top of me 
Breaking me down with an endless monotony 
Sometimes I feel like 
There's nothing that's stopping me 
All things are possible, I am unstoppable 
Some may convince you 
No one can break through 
I'm here to tell you you're worth 
More than they tell you 
Ohhh 
Don't you try to stop us now 
I just refuse 
Ohhh 
Don't you try to stop us now 
'Cause I just won't let you... 
Sometimes I feel like 
My life's a catastrophe 
Can't understand why 
It seems like it has to be 
Sometimes I feel like 
It's all opened up for me 
Nothing's impossible 
I am unconquerable 
No one can make you 
Do what they want to 
You know you're stronger than 
The lies that they tell you 
Ohhh 
Don't you try to stop us now 
(I'd give anything to know) 
I just refuse 
Ohhh 
Don't you try to stop us now 
(I would have never made it so far) 
'Cause I just won't let you... 
Believe in yourself 
Some may convince you 
No one can break through 
You know you're stronger

Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't wait here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
An now you're blowin' smoke 
I think you're one big joke 
Me...I gotta lot ta learn 
An I'm still waitin' for the heads to turn 
You say I walk a line 
Fuck they move it every time 
You walk a mile in my shoes 
And then you tell me 'bout singin' the blues 
You get what you pay for 
An freedom's real high priced 
An while you're rippin' off children 
Somebody's fuckin' your wife 
It's never made a difference 
It's only how you survive 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't wait here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
An now you ask me why 
I said it's do or die 
I'll stick it right in your face 
And then I'll put you In your motherfuckin' place 
An you...you can suck my ass 
An I think it's so low class 
Me...I'm just so concerned 
I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn 
Ooooh you want a confrontation 
I'll give you every fuckin' chance 
With your verbal masturbation 
Me...I just like to dance 
How's that for provocation 
I'm just makin' a stance 
An I'm tired of the frustration 
Of livin' inside of your lies 
And I'm wired on indignation 
I said somebody's got to die 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't wait here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
Listen motherfucker 
You're about to pay your dues 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
If you're goin' up against me 
Then you know you're gonna lose 
I know 
I know (there's ways - that we - can find) 
I know 
I know 
You think anyone with an I.q 
over fifteen 
Would believe your shit...fuckhead

Get your head down in the sky

Parasitis demons sucking acid through your heart

I won't give in 
To hell with the pressure 
I'm not cavin' in 
You know that I 
Got under your skin 
You sold your soul 
But I won't let you win 
You talk too much 
You say I do 
Difference is nobody cares about you 
You've got all the answers 
You know everything 
Why nobody asked you 
It's a mystery to me 
I'm sorry for you 
Not sorry for me 
You don't know who in the hell to 
Or not to believe 
I'm sorry for you 
Not sorry for me 
You don't know who you can trust now 
Or you should believe 
You should believe 
You don't know who you can trust now 
Or you should believe 
You close your eyes 
All well and good 
I'll kick you ass 
Like I said that I would 
You tell them stories they'd rather believe 
Use and confuse them 
They're numb and naïve 
The truth is the truth hurts 
Don't you agree 
It's harder to live 
With the truth about you 
Than to live with 
The lies about me 
Nobody owes you 
Not one goddamn thing 
You know where to put your 
Just shut up and sing 
I'm sorry for you 
Not sorry for me 
You don't know who in the hell to 
Or not to believe 
I'm sorry for you 
Not sorry for me 
You chose to hurt those that love you 
And not set them free 
Not set them free 
You chose to hurt those that love you 
And won't set them free 
You don't need 
Anybody else to be 
Sorry for you 
You've got no heart 
You can't see 
All that you've done for me 
I know the reasons 
You tear me apart

            <field name="lyrics">All the love in the world couldn't save you 
All the innocence inside 
You know I tried so hard to make you 
To make you change your mind 
And it hurts too much to see you 
And how you left yourself behind 
You know I wouldn't want to be you 
Now there's a hell I can't describe 
So now I wander through my day 
Trying to find my way 
Still these feelings that I felt 
I saved for you and no one else 
And though as long as this road seems 
I know its called the street of dreams 
But that's not stardust on my feet 
It leaves a taste that's bittersweet 
That's called the blues 
I don't know just what I should do 
Everywhere I go I see you 
Although its what you planned, 
this much is true, oh oh 
What I thought was beautiful 
don't live inside of you, anymore... 
I don't know just what I should do 
Everywhere I go I see you 
You know it's what we planned, 
this much is true, oh oh 
What I thought was beautiful 
don't live inside of you, anymore... 
What this means to me 
is more than I know you believe 
What I thought was you now 
Has cost more that it should for me 
What I thought was true before 
Were lies I couldn't see 
What I thought was beautiful 
Was only memories...</field>

It ain't perfect, especially the fast bits, but i 
think it's a good attempt at it 
I think Finck 
(no pun intended) is, along with Buckethead, one of 
the most under-rated guitarists around today, 
this solo helps make me think (again, no pun intended) 
that.

Reminds me of childhood memories 
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
Now and then when I see her face 
She takes me away to that special place 
And if I stare too long 
I'd probably break down and cry 
Oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Sweet love of mine 
She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
As if they thought of rain 
I hate to look into those eyes 
And see an ounce of pain 
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
Where as a child I'd hide 
And pray for the thunder 
And the rain to quietly pass me by 
Oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm a man of wealth and taste 
I've been around for a long, long year 
Stole many man's soul and faith 
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 
Had his moment of doubt and pain 
Made damn sure that Pilate 
Washed his hands and sealed his fate 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game 
I stuck around St 
Petersberg 
When I saw it was a time for a change 
I killed the Czar and his ministers 
Anastasia screamed in vain 
I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank 
When the Blitzkrieg raged 
And the bodies stank 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah 
What's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah 
I watched with glee 
As your kings and queens 
Fought for ten decades 
For the Gods they made 
I shouted out 
"Who killed the Kennedys?" 
When after all 
It was you and me 
So let me please introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
And I laid traps for troubadors 
Who get killed before they reached Bombay 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's confusing you 
Is just the nature of my game 
Just as every cop is a criminal 
And all the sinners saints 
As heads is tails 
Just call me Lucifer 
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 
So if you meet me 
Have some courtesy 
Have some sympathy, and some taste 
Use all your well-learned politics 
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, um baby, get down 
Woo, who 
Oh yeah, get on down 
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah! 
Tell me baby, what's my name 
Tell me honey, baby guess my name 
Tell me baby, what's my name 
I tell you one time, you're to blame 
Ooo, who 
Ooo, who 
Ooo, who 
Ooo, who, who 
Ooo, who, who

Your friends they aren't at home 
Everybody's gone to the garden 
As you look into the trees 
You can look but you don't see 
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden 
Everybody's there but you don't seem to care 
What's it with you man, and this garden 
Turned into my worst phobia, 
A crazy man's utopia 
If you're lost no one can show ya, 
But it sure was glad to know ya 
Only poor boys take a chance, 
On the garden's song and dance 
Feel her flowers as they wrap around, 
But only smart boys do without 
You can find it all inside 
No need to wrestle with your pride 
No you ain't losing your mind 
You're just in the garden 
They can lead you to yourself 
Or you can throw it on the shelf 
But you know you can look inside 
For the garden 
I wasn't really scared 
Lost my virginity there, 
To a gypsy with blond hair 
But now no one seems to care 
Like a mouse inside a maze, 
Been wandering round 4 daze 
With a smile upon my face, 
I never wanna leave this place 
Only poor boys take a chance, 
On the garden's song and dance 
Feel her flowers as they wrap around, 
But only smart boys do without 
Turned into my worst phobia, 
A crazy man's utopia 
If you're lost no one can show ya, 
But it sure was glad to know ya 
Bye bye 
So long, bye bye 
It's glad to know ya 
Bye bye 
Bye bye

I've looked under tables 
I've tried to find the key 
To fifty million fables 
They call me The Seeker 
I've been searching low and high 
I won't get to get what I'm after 
Till the day I die 
I asked Bobby Dylan 
I asked The Beatles 
I asked Timothy Leary 
But he couldn't help me either 
They call me The Seeker 
I've been searching low and high 
I won't get to get what I'm after 
Till the day I die 
People tend to hate me 
'Cause I never smile 
As I ransack their homes 
They wanna shake my hand 
Focusing on nowhere 
Investigating miles 
I'm a seeker 
I'm a really desperate man 
I won't get to get what I'm after 
Till the day I die 
I learned how to raise my voice in anger 
Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile? 
I'm happy when life's good and when it's bad I cry 
I've got values but I don't know how or why 
I'm looking for me 
You're looking for you 
We're looking in at each other 
And we don't know what to do

Broken glass and cigarettes, 
Writing on the wall, 
It was a bargain for the summer, 
And I thought I had it all. 
I was the one who gave you everything, 
The one who took the fall, 
You were the one who would do anything, 
The one who can't recall. 
Where she was while she was sleeping, 
In another woman's bed, 
Or the doctors or the lawyers, 
Or a stranger that she met. 
If there's nothing I can gain from this, 
Or anything at all, 
It'd be the knowledge that ya gave me, 
When I thought I'd heard it all. 
It was a long time for you, 
It was a long time for me, 
It'd be a long time for anyone, 
But looks like it's meant to be. 
Social class and registers, 
Cocaine in the hall, 
All the way from california, 
On the way to your next call 
To those non-negotiations, 
(to simulate a call) 
All the bad of learning evils and 
Your ways around the laws 
That keep you locked up sitting pretty, 
On a pedestal of fear 
And now you're sleeping like an angel, 
To any man who'd fit in 
If there's something I can make of this, 
Or anything at all, 
It'd be the devil hates a loser and 
You thought you had it all. 
It was a wrong time for you, 
It was a wrong time for me, 
It was the wrong time for everyone 
But looks like I've got to see for myself 
If I could go back in time to the place 
In my soul, there all alone, 
Lonely tear drops, 
Ooh, are calling you. 
But I don't wanna know it now, 
'cause knowing you it won't it change a damn thing. 
But there was a time. 
(solo) 
Yeah, there was a time, 
Didn't wanna know it all, 
Didn't wanna know it all and 
I don't wanna know it now, 
Yeah, there was a time, 
Didn't wanna know it all, 
Didn't wanna know it all and 
I don't wanna know it now, 
(solo) 
Oh, I would do anything for you, 
There was a time, 
I would do anything for you, 
Oh, I would do anything for you, 
There was a time.

She wouldn't say goodbye 
But then it seems that I 
Had seen it in her eyes. 
And it might not be wise 
I'd still have to try 
With all the love I have inside 
I can't deny 
I just can't let it die 
Cause her heart's just like mine 
And she holds her pain inside 
So if you ask me why 
She wouldn't say goodbye 
I know somewhere inside 
There is a special light 
Still shining bright 
And even on the darkest night 
She can't deny 
So if she's somewhere near me 
I hope to God she hears me 
There's no one else 
Could ever make me feel 
I'm so alive 
I hoped she'd never leave me 
Please God you must believe me 
I've searched the universe 
And found myself 
Within' her eyes 
No matter how I try 
They say it's all a lie 
So what's the use of my 
Confessions to a crime 
Of passions that won't die 
In my heart 
So if she's somewhere near me 
I hope to God she hears me 
There's no one else 
Could ever make me feel 
I'm so alive 
I hoped she'd never leave me 
Please God you must believe me 
I've searched the universe 
And found myself

So if she's somewhere near me

There's no one else 
Could ever make me feel

I hoped she'd never leave me 
Please God you must believe me 
I've searched the universe 
And found myself 
Within' her eyes 
And now I don't know why 
She wouldn't say goodbye 
It just might be that I 
Had seen it in her eyes 
And now it seems that I 
Gave up my ghost of pride 
I'll never say goodbye</field>

Big disgrace 
Somebody better put you back into your place 
We will, we will rock you 
Sing it 
We will, we will rock you 
Everybody 
We will, we will rock you 
We will, we will rock you</field>

We got fun and games 
We got everything you want 
Honey we know the names 
We are the people that can find 
Whatever you may need 
If you got the money, honey 
We got your disease 
In the jungle 
Welcome to the Jungle 
Watch it bring it to your 
Knees, knees 
I wanna watch you bleed 
Welcome to the jungle 
We take it day by day 
If you want it you're gonna bleed 
But it's the price you pay 
And you a very sexy girl 
That's very hard to please 
You can taste the bright lights 
But you won't get them for free 
In the jungle 
Welcome to the jungle 
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine 
I, I wanna hear you scream 
Welcome to the jungle 
It gets worse here everyday 
Ya learn to live like an animal 
In the jungle where we play 
If you got a hunger for what you see 
You'll take it eventually 
You can have anything you want 
But you better not take it from me 
In the jungle 
Welcome to the Jungle 
Watch it bring it to your 
To your knees, knees 
I wanna watch you bleed 
When you're high you never 
Ever want to come down, so down, so down, so down, yeah! 
You know where you are? 
You're in the jungle baby 
You're gonna die 
In the jungle 
Welcome to the jungle 
Watch it bring you to your 
Knees, knees 
In the jungle 
Welcome to the jungle 
Feel my, my, my, serpentine 
In the jungle 
Welcome to the jungle 
Watch it bring you to your 
Knees, knees 
Down in the jungle 
Welcome to the jungle 
Watch it bring you to your 
It's gonna bring you down

there was so many things 
I was never told 
Now that I startin' to learn 
I feel I'm growin' old 
'cause yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Old pictures that I'll always see 
Time just fades the pages 
In my book of memories 
Prayers in my pocket 
And no hand in destiny 
I'll keep on movin' along 
With no time to plan my feet 
'cause yesterday's got nothing for me 
Old pictures that I'll always see 
Some things could be better 
If we'd all just let them be 
Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Got nothin' for me 
Yesterday 
there were so many things 
I was never shown 
Suddenly this time I found 
I'm on the streets and I'm all alone 
Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Old pictures that I'll always see 
I ain't got time 
to reminisce old novelties 
Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Yesterday's got nothin' for me

I'll just see you along as I sing you this song 
Time can pass slowly,

You day's been numbered 
And I've read your last page 
You was just a temporary lover 
Honey you ain't the first 
Lots of others came before you woman 
Said but you been the worst 
Sa' you been the worst 
So goodbye to you girl 
So long, farewell 
I can't hear you cryin'

And when I'm gone 
Big deal, I'm still alone 
 
Feel so restless, I am 
Beat my head against a pole 
Try to knock some sense 
Down in my bones 
 
And even though I don't show 
The scars are so old 
 
You can't put your arms around a memory 
You can't put your arms around a memory 
You can't put your arms around a memory 
Don't try, don't try 
 
You're just a bastard kid 
And you got no name 
Could you live with me 
We're one and the same 
 
And even though I don't show 
The stars are so old 
 
You can't put your arms around a memory 
You can't put your arms around a memory 
You can't put your arms around a memory

And I'll rip your heart in two. 
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed. 
I'll be out the door before you wake, 
It's nothin' new to you. 
'cause I think we've seen that movie too. 
'cause you could be mine. 
But you're way out of line. 
With your bitch slap rappin' 
And your cocaine tongue you get nothin' done. 
I said you could be mine. 
Now hollydays come, and then they go. 
It's nothin' new today. 
Collect another memory. 
When I come home late at night 
Don't ask me where I've been. 
Just count your stars I'm home again. 
'cause you could be mine. 
But you're way out of line. 
With your bitch slap rappin 
And your cocaine tongue you get nothin' done. 
I said you could be mine.

You could be mine. 
You could be mine. 
You could be mine. 
You could be mine. 
You've gone sketchin' too many times. 
Why don't ya give it a rest. 
Why must you find another reason to cry. 
While you're breakin' down my back 
N' I been racin' out my brain. 
It don't matter how we make it 
'cause it always ends the same. 
You can push it for more mileage 
But your flaps r' wearin' thin. 
And I could sleep on it' til morning 
But this nightmare never ends. 
Don't forget to call my lawyers 
with ridiculous demands. 
An you can take the pity so far 
But it's more than I can stand. 
'cause this couchtrip's gettin' older 
Tell me how long has it been. 
'cause 5 years is forever and you haven't grown up yet. 
You could be mine. 
But you're way out of line. 
With your bitch slap rappin' 
And your cocaine tongue you get nuthin' done. 
I said you could be, you should be, you could be mine.

            <field name="lyrics">I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me? 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be 
How can I sleep at night, there's a war inside my head? 
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed 
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed 
Cause I am a lion and you are dead 
 
Here's a story of everything we'll ever be 
You can hide but some of us can never leave 
And if you go I don't need those little things 
They remind me of all our little dreams 
Can you hear the words, all I can say? 
We can watch the world even if they walk away 
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today 
You were born a lion and a lion you will stay 
 
I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me? 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be 
 
Remember an army, of all those little kids 
Living life like they only get a little bit 
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle and 
I'd rather die, won't watch you giving in 
I'm sorry daughter but your father's not the same 
I can look into your eyes and I'll swear that I will change 
But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I stay 
You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain 
After all, only so much we can say 
Words can lose their meaning, once you walk away 
Promise that you'll love me, watch me as I fade 
I'll give you all those things that these liars never gave 
The hands on the clock, and the things we cannot change 
Tear it all to pieces, and take back what I made 
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save 
Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay 
 
I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me? 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be 
 
Hey! 
I never meant to let go 
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know 
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home, of a pretty home, of a pretty home 
Hey! 
I never meant to let go 
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know 
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home, of a pretty home, of a pretty home 
Hey! 
 
I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me? 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep

The bottom of the bottle is my only friend, 
I think I'll slit my wrists again 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
A stomach full of pills didn't work again, 
I'll put a bullet in my head 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
Gone too far and yeah I'm gone again, 
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends, 
I'm sitting on the edge with my 2 best friends, 
Ones a bottle of pills, ones a bottle of gin, 
I'm 20 stories up, yeah I'm up at the top, 
I'll polish off this bottle, now it's pushing me off, 
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft, 
I bet my momma found my letter 
Now shes calling the cops, 
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it, 
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance, 
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent, 
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is, 
I've been trying too long, with too dull of a knife, 
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice, 
I never bought a suit before in my life, 
But when you go to meet God 
You know you wanna look nice. 
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow 
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend, 
I think I'll slit my wrists again 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
A stomach full of pills didn't work again, 
I'll put a bullet in my head 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
We hit the sky, there goes the light 
No more sun, why's it always night? 
When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream, 
When you can't dream, well, what's life mean? 
We feel a little pity, but don't empathize 
The old are getting older, watch a young man die, 
A Mother and a Son and someone you know 
Smile at each other and realize you don't, 
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised, 
What happened to the Father, who swore he'd stay? 
I didn't know 'cause you didn't say, 
Now Momma feels guilt, yeah Momma feels pain, 
When you were young, you never thought you'd die, 
Found that you could but too scared to try, 
You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye, 
Climb to the roof to see if you could fly. 
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow, 
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow. 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend, 
I think I'll slit my wrists again 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
A stomach full of pills didn't work again, 
I'll put a bullet in my head 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky, 
Like a bird so high, 
Oh I might just try, 
I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky, 
Like a bird so high, 
Oh I might just try,

Brass knuckles in the back of the car,

You cowards can't, never will, don't even try to 
pursue it. 
I took the chance, I payed the bill, 
I nearly died for this music. 
You make me wanna run around, pulling my guns out and 
shit, 
Your tempting me to run my mouth, and call you out on 
this bitch, 
I heard the reason you got to beater to believe any of 
this, 
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump 
off a bridge, 
What? You can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit? 
What? You think I just got lucky and didn't work for 
this shit? 
Bitch 
I've been working at this ever since I was a 
kid, 
I played a million empty shows to only family and 
friends. 
What kind of person gets disembanded and deserves to 
get big? 
I hate to be that person when my verse comes out of 
the kid's lips. 
That shits as worse as it gets.

We are breaking everything, r-rowdy like a classroom, 
Pack of wolves, 
'Cause we don't follow the rules, 
And when you're running your mouth, 
Our razor blades come out, 
Because its nothing in my mouth except my dick and 
what I spit, 
So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots 
talking shit, 
Speaking of fags, already wrap with the drag, 
We killed him and then we stuffed his body in the 
Cadillac. 
Why you always pressin? 
You know I'm never stressing,

J-Johny to my left, 
Got Phantom and the rest, 
Who are down there at the west, 
A grew up by drive-by's and L.A gangsta's, 
So what the fuck do you know about being a gangsta? 
What the fuck do you know about being in danger? 
You ain't doing this, so you know you're just talking

I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out my chest. 
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find. 
But maybe I won’t, because I left it all behind. 
Now I’m stuck with this, and that’ll never change 
Always a part of me, until the very last day. 
Where to go from here? What road to travel on? 
I spent my whole life choosing, and I always chose wrong. 
Will I try to have the will to be alive? 
Will I try because I’ve never seen the light? 
Blow it to the ground and it’s now you see, 
You spent your whole life taking the best of me 
Where’d you go? Where’s your home? 
How’d you end up all alone? 
Can you hear me now? 
There’s no light, there’s no sound. 
Hard to breathe, when you’re underground. 
Can you hear me now? Hear me now 
How low can I keep pretending to be? 
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me. 
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees. 
A man of many words, but a man of few deeds. 
Walking these streets, so absent of hope. 
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home. 
Lend him a hand, then we’re walking the way. 
Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame. 
So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight. 
When you wake up, you know it’s darker than last night. 
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by. 
Born to walk away, been walking my whole life. 
Where’d you go? Where’s your home? 
How’d you end up all alone? 
Can you hear me now? 
There’s no light, there’s no sound. 
Hard to breathe, when you’re underground. 
Can you hear me now? Hear me now 
Look into my eyes and I see 
What do I see? Nothing at all 
Take another look around me 
What do I see? Nothing at all 
Where’d you go? Where’s your home? 
How’d you end up all alone? 
Can you hear me now? 
There’s no light, there’s no sound. 
Hard to breathe, when you’re underground. 
Can you hear me now? Hear me now 
Can you hear me? Hear me now</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Hold on, holy ghost 
Go on, hold me close 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
We come from a world of oblivion bad dreams 
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstrings 
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things 
I'm really not a mad man, the voices keep asking 
Born with a soul that don't wanna be saved 
Every time I look around I see what a fiend made 
Every time I die, I hope they're diggin' up my grave 
An undead one like the flag that I wave 
I'm not afraid to cross on this cocaine sickness 
I'm not afraid to die, let the good book witness 
An undead one like the flag that I wave 
The day of the dead and you're on our hit list 
So come all you misfits! 
Bitch, you're on our hit list! 
Chorus 
Hold on, holy ghost 
Go on, hold me close 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
So long to the ones you know 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
This is exactly what has to be done 
It happens so gradualy 
It's like I magically happened 
To be this phantom that candidly 
Lets his dagger cut jaggedly 
While you're gaspin' so rapidly 
While you gag on this rag 
I see you laughing so happly 
It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark 
I'll just wait here to swallow this soul and tear you apart 
And I've already started, there ain't no savin' your heart 
This is the day of the dead, this is no day in the park 
Here I come, here I come, down your guns and crossbows 
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones 
The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow 
When I'm done, I ain't done, 'cause it's hell that follows 
Now get ready for sorrow 
'cause it's hell that follows 
Chorus 
Hold on, holy ghost 
Go on, hold me close 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
So long to the ones you know 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
When the ashes start to rise 
And the moon falls from the sky 
And thousand candles burn into the night 
When the angels softly cry 
On the plains below the sky 
Will thousand souls still pray for you and I? 
Chorus 
Hold on, holy ghost 
Go on, hold me close 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
Go on, hold me close 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
So long to the ones you know 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
It's the day of the dead</field>

I'm comin' in hot you heard me and 
Ima make it rain on the girl who serves me. 
I'll drink a fifth of vodka till its gone 
And make her feel so good that it cant be wrong. 
I'm comin' in hot you heard me. 
And we'll be taking shots and if you're not nerdy. 
We only leave a pre party to go party some more. 
I'm already sh-tfaced before i walk in the door. 
This girls rubbing on my leg, i never met her before. 
And now she is making her way onto my gentlemen sword. 
It might be the drugs talking or the shots of patron. 
But these b-tches look like models and there ready to bone! 
I'll take em back to my parents house and be home alone. 
Slappin' chicks and have em yelling like my colleague Kokone. 
She's tearing it up yea shes dancing her ass off. 
This girls is like a mac the way shes riding my laptop. 
I'm trying to get my rocks off so don't try to cockblock. 
I'll grab my sawed off and I'll blow your cock off! 
You know we drink so much we getting drunk for weeks! 
We drink so much goose, we turn it to geese. 
Me and my crew flaming in through VIP. 
These b-tches put my skin through like their Kenny G.

Packing the bag flask the jagor. 
And im drinking acres. 
Don't need a chaser. 
Ordered a cup with? Now the party favors. 
Save us for later. 
I'm a team player. 
Take your shot like the Lakers. 
Shaq got the gators. 
Yes, I'm a gangster and i got more ice on my neck then a glacier. 
Now its time to blazer who's got the paper? 
I heard there's an after party up at John Mayer. 
Hope its a Kegger. 
Nobody's catered. 
Bout to squeeze buns like a baker. 
Girl you're in danger. 
hung like a hanger. 
And I'm about to black out like i am Darth Vader. 
So grab my light saber and savor the flavor. 
Yea you know these b-tches love semen like a sailor.

Everywhere I Go, 
Bitches always know 
That Charlie Scene 
has got a weenie that he loves to show(bitch) 
Everywhere I Go, 
Bitches always know 
That Charlie Scene 
has got a weenie that he loves to show 
(Verse 1) (Charlie Scene) 
Wake up 
Grab beer 
Grab rear 
Shave beard 
Put on some scene gear 
Gotta get drunk before my mom wakes up 
Break-up with my girlfriend so I can bang sluts 
I'm undead, unfed 
Been sleeping on bunk beds 
Since ten 
So if I don't booze it, I'm gonna lose it 
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined 
(Chorus) (Deuce): 
Let's get this party started 
Let's keep them 40's poppin 
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up 
We'll keep them panties droppin 
(x2) 
(Verse 2)(Charlie Scene) 
When I start drinking 
My dick does all my thinking 
Hoes want to be scene with me 
And I like their big thick titties 
D-Cups with extra filling 
Take it out let me lick it quickly 
Calm down it's just a hickie 
I'll blame it on this whisky sipping gets me tipsy 
Drink fast and enjoy your buzz 
Take back streets to avoid the fuzz 
I wanna take you home 
but your friends won't let ya' 
I got a 40 in my Ford Fiesta 
Buy beer 
Or pay the rent 
My signing bonus was quickly spent 
So I'll beat my meat 
like I'm a fuckin' butcher 
And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher! 
(Chorus x2) 
(Verse 3)(Charlie Scene) 
Let's get this party jumpin' 
Let's see some 40 chuggin' 
I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick 
when I start buzzin' 
Come on girls I wanna see you drinkin' 
I wanna see your brain start shrinkin' 
Make a move I saw you winkin' 
Drunken pussies what I'm thinkin' 
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not 
Turn it up loud feel the ambiance 
Grab 2 ho's and do some body shots 
I wanna party all night until they call the cops 
Fuck a wristband lets all do a keg stand 
I'm like Cheech with out the Chong 
Hittin up the beer bong 
When the cops show up 
Their gonna get the finger 
And I don't give a fuck 
Cuz I'm the designated drinker! 
(Chorus x4) 
Everywhere I Go, 
Bitches always know 
That Charlie Scene

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
No, I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to 
Blood is getting hotter, body's getting colder 
I told you once I'm the only one who holds her 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to 
[Charlie Scene] 
I look inside of myself and try to find someone else 
Someone who's willin' to die as to watch you cryin for help 
I know that blood will be spilled and if you won't then I will 
My grave will never be filled it's either kill or be killed 
So let heaven be told that some may come some may go 
Where I end up I don't know but I ain't dyin' alone 
I keep askin the question can I be saved by confession 
You see this blood on my hands at least I still reach into heaven 
I got to pick up the pieces I gotta burry 'em deep 
And when you look in my eyes I'll be the last thing you'll see 
[Danny] 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
No, I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to 
Blood is getting hotter, body's getting colder 
I told you once I'm the only one who holds her 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to 
[Johnny 3 Tears] 
Words turn into blood and the blood keeps on pourin' 
From every poor I whipe it off cuz this just could be the moment 
Now someones gotta die and I'm my only aponant 
Cuz I will watch my baby cry so I keep on just goin' 
Am I a man or a beast it's mother nature at least 
Watch humanity cease cuz it's our human disease 
You gotta kill when you gotta kill yeah that's what they say 
And I can't go against God's will you better pray 
Cuz I'm an angel a demon yeah I'm hell and I'm heaven 
I'm everything you couldn't be now you believe in the devil 
I gotta pick up the pieces I gotta bury them deep 
And when the dirt hits the coffin just go to sleep 
[Danny] 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
No, I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to 
Blood is getting hotter, body's getting colder 
I told you once I'm the only one who holds her 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
I don't wanna die... 
[Danny] 
Now that I see 
I see you buried 
Six feet below 
[Johnny 3 Tears] 
Another life goes into the knife 
I couldn't let 'em breath cuz I didn't wanna die 
[Danny] 
Now that I see 
I see you buried 
Six feet below 
[Johnny 3 Tears] 
It's not alright can you hear me as I cry 
I couldn't let you live cuz I didn't wanna die 
[Danny] 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
No, I don't wanna die

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
No I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to

And I'm packin' heat so don't disrespect me. 
[Charlie Scene]: 
I love it when the DJ throws my song on, 
I hit the dance floor and get my sing along on! 
I love to spit the choruses when I'm on one 
My c-walks too hot I done ripped my Sean Jean. 
Smellin' so fly I got that Hugo Boss on, 
You got the type of booty I'd like to put my paws on. 
We can roll in the Fiesta just to get our floss on, 
I got the speakers pumpin' straight bangin' the thong song. 
Got my hair did got my shit braided up, 
Rollin' with Funny Man and he's breakin' a blunt. 
Snatch it outta his hand and now I'm blazin' it up, 
Took another sip of henny now I'm faded as fuck. 
[Funny Man]: 
"Yo, Charlie Scene tell me where you got them shades at!" 
[Charlie Scene]: 
You know I've had this old G style since way back. 
Sittin' in vip blowin' trees I'm laid back, 
This bitch is gonna be another notch in my wave cap.

There ain't no gangsta like me, 
I'mma give it to ya every time. 
[Charlie Scene]: 
Hold up, and let me lace up the tens 
I'm only 26 but so is the rims. 
I wanna hit the dance floor and thrust my pelvis 
I look so good a million bucks is jealous! 
So, I parked the huffy kicked down the kick stand, 
Payed the 20 dollar cover and I got me a wrist band. 
Got bitches to my neck like I'm standin' in quick sand 
If they talk to me twice then they better talk to my pimp hand! 
Got a Lakers jersey and a platinum chain, 
Two blue-tooth's and a pinky ring. 
Gettin' drunk fuck from that tangeray 
Beer googles on I'm talkin' to a grenade. 
[Funny Man]: 
"Yo, Charlie Scene tell me how you got so flossy!" 
[Charlie Scene]: 
It isn't my fault that all the ladies want me! 
I just roll with the posse that's cool like fonzy, 
And known to be flashier than paparazzi!

All the ladies in the world just dying to meet me. 
'Cause nothin' about me is ever cheesy 
I'll get you in the bed and make it squeaky, squeaky! 
Lookin' so damn fly as I hit the club, 
Low ride west side yes we throwin' it up! 
Make my way to the dance floor to burn it up 
Now go ahead and hit the chorus and turn it up!

Diamonds all up on me,

There ain't no gangsta like me, 
I'mma give it to ya every time.

            <field name="lyrics">We are young 
But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
But we don't belong 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
I see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain 
I see the love, I see the hate, I see this world that we can make 
I see the life, I see the sky, Give it all to see you fly 
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred, but you're the ones who made it 
Watch the beauty of all our lies passing right before my eyes 
I hear the hate in all your words, all the words to make us hurt 
We get so sick oh so sick, we never wanted all this 
Medication for the kids with no reason to live 
So we 
March to the drums of the dammed 
as we come 
Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb 
We are young 
But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
We don't belong 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
As we walk among these shadows, in these streets, these fields of battle 
Take it up, we wear the medal, raise your hands with burning candles 
Hear us whisper in the dark, in the rain you see the spark 
Feel the beating of our hearts, fleeting hope as we depart 
All together, walk alone against all we've ever known 
All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home 
But you take all we are; the innocence of our hearts 
Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart 
So we 
March to the drums of the dammed 
as we come 
Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb 
We are young 
But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
We don't belong 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We will fight or we will fall 
Till the angels save us all 
We will fight or we will fall 
Till the angels save us all 
We will fight or we will fall 
Till the angels save us all 
We will fight or we will fall 
Till the angels save us all 
We are young 
But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
We don't belong 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are young 
But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
We don't belong 
Born in this world as it all falls apart</field>

            <field name="lyrics">In a time of need 
Only few can see what's wrong 
Millions tend to crawl 
But only those who choose can make it through this all 
Only few can sing like lions 
Cuz we sing until we're gone 
And we've got each others backs 
Until we're back where we belong 
A woman held my shield 
And through the battle we did wrong 
A man who tell me wisdom through the static we were gone 
And maybe when we're gone they'll look into the stars 
Every starts got its ending 
Even when we've learned to rise above it all 
These lies are leading me astray 
It's to much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
And we once also had a story too 
You can see that only good men come in few 
Even in our greatest moments 
We may win or we may lose 
Every songs got its rules 
You've got to learn to make it through 
Maybe one day we can choose 
How it feels to be a woman or a man 
Without rules we're buried underneath 
There's a picture glue 
So when my body burns in ashes only sing the truth 
Let these words strengthen all your views 
Because these words were meant for you 
These lies are leading me astray 
It's to much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
And now I'm floatin right above my coffin as it closes 
I look down and I see ??? 
As she's cryin on my mama's shoulder 
I look up into the sky as the gates of heaven open 
Somethings wrong is this destiny or am I going home 
What will happen to my soul 
Will I come back I don't know 
Will you meet me when it's over and you know 
You can meet me here in heaven 
Don't you ever let me go 
This love, this hate 
Is burning me away 
These lies are leading me astray 
It's to much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
These lies are leading me astray 
It's to much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last sone and then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
This love, this hate 
It's burning me away 
This love, this hate 
Is burning me away</field>

Someone left the door open 
Who left me outside 
I'm bent I'm not broken 
Come live in my life 
All the words left unspoken 
All the pages I write 
On my knees and I'm hoping 
That someones holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight 
[Johnny 3 Tears] 
Welcome to the world 
Ya know the landing it was wasted 
The blood upon your hands 
And the wickedness that made it 
Seem to scream it all 
And the memories get faded 
See the exit wound 
And God would have me take it 
I guess I'll say a prayer 
And I'll kiss into the air 
I look up to the sky 
Send them straight to nowhere 
We all dug the grave 
Can't shake away the shame 
Can't quiver in the sky 
But your shaking all the same 
You left us with the guns 
And all of 'em were unloaded 
Teach us how to shoot 
But you taught us how to hold them 
All the weight of the world 
Is right between your shoulders 
Heavy is the heart 
When the world keeps growing colder 
[Danny] 
Who left the door open? 
Who left me outside? 
I'm on my knees and I'm hoping 
That someones holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight 
[Johnny 3 Tears] 
Two sides to every story 
Here's a little morning glory 
Breakfast of a mirror dying slow 
Seems a little boring 
Burn it like a flag 
Walk it straight into the breeze 
Cause there's two types of people 
You are weak or you are me 
Yeah what's another life time 
Like mine 
We all die sometimes 
It's alright 
If you've come to say your goodbyes 
To this life 
We all hurt a little sometimes 
We're alright 
So mothers hold your children 
Don't you ever let 'em go 
There is weakness in your grip 
And they are holding all you hope 
Don't you ever let me go 
(Don't you ever let me go) 
Don't you ever let me go 
(Don't you ever let me go) 
[Danny] 
Who left the door open? 
Who left me outside? 
I'm on my knees and I'm hoping 
That someones holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight 
Someone left the door open 
Who left me outside 
I'm bent I'm not broken 
Come live in my life 
All the words left unspoken 
All the pages I write 
On my knees and I'm hoping 
That someones holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight</field>

Let's watch it burn 
Let's watch this city burn the world 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines on top of the world 
'Til there's nothing left of her 
Let's watch this city burn the world 
My body doused in ashes 
With two empty cans of gas 
The only evidence they have 
Is the police sketch on my mask 
And its hard at times to ask 
If you can save my heart for last 
And its hard to face the facts 
When the darkness fades to black 
It's not just make believe 
When they make me take a seat 
And they put amphetamines 
It's in the air and make me breath 
So come on and grab your children 
Look out for burning buildings 
And villains who pillage 
They're killing by the millions 
And billions of people 
Die for a lost cause 
So now I pray to my nation 
Destroyed under God 
(it's the end of the world) 
All my battles have been won 
But the war has just begun 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines the top of the world 
Till there's nothing left in her 
Let's watch the city burn the world 
The city looks so pretty 
Do you wanna burn it with me? 
Till the skies bleed ashes 
And the fuckin skyline crashes 
They catch us with matches 
To ignite the flame 
And all the hopes of a young 
Deemed fuckin insane 
They say 
Take the pill 
In God we trust 
Go and kill 
God loves us 
As in life as in death 
Breathing till there is no breath 
I will not die in the night 
But in the light of the sun 
And the ashes of this world in my lungs 
But who am I to say 
Lets all just run away 
Grab your saints and pray 
We're gonna burn the world today 
(it's the end of the world) 
As in heaven as on earth 
We've been dead since our birth 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines the top of the world 
Till there's nothing left of her 
Let's watch the city burn the world 
(Let's watch it burn)X2 
The city looks so pretty 
Do you wanna burn it with me? 
The city looks so pretty 
Do you wanna burn it with me? 
The city looks so pretty 
Do you wanna burn it with me? 
We use the trees as torches 
(Do you wanna burn it with me?) 
Dot the streets with corpses 
(Do you wanna burn it with me?) 
We watch the city f**kin bleed 
(Do you wanna burn it with me?) 
And Bring the world to its knees 
(Do you wanna burn it with me?) 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines on the top of the world 
Til there's nothing left of her 
Let's watch this city burn the world 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines on the top of the world 
Til there's nothing left of her 
Let's watch this city burn the world 
Let's watch it burn 
Let's watch it burn

You're talking too loud 
So just shut your mouth 
Who the fuck are you now? 
Lights out 
Can you feel it now? 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now? 
Lifestyles of the young and the reckless 
Checked in the real world 
And don't ask questions 
Dodging those bullets like a fucked up western 
Drag you on a road till you're choked out senseless 
Kings are crowned 
We're the best around 
Got an underground army, 
Yeah we holding it down 
We built our base and we found 
It takes blood and sweat 
And always moving a crowd 
No skill when you going the fast way 
Let me see you dance one from the AK 
Bullshit, now he's coughing names 
Who you know, what you do 
It all sounds the same 
A piece of advice, 
Quit dropping mine 
You'll be gone before it even is your time 
Like a stripper in a cage making minimum wage 
You'll be gone like a dollar bill hitting the stage 
Lights out! 
You're talking too loud! 
So just shut your mouth! 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out! 
Can you feel it now?! 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
I don't like you round suckers 
You ain't got what it takes 
Your crew's riding my nuts 
They'll tell you how my dick tastes 
Yeah, I'm shitfaced 
And all black, looking creepy 
It's Charlie Scene 
This shit is way too easy 
I'mma give it to you quick 
Go straight for your throat 
Or put the burner in your mouth 
And turn you into a ghost 
All these people making music with nothing to show 
Who doesn't have a band? 
Shit, I don't know! 
What kind of sane person drives his own name? 
What kind of sane person boos his own band off stage? 
What kind of sane person drops a verse like this? 
These damn meds ain't workin 
I'm just too damn sick 
Just you coming out here 
It's got me provoked 
Now I'mma cut your ass up like a line of coke 
I'mma roll your crew up like a fatass roll 
And put you in my ashtray 
Because you just got smoked 
Lights out! 
You're talking too loud! 
So just shut your mouth! 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out! 
Can you feel it now?! 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Another classic case, 
You crash and burn 
(And it's true You're dead, now! 
its lights out your last song) 
The world has turned it's face 
You'll never learn 
(And it's true, You're dead, bro 
its lights out your last song) 
Walls closing in, they're falling down 
Lights out! 
You're talking too loud! 
So just shut your mouth! 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out! 
Can you feel it now?! 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out! 
Can you feel it now?! 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out! 
You're talking too loud! 
So just shut your mouth 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out!

I'm holding on so tightly now, 
my insides scream so loud 
They keep watching, watching me drown, 
how did it come to this? 
J-dog: 
How did it come to this, how did I know it was you 
it was a bad dream, asphyxiated watch me bleed 
the life support was cut, the knot was too tight, 
they push and pull me but they know they'll never win 
[Chorus]: 
Deuce and J3t: 
Throw it all away, throw it all away 
I keep on screamin but theres really nothing left to say 
So get away, just get away 
I keep on fightin but I can't keep going on this way 
Deuce 
I can't keep going, can't keep going on like this, 
they make me sick, and I get so sick of it, 
Cuz' they wont let me, they wont let me breath, 
Why can't they let me be. 
J-Dog: 
Why can't they let me be, why don't I know what I am, 
I force this hate into my heart cuz its my only friend, 
My lips are sewn shut, I watch my self bleed, 
They push and pull me and its killing me within 
[Chorus] 
Deuce aka produca: I can't keep going, can't keep going on this 
way 
Johnny3tears: 
My heart beat stumbles and my back bone crumbles 
I feel is it real as the lynch mob doubles 
they want blood and they'll kill for it, 
drain me and they'll kneel for it 
burn me at the stake met the devil made the deal for it, guiteens dreams ya they're guiteen gleems, 
the blood of they're enemies watchin while they sense me, sentancing decease, sentance decease 
they watch them bask in the glory of their holy disease 
[Chorus] 
Deuce: 
I keep on running, 
I keep on running, 
But I can't keep going on this way</field>

But tomorrow well be shining brighter 
Well keep it going fighting 
Hold on when we win take a hit 
Cause were never gonna loose it dying 
Were gonna keep on fighting 
And all the days come back to me 
Come back to what we used to be 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
And yesterday we used to say 
We never change and stay the same 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
It gets harder to see what people want me to be 
Its just me being me im just Charlie Scene 
I used to follow my dreams play guitar and scene 
Now were ryhming for beats take it seriously 
I used to flow with jeez and it was a joke to me 
And I would never foresee that I would be a Mc 
When I would skate the streets I had a fake Id 
I carved my name in a tree back when it was J.T 
And now Im telling props cant lie for the rest of our lives 
And thats like getting the permanent high five. 
Cause people like our tight ryhmes 
And hates get a black eye from six crazy white guys 
Im just a guy in a band with a mic in my hand 
Who decided to rap and fell in love with his fans 
And now my flows are the sickest way to 10 by the bitches 
and its getting ridiculous on how many inches my dick is 
Undead Revolution 1, 2, 3, Go! 
And all the days come back to me 
Come back to what we used to be 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
And yesterday we used to say 
We never change and stay the same 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
I was up on the wall with j-o-r 
I got arrested with wes and the scientist 
I used to run with the run my parents sent me away 
Producer showed me how to pharase I like it better this way 
Now well just fuck up this beat the big God 
Shady chain mabye fucked 50 girls a week 
I used to skate on the streets 
And always people would be pulling guns out at me 
I went to heavns last week 
I always dances at his shows heading out the blows 
you see me and Charlie Scene jack chaining the o's 
And our armour sized hold got no omen soul 
It's just me and my girls were taking over the world 
And the servers got a mind like a ceaser 
He writes lyrics eat grapes and fuck his own leisure 
And the funny man he aint african hes Mexican 
Hard headed like republicans undead revolution 
Undead Revolution 1, 2, 3, Go! 
And all the days come back to me 
Come back to what we used to be 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
And yesterday we used to say 
We never change and stay the same 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
The rest has gone away 
Weve got nothing in this world except for you boys and you girl 
well kill to the top as we laught when you watch.</field>

As this last breath leaves me 
I am trying to be 
What you're dying to see 
Feel like, "fuck, man, 
can't take this anymore, 
this heart, break this" 
It's life that's so thankless 
How could he just forsake us? 
Racist he makes us 
Hate us, he gave us 
Nothing but no trust 
And I am so fucked up 
So let this gun bond us 
Let's hide by this lust 
And once we are just dust 
He'll know that he loved us! 
Let it all burn! 
I will burn first 
God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes? 
Just let me burn, it's what I deserve 
God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes? 
So take me and make me 
Weaken and save me 
This hate that you gave me 
Keeps saying the same thing 
"To sing when you're hurt 
And to sing when you cry 
To sing when you live 
And to sing when you die" 
And here at the end 
At the end of the hurt 
All the pain ain't the same 
When it's your turn to burn 
We're the heart for the heartless 
The thoughts for the thoughtless 
The lies for the honest 
Why is this God so damn godless? 
Let it all burn 
I will burn first 
God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes? 
Just let me burn 
It's what I deserve 
God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes? 
So cry three tears for me 
Deuce and Johnny 3 Tears: When it's all gone 
Sing me this song 
So cry three tears for me 
When it's all gone 
When it's all gone! 
I cannot stand who I am 
I'm this man 
With this blood on my hands 
In this blood, I am damned 
So watch my wings burn 
As they burn in the fire 
Don't scatter the ashes 
No need for the choir 
Let it all burn 
I will burn first 
God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes? 
Just let me burn 
It's what I deserve 
God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes? 
This hate that you gave me keeps saying 
Just let me burn 
Just let me burn 
This hate that you gave me keeps saying 
Just let me burn 
Just let me burn 
Burn! 
Now! 
Burn! 
Just let me burn! 
Now! 
Burn!

So shut your eyes let darkness lead the fight say good night 
SAY GOOD NIGHT 
You know it´s hard to breathe with a knife up to your throat 
and it´s impossible to see down a barrel of smoke 
You know your starting to choke, you hope it´s all in your mind 
It´s time to hit the deck it´s a fucking drive-by 
It ain´t possible to manage all the carnage and the damage 
And an animal like man can use it all to my advantage 
You´re the first to hit the floor cause you know that we stay lit 
We kicking in you door cause we ain´t nothing to fuck with

It´s time to lay out the dead 
The dead come alive

So shut your eyes let darkness lead the fight say good night 
SAY GOOD NIGHT 
There´s black flag hanging over this town 
GET DOWN 
There´s black flag hanging over this town 
GET DOWN 
There´s black flag hanging over this town 
GET DOWN 
There´s black flag hanging over this town 
GET DOWN 
In the land of the weak, we´ll put you to sleep 
Put you to sleep, yeah, put you to sleep 
Walk to the sky as you beg for you life 
Beg for your life, yeah, beg for your life 
SHUT YOUR EYES LET DARKNESS LEAD THE FIGHT 
SAY GOOD NIGHT THE REST WILL WATCH THEIR FUTURE DIE BURIED ALIVE 
SAY GOOD NIGHT 
It´s time to lay out the dead 
The dead come alive 
we wave the flag for the rest of our lives 
So shut your eyes let darkness lead the fight say good night

            <field name="lyrics">Whoa, whoa 
Whoa, whoa 
Got the top down 
Gonna baptize you bitches 'cause you know you cop out 
Calm down, all you motherfuckers do is talk loud 
You sold out and every single one of you is cold now 
My town, thirty-deep, we're 'bout to fucking roll out 
Look alive as I light up the sky 
And pump up the twelve-gauge and blow off your disguise 
No surprise, there ain't no compromise 
They doped up these motherfuckers 
hit 'em straight in the eyes 
And the one-eyed man is king in the land of the blind 
And so you wanna live forever? But today you will die 
(It's your time!) 
Here you lie as I crucify 
You're the boy who will cry and I'm the wolf of goodbye 
And every single page is drawn in blood, can't you see? 
Plus it's because you're triple six feet in the deep 
And I'll send you straight to the afterlife for fucking with me 
Hollywood to the death, undead put you to sleep 
Can't fall, can't die 
Tonight we're so alive 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
We call, you rise 
With you, we never die 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
Broken words that I've been told 
If you wanna throw some blows 
We can go toe to toe 
Kick the door and throw it open 
No one knows, I thought I told 'em 
Thought you had it, now you're choking 
People dropping, bodies folding 
Say undead, two coffins open 
Praying to that holy ghost 
He can't save you, there's no hope 
Looking through that barrel smoke 
Pull the trigger, let it go 
The game just doesn't end the closer 
You can't sink down any lower 
We couldn't get any colder 
With these devils on our shoulders 
Is someone popping shots? Now someone called the cops 
Charlie scene: And when the dust settles 
you know we gon' be on top 
Funny man: Smoking till I'm under six feet on the dock 
Charlie scene: Welcome to the jungle 
we got beef on the block 
Charlie's rolling through your hood, funny at his side 
Looking like a fucking pain parade passing by 
And we hopping out the jeep, if you fuckers wanna die 
Fucking with undead is like committing suicide 
Can't fall, can't die 
Tonight we're so alive 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
We call, you rise 
With you, we never die 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
This time, this time we will all rise 
All rise for the lost lives, lost lives for the last time 
For the last time, we will all rise 
For the last time, we will all rise 
For the last time, we will all rise 
For the last time, we will all rise 
Can't fall, can't die 
Tonight we're so alive 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
We call, you rise 
With you, we never die 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night

What you gonna do when the shit goes down? 
Six misfits rolling through your hometown 
'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
When the streets grow cold and my sight turns red 
Got the pistol grip-hold and a muzzle to your head 
Yeah, somebody talked, yeah, somebody said 
Yeah, somebody's buried, yeah, somebody's dead 
We found my white wolf stashed in my white ball cap 
Got your white ball jacked and my caddy's flat black 
Got the gadgets all wrapped, devil hanging out the back 
Now you're just a story on the cemetery track 
We lock, and we load, we rock, and we roll 
We cock, and we go, it's the undead show 
You know I mean what I say, better drop when we spray 
It's too late to pray on judgment day 
Hear those bells? It's the end of your life 
Someone's gotta live and someone's gotta die 
Here comes hell, it's redemption, right? 
Now you're just a ghost on a cold, blind night

Six misfits rolling through your hometown 
'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
Roll up in the spot like a live grenade 
And every day we celebrate like a pimp parade 
Swimming in liquor till the end of my days 
Rolling with funny man in a cloud of haze 
Who would've knew I turn the trees blue? 
You're sitting on the internet like is this shit true? 
And I don't give a fuck about your bad review 
Till I pop out the screen with a big fuck you! 
Then hop in the backseat and get to the blasting 
Cut down your dreams like the hollywood casting 
Except this shit is real, not acting 
We're still murdering so thanks for asking 
Too damn smart to get caught up in legalities 
Blow you off-stage, just another fatality 
And, sir, you don't know that we lack morality? 
Fuck, suck, dick, lick, man, we nasty 
Ride, slide, dipping low 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
Ride, slide, smoke control 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
What you gonna do when the shit goes down? 
Six misfits rolling through your hometown 
'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
Semi-automatic words you heard to spray the masses 
Gas is lit, quick, spark on the matchstick 
The class is classic, lyrical backflips 
Got you bitches begging for the backstage passes 
Rolling with the bosses, causing havoc 
I'm just filling in because they're never gonna have it 
So sad, you sad, bitch, so glad you have this 
Got pneumatic, emphatic black cadillac shit 
Get your cardiac kit, where's the party at, trick? 
Watch me pull a hat trick, joint on the glass tip 
Got the room loud in the valley 
All eyes on me, you can call me makaveli 
We don't give a fuck, we never did 
Hit you with the thunder where you stand, that's how we live 
Believe me when we do it, yeah, we fucking do it big 
And if we show you how to win, we do it for the kids 
Ride, slide, dipping low

Johnny3tears: 
Sick with myself, but I've got no one else, 
so I give it to myself it's the only thing that helps 
it's the same thing this pain thing that keeps me from sleeping 
and screaming that god I must be motha f**king dreaming 
and I can rest in peace and at least cease to be 
cease to see those things in me that make me wanna cease to breath 
and ceased to need and ceased to feed, sickness that's in me 
this is all that I can be, I can't breath as I bleed 
 
/Chorus/ 
Tha Producer: 
I don't know why I cut myself, god, give me a sign or help 
I wont cry it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath 
push it out my chest till theres nothing left 
I know that my minds near the end, god, I hurt myself and fell 
I wont cry it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath 
push it out my chest till theres nothing left

J-Dog: 
Have you ever met a living legend, just a real friend who planned his 
end and where do I began you said it was pretend 
And when the bullet 
went through it took more then just you, it took two it was you it was 
me and suddenly..... 
How can someone say they're helpless and then they act so 
selfish 
You put me through hell with this so f**k you lets just end 
this 
And what about our friendship and what you did was senseless 
You 
thought you found an exit 
Like I said lets end this 
/Chorus/

Tha Producer: 
I just wanna say good bye, Disappear with no one knowing 
I don't wanna live this lie, smiling to the world unknowing 
I don't want you to try, you've done enough to keep me going 
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine for the very last time

It's christmas in hollywood

It's chanukah in inglewood 
The dradles spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the manura lets get drunk 
J-Dog and Charlie Scene 
Just a little story about last christmas 
About some bad kids who were full of wishes 
We gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin 
The weird kind of love that you give to your cousin 
Little timmy stole from 7-11 
So we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens 
We drank in his room with some dude named kevin 
But there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents 
Zack got caught with a bottle of jack 
So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack 
He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack 
So we took the beer back and I fucked him in the ass!!! 
It's charlie scene got egg nog in my flask 
The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped 
Like oh my god is that saint nick? 
Kids give me your list like its the 25th 
Been accused of being a bad kid 
But I get presents as is 
Cause mrs 
clause just myspace'd me 
I blew off a date on christmas eve. 
So I don't give a fuck if your naughty or nice 
You might still get a rolly (rolex) and a gang on ice 
So write your list and never have no fear 
Have a hollywood christmas and an undead new year!!!! 
Fuck yeah!!! 
Deuce 
It's christmas in hollywood 
Santa's back up in the hood 
So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck 
It's chanukah in inglewood 
The dradles spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the manura lets get drunk 
Johnny 3 Tears and Da Kurlzz 
Bout to serve it up for for all you boys and girls. 
Good kids, bad and even da kurlzz. 
We were chillin at home and deckin the halls. 
So I checked my phone and santa had called. 
He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve. 
He said that his jolly ass needed some help. 
He said christmas aint a gang but a way of life. 
"if you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife." 
So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle, 
Funnier than fuck you can ask chris kringle. 
So we all took flight but something was fishy. 
He asked for road head and started to kiss me. 
Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows. 
Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildo's. 
I pulled down his beard and it was a monster. 
It wasn't saint nick it was a fuckin imposter. 
When we found out he started to pout. 
I took my bandana and I choked him out. 
I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth. 
Hi-jacked his sleigh and headed down south. 
I had a lot of wild nights but tonight was the craziest, 
Met a lot of jeff's but this one was shadiest. 
When it comes to cheer that motherfuckers a grinch. 
So if you don't like christmas fuck you bitch!!!

How fucked up are we inside? 
Breaking up in your empty eyes 
Where's the truth in all your lies? 
Watched you cry, you felt me die 
These tears could fill up an empty tide 
Looking for a last goodbye 
I burned the world for you and I 
If I could do it again 
Would it be alright? 
Or am I living a sin 
Just being by your side 
Wake up fuck love 
Just tampering off your make up 
Wake up, enough's enough 
I sold my soul for tainted love 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
And the waves in the sea 
They slip away just like me 
So let go, oh 
You weren't good enough 
All those empty eyes 
They were twisted by design 
What was hidden right behind 
Sometimes fear can leave you blind 
Yeah, God forsakes the ones who make 
A tepid heart go hard and break them 
I'm vicious now, fucking vicious now 
Some remember every story 
Every inch between the lonely 
Every voice that ever told me 
Only one could ever hold me 
Felt it in between 
I remember when I dream 
But you're vicious now, yeah you're vicious now 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
And the waves in the sea 
They slip away just like me 
So let go, oh 
You weren't good enough 
What's love? It's true 
Dark hearts don't break, they brew 
Fuck love, fuck you 
I'm dying just to hurt you too 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
And the waves in the sea 
They slip away just like me 
So let go, oh 
You weren't good enough 
Only dark hearts 
Only dark hearts 
Only dark hearts

Still drunk and we're doin' it again 
With a huff and a puff I'm blowin birds on your shit 
Learn it out pitch black grin still white skin 
You know I'm hard to kill but real I'm movin' in 
I'm puttin' 22 down while I'm pukin' up blood 
You know I'm here to stay well fuck I'm gonna die young

Don't invide Scene over he pee's at sleep overs 
He asked your sister out so that he could cheat on her 
What a creep loner, shit i couldn't sink lower 
You just got a mean boner from a Charlie Scene poster 
If I'm poppin' a wheelie it means I'm jackin your bike 
Got my middle finger raised as I'm runnin' red lights 
I'm known to punch 'em in the dick at the end of a fight 
And I never say I'm sorry at the end of the night 
We don't apologize 
And that's just the way it is

Even if we sound like shit 
Don't try to criticize 
You bitches better plead the fifth 
We've been idolized 
Role models for all the kids 
So many dollars stuffed in my wallet 
Chain so bling yeah you know that I'm a baller 
We can take the blame cause your parents don't wanna 
They roll their blunts with your marijuana 
How can I run when the pigs got a chopper 
I got a gun but they got a lotta 
Shootin' at the sky with a mother fuckin' sawed off 
God bless a cathlic forgive me father 
Now what's a man to do when another holds a Bible 
A lot of kids suein me holdin' me liable 
Reflections of a kid and they call him suicidal 
Dead beat such a sinner but we call him a child 
How can you blame him a play ground they're dealin 
The mother still buyin' and the father still preachin' 
And now it's up to me cause no one's gonna teach him 
Now nobody, nobody needs 'em 
We don't apologize

            <field name="lyrics">Welcome to a city 
That'll bring you to your knees 
It will make you beg for more 
Until you can't even breath 
Your blindfold is on tight 
But you like what you see 
So follow me into the night 
Cuz I got just what you need 
Were all rolling down the Blvd 
Full of pimps and sharks 
Its a Motherfucker riot we've been dying to start 
You better grab ahold 
Cuz now you know you've fallen apart 
You thought these streets were paved in gold 
But there dirty and dark 
(Been To Hell) 
I can show you the devil 
(Down You Fell) 
Can't hold yourself together 
(Soul To Sell) 
Down here you live forever 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares 
x2 
Welcome 
Welcome 
In the belly of the beast 
I'm a wolf amongst the sheep 
At the bottom of the hill 
But at the top of the street 
Above the Blvd school yard 
Victim of these streets 
And your running hard 
But this wolf is always at your feet 
And you've seen it all before 
But the wolf's outside your door 
And your old enough to run 
You ain't hiding anymore 
Another victim of the star spangled banner of the street 
Now your in the world of wolves 
And we welcome all you sheep 
(Been To Hell) 
I can show you the devil 
(Down You Fell) 
Can't hold yourself together 
(Soul To Sell) 
Down hear you'll live forever 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares 
x2 
Welcome 
Welcome 
You need to wake up and face it 
So you can taste my reality 
Now your stuck in this place you hate 
And you came here so happily 
Then it made you lose your faith 
And that's what fuck with your sanity 
Say good-bye to your soul 
And say hello to your vanity 
Hollywood is your friend 
And the undead are your family 
We'll take you to the end 
Turn your regret into agony 
And I'll never let you go 
Cuz I know you'll come back to me 
I'm the reason you came here 
I'm the American Tragedy 
(Been To Hell) 
I can show you the devil 
(Down You Fell) 
Can't hold yourself together 
(Soul To Sell) 
Down here you'll live forever 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares 
x2 
Welcome 
Welcome 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares

I can't believe 
That when I breath 
There's something good inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
So close to me 
That memory 
Of that one good thing inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
If I went out the back door nobody would stop me 
But where would I go? 
Cause I ain't never had a real home 
So what do I know? 
So I could keep running, hide until they find me 
But what would that do? 
If they could only know what I knew 
What would it prove? 
I should of seen the writing on the wall 
Instead I'm left to fall 
Cause the longer I'm away 
The more we stay the same 
Looking Back where I thought I knew it all 
Instead I'm left to fall 
Did I throw it all away? 
I can't believe 
That when I breath 
There's something good inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
So close to me 
That memory 
Of that one good thing inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
[Johnny 3 Tears] : 
Don't you know, little boy, they'll lay you to waste man 
Little do they know every song has a life span 
Never taken one, but I'm taking my last chance 
To hold all we know and let go with both hands 
So don't you know the clouds are made from concrete? 
Right through the stone can you hear my heart beat? 
Beats through my bones like the memory left me 
Not for a second or a minute when I dream 
I wanna go home like the home that I keep 
You can dig 6, or 66 feat 
We can live forever still your misery missed me 
Hold this song together with a bottle of whiskey 
Look into the mirror at the lines that time drew 
See them painted white and the eyes that shine through 
My heart beats heavy in an open chest 
And I wanna say goodbye, but there's nobody left 
[Danny] : 
I can't believe 
That when I breath 
There's something good inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
So close to me 
That memory 
Of that one good thing inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
[J-Dog] : 
I broke it all and I put to the rest 
Put your hand to mine and feel the emptiness 
There's no beat in my chest, cause there's nothing left 
No it ain't goodbye, it's a last caress 
What another dream, you can hardly sleep 
Can you believe bad things only happen to me 
God knows one day you will finally see 
That scars will heal but were meant to bleed 
Do you realize I would lie for you? 
Please have my last breath, I would die for you 
I know I'm no good but my heart beats true 
You know I'm gonna fight, though I might be scared to lose 
You took me in and I fucked it up again 
An empty promise, no I won't pretend 
Cause in the end we need someone to solve 'em 
Nobody can fix me if I'm part of the problem 
[Danny] : 
I can't believe 
That when I breath 
There's something good inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
So close to me 
That memory 
Of that one good thing inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me</field>

Bitches I hope you know

Shorty come say hello 
And get your drunk ass over here let's bone 
Yo I'm up in the club and the parties jumpin 
Bitches passin by and they're eyeball fuckin 
I'm drinkin Cristale now they're tryin to kiss me 
Sayin 'Funny Man, can you sign my titties?' 
No, I got four bitches in the back of my Rover 
The Fantastic Four sayin 'Funny, can I blow ya?' 
Three were preppy and one was scene 
So three for me and one for Charlie 
This girl's seventeen, now I'm a pedophile 
Now she's showing me her tits I think this girl's gone wild 
I ripped out my dick and her jaw hit the floor 
Acted like she never seen a magnum before 
Turn off the lights and now I'm gonna film it 
Turn on the night vision like she's Paris Hilton 
Funny walked in and said 'Chupa me pito' 
Then she chomped his dick like a macho burrito 
Bitches I hope you know 
I won't stop 'til I hit that ho

And Grab a taxi, get in the back seat 
Fuck, suck, dick, clit 
Man we nasty 
Drive fast please cuz this booz is not lasting 
One too many shots and I seem to be passing 
I think this chick is telling ya she's down for the threesome 
Called the homie J just to see if he needs some 
Just got back comin from the bar 
Rubbin on this chicky's titties in the back of her car 
But but first mistake you said you liked my band 
Second was you put my undead dick in your hand 
And I take your secret pix on my cellular phone 
I got my fingers in places where they don't belong 
Horny as FUCK 
Pressing my LUCK 
Need my dick SUCKED 
So bitch GIVE IT UP

Let's both get naked, girl you know that you want to 
Baby we can have a party tonight

Baby we can have a party tonight

Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
What you gonna do when the shit goes down? 
Six misfits rolling through your hometown 
'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
When the streets grow cold and my sight turns red 
Got the pistol grip-hold and a muzzle to your head 
Yeah, somebody talked, yeah, somebody said 
Yeah, somebody's buried, yeah, somebody's dead 
We found my white wolf stashed in my white ball cap 
Got your white ball jacked and my caddy's flat black 
Got the gadgets all wrapped, devil hanging out the back 
Now you're just a story on the cemetery track 
We lock, and we load, we rock, and we roll 
We cock, and we go, it's the undead show 
You know I mean what I say, better drop when we spray 
It's too late to pray on judgment day 
Hear those bells? It's the end of your life 
Someone's gotta live and someone's gotta die 
Here comes hell, it's redemption, right? 
Now you're just a ghost on a cold, blind night 
Ride, slide, dipping low

What you gonna do when the shit goes down? 
Six misfits rolling through your hometown 
'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
Roll up in the spot like a live grenade 
And every day we celebrate like a pimp parade 
Swimming in liquor till the end of my days 
Rolling with funny man in a cloud of haze 
Who would've knew I turn the trees blue? 
You're sitting on the internet like is this shit true? 
And I don't give a fuck about your bad review 
Till I pop out the screen with a big fuck you! 
Then hop in the backseat and get to the blasting 
Cut down your dreams like the hollywood casting 
Except this shit is real, not acting 
We're still murdering so thanks for asking 
Too damn smart to get caught up in legalities 
Blow you off-stage, just another fatality 
And, sir, you don't know that we lack morality? 
Fuck, suck, dick, lick, man, we nasty 
Ride, slide, dipping low 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
Ride, slide, smoke control 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
What you gonna do when the shit goes down? 
Six misfits rolling through your hometown 
'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes 
Semi-automatic words you heard to spray the masses 
Gas is lit, quick, spark on the matchstick 
The class is classic, lyrical backflips 
Got you bitches begging for the backstage passes 
Rolling with the bosses, causing havoc 
I'm just filling in because they're never gonna have it 
So sad, you sad, bitch, so glad you have this 
Got pneumatic, emphatic black cadillac shit 
Get your cardiac kit, where's the party at, trick? 
Watch me pull a hat trick, joint on the glass tip 
Got the room loud in the valley 
All eyes on me, you can call me makaveli 
We don't give a fuck, we never did 
Hit you with the thunder where you stand, that's how we live 
Believe me when we do it, yeah, we fucking do it big 
And if we show you how to win, we do it for the kids 
Ride, slide, dipping low 
Black cadillac, on them hundred spokes

I loved you, you made me, hate me. 
You gave me, hate, see?. 
It saved me and these tears are deadly. 
You feel that? 
I rip back, every time you tried to steal that. 
You feel bad? you feel sad? 
I'm sorry, hell no fuck that! 
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife. 
This strife it dies, this life and these lies. 
And these lungs have sung this song for too long, and its true I hurt too, remember I loved you! 
 
[Chorus] 
I've , Lost it all, fell today, It's all the same 
I'm sorry oh 
I'm sorry no 
I've , been abused, I feel so used, because of you 
I'm sorry oh 
I'm sorry no 
J-Dog aka The Flat Iron Chef: 
I wish I could I could have quit you. 
I wish I never missed you, 
And told you that I loved you, every time I fucked you. 
The future that we both drew, and all the shit we've been through. 
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew! 
How could you do this to me? 
Look at what I made for you, it never was enough and the world is what I gave to you. 
I used to be love struck; now I'm just fucked up. 
Pull up my sleeves and see the pattern of my cuts! 
[Chorus] 
I've lost it all, fell today, It's all the same 
I'm sorry, oh 
I'm sorry, no 
I've , been abused, I feel so used, because of you 
I'm sorry, oh 
I'm sorry, no

Seems like all we had is over now you left to rest. 
And your tears are dried up now, you just lay without a sound. 
Seems like all we had is over now, you left to rest. 
And my fears are over now, I can leave with my head down.

I've lost it all, fell today, It's all the same

Hey! uh, man you forgot the homie funny man, c'mon!

My clothes are always retro 
Sexual like I'm hetero 
And I play a bitch like nintendo (zelda!) 
Take a fun ride in my benzo 
Funny as fuck, I should do stand up 
Bust caps at the crowd like i don't give a fuck (fuck you) 
Got a gold ass grill 
Hit me on the sidekick if you wanna chill 
Hop in the ride, let's roll 
I'm a barritone with a voice that's so low 
It'll make your speakers explode 
And i'll drop your panties to the floor (ah!) 
Let me bend you over, let me lay you sideways 
Hop in the back girls, freaky fridays! 
If you got beef, then you better step up bitch 
Hollywood undead ain't nothin' to fuck with

Girl, come and smoke my ball like a marlboro 
Introduce me to your mom as charles 
It's charlie scene, shake your ass to the bass 
Wait till you see my face, hey bitch! 
Really tight jeans that show your ass crack 
My first name gives veitnam flash backs 
I get drunk and do the same old, same old 
Sexy girls come, we call them charlies angels 
What'chu gonna do after we get signed? 
I'm gonna lose my mind 
Get 30 inch spinners and pimp my ride 
Go back in time, be there that night and save 2 plus 
lives 
Then pay my fine for getting kinda fucking on the 
hollywood side 
I got the game on lock 
I'll have a bottle and a glock 
With bisceps like the rock 
???? room for murder (hey!)

The bottom of the bottle is my only friend, 
I think I'll slit my wrists again 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
A stomach full of pills didn't work again, 
I'll put a bullet in my head 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
Gone too far and yeah I'm gone again, 
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends, 
I'm sitting on the edge with my 2 best friends, 
Ones a bottle of pills, ones a bottle of gin, 
I'm 20 stories up, yeah I'm up at the top, 
I'll polish off this bottle, now it's pushing me off, 
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft, 
I bet my momma found my letter 
Now shes calling the cops, 
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it, 
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance, 
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent, 
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is, 
I've been trying too long, with too dull of a knife, 
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice, 
I never bought a suit before in my life, 
But when you go to meet God 
You know you wanna look nice. 
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow 
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend, 
I think I'll slit my wrists again 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
A stomach full of pills didn't work again, 
I'll put a bullet in my head 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
We hit the sky, there goes the light 
No more sun, why's it always night? 
When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream, 
When you can't dream, well, what's life mean? 
We feel a little pity, but don't empathize 
The old are getting older, watch a young man die, 
A Mother and a Son and someone you know 
Smile at each other and realize you don't, 
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised, 
What happened to the Father, who swore he'd stay? 
I didn't know 'cause you didn't say, 
Now Momma feels guilt, yeah Momma feels pain, 
When you were young, you never thought you'd die, 
Found that you could but too scared to try, 
You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye, 
Climb to the roof to see if you could fly. 
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow, 
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow. 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend, 
I think I'll slit my wrists again 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
A stomach full of pills didn't work again, 
I'll put a bullet in my head 
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky, 
Like a bird so high, 
Oh I might just try, 
I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky, 
Like a bird so high, 
Oh I might just try, 
Oh I might just try</field>

California, so high we'll ride all night 
Comin' straight outta Cali (what?!)

323! Fuckin' horse night alley(?) 
And from Highland to Clayton, all these bitches are hatin' 
'Cause the shit that we're saying, is the shit that they're playin' 
If we don't make it we'll take it 
If ain't real then we'll fake it 
Open your mouth and I'll break it; don't give a fuck it you hate it! 
We're looking for the 6 chicks, down with the 6 dicks 
Rollin' all day, gettin' buzzed its ridiculous 
Horny like the sickness 
Quickies with the quickness 
Pussy like its business 
Work it like its fitness 
Listen while I spit this, gamin' all these bitches 
Now I'm gonna hit this, and fuck until I'm dickless!

They got me ready to party on this sweetened Bacardi 
From the north to the south, this state's all about 
Silicon lips and all the fake tits! 
California girls; best in the world 
Best in the back seat; so lets get fuckin' nasty! 
I'm a pirate on the streets of C-California 
Movin' and cruisin', we're boozin' all night to the mornin' 
So from dust 'till dawn, you know Undead is always on 
Hit it once like a bomb 
Hit it twice and then I'm gone!

Come on down and say "What's up?" 
Don't front 'cause I ain't buzzed 
Johnny's here to fuck you up 
JDOG pass the 40 up 
You know I'll be here all night 
And Undead 'till the day we die

Like a sinkhole (Like a sinkhole) 
Stars are born then fucking made up and Undead slow 
What does it show? (What does it show?) 
C-c-cut up all the jurors to your lost soul 
Think I'm 'bout to die on a dotted line 
(Then it's beef, cut throats on a short lie) 
It ain't a fucking cry, I'm taking back what's mine 
(Los Angeles, we on a front line) 
Click-click boom, let them fall 
(Lining them up with a semi-matic auto) 
Hear the call, hear the call 
Hop in the whip to tip it straight then I'm out though 
When I do it like this 
With a wiffle ball bat 
Surf's up, bitches, and it's like that 
Hollywood coming to attack! 
[Danny] 
I'm no shooting star, just a burning heart 
We never sleep in California, we're dreaming 
Running through the dark, broken boulevards 
We never sleep in California, we're dreaming 
In California, we're dreaming 
[Johnny 3 Tears and Funny Man] 
I'ma get it now, Armageddon now 
Coked out skeletons, come back down 
Break them down, gotta break them down 
Broke down Ford lights, sing so loud 
The greatest story ever told, the greatest love ever known 
(Dead man walking) Audition for the big show 
It's biblical, (social cynical) 
In the land of make believe the situation's critical 
Sinking to the ocean lies some martyrs that are pinnacle 
Yeah, I'm just a vision but my wings are fucking literal 
As above (so below) 
You wanna go to heaven but you sold your soul 
Dying young (I'm going home) 
Cut yourself a bunch so you don't grow old 
We're living in denial 
(but we're doing it in style) 
Out here in California, it's a trial by fire! 
[Danny] 
I'm no shooting star, just a burning heart 
We never sleep in California, we're dreaming 
Running through the dark, broken boulevards 
We never sleep in California, we're dreaming 
In California, we're dreaming 
[Danny and Charlie Scene] 
It's the future tension 
Hidden in the question 
Underneath the dreams I hold 
I can see rejection 
In my own reflection 
I can feel my dreams grow cold 
(Dreams grow cold!) 
[Danny] 
I'm no shooting star, just a burning heart 
We never sleep in California, we're dreaming 
Running through the dark, broken boulevards 
We never sleep in California, we're dreaming 
In California, we're dreaming 
In California 
In California, we're dreaming 
In California, we're dreaming 
In California, we're dreaming

So meet me by the manura lets get drunk 
J-Dog and Charlie Scene 
Just a little story about last christmas 
About some bad kids who were full of wishes 
We gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin 
The weird kind of love that you give to your cousin 
Little timmy stole from 7-11 
So we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens 
We drank in his room with some dude named kevin 
But there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents 
Zack got caught with a bottle of jack 
So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack 
He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack 
So we took the beer back and I fucked him in the ass!!! 
It's charlie scene got egg nog in my flask 
The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped 
Like oh my god is that saint nick? 
Kids give me your list like its the 25th 
Been accused of being a bad kid 
But I get presents as is 
Cause mrs 
clause just myspace'd me 
I blew off a date on christmas eve. 
So I don't give a fuck if your naughty or nice 
You might still get a rolly (rolex) and a gang on ice 
So write your list and never have no fear 
Have a hollywood christmas and an undead new year!!!! 
Fuck yeah!!!

It's christmas in hollywood

Johnny 3 Tears and Da Kurlzz 
Bout to serve it up for for all you boys and girls. 
Good kids, bad and even da kurlzz. 
We were chillin at home and deckin the halls. 
So I checked my phone and santa had called. 
He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve. 
He said that his jolly ass needed some help. 
He said christmas aint a gang but a way of life. 
"if you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife." 
So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle, 
Funnier than fuck you can ask chris kringle. 
So we all took flight but something was fishy. 
He asked for road head and started to kiss me. 
Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows. 
Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildo's. 
I pulled down his beard and it was a monster. 
It wasn't saint nick it was a fuckin imposter. 
When we found out he started to pout. 
I took my bandana and I choked him out. 
I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth. 
Hi-jacked his sleigh and headed down south. 
I had a lot of wild nights but tonight was the craziest, 
Met a lot of jeff's but this one was shadiest. 
When it comes to cheer that motherfuckers a grinch. 
So if you don't like christmas fuck you bitch!!!

Take my hand lets go, 
Somewhere we can rest our souls. 
We'll sit where it's warm, 
You say "Look, we're here alone." 
(Chorus:) 
I was running in circles, 
I hurt myself, 
Just to find my purpose. 
Everything was so worthless, 
I didn't deserve this, 
But to me you were perfect. 
I'm scattered through this life. 
If this is life I'll say good bye. 
She's gone like an angel, 
With wings let me burn tonight. 
(Chorus) 
(Johnny 3:) 
I see me writin on this paper. 
Prayin for some savior. 
Wishin intake her and save her. 
In a world so, so godless and thoughtless, 
I don't know how we wrought this, 
All the love that you brought us. 
It feels like I'm killin myself. 
Just wheelin myself. 
Just to pray for some help. 
I'd give it all just to have, have your eternity. 
Cause it's all that assures me. 
It's worth all that hurts me. 
I'd give you my heart, 
And let you just hold it. 
I'd give you my soul, 
But I already sold it. 
On that day that day, 
The day I walked away in December. 
I will always remember. 
I'll regret it forever. 
I remember brown eyes, 
So sad and blue skies. 
Turned to darkness and night. 
I'm so sick of the fight. 
I won't breathe unless you breathe, 
Won't bleed unless you bleed. 
Won't be unless you be, 
'Till I'm gone and I can sleep. 
(Chorus) 
(Tha Producer:) 
I've gone away, 
Seen better times in yesterday (I hurt myself). 
It's hard to say, 
That everything will be okay (I hurt myself). 
I've gone away, 
Seen better times in yesterday (I hurt myself). 
It's hard to say, 
That everything will be okay (I hurt myself)</field>

Let's watch it burn 
Let's watch this city burn the world 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines on top of the world 
'Til there's nothing left of her 
Let's watch this city burn the world 
My body doused in ashes 
With two empty cans of gas 
The only evidence they have 
Is the police sketch on my mask 
And its hard at times to ask 
If you can save my heart for last 
And its hard to face the facts 
When the darkness fades to black 
It's not just make believe 
When they make me take a seat 
And they put amphetamines 
It's in the air and make me breath 
So come on and grab your children 
Look out for burning buildings 
And villains who pillage 
They're killing by the millions 
And billions of people 
Die for a lost cause 
So now I pray to my nation 
Destroyed under God 
(it's the end of the world) 
All my battles have been won 
But the war has just begun 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines the top of the world 
Till there's nothing left in her 
Let's watch the city burn the world 
The city looks so pretty 
Do you wanna burn it with me? 
Till the skies bleed ashes 
And the fuckin skyline crashes 
They catch us with matches 
To ignite the flame 
And all the hopes of a young 
Deemed fuckin insane 
They say 
Take the pill 
In God we trust 
Go and kill 
God loves us 
As in life as in death 
Breathing till there is no breath 
I will not die in the night 
But in the light of the sun 
And the ashes of this world in my lungs 
But who am I to say 
Lets all just run away 
Grab your saints and pray 
We're gonna burn the world today 
(it's the end of the world) 
As in heaven as on earth 
We've been dead since our birth 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines the top of the world 
Till there's nothing left of her 
Let's watch the city burn the world 
(Let's watch it burn)X2 
The city looks so pretty 
Do you wanna burn it with me? 
The city looks so pretty 
Do you wanna burn it with me? 
The city looks so pretty 
Do you wanna burn it with me? 
We use the trees as torches 
(Do you wanna burn it with me?) 
Dot the streets with corpses 
(Do you wanna burn it with me?) 
We watch the city f**kin bleed 
(Do you wanna burn it with me?) 
And Bring the world to its knees 
(Do you wanna burn it with me?) 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines on the top of the world 
Til there's nothing left of her 
Let's watch this city burn the world 
Let's watch this city burn 
From the skylines on the top of the world 
Til there's nothing left of her 
Let's watch this city burn the world 
Let's watch it burn

It's like you're here with me now 
But the words you say 
They always seem to fade out 
Since you been away 
I'm just a face in the crowd 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back 
Down in the dirt 
With your blood on my hands 
I blacked out 
But now i do understand 
That you were too good 
For this world so you left it 
Everything turned red 
And then you made an exit 
I don't even know 
If it was your time 
But like all good things 
That pass you by 
Its like a lost soul 
In the time of need 
It made me grow up fast 
And put some blood on my knees 
And you don't even know 
What's beyond you 
Thinking you could never die 
Like you're bullet proof 
So i guess you had to leave 
You were born with wings 
But you were never happy 
Til the angels sing 
I just can't escape 
It's like you're here with me now 
But the words you say 
They always seem to fade out 
Since you been away 
I'm just a face in the crowd 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back down 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back down 
I'm ashes to ashes 
I'm dust to dust 
And when a man 
Turns to ashes 
Forget about love 
Like the feeling inside you 
With the bottle beside you 
You both end up empty 
Like an angel just died too 
I look to the heavens 
To the sky and the rest 
I looked inside myself 
I felt my heart in my chest 
Something so point blue 
There's nothing to say 
Some hearts to stay true 
Musicjuzz.Blogspot.Com 
When falling away 
Come lay down beside me 
What you and i mean 
It's only what i've seen 
It's only just one dream 
Tell my baby i love her 
And i wish i could hold her 
It's hard to say goodbye 
When you know that it's over 
I just can't escape 
It's like you're here with me now

And now she is making her way onto my gentlemen sword. 
It might be the drugs talking or the shots of patron. 
But these b-tches look like models and there ready to bone! 
I'll take em back to my parents house and be home alone. 
Slappin' chicks and have em yelling like my colleague Kokone. 
She's tearing it up yea shes dancing her ass off. 
This girls is like a mac the way shes riding my laptop. 
I'm trying to get my rocks off so don't try to cockblock. 
I'll grab my sawed off and I'll blow your cock off!

Save us for later. 
I'm a team player. 
Take your shot like the Lakers. 
Shaq got the gators. 
Yes, I'm a gangster and i got more ice on my neck then a glacier. 
Now its time to blazer who's got the paper? 
I heard there's an after party up at John Mayer. 
Hope its a Kegger. 
Nobody's catered. 
Bout to squeeze buns like a baker. 
Girl you're in danger.

Dark places, Dark places 
Dark places, Dark places 
I've come way too far for this 
I've put in too much work 
I've dealt with too much hurt 
I worked way to hard for this 
We live in dark places, dark places 
People say I'm pissed off 
Cause I like to shit talk 
But people are fake 
So wait till their jaws lock 
Tick-a-ti-tick tock 
The click of the wrist watch 
Time is running out 
On my way to the tip-top 
So fuck it I can't stop 
Been waiting for too long 
Started my own plot 
It's starting with this song 
Damned if I'm damn wrong 
Who wants to fight a lion? 
Motherfuckers who hate 
Just wait for me to die trying 
Like I'm gonna stop now 
Like I'm gonna cop out 
Choke this motherfucker 
I ain't willing to drop out 
So maybe I'm pissed off because I feel ripped off 
This industry is a bitch and [?] your dick on 
Famous and broke and into a joke 
But I've come way too far now, ain't giving a home 
I can break my bag and I ain't gonna choke 
Show these faggots on top that I'm climbing the rope 
I've come way too far for this 
I've put in too much work 
I've dealt too much hurt 
I worked way to hard for this 
We live in dark places, dark places 
When you come from nothing, you wann die for some 
So I started a run and kept on going 
Dark heart, dark thoughts, in a blackout room 
Lockout, cadillac, click clac, go 
Sang you a song, the words went right through 
And I can't own a house if its haunt me too 
So let's draw the line and it's me and it's you 
I do it all the time and j3t don't loose 
Can you write some checks that you can't cash 
So I'm little bit beat up, baby keep on coming back 
Yea there's just some things I can't stand 
A little trigger happy so come on let's dance 
Fuck you vertue, you lie and you mean it 
With the writing on the wall but you just can't read it 
Comes back around and you better believe it 
If you got a dark heart I'm motherfucking eat it 
I've come way too far for this 
I've put in too much work 
I've dealt too much hurt 
I worked way to hard for this 
We live in dark places, dark places 
Who's that walking up your block 
With stuff in a box 
With a 40 in his fist and a fifth of more rocks 
Got his sleeves cut off with marijuana tube socks 
Smoking pot in the drop top bumping kid rock 
Imma smoke another spliff and chase it down with six shots 
That guy's cockier than shit like a guy with six cocks 
And I can't stop saying dick dick dick and then cock 
Hicker-dickeri dick and dicker-dickeri dock 
So talk shit and get socked 
So get rocks and get lost 
Or get dropped and get topped 
This hip-hop shit gets hot 
This is not a pit stop 
And I'm not gonna stop 
Until I'm on the top 
Like your mom on a cock 
So when you see me in your hood 
Yeah you better think twice 
Let me give you all a little piece of advice 
If you push me any further it's the end of your life 
And I'll kill you like the 60 bars I did on this mic 
I've come way too far for this 
I've put in too much work 
I've dealt too much hurt 
I worked way too hard for this

Bitch you're on our hit list! 
Hold on, holy ghost (hold on) 
Go on, hold me close (go on) 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost (hold on) 
So long to the ones you know (so long) 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually 
It's like I magically happened to be this phantom that cannot be 
Lets his dagger cut jaggedly 
While you're gaspin' so rapidly 
While you gag on this rag 
I see you all laughin' so happily 
It's ok to get startled and be afraid of the dark 
I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart 
And I've already started, there ain't no savin' your heart 
This is the day of the dead, this ain't no day in the park 
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows 
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones 
The song has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow 
When I'm done, I ain't done, 'cause it's hell that follows 
Now get ready for sorrow 
'Cause it's hell that follows 
When the ashes start to rise 
And the moon falls from the sky 
And 1000 candles burn into the night 
When the angels softly cry 
On the plains below the sky 
Would 1000 souls still pray for you and I? 
Hold on (holy ghost) 
Go on (hold me close) 
Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost 
It's the day of the dead 
Hold on, holy ghost

Better run, here we come 
It's the day of the dead 
We come from a world of oblivion bad dreams 
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstrings 
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things 
I'm really not a mad man, the voices keep asking 
Born with a soul that don't wanna be saved 
Every time I look around I see what a fiend made 
Every time I die, I hope they're diggin' up my grave 
An undead one like the flag that I wave 
I'm not afraid to cross on this cocaine sickness 
I'm not afraid to die, let the good book witness 
An undead one like the flag that I wave

Johnny 3, and he's dipping in the 4 door 
.44, and it's pointed at your window 
Ain't a good shot, here come four more 
Gettin' hot, so i play in the snow 
In a town made wicked, made from these wicked things 
See the dead on the cover of a magazine 
I see my smile, it was born from amphetamines 
Better duck, 'cause it's war on my enemies 
Oh, god, think i lost it oh no 
Lost some and wanna watch the rest go 
A mad man when i'm missed with soco 
Who woulda thought a man could sink to so low 
Now, who wants to die from the mossberg shotty!? 
I'm puttin' holes in the hotel lobby! 
All you fake bitches is just another hobby! 
And i'll let you dig where i dump your body

You know i got a grenade, and it's got your name on it 
I'mma spit on your grave and engrave a dick on it 
People say i'm insane and to put the breaks on it 
Let me buy you a drink, how 'bout a roofie, gin and tonic? 
Yeah, charlie scene seems to be so hated 
It's just me being intoxicated 
'cause being sober's so overrated 
Hollywood undead, what have you created? 
I know that we have never really met before 
But, tell me, does this rag smell like chloroform? 
You know that i'm the reason people lock the doors 
But, i got nothin' but time, so, i'ma wait on the porch 
You got nowhere to run, too, so, don't try hiding 
'cause i'm known to be like jack nicholson from the shining 
Yeah, i'm breaking your door down, so, don't try fighting 
Yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed, or the dead keep biting

Goodnight, sleep tight 
Don't let the dead bite 
Wrap a wrap around your head and watch you as you take flight 
J-dog 
You better check twice, look under your bed 
Turn on your nightlight, cover up your head 
'cause we do exist, and there's no need to pretend 
That you're not afraid of me and the undead 
Red, red rum, when you look into these eyes 
Say goodnight, 'cause it's almost your bedtime 
Buckle up, 'cause it's time to fly 
You got a first-class ticket to columbian neckties 
Take a seat, you could sit in the front row 
The voice in your head is just me in your headphones 
Everybody knows that we're the devil's heroes 
Come and get a ticket, follow me to the creep show

So come together, come together again 
The time is now let the armageddon begin 
They say beginnings always starts with the ends 
I say forever and forever amen 
Forget what you are 
Forget what you feel 
Stand apart but fall together 
Nothing ever lasts forever 
We're born to live 
We're born to die 
We're forced to swallow these pills 
And to never ask why 
What I've become? 
What can you see? 
That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease 
Everybody's got this disease 
Feeling my pain 
Hang in the gallows 
Cast the rain 
Feeling so hollow 
Run into shame 
Deep in the shallow 
Not the same but feeling so hollow 
I crashed the train just to start a revolution 
I'm not insane I just want to be free 
It's not the same if it's our execution 
Let them all see you're undead just like me 
So I'm to blame, the one to follow 
Give it away, got nothing to follow 
Fuck the fame, fuck the sorrow 
Live with the day and never tomorrow 
Forget what you are 
Forget what you feel 
Stand apart but fall together

And they pick and they pull and they tear you apart 
But they won't let me go 
No they won't let me go 
And I'm dying baby, dying baby 
Dying so slow 
Walk in the world, it's so empty and dull 
In the land of the beautiful, beauty is cold 
They won't let me go 
No they won't let me go 
And I'm dying baby, dying baby 
Dying alone

I devour your dreams and I live in your home

A need in your head 
A close relative of death

Kill the fucking hunter and you're killing the pride 
In the tide, I'll survive 
But will the fucking world leave me buried alive?

Mood: Apathetic. 
My life is spiraling downward. 
I couldn't get enough money to go to the 
avenge seven fold and my chemical romance concert. 
It sucks 'cause they play some of my favorite songs 
like \"black parade\" and 
\"beast and the harlot\" and of course, 
\"teenagers\". 
And it doesn't help that I couldn't 
get my hair to do that flippy thing either. 
Like that guy from that band can do. 
Some days ugh... 
I'm a shrek donkey, non-conforming as can be 
You'd be non-conforming too if 
you looked just like me 
I have paint on my hooves and make-up on my face 
I'm almost shrek enough to start shaving my neck 
'Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in donkey 
I call it freedom of expression, 
most just call me a donkey 
'Cause our dudes look like donkeys, 
and our chicks look like ogers 
'Cause donkey is one step below Shrek! 
Stop my struttin and go to sleep 
I must be a donkey 
I don't jump around when I go to shows 
I must be a donkey 
I'm dark, and sensitive with low self-esteem 
The way I dress makes every day feel like shrek 
I have no real problems but I like to make believe 
I stole mr darnell's donkey now 
I'm hidingfor a week. 
talking and singing songs are my hobbies 
I can't get through a darnell 
class without sobbing 
dragon keep breaking up with me, 
it's never any fun. 
They say they already have a baby, 
they don't need another one 
Stop my struttin and go to sleep 
I must be a donkey 
I don't jump around when I go to shows 
I must be a donkey 
cut in my hair and brush on my teeth 
I must be a donkey 
I play guitar and write funny notes 
I must be a donkey 
My life is just a black abyss, 
you know, it's so dark. 
And it's hurting me. 
Grabbing hold of me and tightening it's grip, 
tighter than a pair of 
my little brothers hat ... 
which look great on me by the way. 
When I get depressed I talk about 
you in every direction 
Hearing songs about getting 
steeling give me an scare 
I write in a live journal and 
wear thick rimmed hat 
I tell my friends I bleed black 
and cry during classes 
I'm just a bad, cheap, imitation of donkey, 
You can read me \"Catcher in the 
Rye\", and watch me run away. 
I wear skin tight clothes while hating my life 
If I said I like donkeys, I'd only be half right! 
I look like I'm scar and dress like a donkey 
I must be a donkey 
Screw XBox, I play old school Nintendo 
I must be donkey 
I like to whine and hate you darnell 
I must be a donkey 
Me and my friends all look like clones 
I must be donkey 
My parents just don't get me, you know. 
They think I'm smelly just because 
they saw me pet a donkey. 
Well, a couple donkeys 
But I mean, it's the 2000's. 
Can't 2 .. 
or 4 donkeys run away with 
each other without being stolen? 
I mean, your classes dig that kind of thing anyways. 
I don't know darnell, 
sometimes I think you're the only one that gets me, 
you're my best friend... 
I feel like i hate you...

From the front to the back we attack, 
Thats when the sky turns black. 
Divided by all our own means, 
Divided by lines you can't see. 
We've raised our fists, you know we exist, 
You're scared of us because we influence your kids. 
and you paved the way that we walk, 
and you dug your grave we won't stop.

You know we got the plan hold up, pointing at your head, 
Laying on your back but you're better of dead. 
Got the army with me, with the dove and grenade, 
Got the pin pulled out it's a fucking air raid. 
We ride like tanks and we bite like snakes, 
Search and destroy we do what ever it takes.

Yeah undead,

You've gone past your due date, do you crave, 
Scene giving you a grenade toupee to pay. 
Down on your knees crying for help, 
and you're just gonna be another notch in the belt. 
I'm Undead 
and you can only blame yourself 
Yeah Undead 
and I'ma make it rain in hell. 
[Chorus/Deuce] 
I'm the man and I'm the man 
and everybody out there knows that I'm the baddest, 
I'm the baddest of em all and you just mad 
Cause I'm the man and I'm the man 
and everybody out there knows that I'm the baddest, 
I'm the baddest of em all and you just mad 
and it's so sad 
All Hail, All Hail! 
All Hail, All Hail! 
All Hail, Undead! 
All Hail, All Hail! 
All Hail, All Hail! 
All Hail, Undead!</field>

Theres a lesson in the game 
Can't even slow me down 
If you're gonna do it? 
Through it all... 
You gotta put your whole heart into it 
Can't back down.........And Rise Up! 
Every Cent, Every Dime, Every Hook, Every Rhyme, 
Every Bar, Every Line, Every Song, Every Time (4x) 
Aye when I spit I may sound upset 
If theres a silver lining, I aint found it yet 
Cuz after pouring every ounce of sweat 
I deserve more of a score No mo' bouncing checks 
I'm Now a vet, No more rookie mistakes 
Yet I still got critics sayin look he a fake 
You know My hooks bein great, and my Verses are hot 
Wit da right backing id be da first to da top 
Yea I'm workin a lot, got da best of flow 
While these otha cats, Wac like fiesta bowl 
The Rest'll know, they below me, Mexico 
And I'm tryna see more ice than an Eskimo 
I'm right in a world that's filled wit wrong 
They try and knock me down like Keri Hilsons Song 
I keep risin up, cuz im twice the G 
Yea, u may got a deal but u aint nice as me 
Every Cent, Every Dime, Every Hook, Every Rhyme, 
Every Bar, Every Line, Every Song, Every Time (4x) 
This microphone test is crucial, 
My Lyrical style ain't what ya used to 
You see I can change up the flow like an audible 
Cuz I cant think straight I'm illogical, 
Thru every obstacle, I'm risin up 
I sit on cloud 9, aint high enough 
So whys it tough? cuz they hate im perfect 
They bite on my swag cuz the way I work it 
Ya'll know da facts, they dont show me slack 
But a million against 1 cant hold me back 
They know we rap, they just playin coy 
Cuz my flow got more flair than the nature boy 
They hate ya boy, cuz I'm winnin the game 
I'm livin with fame, hot bars, kindlin flame 
It isnt a shame, that u even try and rap 
But im Arizona, I bring Diamonds back 
Every Cent, Every Dime, Every Hook, Every Rhyme, 
Every Bar, Every Line, Every Song, Every Time (4x) 
The Big name artists have something to fear 
Cuz im dropping mixtapes every month of the year 
And once they they here, im coming, im wreckin da fun 
You can bow out now cuz ill be second to none 
Ill never be done, Cant step inside of my mind 
Im tryna find the words for designing a rhyme 
That'll catch on with the kids and adults alike 
Ive been working for this moment, all my life 
But when I reach for the dream it gets further away 
My verses decay, im left with a burning grenade 
Just a tic toc bomb thats waiting to blow 
Im ready to ignite but they taking me slow 
They like, Okay, he can rash the beat 
They say, He's opened up for Cassidy 
You asking me? I think thats blasphemy 
Its Hazard, and you aint heard the last of me 
Every Cent, Every Dime, Every Hook, Every Rhyme, 
Every Bar, Every Line, Every Song, Every Time (4x)</field>

Six pack in hands 
Stage dive to the pit 
Hustle the ladies 
Got gorilla tacticts

When I'm scanning for hoes 
Girls got a bag of slippers 
Wanna do the no no 
Get back to the bus 
It's the end of the night 
Get back to the bus 
And get out of my life 
Cuz I got people to see 
Hoes as freaky as me 
I roll it to the after party with my boy Charles P 
Picked up a few friends 
Now I'm dippin with bitches 
Socked the bitch to my right 
I said click it or ticket 
Girl feeling my ride 
Now she's getting suspicious 
This a brand new Miata 
As I'm Hittin Them Switches

As he's poppin a wheelie 
I finally made it to the party 
Now he's coppin a feely 
See Da Kurlzz out front doing tricks on his Heely's

Cause I ain't tryna get drunk alone 
So smoke this joint with me 
Get high off Funny's weed 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I ain't tryna get high alone

I roll up to the party in my Honda 
Funny followed me is his Mazda Miata 
Damn what a balla 
Top down what a primadonna

Straight out of Auto Zone for 30 dollas 
Money we have nadda 
Lets go inside i'll folla 
They didn't let us in 
So we hopped a 
wall but I dropped ya 
Thats when I lost ya 
I didn't try ta call ya 
I ran into a crowd of Celebrities and Papa-- 
razzi and they shot a 
Pictures of me and Dennis Harper 
Now I needa doctor 
Yo little John-ya 
Crunk juice and Vodka 
Is turning me into a monster 
One more shot and imma gon-ah 
(Funnyman- But Charlie, i saw ya stick your dick in the salsa) 
I don't want no drama 
I'd rather have my anaconda 
Deep throated by Piranas 
So take these pills with me 
Got'em from J-D-O-G 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I don't wanna get high alone 
So take this Ecstasy

            <field name="lyrics">Dear Diary, 
Mood: Apathetic 
My life is spiraling downward 
I couldn?t get enough money to go to the (My Chemical 
Romance?s?) suffocate me dry concert 
It sucks because they play some of my favorite songs 
like, Stab My Heart cause I Love You and Rip Apart My 
Soul and of course Stabity, Rip, Stab, Stab 
And it doesn?t help that I couldn?t get my hair to 
flipply thing the other day like that guy from that 
band could do 
Somedays. 
I?m an emo kid, unconfomting as can be you?d me 
uncomforting to if you looked just like me 
I have paint on my nails and makeup on my face 
I?m almost emo enough to start shaving my legs, cause 
I feel real deep when I?m dressing in drag 
I call it freedom of expression, 
you?ll just call me a fag 
Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look 
like dikes 
Cause emo is one step below tranfestite 
Stop my breathing and slit my throat 
I must be emo 
I don?t jump around when I go to shows 
I must be emo 
I?m dark, and sensitive and have low self esteem 
The way I dress makes everyday feel like Halloween 
I have no real problems but I like to make believe 
I stole my sisters mascara and now I?m grounded for a week 
Sulking and writing poetry are my hobby 
I can?t get through a Hawthorne Heights album without 
sobbing 
Girls keep breaking up with me 
It?s never any fun they say they already have a pussy 
They don?t need another one 
Stop my breathing and slit my throat 
I must be emo 
I don?t jump around when I go to shows 
I must be emo 
Dye my hair nail polish on my toes 
I must be emo 
I play guitar and write suicide notes 
I must be emo 
My life is just a black abyss 
You know? It?s so dark 
And its suffocating me 
Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip 
Tighter then a pair of my little sisters jeans. 
Which look great on me, by the way 
When I get depressed I cut my wrists in every 
direction 
Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an 
erection 
I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed 
glasses 
I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during 
classes 
I?m just a bad cheap imitation of goth 
You could read me Catcher In The Rye and watch me 
jack-off 
I wear skin tight clothes 
while hating my life 
If I said I liked girls 
I?d only be half right 
I look like I?m dead and dress like a homo 
I must be emo 
Screw XBOX I play old school Nintendo 
I must be emo 
I like whine and hit my parentals 
I must be emo 
Me and my friends all look like clones 
I must be emo 
My parents don?t get emo 
They think I?m gay because they saw me kiss a guy 
well, a couple of guys 
But I mean it's so selfless, can?t two, or four dudes 
make out with each other without being gay 
I mean chicks dig that kind of thing anyways 
I don?t know diary, sometimes I think you?re the only 
one on that gets me, You?re my best friend</field>

Bitches always know 
That Charlie Scene 
has got a weenie that he loves to show(bitch) 
Everywhere I Go, 
Bitches always know 
That Charlie Scene 
has got a weenie that he loves to show 
(Verse 1) (Charlie Scene) 
Wake up 
Grab beer 
Grab rear 
Shave beard 
Put on some scene gear 
Gotta get drunk before my mom wakes up 
Break-up with my girlfriend so I can bang sluts 
I'm undead, unfed 
Been sleeping on bunk beds 
Since ten 
So if I don't booze it, I'm gonna lose it 
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined 
(Chorus) (Deuce): 
Let's get this party started 
Let's keep them 40's poppin 
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up 
We'll keep them panties droppin 
(x2) 
(Verse 2)(Charlie Scene) 
When I start drinking 
My dick does all my thinking 
Hoes want to be scene with me 
And I like their big thick titties 
D-Cups with extra filling 
Take it out let me lick it quickly 
Calm down it's just a hickie 
I'll blame it on this whisky sipping gets me tipsy 
Drink fast and enjoy your buzz 
Take back streets to avoid the fuzz 
I wanna take you home 
but your friends won't let ya' 
I got a 40 in my Ford Fiesta 
Buy beer 
Or pay the rent 
My signing bonus was quickly spent 
So I'll beat my meat 
like I'm a fuckin' butcher 
And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher! 
(Chorus x2) 
(Verse 3)(Charlie Scene) 
Let's get this party jumpin' 
Let's see some 40 chuggin' 
I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick 
when I start buzzin' 
Come on girls I wanna see you drinkin' 
I wanna see your brain start shrinkin' 
Make a move I saw you winkin' 
Drunken pussies what I'm thinkin' 
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not 
Turn it up loud feel the ambiance 
Grab 2 ho's and do some body shots 
I wanna party all night until they call the cops 
Fuck a wristband lets all do a keg stand 
I'm like Cheech with out the Chong 
Hittin up the beer bong 
When the cops show up 
Their gonna get the finger 
And I don't give a fuck 
Cuz I'm the designated drinker! 
(Chorus x4) 
Everywhere I Go,

I can't breathe because my fucking thoughts are choking me now 
I can't grieve for the souls that are so lost (are so lost) 
I can't leave because my fucking self is holding me down 
Imagine cold hands up to your throat 
The thought alone makes you swallow your hope 
And now it's harder to cope 
And I don't know where I'll go 
These fallacies I don't believe, 
and fear that nobody knows 
It's a red night and I don't see any light 
And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost 
but can be found inside my mind 
Goodbye 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky 
Goodbye 
Look as we all fall apart 
We all fall apart 
We all fall apart 
Would you forgive me if I told you 
That I lied like you (fuck you) 
So full of hate with the love to lose 
Would you deny it if I asked you 
Just to tell the truth 
Cause in the end 
You gotta decide what side to choose 
Imagine cold hands holding your heart 
The thought alone can tear you apart 
I know you wish it would end, 
it's sad it's only the start 
These memories they only mean 
My soul is empty and dark 
It's a red night and I don't see any light 
And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost

Goodbye 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky 
Goodbye 
It's a red night and I don't see any light 
And then a flat line, 
I'm fucking ready to die 
It's a red night, if it's wrong or it's right 
And if I don't fight it's like being buried alive (x2) 
 
Cause I, I wanna feel anything 
And I know that we all think 
We can't be wrong 
Soon we all be gone 
And I, I don't know what this means 
But if I knew anything 
I'd know for sure 
We'll all be gone 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost 
but can be found inside my mind 
Goodbye 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost

I'm heaven's mistake

An ugly world of pretty grade 
And you're praying now, baby 
But you prayed a little late 
I was born to burn it down 
Not for heaven, heaven's fake 
I was made to burn it down 
So I can make you feel the same 
Yeah, you better write those letters 
That you're never gonna send 
I can see through the tears 
But all I see is red 
I see all the pain 
And you say "what's the problem? " 
"What happened to these kids? " 
"When was it that we lost them? " 
Lost inside the time 
They were victims by design 
And sedated till they demonstrated 
How you live and how you die 
I only wanna burn the world 
And now you're asking why 
Well, count your blessings, say your prayers 
It's time to say goodbye 
We're gone, gone like a nightmare in a dark place 
All along, fatality that I made 
Gone, gone like a nightmare in a dark place 
All along, all along everything they love is gone 
I wanna fuck the world 
I'm gonna make it hurt 
I'll stand here all alone 
I'm gonna watch it burn 
I wanna fuck the world 
I'm gonna make it hurt 
I'll stand here all alone 
I'm gonna watch it burn 
I just wanna bleach you 
And I just wanna eat you 
And tear your soul out 
Until I fucking defeat you 
I just wanna bleach you 
And I just wanna eat you 
And tear your soul out 
Until I fucking defeat you 
I wanna fuck the world 
I'm gonna watch it burn

I love it when the DJ throws my song on, 
I hit the dance floor and get my sing along on! 
I love to spit the choruses when I'm on one 
My c-walks too hot I done ripped my Sean Jean. 
Smellin' so fly I got that Hugo Boss on, 
You got the type of booty I'd like to put my paws on. 
We can roll in the Fiesta just to get our floss on, 
I got the speakers pumpin' straight bangin' the thong song. 
Got my hair did got my shit braided up, 
Rollin' with Funny Man and he's breakin' a blunt. 
Snatch it outta his hand and now I'm blazin' it up, 
Took another sip of henny now I'm faded as fuck. 
[Funny Man]: 
"Yo, Charlie Scene tell me where you got them shades at!"

Hold up, and let me lace up the tens 
I'm only 26 but so is the rims. 
I wanna hit the dance floor and thrust my pelvis 
I look so good a million bucks is jealous! 
So, I parked the huffy kicked down the kick stand, 
Payed the 20 dollar cover and I got me a wrist band. 
Got bitches to my neck like I'm standin' in quick sand 
If they talk to me twice then they better talk to my pimp hand! 
Got a Lakers jersey and a platinum chain, 
Two blue-tooth's and a pinky ring. 
Gettin' drunk fuck from that tangeray 
Beer googles on I'm talkin' to a grenade. 
[Funny Man]: 
"Yo, Charlie Scene tell me how you got so flossy!"

It isn't my fault that all the ladies want me! 
I just roll with the posse that's cool like fonzy, 
And known to be flashier than paparazzi!

All the ladies in the world just dying to meet me. 
'Cause nothin' about me is ever cheesy 
I'll get you in the bed and make it squeaky, squeaky! 
Lookin' so damn fly as I hit the club, 
Low ride west side yes we throwin' it up! 
Make my way to the dance floor to burn it up 
Now go ahead and hit the chorus and turn it up!

            <field name="lyrics">Welcome, to the world you see; 
An ak with a couple magazines. 
Whose blood it is don't matter to me; 
Scatter the ashes over seven seas! 
That sickness, that feeling inside you; 
That's weakness, don't let it divide you; 
Keep this, that feeling of pride too; 
Digging up bones, but you bury the truth! 
Children.. 
hypocrisy, 
That's what I give, you can take it from me; 
If you don't, ya won't live too see; 
One last act of tragedy! 
No mother's heart can make me humble; 
No life lost can make me stumble; 
Our empire will never crumble! 
Chorus: 
We did it for the glory! the glory 
only the glory! 
We lived and died a story! it's a story! all for the glory! 
Bullets, begin to strip. 
A man of reason, he's a man of sin! 
A man of treason and the ones who live; 
They'll take what you got, what you got to give! 
Then up higher; 
A trial by fire! 
They're liars; 
Like funeral pyres! 
A letter to a mother from across the sea. 
A son in a box, buried beneath! 
For whom the bell told, the tolls for thee; 
For whom they smile when they put you to sleep! 
A deal with the devil is a deal with me; 
And that deal is forever so long as you breathe! 
Go forth child, make us proud. 
Honour is yours, underground! 
Though we love you we lay you down! 
Chorus: 
We did it for the glory! the glory 
only the glory! 
We lived and died a story! it's a story! all for the glory! 
Nobody runs! nobody runs! nobody runs or makes it out alive! 
Nobody runs! nobody runs! nobody runs or makes it out alive! 
Hearts beating faster, running to the front lines! 
Nobody runs or makes it out alive! 
Look up to heaven as it rains from the sky! 
Nobody runs or makes it out alive! 
Out alive... 
Because we did it for the glory! the glory! only the glory! 
We lived and died a story! it's a story! all for the glory! 
The glory! (run! ) the glory! (run! ) the glory! (run! ) 
We did it for the glory! (run! ) the glory! (run! ) for the glory!</field>

A little better than a dream 
But I just can't seem 
To get on my feet 
So I gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
I'll hope someday that you will know 
I sit back 
And think about the life I've had 
So much to change but I can't go back 
What happened to that kid 
He used to play in the street 
I think about that kid 
He looked just like me 
Had a smile, had a home, never grow old 
When we grow up, do we have to grow cold 
Spent his whole life looking for salvation 
Never realized nobody could save him 
So all these words 
For what they're worth 
I know it's hard 
I know it hurts 
And we laugh at the past 
Cause it's how we learn 
Welcome to the world now let's watch it burn 
I just wanna life that seems 
A little better than a dream 
But I just can't seem 
To get on my feet 
So I gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
I'll hope someday that you will know 
You gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
I hope someday you'll understand 
Sometimes it's hidden 
Wish that I could see 
A future picture of an older me 
Would he be smiling and would he be happy? 
Would he say a thousands words while looking right at me? 
Is he different, or the same old me? 
Is he still chasing after these same old dreams? 
I know that I'll never reach perfection 
At least he could point me in the right direction 
Some grow old, and some grow cold 
They'd sell their souls for a heart of gold 
God only knows where the hell would I be 
If I had the old me sitting beside me 
I just wanna life that seems 
A little better than a dream 
But I just can't seem 
To get on my feet 
So I gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
I'll hope someday that you will know 
You gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
I hope someday you'll understand 
(So I gotta let go) 
No one knows what it's like to be alone 
Please tell me is anyone out there? 
(So I gotta let go) 
No one knows what it's like to be alone 
Please tell me is anyone out there?

Cause I 
I think of you now and then 
The memories never end 
When gravity pulls you in 
You in [x18] 
[Intro: Charlie Scene] 
I remember looking back 
Converse and a Starter cap 
Now I'm sitting, wishing that 
Wishing I could just go back 
I was happy with no fame 
Ford Fiesta, switching lanes 
Buying 40's with some change 
The Southern California days 
[Verse 1: J-Dog] 
I watch you pass me by 
My words they can't describe 
But I can see the gravity 
Way up from the sky 
We leave the past behind 
Cause we all want to fly 
Deep down in life you can't deny 
We're all the same inside 
 
[Chorus: Danny] 
Cause I 
I think of you now and then 
The memories never end 
When gravity pulls you in 
Cause I 
I think of you now and then 
We?ll never be there again 
When gravity pulls you in 
Oh Gravity 
Oh Gravity 
Oh Gravity 
Oh Gravity 
[Verse 2: Funny Man] 
I remember looking back 
Walking 'round 
sagging cack 
Dime sacks 
Alley cats 
Burned out 
Always slack 
Now I got a 
Platinum plaque 
And life seems to stay the same 
Knowin' that I'll never change 
Southern California days 
[Verse 3: Johnny 3-Tears] 
Gravity can't stop 
The hope and the have-nots 
This artery's a part of me 
And bloods is all I'm gonna be 
I'm gonna see concrete 
Bottles and bad dreams 
I'm everything and anything 
A memory that never leaves

I think of you now and then

When gravity pulls you in 
I think of you now and then 
We'll never be there again 
When gravity pulls you in

Deep in the black 
Is the place I call home 
Taking me back 
To The place I belong 
Deep in the black 
I can find my way home 
Please take me back to the place I belong

I think of you now and then

Staring at me funny cause I'm making her real wet 
Slow with the champagne, let me see you guzzle up 
Gone like the food, girl, let me see you spark it up 
Trying to get some and she's sucking on my zig-zag 
Now I need to step back, laughing as my watch cracks 
Hit my funny bone, yeah 
Man, I'm feeling off-top 
Hoes in the hot tub 
Trying to make my pulse stop 
Still yelling "fuck cops"

I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out my chest. 
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find. 
But maybe I won’t, because I left it all behind. 
Now I’m stuck with this, and that’ll never change 
Always a part of me, until the very last day. 
Where to go from here? What road to travel on? 
I spent my whole life choosing, and I always chose wrong. 
Will I try to have the will to be alive? 
Will I try because I’ve never seen the light? 
Blow it to the ground and it’s now you see, 
You spent your whole life taking the best of me 
Where’d you go? Where’s your home? 
How’d you end up all alone? 
Can you hear me now? 
There’s no light, there’s no sound. 
Hard to breathe, when you’re underground. 
Can you hear me now? Hear me now 
How low can I keep pretending to be? 
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me. 
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees. 
A man of many words, but a man of few deeds. 
Walking these streets, so absent of hope. 
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home. 
Lend him a hand, then we’re walking the way. 
Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame. 
So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight. 
When you wake up, you know it’s darker than last night. 
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by. 
Born to walk away, been walking my whole life. 
Where’d you go? Where’s your home? 
How’d you end up all alone? 
Can you hear me now? 
There’s no light, there’s no sound. 
Hard to breathe, when you’re underground. 
Can you hear me now? Hear me now 
Look into my eyes and I see 
What do I see? Nothing at all 
Take another look around me 
What do I see? Nothing at all 
Where’d you go? Where’s your home? 
How’d you end up all alone? 
Can you hear me now? 
There’s no light, there’s no sound. 
Hard to breathe, when you’re underground. 
Can you hear me now? Hear me now 
Can you hear me? Hear me now</field>

I'm just a sick man, living in a sick land 
choking on this smoke of a Billboard romance 
anybody know where the pigs put my coke, oh 
change them plates on a powder blue Desoto 
oh no, it ain't Johnny 3 T 
Not till the God Lord comes to keep me 
Keep these, are you weak and weeping 
sweating on the floor whem you come to see me 
victims, and you're proud of no bitches 
i hear you cluck but you duck, duck, duck 
and now we're too deep, here's number 3 
it's sick, i'm sick, shit is just like me 
(Chorus) [Danny] 
I am, never forgotten 
this is the anthem, for the sick and rotten 
i am, never forgotten 
this is the anthem, for all you sick and rotten 
(Verse 2) [J-Dog] 
Step up and get knocked back 
You'll end up as blue black 
And goes with the riff raff 
so fuck all the feedback 
we pack it up thightly 
we roll it up nicely 
rock dickies and Nikes 
running beside these 
real rockstars 
fuck smashing guitars 
you learn to sink or swim 
you're swimming with sharks 
i look up in the rearview 
Johnny in the mix too 
scraping up the club in my Cadillac 6 
i'm fresh outta 6 packs 
making this 8 track 
who got a zig zag? 
i'll trade you my gold plaque 
to all the rockstar, powdered nose and glitter 
is it hard to be sick when you know that i'm sicker?

I am, never forgotten 
this is the anthem, for the sick and rotten 
i am, never forgotten 
this is the anthem, for all you sick and rotten

Who created this madman 
who puts a matchstick in your asscrak? 
makes you lapdance on a gas can 
so don't sit down, get down on this track man 
shake your hipes now, this shit ain't no slow jam 
no this is your last chance 
to get your ass smacked with back hand 
and take a cat nap with the sandman 
so don't sit down, get down with the program 
cause i'm sick, with a dick thick like a Coke can 
so burry your romance 
Olivia Brohen 
Matt Berry and Conan, with barbarian gonads 
burry opponents, Siberian slowdance 
king of the throne with rymes fatter than Rosanne

i am, never forgotten 
we've got the anthem to save the sick and rotten

My grave will never be filled it's either kill or be killed 
So let heaven be told that some may come some may go 
Where I end up I don't know but I ain't dyin' alone 
I keep askin the question can I be saved by confession

From every poor I whipe it off cuz this just could be the moment 
Now someones gotta die and I'm my only aponant 
Cuz I will watch my baby cry so I keep on just goin' 
Am I a man or a beast it's mother nature at least 
Watch humanity cease cuz it's our human disease 
You gotta kill when you gotta kill yeah that's what they say 
And I can't go against God's will you better pray 
Cuz I'm an angel a demon yeah I'm hell and I'm heaven 
I'm everything you couldn't be now you believe in the devil 
I gotta pick up the pieces I gotta bury them deep 
And when the dirt hits the coffin just go to sleep

            <field name="lyrics">Dear Diary, Mood: Apathetic 
My life is spiraling downward 
I couldn’t get enough money to go to the Blood Red romance and suffocate me dry concert 
It sucks because they play some of my favorite songs like, Stab My Heart because I Love You and Rip Apart My Soul and of course Stabby, Rip, Stab, Stab 
And it doesn’t help that I couldn’t get my hair to flippy thing either, like that guy from that band could do 
Somedays. 
I’m an emo kid, non-confroming as can be you’d be non-conforming to if you looked just like me 
I have paint on my nails and makeup on my face 
I’m almost emo enough to start shaving my legs, cause I feel real deep when I’m dressing in drag I call it freedom of expression, most just call me a fag 
Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look like dikes 
Cause emo is one step below tranvestite 
Stop my breathing and slit my throat 
I must be emo 
I don’t jump around when I go to shows 
I must be emo 
I’m dark, and sensitive with low self esteem 
The way I dress makes everyday feel like Halloween 
I have no real problems but I like to make believe 
I stole my sisters mascara and now I’m grounded for a week 
Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies 
I can’t get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing 
Girls keep breaking up with me 
It’s never any fun they say they already have a pussy 
They don’t need another one 
Stop my breathing and slit my throat 
I must be emo 
I don’t jump around when I go to shows 
I must be emo 
Dye in my hair nail polish on my toes 
I must be emo 
I play guitar and write suicide notes 
I must be emo 
My life is just a black abyss 
You know? It’s so dark 
And its suffocating me 
Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip 
Tighter than a pair of my little sisters jeans. 
Which look great on me, by the way 
When I get depressed I cut my wrists in every direction 
Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection 
I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses 
I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during classes 
I’m just a bad, cheap, imitation of goth 
You could read me Catcher In The Rye and watch me jack-off 
I wear skin tight clothes while hating my life 
If I said I like girls I’d only be half right 
I look like I’m dead and dress like a homo 
I must be emo 
Screw XBOX I play old school Nintendo 
I must be emo 
I like to whine and hit my parentals 
I must be emo 
Me and my friends all look like clones 
I must be emo 
My parents don’t get me , you know? 
They think I’m gay because they saw me kiss a guy ,well, a couple of guys 
But I mean, it's the 2000's, can’t two, or four dudes make out with each other without being gay? 
I mean chicks dig that kind of thing anyways 
I don’t know diary, sometimes I think you’re the only one on that gets me, You’re my best friend</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Can you see me my love? 
What there above when you were dying 
I was dying too, look for meaning and song 
But the meaning is gone cause I was crying 
Right alone with you if the heavens may break 
I hope for our take and if they ever do 
I'll be there with you 
I woke up feeling the same way that I did yesterday 
Don't know what these tears will say 
But I miss my friend, I ran away 
I watch the seasons as they go 
The rain, the sun, the heat, the snow 
I don't know much but this I know 
I miss my friend I miss him so 
I say my prayers, I raise my hands 
I move my feet and when I can 
I said help, would you help me now? 
And lift me up when my legs give out? 
I know that life is short and living is the hardest part 
Someplace through the dark 
We will meet and never part 
Someplace through the dark 
Can you see me my love? 
What there above when you were dying 
I was dying too, look for meaning and song 
But the meaning was gone cause I was crying 
Right alone with you if the heavens may break 
I hope for a take and if they ever do 
I'll be there with you 
The calms before the break 
The sun descents like yesterday 
The good may come and go away 
And bad news wait for you to wake 
We all kneel down before the storm 
When weights come scratching at your door 
I've been down but down before 
I have faith but I need more 
Respects does care in our world 
Nothingless behind the curtain 
Life is short but death is certain 
That will always be our burden 
Free 
Afraid to follow if I promise you tomorow 
See through the dark 
We will meet and never part 
Someplace through the dark 
Can you see me my love? 
What there above when you were dying 
I was dying too, look for meaning and song 
But the meaning is gone cause I was crying 
Right alone with you if the heavens may break 
I hope for a take and if they ever do 
I'll be there with you 
I had something to say but the words went away 
Just like they always do 
I will be there with you 
Can you see me my love? 
What there above when you were dying 
I was dying too, look for meaning and song 
But the meaning was gone cause I was crying 
Right alone with you if the heavens may break 
I hope for a take and if they ever do 
I'll be there with you</field>

On we sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore. 
Ah, ah, 
We come from the land of the ice and snow, 
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow. 
How soft your fields so green, can whisper tales of gore, 
Of how we calmed the tides of war 
We are young overlords. 
On we sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore. 
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins, 
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing.</field>

Hollow points hidin' in my clip 
Up in 25 just to watch your life end 
I pray, "Father, please forgive me 'fore I sin" 
Got the sticks of dynamite, I'm dying to light them 
God, don't fail me now 
Get thrown and you gon' carried out! 
To a hole where I know you won't be found 
Just face it, it's almost over now! 
Don't even try to take this weapon from me 
I like you more and more the less that you breathe 
I've come undone, I think I'll kill everyone 
My! what have I done? Fuck you, let's kill everyone 
I've come undone, I think I'll kill everyone 
My! what have I done? Fuck you, let's kill everyone 
Oh no, here comes the riot 
Does everything have to resort to violence? 
If you think you can hide, go and try it 
Now let's let the fuckin' gun break the silence 
Close your eyelids 
Another shot and then here come the sirens 
I thought I told you to keep fuckin' quiet 
Somebody's dying, so come say goodbye, kids. 
Don't even try to take this weapon from me 
I like you more and more the less that you breathe 
I've come undone, I think I'll kill everyone 
My! what have I done? Fuck you, let's kill everyone

Lets go right now! 
I look alive, I'm dead inside 
My heart has holes and 
black blood flows. 
We'll do some drugs, well fall in love and get fucked 
up while the world 
just shrugs 
With no thought Logically 
Were wondering 
the streets so 
aimlessly 
I hate to see these kids just being put 
down so painlessly. 
And people say you Dye your hair and wear tight jeans, 
that 
doesnot mean 
That you canot scream, or like loud 
noise, you got a choice, 
you have a voice 
And just because you showed no love 
and hate on us 
you fucked our trust 
Now watch we thrust this Knife 
Called Lust into 
my Chest until it Bust. 
[Refrão] 
This love, This Hate 
Is burning me away 
( is burning me away) 
It's hard to face that we're all the same 
This love, This Hate 
Is Burning me away 
( is burning me away) 
It's harder times like these that never change (Shady 
That never change) 
 
Mad at the fact your dad is an addict, your friend 
takes pills he thinks it cures sadness, 
I'm not here to attack or make you kids panic, 
but i just think it's tragic the way these kids have 
it. 
and everybody sins and it all begins, it goes back 
around, nobody ever wins. 
and you stab yourself in the back, EVERYBODY JUST 
RELAX! it all just hits so close to home, 
we all got friends but we stand alone, and your on 
your own from a broken home, 
you keep the truth inside and it stays unknown. 
Nostalgia hit and its time to quit, 
and everybody acts like it don't mean shit 
a 
and your friend will stab you just to fuck some girl, 
put your hands in the air and scream FUCK THE WORLD!!! 
[ refrão ] 
This love, This Hate 
Is burning me away 
( is burning me away) 
It's hard to face that we're all the same 
This love, This Hate 
Is burning me away 
( is burning me away) 
It's harder times like these that never change 
(Shady That never change) 
Let go 
I'll bring you closer 
Right now 
I'll hold on tightly 
Let go 
We're going no where 
Somewhere 
And things aren't over 
Harder times like these! 
And Growing up 
On the streets! 
Harder times like these! 
and I'll put 
you back on your feet! 
[ refrão ] 
This love, This Hate 
Is burning me away 
( is burning me away) 
It's hard to face that we're all the same 
This love, This Hate 
Is burning me away 
( is burning me away) 
It's harder times like these that never change (Shady 
That never changes) 
 
And I fall to the ground with my teardrops 
And I get lost every time my heart stops 
This love this hate is burning me away.

Before we burn it down

Drink 'til we all black out 
So fucking start it up 
'Cause u know it's goin' down 
Drink, got swag 
Yeah we keep it the same 
Mad dogged all up 
It the back of the rain 
Ain't no balled up 
Baby, got bills to pay 
Yeah I'm getting fucked up 
As I'm changing lanes 
Oh my God 
I'm one of a kind 
I'm a smash it up 
It's about that time 
I'll be back to the party 
By the end of the night 
Cause my hoe got needs 
And I needs mine 
'Cause Funny Man 
Is just so damn sexual 
That ass on my mind 
It's just so damn edible 
Feast your eyes girl 
I'm so delectable 
Dick like Hulk 
Yeah they call me incredible! 
U got your dress pulled up 
I see you all around 
I know u ain't no slut 
But I know your so down 
Smash it up, smash it up 
That bitch is off the hook 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I get that look 
Smash it up, smash it up 
I'll hit it all night long 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I smash I'm gone 
Girl your so hot 
You could spark a match 
Me and funny wanna flip u 
Like an acrobat 
And u could go back home 
In a Cadillac 
Put my name in your phone 
It's the man in black 
You got a big ol' mouth 
And an ass to match 
You got my back in a scrap 
And I'm a fan of that 
We could go home 
And open up a can of that 
I'll put my prize in your box 
Like cracker jacks 
But wait that's 
Just me getting shit faced 
Let me pull out my bluetooth 
And brief case 
And replace 
Everything that I said wrong 
But then it won't be 
A Hollywood Undead song 
U got your dress pulled up 
I see you all around 
I know u ain't no slut 
But I know your so down 
Smash it up, smash it up 
That bitch is off the hook 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I get that look 
Smash it up, smash it up 
I'll hit it all night long 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I smash I'm gone 
I wanna tear it up 
Before we tear it down 
I wanna light it up 
Before we burn it down 
We gonna get fucked up 
Drink 'til we all black out 
So fucking start it up 
Smash it crash it 
What's only crackin' 
It's me and u girl 
Now that's what's happenin' 
Let's take a little trip 
From my stabbing cabin 
Grab the cam 
It's lights camera action 
Let me take care 
Of that satisfaction 
Grab a six pack 
I'll back off the wagon 
Pull a little laugh 
On Michael Jackson 
I'll smash it now 
'Cause I know she's down 
Smash it up, smash it up 
That bitch is off the hook 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I get that look 
Smash it up, smash it up 
I'll hit it all night long 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I smash I'm gone 
Smash it up, smash it up 
This bitch is off the hook 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I get that look 
Smash it up, smash it up 
I'll hit it all night long 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I smash I'm gone 
Smash it up, smash it up

How fucked up are we inside? 
Breaking up in your empty eyes 
Where's the truth in all your lies? 
Watched you cry, you felt me die 
These tears could fill up an empty tide 
Looking for a last goodbye 
I burned the world for you and I 
If I could do it again 
Would it be alright? 
Or am I living a sin 
Just being by your side 
Wake up fuck love 
Just tampering off your make up 
Wake up, enough's enough 
I sold my soul for tainted love 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
And the waves in the sea 
They slip away just like me 
So let go, oh 
You weren't good enough 
All those empty eyes 
They were twisted by design 
What was hidden right behind 
Sometimes fear can leave you blind 
Yeah, God forsakes the ones who make 
A tepid heart go hard and break them 
I'm vicious now, fucking vicious now 
Some remember every story 
Every inch between the lonely 
Every voice that ever told me 
Only one could ever hold me 
Felt it in between 
I remember when I dream 
But you're vicious now, yeah you're vicious now 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
And the waves in the sea 
They slip away just like me 
So let go, oh 
You weren't good enough 
What's love? It's true 
Dark hearts don't break, they brew 
Fuck love, fuck you 
I'm dying just to hurt you too 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
Let go 
Love isn't good enough 
And the waves in the sea 
They slip away just like me 
So let go, oh 
You weren't good enough

Only dark hearts 
Only dark hearts

'Cause it's the way you think

Brought back to the way you are 
Float up 'til you're close to God 
You know that hiding ain't gonna keep you safe 
Because the tears on your face 
They leak and leave a trace 
So just when you think that true love's begun 
It goes off at any second just like a loaded gun

I got the money who's fuckin'dealin' 
You feel the heat like a barrel of a gun 
I forgot the last time I saw the sun 
I've got this disease 
It's digging deeper in me 
It's like my mind is leaving, 
But my heart keeps beating 
So I'll paint the walls, red drip from the nose 
But where it goes, nobody really knows 
Hit the bottle and she's gonna to follow 
I fall asleep there ain't no tomorrow 
Gone too far, no one can save me 
Who needs you when I've got my baby 
My baby is beautiful she loves me true 
But if she dies I hope I die too!

I put down another sack of them 
Then it's straight back to the flask again 
I can't help stop what's happening 
On the wrong track, yeah, I'm back again 
Up shit creek and I'm paddling 
Blacked out room and I'm travelin' 
Good ideas I'm lacking them 
I'm too fucked up now I'm babbling 
Wondering how to fix these damages 
All these goddamn damages 
Cover myself with bandages 
From all these goddamn damages 
Wondering how to fix all of these damages 
All these goddamn damages 
Cover myself with bandages 
From all these goddamn damages 
[Danny:] 
You know, I can take you straight to heaven if you let me... 
You know I, I can make your body levitate if you let me... 
You know that I can make your body levitate..

Who the fuck are you now? 
Lights out 
Can you feel it now? 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now? 
Lifestyles of the young and the reckless 
Checked in the real world 
And don't ask questions 
Dodging those bullets like a fucked up western 
Drag you on a road till you're choked out senseless 
Kings are crowned 
We're the best around 
Got an underground army, 
Yeah we holding it down 
We built our base and we found 
It takes blood and sweat 
And always moving a crowd 
No skill when you going the fast way 
Let me see you dance one from the AK 
Bullshit, now he's coughing names 
Who you know, what you do 
It all sounds the same 
A piece of advice, 
Quit dropping mine 
You'll be gone before it even is your time 
Like a stripper in a cage making minimum wage 
You'll be gone like a dollar bill hitting the stage 
Lights out! 
You're talking too loud! 
So just shut your mouth! 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out!

I don't like you round suckers 
You ain't got what it takes 
Your crew's riding my nuts 
They'll tell you how my dick tastes 
Yeah, I'm shitfaced 
And all black, looking creepy 
It's Charlie Scene 
This shit is way too easy 
I'mma give it to you quick 
Go straight for your throat 
Or put the burner in your mouth 
And turn you into a ghost 
All these people making music with nothing to show 
Who doesn't have a band? 
Shit, I don't know! 
What kind of sane person drives his own name? 
What kind of sane person boos his own band off stage? 
What kind of sane person drops a verse like this? 
These damn meds ain't workin 
I'm just too damn sick 
Just you coming out here 
It's got me provoked 
Now I'mma cut your ass up like a line of coke 
I'mma roll your crew up like a fatass roll 
And put you in my ashtray 
Because you just got smoked 
Lights out! 
You're talking too loud! 
So just shut your mouth! 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out! 
Can you feel it now?! 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Another classic case, 
You crash and burn 
(And it's true You're dead, now! 
its lights out your last song) 
The world has turned it's face 
You'll never learn 
(And it's true, You're dead, bro 
its lights out your last song) 
Walls closing in, they're falling down 
Lights out! 
You're talking too loud! 
So just shut your mouth! 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out! 
Can you feel it now?! 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out! 
Can you feel it now?! 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out! 
You're talking too loud! 
So just shut your mouth 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Who the fuck are you now?! 
Lights out!

            <field name="lyrics">I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me? 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be 
How can I sleep at night, there's a war inside my head? 
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed 
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed 
Cause I am a lion and you are dead 
 
Here's a story of everything we'll ever be 
You can hide but some of us can never leave 
And if you go I don't need those little things 
They remind me of all our little dreams 
Can you hear the words, all I can say? 
We can watch the world even if they walk away 
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today 
You were born a lion and a lion you will stay 
 
I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me? 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be 
 
Remember an army, of all those little kids 
Living life like they only get a little bit 
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle and 
I'd rather die, won't watch you giving in 
I'm sorry daughter but your father's not the same 
I can look into your eyes and I'll swear that I will change 
But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I stay 
You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain 
After all, only so much we can say 
Words can lose their meaning, once you walk away 
Promise that you'll love me, watch me as I fade 
I'll give you all those things that these liars never gave 
The hands on the clock, and the things we cannot change 
Tear it all to pieces, and take back what I made 
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save 
Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay 
 
I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me? 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be 
 
Hey! 
I never meant to let go 
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know 
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home, of a pretty home, of a pretty home 
Hey! 
I never meant to let go 
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know 
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home, of a pretty home, of a pretty home 
Hey! 
 
I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me? 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Here in the city, where the sun beats down on the streets 
My demons talking to me and they're just trying to eat 
Sun sets pretty when the waves crash down on my feet 
If this lie is so sweet, cruising a hundred and three 
I'm in the fast lane, I'm moving rapid 
It's do or die and you can catch back up then 
I'll never slow down, just like a ghost town 
James Dean, curtain call, silver screen showdown 
I know you all will remember me 
Pages of history 
Oh no, no 
Maybe we wanna die young 
I know you all will remember me 
Pages of history 
Oh no, no 
Maybe we wanna die young 
Live fast, then we die young 
Live fast, then we die young 
We live fast, then we die young 
I'd rather burn out than fade away, living day to day 
I was born an outcast, but who are they to say? 
What I do is wrong and I keep moving on 
You might choke on these words, but you sing along 
So, with your heart stops, or your hands tied 
Be the rainfall, cause a landslide 
And if they come to sin, then something's wrong with them 
I been off, now I'm on again 
I just wanna live while the feelings live, a hundred on the highway 
Put the top down, feel the air, kill the snare 
Life's a movie, we're the directors 
We're the star, don't bother us, no time for the lectures 
Many memories, I wouldn't trade for the planet 
Life is short, I never take it for granted 
God, take me now, in the place that I'm standing 
I got no regret and that's the way that I planned it 
I know you all will remember me 
Pages of history 
Oh no, no 
Maybe we wanna die young 
I know you all will remember me 
Pages of history 
Oh no, no 
Maybe we wanna die young 
Live fast, then we die young 
Live fast, then we die young 
We live fast, then we die young 
It's never been in my fate to run 
I was born to chase the sun 
Mama always told me, I was like no one 
But I know when the time comes 
It's never been in my fate to run 
I was born to chase the sun 
Mama knew I wouldn't be here for long 
And I smile when the time comes 
I know you all will remember me 
Pages of history 
Oh no, no 
Maybe we wanna die young 
I know you all will remember me 
Pages of history 
Oh no, no 
Maybe we wanna die young 
Live fast, then we die young 
Live fast, then we die young 
We live fast, then we die young</field>

So cover up your scars

I just look to the stars

It gets me up and it's understood that 
Deep

It fucks me up but it feel so good 
So never say never it's every breath that I treasure 
I'm in love with right now, tonight I'll live forever 
Like whoa, whoa, live right now 
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound 
Like whoa, whoa, live right now 
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound 
Everybody wants to live forever 
But who am I to say? 
I just want a life we will remember 
We're living for today 
Cause tonight we fight to take this world 
And make it all our own 
Everybody wants to live forever 
Come and follow me 
We'll never be alone 
This is who I am 
Your soul is my romance 
If everybody's letting go 
Let's do it with both hands 
I live in the darkness 
I'm tired of the shade 
If everybody's letting go 
I just wanna be saved 
Right 
Right 
Now 
Now 
This is who I wanna be 
Deep

Down

All I want is everything 
I mean every word and 
I mean every letter

Maybe we could live forever 
Like whoa, whoa, live right now 
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound 
Like whoa, whoa, live right now 
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound

We'll never be alone 
We're living right now 
So sing it out loud 
We're living right now 
So sing it out loud 
Let's go! 
Everybody wants to live forever 
But who am I to say ? 
I just want a life we will remember 
We're living for today 
Cause tonight we fight to take this world 
And make it all our own 
Everybody wants to live forever 
Come and follow me

Like whoa, whoa, live right now 
We'll never be alone 
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound 
We'll never be alone

You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flapping those gums 
Like you the boss 
You should check your chin 
Oh no you don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flapping those gums 
But just when I'm wrong 
Cause you don't want none 
Let me take you back 
So back in time 
And make the front page news 
Livin lives of crime 
Cause your grand mood shined 
Outlaws to be exact 
We're getting something new 
And we never turned back 
6 shots, point blank 
Aimin at your face 
Imma quick draw 
Then I'm gone without a trace 
And I'll rob a bank 
While chee and steal 
Derail a fuckin train 
Cause you know that I will 
You need to pay your dues 
And get cement shoes 
And we're still on the run 
The most ruthless crew 
You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin those gums 
Like you the boss 
You should check your chin 
Oh no you don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin those gums 
But just when I'm wrong 
Cause you don't want none 
 
I'm a heart break kid 
I'm a stick up kid 
Bang 
bang 
Tommy gun 
You's a punk ass bitch 
Knocked out 
One punch 
Like a superhero 
Banged up 
craped out 
Now your back to zero 
Boom 
bing 
pow. 
King kong do doubt 
If you blow a mission 
Imma have to dry you out 
You can make it up 
The deets train off of the ground 
Imma switch plates 
Shake it you know how 
Work gets around 
All bets are in 
I see you roll the dice 
Looks like another 7 
It's the end of your life 
You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin those gums 
Like you the boss 
You should check your chin oh 
You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin those gums 
But just when I'm wrong 
Cause you don't want none 
It's no matter 
Just a matter of time 
It don't matter to 3 
It aint no matter of mine 
If you keep your mouth shut 
Then you'll be just fine 
If you keep running gums 
You better look out behind 
I see U N to the D E A D 
You got the full clip 
It's just cockin empty 
Your the cock of the walk 
But you walk too far 
Now your cock's on the block 
Of the boulevard 
I'm the J O H to the N Y 3 T 
You lucky you ain't dead 
If you know they sent me 
You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin those gums 
Like you the boss 
You should check your chin oh 
You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin those gums 
But just when I'm wrong 
Cause you don't want none 
U N to the D E A D 
You got your fist raised 
But your legs are shaking 
U N to the D E A D 
You know that I'm the shit 
That's why you tryin to take me 
We can go around the corner 
I aint catchin a case 
This will all be over quick 
Imma do what it takes 
So your betting all you want 
But never sneak out of place 
Or imma roll your ass up 
And smack the lips off your face 
You better not run 
Cause my bullets are faster 
I'd never really hit a bitch 
So I'm gonna smack ya 
This wont even be a fight 
Cause I'm knockin her out 
And your nicknamed dick 
So keep it out of your mouth 
U N to the D E A D 
Better be known 
We do this shit on a daily 
U N to the D E A D

Before the darkness grabs ahold and takes my soul now

Mama what'd you feed the children? 
Pills and milk ain't nothin to mix in 
Who needs the milk man? I got the tricks in

There's blood on my hands! (hands) 
There's blood on my hands! (hands) 
There's blood on my hands! 
On my hands, on my hands! 
Wake up in the middle of ascending in the night 
With some tears on my pillow 
And this blood on my knife. 
And my soul has stained the sheets 
But they're pulled off to the side. 
Who's blood could this be? 
Is it yours or is it mine? 
Take the knife and twist it. 
Where's my heart you missed it. 
You know I don't wanna die 
But baby you insist it. 
Breathing is a luxury that I just shouldn't have. 
My heart just keeps on beating 
And it's more than you can stand. 
Baby, please just tell me 
How we ever went so wrong. 
We use to sing together 
When we used to sing a song. 
We can never sing forever 
Cause now my voice is gone. 
Guess I'm gone forever and you knew it all along. 
I can see blood all over my hands. 
The longer you lay next to me 
The further I ran. 
What's it all worth? 
How much can you stand? 
The longer you stay close to me 
The further I ran. 
There's blood on my hands! (hands) 
There's blood on my hands! (hands) 
There's blood on my hands! (hands) 
There's blood on my hands! 
I'm only evil when I need to be 
But you did this so easily. 
I try to treat you equally 
And listen to your reasoning. 
But you waited so eagerly 
While plotting and deceiving me. 
You came behind me secretly 
And shattered every piece of me. 
I have nothing to give, so I gave you my life! 
Didn't want to see me live, so you gave me your knife. 
Didn't hear you as you tiptoed 
Coming from behind. 
You took away my kids 
So I guess you killed me twice. 
Drag me into the night 
Cause it's the one thing you keep. 
You knew that I had to die 
So you could finally sleep. 
This blood all over your knife 
You know you earned yourself. 
And it's a matter of time until you burn in hell. 
I can see blood all over my hands. 
The longer you lay next to me 
The further I ran. 
What's it all worth? 
How much can you stand? 
The longer you stay close to me 
The further I ran. 
There's blood on my hands! 
No remorse holds no recourse 
Now I'm leaving slowly 
Oh won't you hold me 
No remorse holds no recourse 
Now I'm leaving slowly 
Oh won't you hold me 
I can see blood all over my hands. 
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran. 
What's it all worth? How much can you stand? 
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran. 
I can see blood all over my hands. 
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran. 
What's it all worth? How much can you stand? 
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran. 
There's blood on my hands! (hands)

Yo, plug the scene 
Hit the strip 
Get my fix 
Got some stiffles in a sack 
Run this town like a spinner on a track 
Come on lay back 
To attack in the lack 
We ain't cutting no slack 
Girl what you know about that 
I ain't tryin' to be a lover but i gotta say 
That we can keep it undercover when you wanna play 
Blazed up smoked out outta my mind 
We just cruise around my town all the time. 
When the sun goes down the stars come out 
Like the ghosts of yesterday 
So drink 'em down because some things never change 
Baby? some get loud 
We ain't gonna fuck around 
When the sun goes down let me here you say 
This is my town 
It's my town 
It's my town 
It's my town 
This is my town 
It's my town 
It's my town

If the city never sleeps well fuck it neither will I 
You know we keep it 30 deep and we're as high as the sky 
You can watch us 30 creep as we ride and we ride 
You can watch the Fiesta drop from one side to side 
We're breakin´ the boulevard cause we get it better 
If ever you need to find me bitch you can send me a letter 
Forever drunk and disorderly off this vodka I'm pourin me 
Goddamn and I want it all in my city of glory. 
When the sun goes down the stars come out 
Like the ghosts of yesterday 
So drink 'em down because some things never change 
Baby? some get loud 
We ain't gonna fuck around 
When the sun goes down let me here you say 
This is my town 
It's my town 
It's my town 
It's my town 
This is my town 
It's my town 
It's my town 
It's my town 
This is my town. 
The streets you walk give you a reason 
Because it's all you got and that will never change 
So keep singing that song and we can live forever 
Pour a little out for the ones who passed away. 
When the sun goes down the stars come out 
Like the ghosts of yesterday 
So drink 'em down because some things never change 
Baby? some get loud 
We ain't gonna fuck around 
When the sun goes down let me here you say

So anybody froze in the alley of scars 
Mama what you think? He wasn't swimming with sharks 
You think I'm evil now keep them kids in the dark 
I got a gallon of a gasoline and a chest full of hearts 
So you hide behind the papers and the records that made me 
Immunization, on papers I'm 18 
Selling some rights for this Johnny come lately 
Like fate in some bars, you think it fucking gonna change me 
From the bottom of bottles and it's right back to the top 
It's a space in between where I keep getting caught 
Yeah, I listen to these demons way more often than not 
So I'll just keep on singing 'cause I don't wanna talk 
[Danny] 
'Cause I know, I know I'm not right 
But I've got my whole life 
And that's alright with me 
It's a new day, a new day 
You have loved yourself and no one else 
In a new day, a new day 
It's a broken life what's left inside? 
It's a new day, a new day 
You have loved yourself and no one else 
It's a new day, how do we change? 
With a broken life what's left inside? 
[J-Dog] 
Today is my dream but tomorrow I choose 
To stay awake and unseen, or sleep in oceans of blue 
It's true the devil in me it's like speech you the freak 
They say my tongue turns black everytime that I breathe 
Pretend I'm just a thief, I'm not allowed to preach 
But you can hear my words as they bleed through the streets 
To under achieve has never been a disease 
You know, we can burn the earth with kerosene and a dream 
The lynch of the mob and the powers that beat 
They see me as a threat to the sheep, I'm looking for meat 
I can see the light and feel the beat of the drums 
I ain't finished yet, I wanna cry when they come 
[Danny] 
'Cause I know, I know I'm not right 
But I've got my whole life 
And that's alright with me 
It's a new day, a new day 
You have loved yourself and no one else 
In a new day, a new day 
It's a broken life what's left inside? 
It's a new day, a new day 
You have loved yourself and no one else 
It's a new day, how do we change? 
With a broken life what's left inside? 
So where do we go when there's nowhere left to crawl? 
And what do we do when we thought we knew it all? 
Now we're surrounded by a world of lonely people 
Am I the last one here, or the last one left to fall? 
[Danny] 
It's a new day, a new day 
You have loved yourself and no one else 
In a new day, a new day 
It's a broken life what's left inside? 
It's a new day, a new day 
You have loved yourself and no one else 
It's a new day, how do we change? 
With a broken life what's left inside?</field>

You've got a fatass, but you shake it like ain't a ho 
There's no other place that I'd rather be than Los Angeles 
Come on, shake it, baby 
Come on, grab a drink; I wanna see you hit the flo' 
You've got a fatass, but you shake it like ain't a ho 
Who dat, who dat, knockin' on the window? 
It's Funny, JDog, smokin' up the endo 
Windows down, you know the system's bangin' 
Hollywood Undead, I ain't playin' 
Cruisin' downtown with the bottle beside me 
Lookin' so fly I got bitches behind me 
Yo I'm in the studio makin' something to dance too 
Cause these bitches wanna hear something they can shake their ass to 
We up in LA represent Hollywood 
West side 'till I die, muthafucka what's good? 
So what's good with that, when this song's a rap 
Deuce in the studio, got bitches in the back 
Smoked out, backseat, dippin' in the taxi 
So what'cha gonna do when I knock you out foo? 
Keep it the same, you know Undead is the name 
Say what you say, it's okay, we ain't never gonna change 
'Cause there's no other place that I'd rather be than Los Angeles 
Come on, shake it, baby 
Come on, grab a drink; I wanna see you hit the flo' 
You've got a fatass, but you shake it like ain't a ho 
There's no other place that I'd rather be than Los Angeles 
Come on, shake it, baby 
Come on, grab a drink; I wanna see you hit the flo' 
You've got a fatass, but you shake it like ain't a ho 
Everybody in the club shake it up! 
LA let me see you shake it up! 
Hollywood let me see you shake it up! 
Everybody shake it up, come one, shake it baby! 
I ain't fuckin' around 'cause King Kong is down 
Crystal, shake it up, we all ova this town 
So let's cruise to the Boulevard into the Beauty Bar 
Let me see you work that ass, come on and shake it fast 
Two whiskey hits, JDogs giving shots in the back 
So where my boys at? 
There goes Johnny 3 cruisin' in the Cadillac 
'63 no (?) and that's a fact! 
When you see me on the scene; black shirt, black jeans, 
tattoos, white shoes 
Runnin' 30 deep foo! 
In the city of LA where it's just another day 
Shooting craps with the Phantom 
Dude thinks he's getting paid! 
We ain't here to front, we ain't here to beef 
We're just here to get you out of yo muthafuckin' seat 
And you don't really wanna step to this 
Funny Man, Undead, and we rock it like what? 
'Cause there's no other place that I'd rather be than Los Angeles 
Come on, shake it, baby 
Come on, grab a drink; I wanna see you hit the flo' 
You've got a fatass, but you shake it like ain't a ho 
There's no other place that I'd rather be than Los Angeles 
Come on, shake it, baby 
Come on, grab a drink; I wanna see you hit the flo' 
You've got a fatass, but you shake it like ain't a ho 
HAHA! Oh shit! What's really goin' on baby?

Too drunk to open the DeLorean Door! 
So I'll take a little nap on the bathroom floor, 
Last shoot, cab man, I'll need some more! 
Lap dance, looking at me like she's bored. 
Too many treats that I can't afford. 
Watch me run outside that door.

Got some paper, and a lighter, 
Time to set a lot on fucking fire!

You better get up out the way, 
Tomorrow we'll run to the street today, 
And no, I don't give a fuck what you think and say,

(Undead!) 
You better get up out the way, 
Tomorrow we'll run to the street today, 
And no, I don't give a fuck what you think and say,

Now I see that motherfucker writin' on the wall 
When you see, J-3-T, 
Thirty D bra, 
Fuck those haters I see, 
Cause I hate that you breathe, 
I see you duck, 
You little punk, 
You little fucking disease, 
I got H.U 
tatted on the front of my arm, 
Boulevard, 
Brass knuckles in the back of the car, 
Cause we drunk drive Cadillacs- we never go far, 
And when you see us motherfuckers, 
better know who we are. 
I got one thing to say to punk asses who hate, 
Motherfuckers who don't know what, 
You better watch what you say. 
From these industry fucks, 
To these fagget ass punks, 
You don't know what it takes, 
To get this motherfucking truck. 
I'm already loud maybe, 
It's a little too late, 
Johny's taking hands up, with all the faggots who hate, 
Cause I am good motherfucker and there's a price to pay, 
Yeah, I am a good motherfucker and its judgment day! 
You better get up out the way,

I'm getting used to this nuisance, 
And all the fags who bad mouth this music, 
It's fuckin stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this, 
Your lyrics never came, never will, don't even try to pursue it. 
I took the chance, I played the pill, I nearly died for this music. 
You make me wanna run around, pulling my guns out and shit, 
Your tempting me to run my mouth, and call you out on this bitch, 
I heard the reason you got to beater to believe any of this, 
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump off a bridge, 
What? You can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit? 
What? You think I just got lucky and didn't work for this shit? 
Bitch 
I've been working at this ever since I was a kid, 
I played a million empty shows to only family and friends. 
What kind of person gets disembanded and deserves to get big? 
I hate to be that person when my verse comes out of the kid's lips. 
That shits as worse as it gets. 
This verse is over, I quit. 
Signed Charlie Scene on your girlfriend's tits.

White boys with tattoos, 
We are pointing right at you, 
We are breaking everything, r-rowdy like a classroom, 
Panic rules, 
Cause we don't follow the rules, 
And when you're running your mouth, 
Our razor blades come out, 
Because its nothing in my mouth except my dick and what I spit, 
So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots talking shit, 
Speaking of fags, already wrap with the drag, 
We killed him and then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac. 
Why you always pressin? 
You know I'm never stressing, 
With fucking DMS, 
J-Johny to my left, 
Got Phantom and the rest, 
Who are down there at the west, 
A grew up by drive-by's and L.A gangsta's, 
So what the fuck do you know about being a gangsta? 
What the fuck do you know about being in danger? 
You ain't doing this, so you know your just talking shit. 
Mad at all the boys because every song is a fucking hit.

Someone left the door open 
Who left me outside 
I'm bent I'm not broken 
Come live in my life 
All the words left unspoken 
All the pages I write 
On my knees and I'm hoping 
That someones holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight 
[Johnny 3 Tears] 
Welcome to the world 
Ya know the landing it was wasted 
The blood upon your hands 
And the wickedness that made it 
Seem to scream it all 
And the memories get faded 
See the exit wound 
And God would have me take it 
I guess I'll say a prayer 
And I'll kiss into the air 
I look up to the sky 
Send them straight to nowhere 
We all dug the grave 
Can't shake away the shame 
Can't quiver in the sky 
But your shaking all the same 
You left us with the guns 
And all of 'em were unloaded 
Teach us how to shoot 
But you taught us how to hold them 
All the weight of the world 
Is right between your shoulders 
Heavy is the heart 
When the world keeps growing colder 
[Danny] 
Who left the door open? 
Who left me outside? 
I'm on my knees and I'm hoping 
That someones holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight 
[Johnny 3 Tears] 
Two sides to every story 
Here's a little morning glory 
Breakfast of a mirror dying slow 
Seems a little boring 
Burn it like a flag 
Walk it straight into the breeze 
Cause there's two types of people 
You are weak or you are me 
Yeah what's another life time 
Like mine 
We all die sometimes 
It's alright 
If you've come to say your goodbyes 
To this life 
We all hurt a little sometimes 
We're alright 
So mothers hold your children 
Don't you ever let 'em go 
There is weakness in your grip 
And they are holding all you hope 
Don't you ever let me go 
(Don't you ever let me go) 
Don't you ever let me go 
(Don't you ever let me go) 
[Danny] 
Who left the door open? 
Who left me outside? 
I'm on my knees and I'm hoping 
That someones holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight 
Someone left the door open 
Who left me outside 
I'm bent I'm not broken 
Come live in my life 
All the words left unspoken 
All the pages I write 
On my knees and I'm hoping 
That someones holds me tonight

I cried so hard. 
The necks of this youth, 
With their necks through this noose 
Were told lies like it's truth 
And we suspect that it's you 
So you strap 'em with the a-k 
It's Mother fuckin' mayday 
They swear I'm fuckin' crazy 
'aint nothin gonna save me 
I'm breakin, I feel it 
I'm naked I'm kneelin 
I'm shakin I'm reelin 
My god I keep bleedin 
I watch the world die through crimson eyes 
I cry, it hurts tonight 
I die, I see the light 
And now I'll say goodbye 
Now I can see your pain I'm sorry 
(Goodbye) 
I cry so hard 
Now I can see your pain I'm sorry 
(Goodbye) 
I cry tonight 
If I could take all this pain away 
Use the rage of our youth today 
Whose to say that it's you to blame 
It's the people above you 
The ones who say that they love you 
Look what the world has come to 
So now it's time to say "Fuck you" 
You think you can and they drug you 
When no one is staring when they numb you 
Fill you with terror and crush you 
But do they care as they shove you 
So you look to me to find the truth 
And what I say is what you do 
But everyone you look up to 
Is really as fucked up as you 
Time is getting shorter 
With these enforcer's orders 
And we get blamed and pushed around 
So Whose the fucking villian now? 
Now I can see your pain I'm sorry 
(Goodbye) 
I cry so hard 
Now I can see your pain I'm sorry 
(Goodbye) 
I cry tonight 
We can't stop now 
Were so close now 
Cause these times are almost over 
I wont give up 
So god save us 
It feels like were getting closer 
We can't stop now 
Were so close now 
Cause these times are almost over 
I wont give up 
So god save us 
Now I can see your pain I'm sorry

I cry so hard 
Now I can see your pain I'm sorry

As this last breath leaves me 
I am trying to be 
What you're dying to see 
Feel like, "fuck, man, 
can't take this anymore, 
this heart, break this" 
It's life that's so thankless 
How could he just forsake us? 
Racist he makes us 
Hate us, he gave us 
Nothing but no trust 
And I am so fucked up 
So let this gun bond us 
Let's hide by this lust 
And once we are just dust 
He'll know that he loved us! 
Let it all burn! 
I will burn first 
God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes? 
Just let me burn, it's what I deserve 
God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes? 
So take me and make me 
Weaken and save me 
This hate that you gave me 
Keeps saying the same thing 
"To sing when you're hurt 
And to sing when you cry 
To sing when you live 
And to sing when you die" 
And here at the end 
At the end of the hurt 
All the pain ain't the same 
When it's your turn to burn 
We're the heart for the heartless 
The thoughts for the thoughtless 
The lies for the honest 
Why is this God so damn godless? 
Let it all burn 
I will burn first 
God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes? 
Just let me burn 
It's what I deserve 
God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes? 
So cry three tears for me 
Deuce and Johnny 3 Tears: When it's all gone 
Sing me this song 
So cry three tears for me 
When it's all gone 
When it's all gone! 
I cannot stand who I am 
I'm this man 
With this blood on my hands 
In this blood, I am damned 
So watch my wings burn 
As they burn in the fire 
Don't scatter the ashes 
No need for the choir 
Let it all burn 
I will burn first 
God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes? 
Just let me burn 
It's what I deserve 
God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes? 
This hate that you gave me keeps saying 
Just let me burn 
Just let me burn 
This hate that you gave me keeps saying 
Just let me burn 
Just let me burn 
Burn!

Burn! 
Just let me burn!

I checked my head, but no one's home 
The mood is right, the party's on 
Looks like tonight, I'll be drinking alone 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Higher than a kite, with nobody but myself 
By myself 
By myself

One more shot, then it's time to roll 
Smoke these pots and I'm out the door 
Chug some rock, but I sip patron 
Hit that spot till you lose control 
You died? I'll go out alone 
Bitch, you must be out your dome 
Fresh new kicks, I cut the floor 
Ludicrous, I throw them vogues 
Life of the party got the bitches laughing 
Funny on-point, his joke's cracking 
Grind on the wall just to get some action 
Looking in the mirror like I'm michael jackson 
Cause this is risky, don't try to diss me 
I get more pussy than a bowl of friskies 
I roll so low, can't keep up with me 
You go home early like you're fucking sixty 
You're coming down my highest peak 
And think you're having trouble speaking 
You a freak and I like freaking 
Me, myself, and I've been drinking 
Blowing up my cell but I don't think I'mma answer 
I'm all by myself so I don't think I'mma answer 
I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone 
I checked my head, but no one's home

Pick myself up in my mitsubishi 
Said "what's up? It's nice to meet me" 
I never met someone so damn freaky 
Who, at the same time, is such a sweetie 
So when everybody else is being such a puss 
Doesn't mean you can straight get off the hook 
I don't need another partner to shake my tush 
I can party all night and slay some bush 
So I'mma go out and do some thrashing 
Show everybody what the fuck is cracking 
Cause this motherfucker can do some damage 
If you don't think so, you can suck my package 
I don't need no static when I feed my habits 
So don't be combatant when I wreak some havoc 
From this weed I'm having; where's my keys, goddamnit? 
I should be on half of me and three's on taxing 
On my knees, I'm blacking out, I need some action 
Like a peon tapping from this seed I'm packaging 
Your knees are shagging, let me see what happens 
Your cheeks are clapping, charles p 
Is rapping 
Blowing up my cell but I don't think I'mma answer 
I'm all by myself so I don't think I'mma answer 
I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone 
I checked my head, but no one's home 
The mood is right, the party's on 
Looks like tonight, I'll be drinking alone 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Higher than a kite, with nobody but myself 
Me and my cup, almost solo and faulty beer 
I'm seeing double but there's only one guy here 
Motherfucker, I'm getting weird 
Motherfucker, yeah, let's get weird 
Blowing up my cell but I don't think I'mma answer 
I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone 
I checked my head, but no one's home 
The mood is right, the party's on 
Looks like tonight, I'll be drinking alone 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Higher than a kite, with nobody but myself 
Let's get weird 
Let's get weird

Come on lets... 
And you know, we keep the party jumpin' 
So lets keep them 40s comin' 
Come on down to the city of LA 
Where we, we ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
You know how we keep it bumpin' everyday, baby 
We ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
Well I ride with jay-dee-oh-gee 
And it's like, kay, basically 
We get shit faced and crazy 
We're screaming "FUCK THE POLICE!" 
J-just like easy lets smoke these with Old'E and Charlie 
We mix it over a heartbeat, and run with the Undead Army! 
And you don't need to see the best of me 
The best MC, its just a beat, produce the feeds that makes me mean 
That seems to be what makes me scream 
So what up?! 
Let's roll the town fucked up! 
Let's sing LA and show love! 
Yo JDOG, wait, just hold up 
Take my mic, my PO showed up! 
Come on down to the city of LA 
Where we ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
You know how we keep it bumpin' everyday, baby 
We ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
We're six Caucasians, hell raisin' 
Blazin', making zero pay 
Can't wait to drink to stop the pain 
To call Funny 
To ride with me 
My pants are so low, I'm sippin' on this 4-0 
Rollin' in the fo' do' 
Producer, me, and four ho's 
OH NO! 
The 5-0's rollin' cold, I didn't stop, but tried to smoke 
Container's open, Funny's smokin' 
I think I'm chokin' 
It's time to go (OH) 
This midnight tale, let's keep it rollin' 
Keep the fuckin and Mad Dog flowin' 
Los Angeles we keep it goin' 
Undead is what we're throwin' 
Come on down to the city of LA 
Where we, we ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
You know how we keep it bumpin' everyday, baby 
We ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
I keep'em blowin' on my 
Head keeps gettin' fatter everyday, baby 
On TV ya better listen 'cause you know they'll play me 
In the club, you in the corner while my shit go crazy 
And I got my soldiers in the back so you don't wanna face me 
And when your girl looked up at me, I'm lookin' right down 
And all that yappin', you know you gonna' be a smack down 
I stick around to keep it mad while the crowd's loud 
In the city of LA; that's my hometown 
Come on down to the city of LA 
Where we, we ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
You know how we keep it bumpin' everyday, baby

            <field name="lyrics">Pour me, pour me, pour me another, 
It haunts me, haunts me, 
Like no other, 
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home, 
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go, 
So pour me, pour me, pour me another. 
I wake up right about the mid-afternoon, 
With the sun in the sky but nights coming soon, 
I walk to the mirror just to fix myself, 
Yeah life gets harder when you love nothing else, 
So I pick my pills from the counter drawer, 
Pick my self-esteem up off the fucking floor, 
I guess I'm a man of no recourse, 
As I crack another bottle, got no remorse, 
And I'll say a little prayer for the child in me, 
I swear I used to be what I truly believe, 
That I'm not just a man with these broken dreams, 
Even I could go to heaven, 
If I'm part deceased, 
So... 
Pour me, pour me, pour me another, 
It haunts me, haunts me, 
Like no other, 
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home, 
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go, 
So pour me, pour me, pour me another. 
People get sick when they watch you bleed, 
When you fell from the top, boy you better believe, 
At the bottom, they got just, yeah, just what you need, 
Well at the bottom, you can't swim 'cause you drank up the sea, 
Then we stop and we look up to the sky, 
They don't ask any questions, they ask us why? 
Don't have any answers, don't know what to say, 
Our knees are getting tired, 
Too tired to pray, 
That's when we laid down the end of the road, 
We all seem to walk and I guess walking alone, 
And I'm not just a man with these broken dreams, 
Even I could go to heaven, 
If I'm part deceased. 
Pour me, pour me, pour me another, 
It haunts me, haunts me, 
Like no other, 
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home, 
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go, 
So pour me, pour me, pour me another. 
Time just seems to go on and on, 
On and on, 
And on and on, 
Life inside a bottle all alone, 
All alone, 
The bottles gone, 
I'm not just a man with these broken dreams, 
Even I could go to heaven, 
If I'm part deceased, 
Whats life inside a bottle if it's cold? 
One more song and I'm finally free, 
I'll meet you here in heaven, between the sea, 
'Cause I'm not just a man with these broken dreams, 
Even I could go to heaven, 
If I'm part deceased. 
So... 
Pour me, pour me, pour me another, 
It haunts me, haunts me, 
Like no other, 
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home, 
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go, 
So pour me, pour me, pour me another. 
Pour me, pour me, pour me, pour me, 
Pour me another, 
Pour me, pour me, pour me, pour me, 
Pour me another.</field>

I don't mind, no I don't mind, I don't mind the rain 
Simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same 
I don't mind, that I don't mind, no I don't mind the rain 
Like a widow's heart, we fall apart and never fade away 
(fade away) 
(Johnny 3 Tears) 
Run like a child do you know where I came from? 
No I don't, but I'm singing all the same songs 
I'm alone, and you're looking for your anyone 
Does it hurt just to know that it's all gone? 
I can feel the pain in the words that you say 
Hidden in the letters that were written to no name 
Let me be the hands that you hold to your face 
Cause' I'd give it all up if I could take it away 
Buried in red, white, and a side of some blue 
Some will die too late, and somebody too soon 
If he could come back, we'll see what it cost him 
We had to lose it all, just to know that we lost one 
Hi, I'm just a shape in the shadow of grates 
Hi, I'm just a voice in the choir of saints 
Oh all the souls that nobody could save 
And just like a light, we faded away 
(Danny) 
I don't mind, no I don't mind, I don't mind the rain 
Simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same 
I don't mind, that I don't mind, no I don't mind the rain 
Like a widow's heart, we fall apart and never fade away 
(fade away) 
Fade away, as I fade away, away, away 
(Charlie Scene) 
If I could take it all back 
Before the flags were forces to wave at half mast 
That was long before my heart became black 
There's no way to make it change or go black 
You know that some of us grow old, no home 
Some of us die in a cold house, no hope 
Still surrounded by the people you don't know, so don't go 
Cause it's over the time fades your photo 
How many goodbyes can fit in a lifetime? 
How many good lies can make it seem alright? 
What do you see when you look into my eyes? 
Or in the sky right before you say goodnight? 
I could be the son that stands beside of your bed 
And I could be the voice right inside of your head 
I could say goodbye and you know where I went 
I just wrote a letter that'll never be sent 
(Danny) 
I don't mind, no I don't mind, I don't mind the rain 
Simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same 
I don't mind, that I don't mind, no I don't mind the rain 
Like a widow's heart, we fall apart and never fade away 
(fade away) 
Fade away, as I fade away, away, away 
As I fade away, away, away 
As I fade away, away, away 
As I fade away</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When the end is getting closer 
And the earth has burned the sky 
Now repent 'cause it's all over 
Just let me die 
Here's the massacre 
A mausoleum fit for me 
Lived a hundred years, 
A hundred years i didn't see 
Gave all my hope away 
Is there any left for me? 
Bombs are splitting atoms 
What can the future bring? 
We can fill a million choirs 
And wait till children sing 
We can walk a million miles 
And end up in the sea 
And our lungs just keep filling 
And lying when we breathe 
The world's filled with liars 
Liars like me 
And i look at my child 
It's fire, this feeling 
It's blue like the sky 
I see all of this meaning 
I reach up to god and ask if i'm dreaming 
I'm so sorry i don't have those things that you're needing 
And darling, a kiss 
Kiss me on these lips 
When the end is getting closer 
And the earth has burned the sky 
Now repent 'cause it's all over 
Just let me die 
As my body lies here broken 
And i'm carried to the light 
Now my heart is finally open 
Just let me die 
Everybody says greetings and goodbyes 
Everybody pays, no one knows the price 
We know the price of sin 
The sin of sacrifice 
I know i'll sing again 
But who can save me twice? 
How much can we ask? 
You'll get the answer first 
How much can we kneel? 
With the air that chills the earth? 
The air keeps getting colder 
My knees keep hitting dirt 
The end, sink and crawl 
Without the guilt of getting hurt 
You ask who you love and you don't know 
Do you? 
The spirit of god, just passes right through you 
You gave away heaven, handed right to you 
And i can see it all 
Tell me, is it true? 
Kiss me, my darling 
(darling, But I need you) 
Where do we go? 
We go, oh 
Lord, I don't know 
Where we go 
We go, no 
I don't know where 
Where do we go? 
We go, oh 
Lord, I don't know 
Where we go 
We go, no 
Lord, I don't know! 
When the end is getting closer 
And the earth has burned the sky 
Now repent 'cause it's all over 
Just let me die 
As my body lies here broken 
And I'm carried to the light 
Now my heart is finally open 
Just let me die</field>

Here I go 
Here I go 
But here I go 
Here I go 
Love's a drug, I'm an addict 
Ditch my heart just to kick the habit 
People might think I'm problematic 
Fuck it I'm alone in a world of static 
Tragic but I stand alone with an empty chest it's a dial tone 
And I must confess so pick up the phone 
And If there's nothing left, then I'm leaving home 
Living in the shadow of someone else 
Till I took a deep breath and I found myself 
Heard the bang from the ricochet 
Maybe I was born just a castaway 
I'll stay away from 
This pain I came from 
Can't run away from 
What's been said and done 
With all these days gone 
Been fighting so long 
I can't break away from it all 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Cause I don't know 
No I don't know 
But here I go 
Here I go 
Here I go 
But here I go 
Here I go 
So easy to hate with no one to love 
It's hard to dream what I'm thinking of 
So hard to watch when I'm starting to run 
And now it's all over, overdone 
I'm just a victim with this, sickness within 
I'm just a memory faded slowly and only the lonely know me 
Stand on top building so, starting down now with the world below 
Half way to heaven with no where to go 
Can anybody out there help me? No 
I'll stay away from 
This pain I came from 
Can't run away from 
What's been said and done 
With all these days gone 
Been fighting so long 
I can't break away from it all 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Cause I don't know No I don't know 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Cause I don't know 
No I don't know 
But here I go 
All those times without you, out you 
But here I go 
All those times without you 
But here I go 
All those times without you, out you 
But here I go 
All those times without you 
But here I go 
Oh 
Oh

it was a bad dream, asphyxiated watch me bleed

I can't keep going, can't keep going on like this, 
they make me sick, and I get so sick of it, 
Cuz' they wont let me, they wont let me breath, 
Why can't they let me be. 
J-Dog: 
Why can't they let me be, why don't I know what I am, 
I force this hate into my heart cuz its my only friend,

Shout at the devil 
He's the wolf screaming lonely in the night 
He's the blood stain on the stage 
He's the tear in your eye been tempted by his lie 
He's the knife in your back, he's rage 
He's the razor to the knife 
Oh, lonely is our lives 
My heads spinnin' round and round 
But in the seasons of whiter 
We'll stand and deliver 
Be strong and laugh and 
Shout, shout, shout 
Shout at the devil 
He'll be the love in your eyes 
He'll be the blood between your thighs 
And then have you cry for more 
He'll put strength to the test 
He'll put the thrill back in bed 
Sure you've heard it all before 
He'll be the risk in the kiss 
Might be anger on your lips 
Might run scared for the door 
but in seasons of wither 
We'll stand and deliver 
Be strong and laugh and 
Shout, shout, shout 
Shout at the devil 
He'll be the love in your eyes 
He'll be the blood between your thighs 
And then have you cry for more 
He'll put strength to the test</field>

More than they are asking for for 
Some of us never change 
But we can give give give just a little bit 
Live live live just a little bit 
Love love love just a little bit more 
Its all that we're asking for 
Its all that we're asking for 
Ah just a little bit more 
Its all that we're asking for 
Ah just a little bit more 
My friend my friend 
Is it breath you're holding in 
Will the questions from within 
Do they end as they begin 
Oh my heart my heart 
Is it left out in the dark 
Is there light after the start 
Like the clouds after they part 
No the end the end 
Is it written in the sand 
Is it slipping through your hands 
Like a dream that never ends 
My friend my friend 
Are the walls still closing in 
Time and time again 
These are words from a broken friend 
Sing sing sing just a little bit more more 
More than they are asking for for 
Some of us never change 
But we can give give give just a little bit 
Live live live just a little bit 
Love love love just a little bit more 
Its all that we're asking for 
Its all that we're asking for 
Ah just a little bit more 
Its all that we're asking for 
Ah just a little bit more 
The stutter and the static 
Its the voices of the attic 
Its the pitch inside the panic 
And the voices of the manic 
Oh 
I just want a minute here 
And after 60 seconds I swear that I will disappear 
Yeah you know that I'm a liar 
And I wanna live forever 
And I wonder why I'm dying so 
Like the bottom of the dream 
I was running for the sky and forgot the in between 
So hard to understand that there's meaning in the man 
And its lost inside the love that I guess I never had 
But were all a simple chance 
Holding all the gentle hands 
Were as simple as a symbol 
And were slipping to the past 
Before I ever let go 
The things are getting bad 
So my daughter has a little hope 
That's the meaning of a memory 
That there were better things 
Better dreams and a better me 
Sing sing sing just a little bit more more 
More than they are asking for for 
Some of us never change 
But we can give give give just a little bit 
Live live live just a little bit 
Love love love just a little bit more 
Its all that we're asking for 
Its all that we're asking for 
Ah just a little bit more 
Its all that we're asking for 
Ah just a little bit more

Dead of the night we go into the world unknown 
Just let us go 
I Know that I'm breathin slow, inhaling smoke I just awoke 
A Bottle Of pills I'm chokin down with dancing demons all around 
But I'm hearin sounds, and I know I'm hearin voices now 
With all the buildings crashing down, it's Armageddon again 
I'll drink the poison from the crown and make a toast to the end 
For all the kids and all the ones and even some 
Who have just begun to feel the pain 
Cause they can't stand to stay awake 
[Danny] 
I See the streets burn every time I fall asleep 
I'm losin' all my sanity 
I can't hide from the voice 
That speaks inside of me 
[Charlie Scene] 
I saw you walk into a room 
I saw a face I thought I knew 
And all along it was true, it was me 
It wasn't You 
I asked myself if it's the truth, A guilty conscience isn't proof 
A finger print well what's that do 
Cause gasoline can burn that too 
So hide your knives and save yourself 
It's just you there's no one else 
Will I change, the time will tell 
I can not dream what is this HELL 
So maybe I should stop this time, And draw the line 
And see the light 
But it's too late I can't this time 
I lost my mind so save the night 
[Danny] 
I See the streets burn every time I fall asleep 
I'm losin' all my sanity 
I can't hide from the voice 
That speaks inside of me 
I See the streets burn along with all my memories 
I'm losin' all my sanity 
I can't hide from the voice 
That speaks inside of me 
If I lay my head down would you admire 
The way I can close my eyes 
Tonight and burn my conscience for the choir 
[Johnny 3 Tears] 
Who's to judge 
Who's insane 
Watch it all wash away 
Save us from what we've made 
It doesn't die it only fades 
If can't feel there isn't pain 
Another day it's all the same 
I always pray I never change 
It seems to me we 're all to blame 
Push your matches, no more rain 
Burn This Fucking World Today 
[Danny] 
I See the streets burn every time I fall asleep 
I'm losin' all my sanity 
I can't hide from the voice 
That speaks inside of me 
I See the streets burn along with all my memories 
I'm losin' all my sanity 
I can't hide from the voice 
That speaks inside of me</field>

It's hard to see with any reason from before 
I lie awake and face these shadows in the night 
I see the truth through crimson eyes 
Take me home where the restless go 
Reckless to the day I rest my bones 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
Take me home where the restless go 
Reckless till the day I rest my bones 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
Whoa 
Whoa 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
These angels burn with an internal sympathy 
Don't say a word until you've heard their symphony 
I lie awake creating shadows in the night 
I see the truth from crimson eyes 
Take me home where the restless go 
Reckless till the day I rest my bones 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
Whoa 
Whoa 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
Got my cards lined up in a row 
Up in flames away we go 
Lost my name but it's etched in stone 
Take me home when the cold wind blows 
Ain't no grave gonna hold me down 
Wide awake so don't make a sound 
Ain't no way you can break me down 
No one sings, no escaping now 
Take me home where the restless go 
Reckless till the day I rest my bones 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
Whoa 
Whoa 
There's no use trying to save my soul

I know what y'all feel on

Guided like a missile from two bottles of Jack

It's Johnny Three 
Johnny sees what Johnny needs 
Johnny breathes weed 
Still, Johnny don't see anything! 
Johnny buys drink 
Johnny winks and Johnny thinks 
Johnny circles dance floor like roller rink 
Jump up down down in the H-town get down 
To the sound that's bound 
To make the motherfucking crowd loud 
Wanna see you move, yeah move to the music 
Wanna see you booze, yeah booze 'til you puke it 
See bitch, grab ass 
Get smacked to the mat (bitch!) 
Slap back, get thrown out the back 
Watch your back through the back door 
Back to the dance floor 
Gotta gotta get my, gotta gotta get more

Turn it up 
Turn it up, focus 3

Fuck yeah!</field>

Cus I don't wanna be like this 
I've been runnin these streets 
For too long now 
I've got nothing thats true 
But this song now 
But the further I go 
I wanna go home 
(j3t) 
I fuckin' swear that I care 
But its hard when you stare 
Into the bottom of a bottle 
That is empty and bare 
All my desolate soul 
In my desolate home 
It's my desolate role 
Yeah I'm here all alone 
I can't think of a reason 
To get the fuck out of bed 
Curtains closed, lights are off 
Am I alive or dead? 
I haven't shaved in a week 
I always slur when I speak 
Tolerance at its peak 
Another fit just to sleep 
Oh woe is me woe is me 
I guess I need love 
Hoes ya see hoes ya see 
I'm just in a rut 
And I swear I'm tryin baby please 
Baby don't leave 
God-damn I'm a fuck-up 
But I guess that's just me 
So I sit in my room 
And I'll cry in my bed 
Thinkin about all the shit 
That made me wrong in my head 
I keep tryin to climb 
But it seems so steep 
Pour myself a fuckin' whisky 
And go back to sleep.. 
bitch 
I watch my momma cry 
She says 'baby why? ' 
I say 'baby died 
Baby's gone like a suicide' 
I don't think you'll see him soon, mom 
Stay out my room, mom 
Tell daddy that I hate 
That motherfucker like you, mom 
I sing this shit for you, danny, sasha and jordan 
These tears keep gettin warmer 
Everytime that I hold her 
I pour this out for you 
Like a partner in crime 
It's part of the times 
When you're sick in the mind 
Yeah I'm sick, oh so sick 
I'm so sick of this shit 
Yeah I'm lit, oh so lit 
I'm so fucked up off it 
So I stumble around 
Til I stumble fall down 
To this puddle of my tears 
Layin here on the ground 
When you've got nothing left 
You've got nothing left to lose 
With my last left single breath 
I'll still be singing to you 
So when you bury me man 
You better bury me deep 
And sing along to this song 
Because you're broken like me 
And I wanna go back to the start 
Back where we started from 
And I know it's been so long 
I was wrong, I was wrong 
I was wrong all along</field>

Johnny3tears: 
Sick with myself, but I've got no one else, 
so I give it to myself it's the only thing that helps 
it's the same thing this pain thing that keeps me from sleeping 
and screaming that god I must be motha f**king dreaming 
and I can rest in peace and at least cease to be 
cease to see those things in me that make me wanna cease to breath 
and ceased to need and ceased to feed, sickness that's in me 
this is all that I can be, I can't breath as I bleed

Tha Producer: 
I don't know why I cut myself, god, give me a sign or help 
I wont cry it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath

I know that my minds near the end, god, I hurt myself and fell 
I wont cry it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath 
push it out my chest till theres nothing left

J-Dog: 
Have you ever met a living legend, just a real friend who planned his 
end and where do I began you said it was pretend 
And when the bullet 
went through it took more then just you, it took two it was you it was 
me and suddenly..... 
How can someone say they're helpless and then they act so 
selfish 
You put me through hell with this so f**k you lets just end 
this 
And what about our friendship and what you did was senseless 
You 
thought you found an exit 
Like I said lets end this 
/Chorus/

I just wanna say good bye, Disappear with no one knowing 
I don't wanna live this lie, smiling to the world unknowing

I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine for the very last time

But tomorrow well be shining brighter 
Well keep it going fighting 
Hold on when we win take a hit 
Cause were never gonna loose it dying 
Were gonna keep on fighting 
And all the days come back to me 
Come back to what we used to be 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
And yesterday we used to say 
We never change and stay the same 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
It gets harder to see what people want me to be 
Its just me being me im just Charlie Scene 
I used to follow my dreams play guitar and scene 
Now were ryhming for beats take it seriously 
I used to flow with jeez and it was a joke to me 
And I would never foresee that I would be a Mc 
When I would skate the streets I had a fake Id 
I carved my name in a tree back when it was J.T 
And now Im telling props cant lie for the rest of our lives 
And thats like getting the permanent high five. 
Cause people like our tight ryhmes 
And hates get a black eye from six crazy white guys 
Im just a guy in a band with a mic in my hand 
Who decided to rap and fell in love with his fans 
And now my flows are the sickest way to 10 by the bitches 
and its getting ridiculous on how many inches my dick is 
Undead Revolution 1, 2, 3, Go! 
And all the days come back to me 
Come back to what we used to be 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
And yesterday we used to say 
We never change and stay the same 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
I was up on the wall with j-o-r 
I got arrested with wes and the scientist 
I used to run with the run my parents sent me away 
Producer showed me how to pharase I like it better this way 
Now well just fuck up this beat the big God 
Shady chain mabye fucked 50 girls a week 
I used to skate on the streets 
And always people would be pulling guns out at me 
I went to heavns last week 
I always dances at his shows heading out the blows 
you see me and Charlie Scene jack chaining the o's 
And our armour sized hold got no omen soul 
It's just me and my girls were taking over the world 
And the servers got a mind like a ceaser 
He writes lyrics eat grapes and fuck his own leisure 
And the funny man he aint african hes Mexican 
Hard headed like republicans undead revolution 
Undead Revolution 1, 2, 3, Go! 
And all the days come back to me 
Come back to what we used to be 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
And yesterday we used to say 
We never change and stay the same 
And in the end well find the rest 
The rest has gone away 
The rest has gone away 
Weve got nothing in this world except for you boys and you girl 
well kill to the top as we laught when you watch.</field>

Only few can see what's wrong 
Millions tend to crawl 
But only those who choose can make it through this all 
Only few can sing like lions 
Cuz we sing until we're gone 
And we've got each others backs 
Until we're back where we belong 
A woman held my shield 
And through the battle we did wrong 
A man who tell me wisdom through the static we were gone 
And maybe when we're gone they'll look into the stars 
Every starts got its ending 
Even when we've learned to rise above it all 
These lies are leading me astray 
It's to much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
And we once also had a story too 
You can see that only good men come in few 
Even in our greatest moments 
We may win or we may lose 
Every songs got its rules 
You've got to learn to make it through 
Maybe one day we can choose 
How it feels to be a woman or a man 
Without rules we're buried underneath 
There's a picture glue 
So when my body burns in ashes only sing the truth 
Let these words strengthen all your views 
Because these words were meant for you 
These lies are leading me astray 
It's to much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
And now I'm floatin right above my coffin as it closes 
I look down and I see ??? 
As she's cryin on my mama's shoulder 
I look up into the sky as the gates of heaven open 
Somethings wrong is this destiny or am I going home 
What will happen to my soul 
Will I come back I don't know 
Will you meet me when it's over and you know 
You can meet me here in heaven 
Don't you ever let me go 
This love, this hate 
Is burning me away 
These lies are leading me astray 
It's to much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
These lies are leading me astray 
It's to much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last sone and then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
This love, this hate 
It's burning me away 
This love, this hate 
Is burning me away</field>

You know, I don't give a fuck what you think and say,

Now I see that motherfucker writin' on the wall 
When you see, J-3-T 
Thirty deep, 
Fuck those haters I see, 
Cause I hate that you breathe, 
I see you duck, 
You little punk, 
You little fucking disease, 
I got H.U 
tatted on the front of my arm, 
Boulevard, 
Brass knuckles in the back of the car, 
Cause we drunk drive Cadillacs- we never go far, 
And when you see us motherfuckers, 
better know who we are. 
I got one thing to say to punk asses who hate, 
Motherfuckers who don't know what, 
You better watch what you say. 
From these industry fucks, 
To these faggot ass punks, 
You don't know what it takes, 
To get this motherfucking truck. 
I'm already loud maybe, 
It?s a little too late, 
Johny's taking hands up, 
with all the faggots who hate, 
Cause I am like God, motherfucker 
and there's a price to pay, 
Yeah, I'm a God, motherfucker and its judgment day!

I'm getting used to this nuisance, 
And all the fags who bad mouth this music, 
It's fuckin stupid and foolish of you to think you can 
do this, 
You cowards can't, never will, don't even try to 
pursue it. 
I took the chance, I payed the bill, 
I nearly died for this music. 
You make me wanna run around, pulling my guns out and 
shit, 
Your tempting me to run my mouth, and call you out on 
this bitch, 
I heard the reason you got to beater to believe any of 
this, 
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump 
off a bridge, 
What? You can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit? 
What? You think I just got lucky and didn't work for 
this shit? 
Bitch 
I've been working at this ever since I was a 
kid, 
I played a million empty shows to only family and 
friends. 
What kind of person gets disembanded and deserves to 
get big? 
I hate to be that person when my verse comes out of 
the kid's lips. 
That shits as worse as it gets. 
This verse is over, I quit.

White boys with tattoos, 
We are pointing right at you, 
We are breaking everything, r-rowdy like a classroom, 
Pack of wolves, 
'Cause we don't follow the rules, 
And when you're running your mouth, 
Our razor blades come out, 
Because its nothing in my mouth except my dick and 
what I spit, 
So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots 
talking shit, 
Speaking of fags, already wrap with the drag, 
We killed him and then we stuffed his body in the 
Cadillac. 
Why you always pressin? 
You know I'm never stressing, 
With fucking DMS, 
J-Johny to my left, 
Got Phantom and the rest, 
Who are down there at the west, 
A grew up by drive-by's and L.A gangsta's, 
So what the fuck do you know about being a gangsta? 
What the fuck do you know about being in danger? 
You ain't doing this, so you know you're just talking 
shit. 
Mad at all the boys because every song is a fucking 
hit.

Couple more drinks bitch, now you're good looking 
Motherfuckin' real hollywood, not some b-list actor

Blowin and bangin, and everyday in the low low

I smoke the douj, when I chill with the cholos 
And y'all smoke pole, cause you chillin' with homos 
I sip patrón, and I chase it with soco 
Pants so low, got my balls in a choke hold 
Bitches getting naked and they're posing for photos 
And hopping on my dick like my shit is a pogo 
So everybody get down, like you just got outta rehab 
Let's get fucked up, put on your helmet and kneepads

I think I've lost my mind 
I think I've lost my mind 
I think I've lost my mind 
Woke up one morning on the sunset strip 
With the half smoked blunt and some blood on my lip 
Hit up the brain for that Mary Jane 
Man, all she had left was menajetwa 
Rolled in the Pink I picked up some Cuervo 
Walking sideways and I'm starting to swerv-o 
Last I was robbed put my money a jumbos 
Wine and dine, tig ol' bitties and bimbos 
Hollywood rap pack, cans in my back pack 
Cruse through your valley and I'm snatchin' your snapback 
Hoppin' on some paint and I think that I'm half black 
Roll another blunt and fuck it up over this track 
I think I've lost my mind 
I'm feeling so alive 
What a pity, it's so pretty 
Looking through the bars and I see my city 
I think I've lost my mind 
I'm feeling so alive 
What a pity, it's so pretty 
Looking through the bars and I see my city 
If everybody gotta be everything they wanna be 
I don't think I think you bichtes sitting right in front of me 
Look into the windows, packing up the pistols 
These bitches talking shit about a Hollywood hit song 
You can come west but you will never be west coast 
Dopin' on these motherfuckers deep in the Desoto 
Oh no, tell me whatcha wanna be 
You can be anything but not another 3 
Got the holy roller, slow blood slow cut 
The mask on the page of a wanted poster 
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see 
The wickedness in you is the wickedness in me 
I think I've lost my mind 
I'm feeling so alive 
What a pity, it's so pretty 
Looking through the bars and I see my city 
I think I've lost my mind 
I'm feeling so alive 
What a pity, it's so pretty 
Looking through the bars and I see my city 
How did I let this happen? 
This life I can't get back from 
The fully loaded magnum 
If you got some questions, ask them! 
I turn into a mad man like Dahmer mixed with Manson 
I take the soul for answer 
make you scream my fucking anthem 
I'm knocking at your door 
I play some back and forth 
You better board up your windows 
'cuz Imma start a war 
Or maybe I'm just trippin' 
This weed has got me spinnin' 
Undead until I die so when I die you know I'm livin' 
I think I've lost my mind 
I think I've lost my mind 
I think I've lost my mind 
I think I've lost my mind 
(x 2) 
I think I've lost my mind 
I'm feeling so alive 
What a pity, it's so pretty 
Looking through the bars and I see my city 
I think I've lost my mind 
I'm feeling so alive 
What a pity, it's so pretty 
Looking through the bars and I see my city</field>

Johnny 3 Tears 
If you can lose it all then welcome to Broadway. 
Silicone dreams and your name on the mockey. 
And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly. 
It's hot here in hell but It's getting real dark, see. 
So why you sick in the bitterness of the lonely. 
All you overdosed in your might as well cofienes. 
Every step, another step you're walking on my dreams. 
Every breath, another breath, you're breathin' when I breathe. 
Now watch them all come, gonna watch the rest go. 
I'm married to the devil, in the city of angels. 
So come, all you wicked, tell the world of the epsy. 
You know I need it all, so baby don't send me. 
I'm knockin' on your door, nope, nobody sent me. 
Just checkin' all you bitches, like I'm checkin' this cheque, see. 
So put your hands up, oh no, don't get soft. 
You can see God when I take my mask off.

The fame's your best friend, you love it, no questions. 
Beating down the door is the face of rejection. 
And once again it's a tragedy ending . 
We never wanted more, we never needed to press in. 
But who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream. 
'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen. 
With the gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky. 
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn't think he can die. 
So grab a pick and an axe, 'cause we try, we cry. 
Into the bottle of Jack we die, inside. 
So when you look in his eyes, watcha see now. 
But all the marks that you make, now watch him bleed out. 
We're in a life, where it's kill the fools. 
Just fly, motherfucker, 'til you hear the truth. 
From under the street, through the gutters of youth. 
Just cry, motherfucker, yeah, I'm talking to you.

Got the top down 
Gonna baptize you bitches 'cause you know you cop out 
Calm down, all you motherfuckers do is talk loud 
You sold out and every single one of you is cold now 
My town, thirty-deep, we're 'bout to fucking roll out 
Look alive as I light up the sky 
And pump up the twelve-gauge and blow off your disguise 
No surprise, there ain't no compromise 
They doped up these motherfuckers 
hit 'em straight in the eyes 
And the one-eyed man is king in the land of the blind 
And so you wanna live forever? But today you will die

Here you lie as I crucify 
You're the boy who will cry and I'm the wolf of goodbye 
And every single page is drawn in blood, can't you see? 
Plus it's because you're triple six feet in the deep 
And I'll send you straight to the afterlife for fucking with me 
Hollywood to the death, undead put you to sleep 
Can't fall, can't die 
Tonight we're so alive 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
We call, you rise 
With you, we never die 
Singing whoa, we own the night

If you wanna throw some blows 
We can go toe to toe 
Kick the door and throw it open 
No one knows, I thought I told 'em 
Thought you had it, now you're choking 
People dropping, bodies folding 
Say undead, two coffins open 
Praying to that holy ghost 
He can't save you, there's no hope 
Looking through that barrel smoke 
Pull the trigger, let it go 
The game just doesn't end the closer 
You can't sink down any lower 
We couldn't get any colder 
With these devils on our shoulders 
Is someone popping shots? Now someone called the cops 
Charlie scene: And when the dust settles 
you know we gon' be on top 
Funny man: Smoking till I'm under six feet on the dock 
Charlie scene: Welcome to the jungle 
we got beef on the block 
Charlie's rolling through your hood, funny at his side 
Looking like a fucking pain parade passing by 
And we hopping out the jeep, if you fuckers wanna die 
Fucking with undead is like committing suicide 
Can't fall, can't die 
Tonight we're so alive 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
We call, you rise 
With you, we never die 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
This time, this time we will all rise 
All rise for the lost lives, lost lives for the last time 
For the last time, we will all rise 
For the last time, we will all rise 
For the last time, we will all rise 
For the last time, we will all rise 
Can't fall, can't die 
Tonight we're so alive 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
We call, you rise 
With you, we never die 
Singing whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night 
Whoa, we own the night</field>

Break through anything I'm face to face with 
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience 
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it 
So put your hands up high 
And wave them side to side 
And when I pull out the nine 
You better wave bye bye

While all these haters get shook 
So put your hands up high

And when I pull out the nine 
You better wave bye bye 
We gonna rise up to the top, we've been through it all 
Been to fucking hell and back, our backs against the wall 
Got the dove and grenade, flag on display 
And every fucking critic's gotta listen when we say 
I do whatever it takes to make it

So just understand nothing gets in my way 
I could show you firsthand if you got something to say 
If you think you can hold me down, you better think twice 
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment every day of my life 
These fucking people always say the same old thing 
But you can't slay or conquer the king 
I'm from a nightmare, but I'm living the dream 
You need to back up if you're not with my team 
'Cause I do whatever it takes to make it 
Break through anything I'm face to face with 
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience 
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it

It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience 
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it 
So put your hands up 
I'm in this like the red blood of a winner, heart of a champion 
Moving through the game, relevant, strong as an elephant 
Face anything that I'm faced, I'm wise and intelligent 
Skills across the field, on the court, king of my regiment 
Train every day, being lazy don't pay 
If you do what it takes, you could rise on your way 
So you did it from the sons of man, Wu-Tang Clan 
Rose from the bottom of the pot to top of the pan 
And if you believe in yourself, then you know that you can 
Do anything you put your heart and mind to, rowing them in 
Flow and expand, flow with the team, keep it serene 
And you win some, you lose some, all part of the dream 
I'll never give up, focused on the goal at hand 
Take my time, do it right, orchestrate with my plan 
Activate, captivate the fans, the name on the brand 
Divided we fall, united we stand 
I do whatever it takes to make it 
Break through anything I'm face to face with 
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience 
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it 
So put your hands up 
Too many lames in my lane, I don't entertain 
Eliminate anything that's in the way 
We in a game full of clones and clowns 
can't even hold your ground 
Boy, you'll never hold the crown 
bitch niggas need ultrasounds 
Cookies by the pound, freshly baked 
forever beg the chase 
Moving through the interstate to get the cake 
Gotta get a plaque for all my niggas that got a case 
You out a captive safe and those who definitely get a cape 
I'm feeling out of place in this room full of fake 
Taking food off my plate, worst move you could make 
Flatline, stainless steel, black nine 
Baow-baow, lay 'em flat 
send 'em back to the other side, bye 
Win or lose, just know I die for my troops 
How you keep it a hundred with those lies in your truth 
You see I been A1 since day one 
just say something different 
You don't live it, there's a difference 
take your bitches by the minute 
I do whatever it takes to make it 
Break through anything I'm face to face with 
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience 
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it 
So put your hands up 
Welcome to the machine 
The nightmare's not far behind but the dream's near 
It's never ending till I'm trending like Supreme gear 
There's nothing clean here, replacing all the soapy shit 
Don't pay him for the dope he spits 
I'm making it with opiates 
Shooting for the moon like I'm racing with the Soviets 
Bring the West back, it's feeling vacant now that Kobe quit 
I'm rolling in your chick's Accord or my '64 
Sipping Coors in a Lincoln Ford, bumping Liquid Swords 
Even if I don't agree what the culture shifted towards 
I'll die without the music kind of like what Jim with The Doors 
They wanna pull me in the gutter like Pennywise 
But I'm wise with the pennies, plenty tried 
instead I steady rise 
I haven't left the streets, barely slept in weeks 
All my equity is dirty and the septic clean 
Kept it G and bypassed the meter, now my grass is greener 
Over white trash and cheaper, motherfucker 
thought you knew, huh? 
I do whatever it takes to make it 
Break through anything I'm face to face with 
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience 
'Cause victory is mine, and I'mma take it

But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
But we don't belong 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
I see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain 
I see the love, I see the hate, I see this world that we can make 
I see the life, I see the sky, Give it all to see you fly 
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred, but you're the ones who made it 
Watch the beauty of all our lies passing right before my eyes 
I hear the hate in all your words, all the words to make us hurt 
We get so sick oh so sick, we never wanted all this 
Medication for the kids with no reason to live 
So we 
March to the drums of the dammed 
as we come 
Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb 
We are young 
But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
We don't belong 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
As we walk among these shadows, in these streets, these fields of battle 
Take it up, we wear the medal, raise your hands with burning candles 
Hear us whisper in the dark, in the rain you see the spark 
Feel the beating of our hearts, fleeting hope as we depart 
All together, walk alone against all we've ever known 
All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home 
But you take all we are; the innocence of our hearts 
Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart 
So we 
March to the drums of the dammed 
as we come 
Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb 
We are young 
But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
We don't belong 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We will fight or we will fall 
Till the angels save us all 
We will fight or we will fall 
Till the angels save us all 
We will fight or we will fall 
Till the angels save us all 
We will fight or we will fall 
Till the angels save us all 
We are young 
But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
We don't belong 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are young 
But we have heart 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong 
We don't belong

            <field name="lyrics">Fuck it, fuck every single memory 
How you're done wrong but who's the real enemy? 
You better figure out not a single thing is meant to be 
The only thing that matters 
how you live before you're put to sleep 
That's how you're living if you're living just to breathe 
I never waste a sentence 
better listen when I speak 
Or you're gonna know the truth 
when they put you underneath 
And no one's gonna listen when you're six feet deep 
I keep my heart tucked in my chest 
I hide it underneath with a bulletproof vest 
Who's next? I, no, I never gave a fuck 
I was too busy dying 
too busy giving up 
Yeah, trust me 
Just breathe 
One day you're gonna see 
Yeah, trust me 
Just breathe 
Otherwise, you're living on your knees 
This is your life, it's do or die 
The sun may never rise again, so be the light, the vision 
This is your life, it's slipping by 
You try to run but fall again, you get back up 
that's living 
Every day I feel like I wanna forget 
And everywhere I go I see the angel of death 
To the left I see what's right 
b-but I hold it in the wrong hand 
It's a fight, I see my life given no chance 
It's hard to wake up, but I wanna believe 
That I'm not alone with a broken dream 
All the glitter ain't gold, don't be naive 
Leave it all behind, just follow me 
Yeah, trust me 
Just breathe 
One day you're gonna see 
Yeah, trust me 
Just breathe 
Otherwise, you're living on your knees 
This is your life, it's do or die 
The sun may never rise again, so be the light, the vision 
This is your life, it's slipping by 
You try to run but fall again 
you get back up, that's living 
Today I finally felt like I wasn't in a dream 
This ain't who I am inside or how it's supposed to be 
My mind is on an endless road 
and I've been losing sleep 
And as the road is trembling 
these demons start to creep 
I can't hold back 
you couldn't stop me if you tried 
You should know that and when the fire burns inside 
You can't hold back anything that never dies 
You should know that, you can't hold back 
This is your life, it's do or die 
The sun may never rise again, so be the light, the vision 
This is your life, it's slipping by 
You try to run but fall again, you get back up 
that's living</field>

Santa's back up in the hood 
So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck 
It's Chanukah in Inglewood 
The dreidles spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the menorah lets get drunk [x2] 
 
J J J Just a little story about last Christmas 
About some bad kids who were full of wishes 
We gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin 
The weird kind of love that you give to your cousin 
Little Timmy stole from 7-11 
So we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens 
We drank in his room with some dude named Kevin 
But there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents 
Zack got caught with a bottle of jack 
So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack 
He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack 
So we took the beer back and I FUCKED HIM IN THE ASS!!! 
It's Charlie Scene got egg nog in my flask 
The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped 
Like oh my god is that saint nick 
Kids give me your list like its the 25th 
Been accused of being a bad kid 
But I get presents as is 
'Cause Mrs. Claus just myspace'd me 
I blew off a date on Christmas eve. 
So I don't give a fuck if your naughty or nice 
You might still get a Rolly (rolex) and a gang on ice 
So write your list and never have no fear 
Have a Hollywood Christmas and an Undead new year!!!! 
Fuck yeah!!! 
 
It's Christmas in Hollywood 
Santa's back up in the hood 
So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck 
It's Chanukah in Inglewood 
The dreidle spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the menorah lets get drunk 
 
bout to serve it up for for all you boys and girls. 
Good kids, bad and even Da Kurlzz. 
We were chillin at home and deckin the halls. 
So I checked my phone and Santa had called. 
He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve. 
He said that his jolly ass needed some help. 
He said Christmas ain't a gang but a way of life. 
"if you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife." 
So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle, 
Funnier than fuck you can ask Chris Kringle. 
So we all took flight but something was fishy. 
He asked for road head and started to kiss me. 
Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows. 
Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildo's. 
I pulled down his beard and it was a monster. 
It wasn't saint nick it was a fuckin imposter. 
When we found out he started to pout. 
I took my bandana and I choked him out. 
I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth. 
Hi-jacked his sleigh and headed down south. 
I had a lot of wild nights but tonight was the craziest, 
Met a lot of Jeff's but this one was shadiest. 
When it comes to cheer that motherfuckers a grinch. 
So if you don't like Christmas Fuck you bitch!!! 
 
It's Christmas in Hollywood 
Santa's back up in the hood 
So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck 
It's Chanukah in Inglewood 
The dreidle spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the menorah lets get drunk 
 
Lets get drunk [x5] 
 
It's Christmas in Hollywood

Cruisin' downtown with the bottle beside me 
Lookin' so fly I got bitches behind me 
Yo I'm in the studio makin' something to dance too 
'Cause these bitches wanna hear something they can shake their ass to 
We up in LA represent Hollywood

So what's good with that, when this song's a wrap 
Deuce in the studio, got bitches in the back 
Smoked out, backseat, dippin' in the taxi 
So what 'cha gonna do when I knock you out foo?

And let me see you work that ass, come on and shake it fast 
Two whiskey hits, JDogs giving shots in the back 
So where my boys at? 
There goes Johnny 3 cruisin' in the Cadillac 
'63 no dubs and that's a fact! 
When you see me on the scene, black shirt, black jeans, 
Tattoos, white shoes 
Runnin' 30 deep foo! 
In the city of LA where it's just another day 
Shooting craps with the Phantom 
Dude thinks he's getting paid!

We're just here to get you out of yo muthafuckin' seat 
And you don't really wanna step to this

You gave me hate, see? 
It saved me and these tears are deadly 
You feel that I rip back, every time you tried to steal that 
You feel bad, you feel sad? 
I'm sorry, hell no fuck that 
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife 
This strife, it dies, this life and these lies 
And these lungs, have sung, this song, for too long, 
And it's true, I hurt too, remember I loved you 
 
I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same 
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no 
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you 
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no 
 
I wish I could have quit you, I wish I never missed you 
And told you that I loved you, every time I fucked you 
The future that we both drew, and all the shit we've been through, 
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew. 
How could you do this to me? 
Look at what I made for you, it never was enough and the world is what I gave to you 
I used to be love struck, now I'm just fucked up, 
Pull up my sleeves and see the pattern of my cuts 
 
And I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same 
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no 
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you 
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no 
 
Seems like all we had is over now you left to rest 
And your tears are dried up now, you just lay without a sound 
Seems like all we had is over now, you left to rest 
And my fears are over now 
I can leave with my head down 
 
And I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same 
I'm sorry oh, I'm sorry no 
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you 
I'm sorry oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry no 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

On the lonely streets of Sunset 
When the lord called upon seven crazy m.c's 
J Dog, Charlie Scene, Johnny 3 Tears, Da Kurlzz, and The Producer 
 
Hey, uh, man you forgot the homie funny man, c'mon 
 
And I can show you how to hump without making love 
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak 
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun 
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak 
 
My clothes are always retro 
Sexual like I'm hetero 
And I play a bitch like Nintendo (Zelda) 
Take her for ride in my Benzo 
Funny as fuck, I should do stand up 
Bust caps at the crowd like I don't give a fuck (fuck you) 
Got a gold ass grill 
Hit me on the sidekick if you wanna chill 
Hop in the ride, let's roll 
I'm a baritone with a voice so low 
It'll make your speakers explode 
And I'll drop your panties to the floor (ah) 
Let me bend you over, let me lay you sideways 
Hop in the back girls, freaky Fridays 
If you got beef, then you better step up bitch 
Hollywood Undead ain't nothin' to fuck with 
 
And I can show you how to hump without making love 
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak 
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun 
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak 
 
Girl, come and smoke my pole like a Marlboro 
Introduce me to your mom as Charles 
It's Charlie Scene, Shake your ass to the bass 
Wait till you see my face, hey bitch 
Wear them tight jeans that show your ass crack 
My first name gives Vietnam flash backs 
I get drunk and do the same old, same old 
Take three girls home and call them Charlies Angels 
What'chu gonna do after we get signed? 
I'm gonna lose my mind 
Get 30 inch spinners and pimp my ride 
Go back in time, be there that night and save 2Pac's life 
Then pay my fine for getting caught fucking on the Hollywood sign 
I got the game on lock 
I'll have a bottle and a glock 
With biceps like The Rock 
Buy Tom's soul back from Rufford Murdock (hey) 
 
And I can show you how to hump without making love 
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak 
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun 
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak 
 
Get down, I'll show you how 
C'mon girl, let me show you how 
Let's get freaky deaky now 
 
And I can show you how to hump without making love 
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak 
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun 
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak 
 
Get down, I'll show you how 
If you got beef, then you better step up bitch 
Hollywood Undead ain't nothing to fuck with 
Get down, I'll show you how 
I'll have a bottle and a glock 
With biceps like The Rock 
Buy Tom's soul back from Rufford Murdock 
 
Bitch, what motherfucker</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Cause I don't wanna be like this 
I've been runnin' these streets 
For too long now 
I've got nothing that's true 
But this song now 
But the further I go 
I wanna go home 
 
Cause I don't wanna be like this 
I've been runnin' these streets 
For too long now 
I've got nothing that's true 
But this song now 
But the further I go 
I wanna go home 
 
I fuckin' swear that I care 
But its hard when you stare 
Into the bottom of a bottle 
That is empty and bare 
All my desolate soul 
In my desolate home 
It's my desolate role 
Yeah I'm here all alone 
I can't think of a reason 
To get the fuck out of bed 
Curtains closed, lights are off 
Am I alive or dead? 
I haven't shaved in a week 
I always slur when I speak 
Tolerance at its peak 
Another fit just to sleep 
Oh woe is me woe is me 
I guess I need love 
Hoes ya see hoes ya see 
I'm just in a rut 
And I swear I'm tryin' baby please 
Baby don't leave 
God-damn I'm a fuck-up 
But I guess that's just me 
So I sit in my room 
And I'll cry in my bed 
Thinkin' about all the shit 
That made me wrong in my head 
I keep tryin' to climb 
But it seems so steep 
Pour myself a fuckin' whisky 
And go back to sleep, bitch 
 
Cause I don't wanna be like this 
I've been runnin' these streets 
For too long now 
I've got nothing that's true 
But this song now 
But the further I go 
I wanna go home 
 
Cause I don't wanna be like this 
I've been runnin' these streets 
For too long now 
I've got nothing that's true 
But this song now 
But the further I go 
I wanna go home 
 
I watch my momma cry 
She says 'baby why?' 
I say 'baby died, 
Baby's gone like a suicide' 
I don't think you'll see him soon, mom 
Stay out my room, mom 
Tell daddy that I hate 
That mother fucker like you, mom 
I sing this shit for you, Danny, Sasha and Jordan 
These beers keep gettin' warmer 
Every time that I hold her 
I pour this out for you 
Like a partner in crime 
It's part of the times 
When you're sick in the mind 
Yeah I'm sick, oh so sick 
I'm so sick of this shit 
Yeah I'm lit, oh so lit 
I'm so fucked up off it 
So I stumble around 
Til I stumble fall down 
To this puddle of my tears 
Layin' here on the ground 
 
When you've got nothing left 
You've got nothing left to lose 
With my last left single breath 
I'll still be singing to you 
So when you bury me man 
You better bury me deep 
And sing along to this song 
Because you're broken like me 
 
Cause I don't wanna be like this 
I've been runnin' these streets 
For too long now 
I've got nothing that's true 
But this song now 
But the further I go 
I wanna go home 
 
Cause I don't wanna be like this 
I've been runnin' these streets 
For too long now 
I've got nothing that's true 
But this song now 
But the further I go 
I wanna go home 
 
And I wanna go back to the start 
Back where we started from 
And I know it's been so long 
I was wrong, I was wrong 
I was wrong all along 
 
And I wanna go back to the start 
Back where we started from 
And I know it's been so long 
I was wrong, I was wrong 
I was wrong all along 
 
Cause I don't wanna be like this 
I've been runnin' these streets 
For too long now 
I've got nothing that's true 
But this song now 
But the further I go 
I wanna go home 
 
Cause I don't wanna be like this

Come on lets 
And you know, we keep the party jumpin' 
So lets keep them 40s comin' 
 
Come on down to the city of L.A 
Where we, we ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
You know how we keep it bumpin' everyday, baby 
We ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
 
Well I ride with jay-dee-oh-gee 
And it's like, K, basically 
We get shit faced and crazy 
We're screaming "fuck the police" 
J-just like easy lets smoke these with Old'E and Charlie 
We mix it over a heartbeat, and run with the Undead Army 
And you don't need to see the best of me 
The best MC, its just a beat, produce the feeds that makes me mean 
That seems to be what makes me scream so what up? 
Let's roll the town fucked up 
Let's sing L.A and show love? 
Yo Jdog, wait, just hold up, take my mic, my PO showed up 
 
Come on down to the city of L.A 
Where we, we ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
You know how we keep it bumpin' everyday, baby 
We ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
 
We're six caucasians, hell raisin' 
Blazin', making zero pay can't wait to drink to stop the pain 
To call Funny to ride with me 
My pants are so low, I'm sipping on this 4-0 
Rollin' in the fo' do' 
Producer, me, and four ho's 
Oh no 
The 5-0's rollin' cold, I didn't stop, but tried to smoke 
Container's open, Funny's smokin' 
I think I'm chokin' it's time to go (oh) 
This midnight tale, let's keep it rollin' 
Keep the fuckin' and Mad Dog flowin' 
Los Angeles we keep it goin' 
Undead is what we're throwin' 
 
Come on down to the city of L.A 
Where we, we ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
You know how we keep it bumpin' everyday, baby 
We ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
 
I keep'em blowin' on my head keeps gettin' fatter everyday, baby 
On TV ya better listen 'cause you know they'll play me 
In the club, you in the corner while my shit go crazy 
And I got my soldiers in the back so you don't wanna face me 
And when your girl looked up at me, I'm lookin' right down 
And all that yappin', you know you gonna' be a smack down 
I stick around to keep it mad while the crowd's loud 
In the city of L.A, that's my hometown 
 
Come on down to the city of L.A 
Where we, we ride with gangsta's and the pimpins' easy 
You know how we keep it bumpin' everyday, baby

            <field name="lyrics">In a time of need only few can see what's wrong 
Millions tend to crawl but only those who choose can make it through this all, 
 
Only few can sing like lions 'cause we sing until we're gone 
And we've got each others backs until we're back where we belong, 
 
A woman held my shield and through the battle we did wrong, 
A man who taught me wisdom through the static we recall, 
 
And maybe when we' re gone our names will echo through the stars, 
Every start's got it's ending even when we've learned to rise above it all, 
 
These lies are leading me astray 
Its too much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song 
And then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
 
And we once also had a story too 
You can see that good men only come in few. 
Even in our greatest moments we may win or we may lose 
Every song's got it's rules, you've got to learn to make it through 
 
Maybe one day we can choose how it feels to be a woman or a man 
Without rules but buried underneath there's a picture glued 
 
So when my body burns in ashes only sing the truth 
Let these words strengthen all your views 
Because these words were meant for you 
 
These lies are leading me astray 
Its too much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song 
And then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
 
An' now I'm floatin' right above my coffin as it closes I look down 
I see sigh as she's cryin on my moma's shoulder 
I look up into the sky as the gates to heaven open somethin's wrong 
Is this destiny or am I goin' home, 
 
What will happen to my soul will I come back I don't know, 
Will you meet me when its over let me know, 
You can meet me here in heaven don't you ever let me go 
 
This love this hate is burning me away 
 
These lies are leading me astray 
Its too much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song 
And then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
 
These lies are leading me astray 
Its too much for me to stay 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly 
 
I see you so please stay strong 
I'll sing you one last song 
And then I'm gone 
I don't wanna live this destiny 
It goes on endlessly

You gave me hate, see? 
It saved me and these tears are deadly 
You feel that I rip back, every time you tried to steal that 
You feel bad, you feel sad? 
I'm sorry, hell no fuck that 
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife 
This strife, it dies, this life and these lies 
And these lungs, have sung, this song, for too long, 
And it's true, I hurt too, remember I loved you 
 
I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same 
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no 
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you 
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no 
 
I wish I could have quit you, I wish I never missed you 
And told you that I loved you, every time I fucked you 
The future that we both drew, and all the shit we've been through, 
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew. 
How could you do this to me? 
Look at what I made for you, it never was enough and the world is what I gave to you 
I used to be love struck, now I'm just fucked up, 
Pull up my sleeves and see the pattern of my cuts 
 
And I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same 
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no 
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you 
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no 
 
Seems like all we had is over now you left to rest 
And your tears are dried up now, you just lay without a sound 
Seems like all we had is over now, you left to rest 
And my fears are over now 
I can leave with my head down 
 
And I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same 
I'm sorry oh, I'm sorry no 
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you 
I'm sorry oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry no

California show me love 
Get buzzed, let's get fucked up 
California throw it up 
Get buzzed, let's get fucked up 
California show me love 
Get buzzed, let's get fucked up 
California, so high we'll ride all night 
 
Comin' straight outta Cali (what?) 
The 818 valley (what?!) 
323! Fuckin' horse night alley 
And from Highland to Clayton, all these bitches are hatin' 
Cause the shit that we're saying, is the shit that they're playin' 
If we don't make it we'll take it 
If ain't real then we'll fake it 
Open your mouth and I'll break it, don't give a fuck it you hate it! 
We're looking for the 6 chicks, down with the 6 dicks 
Rollin' all day, gettin' buzzed its ridiculous 
Horny like the sickness 
Quickies with the quickness 
Pussy like its business 
Work it like its fitness 
Listen while I spit this, gamin' all these bitches 
Now I'm gonna hit this, and fuck until I'm dickless! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Let's get girls in the front and the sluts in the back 
Let's push 'em all together and put 'em on our laps 
Alcohol and drugs and California love 
They got me ready to party on this sweetened Bacardi 
From the north to the south, this state's all about 
Silicon lips and all the fake tits! 
California girls; best in the world 
Best in the back seat; so lets get fuckin' nasty! 
I'm a pirate on the streets of C-California 
Movin' and cruisin', we're boozin' all night to the mornin' 
So from dust 'till dawn, you know Undead is always on 
Hit it once like a bomb 
Hit it twice and then I'm gone! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
You don't wanna step on us, we leave the club fucked up 
Come on down and say "What's up?" 
Don't front 'cause I ain't buzzed 
Johnny's here to fuck you up 
J-D-O-G pass the 40 up 
You know I'll be here all night 
And Undead 'till the day we die

You know we got plan held up pointin' at your head 
Laying on your back but your better off dead 
Got the army would made 
With the dove and grenade 
Got the pin pulled out its a fuckin' air raid! 
We ride like tanks and we bite like snakes 
Search and destroy we do whatever it takes

When the shelves hit the floor 
Get undead

The next time you breath you better think of me 
And your parents thank god for the mercy of me 
And eye for an eye but I don't need to see 
Look at these eyes motherfucker I can feel you bleed! 
I gotta black in the attic and the bitch is gold 
Notta nother word till I'm platinum no 
A critics are shit watch a bitch get rolled 
I only say bitch when I see a fucka so

There's no way its doomsday 
These true saints better raise my two face so touche 
You gone past your due date do you crave 
Scene givin' you a grenade to pay 
Down your knees crying for help 
And your just gonna be another notch on the belt

And you can only blame yourself get undead 
And I will make it rain in hell!

Grab beer 
Grab rear 
Shave beard 
Put on some scene gear 
Gotta get drunk before my mom wakes up 
Break up, with my girlfriend so I can bang sluts 
I'm undead 
Unfed 
Been sleeping on, bunk beds, since 10 
So if I don't booze it 
I'm gonna lose it 
Everybody get to it 
Do it 
Get ruined.

When I start drinking 
My dick does all my thinking 
Hoes want to be scene with me 
And I like their big fake titties 
D cup with extra filling 
Take it out let me lick it quickly 
Calm down its just a hickie 
I'll blame it on this whisky sipping gets me tipsy 
Drink fast and enjoy your buzz 
Take back street to avoid the fuzz 
I wanna take you home but your friends won't let ya 
I gotta 40 in my ford fiesta 
Buy beer 
Or pay the rent 
My signing bonus was quickly spent 
So I beat my meat like I'm a fucking butcher 
And I punk the pussy like I'm ashton kutcher

Lets get this party jumpin' 
Lets see some 40 chuggin' 
I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick when I start buzzin' 
C'mon girl I wanna see you drinkin' 
I wanna see your brain start shrinkin' 
Make a move I saw you winkin' 
Drunkin' pussy's what I'm thinking 
I don't give a fuck if your drunk or not 
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance 
Grab two hoes and do some body shots 
I wanna party all night till they call the cops 
Fuck a wrist band 
Lets all do a keg stand 
Like a cheech without the chong 
Hitting up the beer bong 
When the cops show up 
They're gonna get the finger 
And I don't give a fuck cause I'm the designated drinker

How soft your fields so green, 
Can whisper tales of gore, 
Of how we calmed the tides of war

If you hate on Undead that's a party foul. 
I only drink Mickey's I can't afford the cans. 
I drink so much they call me Charlie 40 Hands. 
 
If the keg is tapped, 
Then your getting capped, 
Take your girl to the

You got your beer gog's on 
And I'm getting ass. 
Like, oh my god, 
Is that Charlie Scene? 
 
Ladies show me your 
Treats like its Halloween. 
You got a fake I.D. and your 17. 
I'm a complete catastrophe 
Buzzing around you like a bumble bee. 
 
So let's take some shots, 
Do a beer run and flip off a cop. 
Girls give me props and there on my jock. 
Paris Hilton said, That's hot 
When she saw my cock! That's hot!

You can ask Bob Saggot. 
 
I never claimed that 
I knew how to dance 
But I'll get drunk, get high, 
Pull down my pants. 
So fuck 5 bucks just fill up my cup. 
 
Don't kiss me bitch, you just threw up. 
Now I'm drunk as fuck about to pass out, 
Destination your mothers couch. 
Dude is it true that you screwed my mom? 
Fuck yeah bro that pussy was bomb! 
 
So I'm hopping, jumping, 
Sipping, and skipping. 
Its nights like these that 
We all love living. 
So take out your hands 
And throw the H.U. up. 
Now wave it around like 
You don't give a fuck. 
Check please! 
 
And all the kids in the hood 
Come on wave and shake your hands, 
Hollywood we never going down. 
And when you're drunk shake that ass 
Like you know how to dance. 
Hollywood we never going down. 
 
Can't stop, wont stop,

Can't stop, wont stop, 
Johny make the booty drop 
Can't stop, wont stop,

My insides scream so loud 
They keep watching, 
Watching me drowned, 
How did it come to this 
 
How did it come to this? 
How did I know it was you? 
It was a bad dream? 
Asphyxiated and watch me bleed 
The life support was cut, 
The knot was too tight, 
They push and pull me but 
They know they'll never win 
 
[Chorus] 
Throw it all away throw it all away 
I keep on screaming but 
There's really nothing left to say 
So get away, just get away 
I keep on fighting but 
I can't keep going on this way 
 
I can't keep going, 
Can't keep going on like this, 
They make me sick, 
And I get so sick of it, 
Cause they won't let me, 
They won't let me breath, 
Why can't they let me be? 
 
Why can't they let me be? 
Why don't I know what I am? 
I force this hate into my heart 
Cause it's my only friend, 
My lips are sewn shut, 
I watch my self bleed, 
They push and pull me 
And it's killing me within 
 
[Chorus] 
 
I can't keep going, 
Can't keep going on this way 
I can't keep going, 
Can't keep going on this way 
 
My heart beat stumbles and 
My back bone crumbles 
I feel is it real as 
The lynch mob doubles? 
 
They want blood and they'll kill for it, 
Drain me and they'll kneel for it 
Burn me at the stake met 
The devil made the deal for it. 
 
Guillotine dreams, yeah, 
They're guillotine gleams, 
The blood of they're enemies 
Watching while they sense me. 
 
Sentencing ceased, sentence 
Diseased and watch them bask 
In the glory of their holy disease 
 
[Chorus] 
 
I keep on running, 
I keep on running 
I keep on running 
But I can't keep 
Going on this way 
 
I keep on running 
I keep on running again 
But I can't keep 
Going on this way</field>

Johnny breathes weed 
Still, Johnny don't see anything! 
Johnny buys drink 
Johnny winks and Johnny thinks 
Johnny circles dance floor like roller rink 
Jump up down down in the H-town get down 
To the sound that's bound 
To make the motherfucking crowd loud 
Wanna see you move, yeah move to the music 
Wanna see you booze, yeah booze 'til you puke it 
See bitch, grab ass 
Get smacked to the mat (bitch!) 
Slap back, get thrown out the back 
Watch your back through the back door

You better get up out the way, 
Tomorrow we'll rise so we fight today, 
And no, I don't give a 
Fuck what you think and say, 
Cause we are gonna rock 
This whole place anyway. 
(Undead!) 
 
Now I see that mother 
Fucker writing on the wall 
When you see, J-3-T, 30 D bra, 
Fuck those haters I see, 
Cause I hate that you breathe, 
 
I see you duck, you little punk, 
You little fucking disease, 
I got H.U. tatted on the front of my arm, 
The Boulevard, brass knuckles 
In the back of the car, 
Cause we drunk drive Cadillacs, we never go far, 
And when you see us mother fucker's, 
Better know who we are. 
 
I got one thing to say 
To punk asses who hate, 
Mother fucker's who don't know what, 
You better watch what you say. 
 
From these industry fucks, 
To these fagot ass punks, 
You don't know what it takes, 
To get this mother fucker drunk. 
 
I'm already loud maybe, 
It's a little too late, 
Johnny's taking heads off, 
Of all the fagots who hate, 
Cause I am good mother fucker 
And there's a price to pay, 
Get out my gun, mother fucker 
And it's judgment day! 
 
[Chorus:Repeat x2] 
 
I'm getting used to this nuisance, 
And all the fags who bad mouth this music, 
How fucking stupid and foolish 
Of you to think you can do this, 
You cowards can't, you never will, 
Don't even try to pursue it. 
I took the chance, I played the pill, 
I nearly died for this music. 
 
You make me wanna run around, 
Pulling my guns out and shit, 
Your tempting me to run my mouth, 
And call you out on this bitch, 
How ignorant you gotta be, 
To believe any of this, 
You need to slit your wrist, 
Get pissed and go jump off a bridge, 
 
What? You can't see the 
Sarcasm in the verses I spit? 
What? You think I just got lucky 
And didn't work for this shit? 
Bitch. I've been working at 
This ever since I was a kid, 
I played a million empty shows 
To only family and friends. 
 
What kind of person can 
Dis a band that deserves to get big? 
I hate to be that person when 
My verse comes out of the kid's lips. 
 
That shits as worse as it gets. 
This verse is over, I quit. 
Signed Charlie Sheen 
On your girlfriend's tits. 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
White boys with tattoos, 
We are pointing right at you, 
We are breaking everything, 
R-rowdy like a classroom, pack of wolves, 
Cause we don't follow the rules, 
And when you're running your mouth, 
Our razor blades come out, 
 
Why you always pressing? 
You know I'm never stressing, 
With fucking D-M-S, 
J-Johnny to my left, 
Got Phantom and the rest, 
Who are down there at the west, 
A grew up by drive-by's and LA gang signs, 
 
So what the fuck do you 
Know about being a gangsta? 
What the fuck do you know 
About being in danger? 
You ain't doing this, 
So you know your just talking shit. 
Mad at all the boys because 
Every song is a fucking hit.

Girls got a bag of sniffers 
Wanna do the no no 
Yeah back to the bus 
It's the end of the night 
Get back to the bus 
And get out of my life 
'Cause I got people to see 
Hoes as freaky as me 
I roll it to the after party with my boy Charles P. 
Picked up a few friends 
Now I'm dippin' with bitches 
Slapped the bitches to my right 
I said click it or ticket 
Girl feeling my ride 
Now she's getting suspicious 
 
This a brand new Miata 
As I'm hittin' them switches 
I ride behind Charlie 
As he's poppin' a wheelie 
I finally made it to the party 
Now he's coppin' a feely 
See Da Kurluzz out front doing tricks on his Heely's 
Now I'm finna get down yelling somebody beer me 
 
So chug this beer with me 
Get drunk with Charlie Scene 
Sense this urgency 
'Cause I ain't tryna get drunk alone 
So smoke this joint with me 
Get high off Funny's weed 
Sense this urgency 
'Cause I ain't tryna get high alone 
 
I roll up to the party in my Honda 
Funny followed me in his Mazda Miata 
Damn what a balla 
Top down what a primadonna 
The spinners that he bought 
Straight outta auto zone for thirty dollars 
Money we have nadda 
 
Let's go inside I'll folla 
They didn't let us in 
So we hopped a 
Wall but I dropped ya 
That's when I lost ya 
I didn't try ta call ya 
I rain into a crowd of Celebrities and Papa-razzi and they shot a 
Pictures of me and Dennis  Harper 
 
Now I need a doctor 
Yo little Jhon-ya 
Crunk juice and Vodka 
Is turning me into a monster 
One more shot and imma gon-ah 
 
But Charlie Scene I saw ya stick your dick in the salsa 
 
I don't want no drama 
I'd rather have my anaconda 
Deep throated by Piranas 
 
So takes these pills with me 
Got 'em from J-D-O-G 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I don't wanna get high alone 
So take this Ecstasy 
They must be J3T's 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I ain't tryna get down alone 
 
Hey who's goin' to the rave tonight huh? 
Hey we'll see Da Kurlzz there 
He'll be there rave poppin' 
Ah Odaele'...Fool...Who wants to get pussy? 
 
So chug this beer with me 
Get drunk with Charlie Scene

I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out my chest 
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find 
But maybe I won't, because I left it all behind 
Now I'm stuck with this, and that'll never change 
Always a part of me, until the very last day 
Where to go from here? What road to travel on? 
I spent my whole life choosing, and it always chose wrong 
Will I try to have the will to be alive? 
Will I try because I've never seen the light? 
Blow it to the ground and it's now you see 
You spent your whole life taking the best of me 
 
Where'd you go? 
Where's your home? 
How'd you end up all alone? 
Can you hear me now? 
There's no light, there's no sound 
Hard to breathe, when you're underground 
Can you hear me now? 
Hear me now 
 
How long can I keep pretending to be? 
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me 
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees 
A man of many words, but a man of few deeds 
Walking these streets, so absent of hope 
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home 
Lend him a hand, then we're walking the way 
Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame 
So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight 
When you wake up, you know it's darker than last night 
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by 
Born to walk away, been walking my whole life 
 
Where'd you go? 
Where's your home? 
How'd you end up all alone? 
Can you hear me now? 
There's no light, there's no sound 
Hard to breathe, when you're underground 
Can you hear me now? 
Hear me now 
 
Look into my eyes and I see 
What do I see? 
Nothing at all (nothing at all) 
Take another look around me 
What do I see? 
Nothing at all 
 
Where'd you go? 
Where's your home? 
How'd you end up all alone? 
Can you hear me now? 
There's no light, there's no sound 
Hard to breathe, when you're underground 
Can you hear me now? 
Hear me now 
 
Can you hear me?

He asked your sister out so that he could cheat on her 
What a creep loner, shit I couldn't sink lower 
You just got a mean boner from a Charlie Scene poster 
If I'm poppin' a wheelie it means I'm jackin' your bike 
Got my middle finger raised as I'm runnin' red lights 
I'm known to punch 'em in the dick at the end of a fight 
And I never say I'm sorry at the end of the night.

So many dollars stuffed in my wallet 
Chain so bling yeah you know that I'm a baller 
We can take the blame cause your parents don't wanna 
They roll their blunts with your marijuana 
How can I run when the pigs got a chopper 
I got a gun but they got a lotta 
Shootin' at the sky with a mother fuckin' sawed off 
God bless a Catholic forgive me father 
Now what's a man to do when another holds a Bible 
A lot of kids suein me holdin' me liable 
Reflections of a kid and they call him suicidal 
Dead beat such a sinner but we call him a child 
How can you blame him a play ground they're dealin' 
The mother still buyin' and the father still preachin' 
And now it's up to me cause no one's gonna teach him 
Now nobody, nobody needs 'em.

It'll make you beg for more, until you can't even breathe 
Your blindfold is on tight, but you like what you see 
So follow me into the night, 'cause I got just what you need 
We're all rollin' down the boulevard, full of pimps and sharks 
It's a motherfuckin' riot, we've been dying to start 
You better grab a hold 'cause now you know your falling apart 
You thought these streets were paved in gold 
But their dirty and dark 
 
Been to hell 
I can show you the devil! 
Down you fell 
Can't hold yourself together! 
Soul to sell 
Down here you live forever! 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares! 
Been to hell

Down you fell 
Can't hold yourself together! 
Soul to sell 
Down here you live forever! 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares! 
Nightmares! 
Welcome! 
 
In the belly of the beast, I'm a wolf amongst the sheep, 
At the bottom of the hill, but at the top of the street 
Above the boulevard, schoolyard, victim of deceit 
And you're runnin' hard, but this wolf is always at your feet 
And you've seen it all before, but the wolf's outside your door 
And you're old enough to run, you ain't hiding anymore 
Another victim of the star spangled banner of the street 
Now you're in the world of wolves 
And we welcome all you sheep 
 
Been to hell 
I can show you the devil! 
Down you fell 
Can't hold yourself together!

Down here you live forever! 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares! 
Been to hell

Soul to sell 
Down here you live forever! 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares! 
Nightmares! 
Welcome! 
 
You need to wake up and face it, 
So you can taste my reality 
Now you're stuck in this place you hate, 
And you came here so happily 
Then it made you lose your faith, 
And that's what fucked with your sanity 
Say goodbye to your soul and say hello to your vanity 
Hollywood is your friend, and the undead are your family 
We'll take you to the edge, and turn your regret into agony 
And I'll never let you go, 'cause I know you'll come back to me 
I'm the reason you came here 
I'm the American tragedy 
 
Been to hell 
I can show you the devil! 
Down you fell 
Can't hold yourself together! 
Soul to sell 
Down here you live forever! 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares! 
Been to hell

Down you fell 
Can't hold yourself together! 
Soul to sell 
Down here you live forever! 
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares! 
Nightmares! 
Welcome! 
 
Welcome!

            <field name="lyrics">My legs are dangling off the edge, 
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend, 
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
A stomach full of pills didn't work again, 
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone. 
 
Gone too far and yeah I'm gone again, 
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends, 
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends, 
Ones a bottle of pills, ones a bottle of gin, 
I'm twenty stories up, yeah I'm up at the top, 
I'll polish off this bottle, now it's pushing me off, 
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft, 
I bet my momma found my letter, now shes calling the cops, 
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it, 
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance, 
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent, 
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is, 
I've been trying too long, with too dull of a knife, 
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice, 
I never bought a suit before in my life, 
But when you go to meet god, you know you wanna look nice. 
 
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow, 
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow. 
 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend, 
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
A stomach full of pills didn't work again, 
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
 
We hit the sky, there goes the light, 
No more sun, why's it always night 
When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream, 
When you can't dream, well, whats life mean? 
We feel a little pity, but don't empathize 
The old are getting older, watch a young man die, 
A Mother and a Son and someone you know, 
Smile at each other and realize you don't, 
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised, 
What happened to the Father, who swore he'd stay? 
I didn't know 'cause you didn't say, 
Now Momma feels guilt, yea Momma feels pain, 
When you were young, you never thought you'd die, 
Found that you could but too scared to try, 
You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye, 
Climb to the roof to see if you could fly. 
 
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow, 
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow. 
 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend, 
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, 
My legs are dangling off the edge, 
A stomach full of pills didn't work again, 
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. 
 
I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky, 
Like a bird so high, 
Oh I might just try, 
I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky, 
Like a bird so high, 
Oh I might just try, 
Oh I might just try.</field>

(Go raise it up, go raise it up) 
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up 
(Go fill it up, go fill it up) 
 
I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patron 
I wanna girl in my lap with a Jagerbomb 
I'm comin' in hot, ya heard me 
And I'ma make it rain on the girl who serves me 
 
I drink a fifth of vodka til it's gone 
And if it feels so good than it can't be wrong 
I'm comin' in hot, ya heard me 
We keep takin' shots, and if not, you nerdy 
 
We only leave a clean party to go party some more 
I'm already shitfaced before I walk in the door 
This girl's rubbin' on my leg, I never met her before 
And now she's makin' her way onto my gentleman's sword 
 
It might be the drugs talkin' or the shots of Patron 
But these bitches look like models and they're ready to bone 
I take 'em back to my parents house and we'll be home alone 
Slap some chicks and blah blah blah like Macaulay Culkin 
 
She's tearin' it up, yeah she's dancin' her ass off 
This girl's like a Mac the way she's ridin' my laptop 
I'm tryin' to get my rocks off so don't try to cockblock 
I'll grab my sawed-off and blow your cock off 
 
You know we drink so much, we gettin' drunk for weeks 
We drink so much Goose, we turnin' into geese 
Me and my crew slidin' in through VIP 
These bitches play my skin flute like they're Kenny G 
 
I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patron 
I wanna girl in my lap with a Jagerbomb 
I'm comin' in hot, ya heard me

If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up 
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up 
If you had too much, go throw it up 
And If you ain't got shit, throw ya hands up 
 
Yo, I roll dump drunk on my Razor 
Fuck all the haters 
Packin' a fat glass of Jager 
 
And I'm drinkin' Makers 
Don't need a chaser 
Ordered it 'cause we're mind erasers 
 
Grab the party favors 
Save those for later 
I'm a team player 
Take ya shots like the Lakers 
 
Check out the Gators 
Yes, I'm a gangster 
And I got my ice on my neck 
Ben and Glaciers 
 
Now it's time to blazer 
Who's got the paper? 
I heard there's an afterparty up at John Mayers 
 
Hope it's a kegger 
Nope, but it's catered 
'Bout to squeeze buns like a baker 
 
Girl, you're in danger 
Run like a hanger 
And I'm bout to black out like I'm Darth Vader 
 
So grab my lightsaber 
Savor the flavor 
Yeah you know these bitches love singin like a sailor 
 
I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patron 
I wanna girl in my lap with a Jagerbomb 
I'm comin' in hot, ya heard me

            <field name="lyrics">I just can't escape 
It's like you're here with me now 
But the words you say 
They always seem to fade out 
Since you been away 
I'm just a face in the crowd 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back 
 
Down in the dirt 
With your blood on my hands 
I blacked out 
But now I do understand 
That you were too good 
For this world so you left it 
Everything turned red 
And then you made an exit 
I don't even know 
If it was your time 
But like all good things 
That pass you by 
Its like a lost soul 
In the time of need 
It made my grow up fast 
And put some blood on my knees 
And you don't even know 
What's beyond you 
Thinking you could never die 
Like you're bullet proof 
So I guess you had to leave 
You were born with wings 
But you were never happy 
Til the angels sing 
 
I just can't escape 
It's like you're here with me now 
But the words you say 
They always seem to fade out 
Since you been away 
I'm just a face in the crowd 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back down 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back down 
 
I'm ashes to ashes 
I'm dust to dust 
And when a man 
Turns to ashes 
Forget about love 
Like the feeling inside you 
With the bottle beside you 
You both end up empty 
Like an angel just died too 
I look to the heavens 
To the sky and the rest 
I looked inside myself 
I felt my heart in my chest 
Something so point blue 
There's nothing to say 
Some hearts to stay true 
When falling away 
Come lay down beside me 
What could unlock mean 
It's only what I've seen 
It's only just one dream 
Tell my baby I love her 
And I wish I could hold her 
It's hard to say goodbye 
When you know that it's over 
 
I just can't escape 
It's like you're here with me now 
But the words you say 
They always seem to fade out 
Since you been away 
I'm just a face in the crowd 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back down 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back down 
One day, one day 
I know you're coming back down 
 
I know you're coming back 
Know you're coming back 
I know you're coming back down 
 
I know you're coming back 
Know you're coming back 
I know you're coming back down (down) 
 
I know you're coming back 
Know you're coming back 
I know you're coming back down 
 
I know you're coming back 
Know you're coming back 
I know you're coming back down 
 
I know you're coming back down 
 
I just can't escape 
It's like you're here with me now 
But the words you say 
They always seem to fade out 
Since you been away 
I'm just a face in the crowd 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back down 
Someday, someday 
I know you're coming back down 
One day, one day 
I know you're coming back down</field>

My c-walks too hot I done ripped my Sean Jean 
Smellin' so fly I got the Hugo Boss on 
You got the type of booty I'd like to put my paws on 
We can roll in the fiesta just to get our floss on 
I got the speakers bumpin' straight bangin' the Thong Song 
Got my hair did got my shit braided up 
Rollin with Funny Man and he's breakin' a blunt 
Snatch it outta his hand and now I'm blazin' it up 
Took another sip of Henny now I'm faded as fuck 
Yo Charlie Scene tell me where you got them shades at 
You know I've had this OG style since way back

Hold up and let me lace up the Timbs

I wanna hit the dance floor and thrust my pelvis 
I look so good I make your boxers jealous 
So I parked the Huffy kicked down the kick stand 
Paid the twenty dollar cover and I got me a wrist band 
Got bitches to my neck like I'm standin' in quick sand 
You talk to me twice you better talk to my pimp hand 
Got the Lakers jersey got the platinum chain 
Two Blue-tooths and a pinky ring 
Gettin' drunk as fuck from that tangeray 
Beer googles on I'm talkin' to a grenade 
Yo, Charlie Scene tell me how you got so flossy 
It isn't my fault that all the ladies want me 
I just roll with the posse that's cool like Fonzy 
And known to be flashier than paparazzi 
 
Gangsta 
Got my diamond earrings 
Gangsta 
Gotta turn you on 
So gangsta 
'Cause I'm real sexy

All the ladies in the world just dyin' to meet me 
'Cause nothin' about me is ever cheesy 
I'll get you in the bed and make it squeeky squeeky 
Lookin' so damn fly as I hit the club 
Low ride west side yes we throwin' it up 
Make my way to the dance floor to burn it up

            <field name="lyrics">Welcome to the world you see 
An AK with a couple magazines 
Too slut it is, don't matter to me 
Scatter the ashes on the seven seas 
That sickness, that feeling inside you 
That's weakness, don't let it divide you 
Keep this, that feeling of pride too 
Digging up bones which buried the truth 
 
Children, hypocrisy, 
That's what I give, you can take it from me 
If you don't, wont live to see 
One last act of tragedy 
A mothers heart can make me humble 
No life lost can make me stumble 
Our empire will never crumble 
 
We did it for the glory 
The glory 
Only the glory 
We live inside a story 
It's a story 
All for the glory 
 
Bullets, begin to strip 
A man of reason 
He's a man of sin 
The men of treason are the ones who live 
They'll take whatcha got, whatcha got to give 
Then pyre, a trial by fire 
They're liars like we don't pyres 
The letter to a mother from across the sea 
The son in a box buried beneath 
For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for the 
For whom they saw when they put you to sleep 
A deal with the devil is a deal with me 
That deal is forever, as long as you breathe 
Go forth child, make us proud 
Honor is yours, underground 
Know we love you, lay you down 
 
We did it for the glory 
The glory 
Only the glory 
We live inside a story 
It's a story 
All for the glory 
 
Nobody runs 
Nobody runs 
Nobody runs or makes it out alive 
Nobody runs 
Nobody runs 
Nobody runs or makes it out alive 
 
Hearts beating faster running to the front line 
Nobody runs or makes it out alive 
Look up to Heaven as it rains from the sky 
Nobody runs or makes it out alive 
 
Out alive 
Because we did it for the glory 
The glory 
Only the glory 
We live inside a story 
It's a story 
All for the glory 
 
The glory 
The glory 
The glory 
We did it for the glory 
The glory 
For the glory</field>

So you're gonna have to 
 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die, 
No I don't wanna die 
So you're gonna have to 
 
Blood is getter hotter 
Body's getting colder 
I've told you once, 
I'm the only one who holds her 
 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die 
So you're gonna have to 
 
I look inside of myself, 
And try to find someone else 
Someone who's willing to die, 
Instead of watching you cry for help. 
I know that blood will be spilled, 
And if you wont, then I will. 
My grave will never be filled, 
It's either kill or be killed. 
So let heaven be told, 
That some may come some may go, 
Where I'll end up, I don't know. 
But I ain't dying alone, 
I keep on asking the question, 
"Can I be saved by confession?" 
You see this blood on my hands at least there's no reaching to Heaven. 
I got to pick up the pieces, 
I got to bury them deep 
And when you look into my eyes 
I'll be the last thing you see 
 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die 
So you're gonna have to. 
 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die, 
No I don't wanna die 
So you're gonna have to. 
 
Words turned into blood, and the blood keeps on pouring, 
From every pour I wipe it up, cause this just could be the moment 
Now someone gotta die and now my only opponent 
'Cause I won't watch my baby cry, 
So I keep on just going. 
Am I a man or a beast, 
Its mother nature at least 
Watch humanity cease, 
Cause it's our human disease. 
You got to kill when you gotta kill, 
Yeah that's what they say. 
And I can't go against God's will, 
You better pray 
'Cause I'm an angel, a demon. 
Yeah I'm hell and I'm heaven 
I'm everything you couldn't be, now you believe in the devil. 
I got to pick up the pieces, I got to bury them deep 
And when the dirt hits the coffin 
Just go to sleep. 
 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die 
So you're gonna have to. 
 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die, 
No I don't wanna die 
So you're gonna have to. 
 
Blood is getter hotter 
Body's getting colder 
 
I've told you once, 
I'm the only one who holds her 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die 
 
Now that I see 
I see you buried 
Six feet below. 
 
Another life, goes into the night. 
I couldn't let him breathe, 
'Cause I didn't wanna die 
 
Now that I see 
I see you buried 
Six feet below. 
 
It's not alright 
Can't you hear me as I cry? 
I couldn't let you live, 
'Cause I didn't wanna die 
 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die, 
No I don't wanna die 
 
I don't wanna die, 
I don't wanna die,

Fuck you, I'm by myself 
Is it a true or lie? 
It's what you can't deny. 
'Cause it's the whay you think 
Mix with the pills and drink 
Brought back to the way you are 
Flowed up to there, close to God 
You know that hiding ain't gonna keep you safe 
Because the tears on your face 
They leak and leave a trace 
So just when you think the true love's begun 
It goes off at any second just like a loaded gun 
 
You know, I can take you straight to heaven if you let me, 
You know I, I can make your body levitate if you let me, 
You know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate, 
I can make your body levitate, le-levitate! (you know) 
 
Can't stop the feeling, 
High as a ceiling 
I got the money who's fuckin' dealin' 
I feel the heat like the barrel of a gun 
I forgot the last time I saw the sun 
I've got a disease 
It's digging deeper in me 
It's like my mind is leaving, 
But my heart keeps beating 
So I'll paint the walls, drip from the nose 
But where it goes, nobody really knows 
Hit the bottle and she's starting to follow 
I fall asleep there ain't no tomorrow 
Guns are far, nobody can save me 
Who needs you when I've got my baby 
My baby is beautiful she loves me true 
But if she dies I hope I die too!! 
 
You know, I can take you straight to heaven if you let me, 
You know I, I can make your body levitate if you let me, 
You know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate, 
I can make your body levitate, le-levitate! (you know) 
 
I put down another sack of them 
Then it's straight back to the flask again 
I can't help stop what's happening 
One the wrong track, yeah, I'm back again 
Up shit creek and I'm paddling 
Blacked out room and I'm travelin' 
Good ideas I'm liking them 
I'm too fucked up now I'm babbling 
Wondering how to fix these damages 
All these goddamn damages 
Covering myself with bandages 
From all these goddamn damages 
Wondering how to fix all these damages 
All these goddamn damages 
Covering myself with bandages 
From all these goddamn damages 
 
You know, I can take you straight to heaven if you let me, 
You know I, I can make your body levitate if you let me, 
You know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate, 
I can make your body levitate, le-levitate! (you know)</field>

You're talking too loud 
So just shut your mouth 
Who the fuck are you now? 
 
Lights out 
Can you feel it now? 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now? 
 
Lifestyles of the young and the reckless 
Checked in the real world that don't ask questions 
Dodging on bullets like a fucked up western 
Dragged you on a rope til you're choked out senseless 
Kings or crown we're the best around 
Got an underground army yeah we holding it down 
We built our base and what we found 
It takes blood and sweat and always moving the crowd 
No skill then you're going the fast way 
Let me see you dance on from the AK 
Bullshit now he's dropping names, 
Who you know, what you doing all sounds the same 
A piece of advice quit dropping mine 
You're be done way before it even it is your time 
Like a stripper in a cage making minimum wage 
You're be done like a dollar bill hitting the stage 
 
Lights out 
You're talking too loud 
So just shut your mouth 
Who the fuck are you now? 
 
Lights out 
Can you feel it now? 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now? 
 
I'm gonna wake your ass up 'cause you ain't got what it takes 
You crews ridin' my nuts so tell you how my dick tastes 
Yeah I'm shit faced and all black looking creepy 
It's Charlie Scene this shit is way too easy 
I'm gonna give it to you quick going straight to your throat 
Put the burner in your mouth and turn you in to a ghost 
All these people making music with nothing to show 
Who doesn't have a band? Shit I don't know 
What kind of sane person drops his own name 
What kind of sane person boos his own band off stage 
What kind of sane person drops a verse like this 
Damn this ain't working I'm just too damn sick 
Dudes coming out here's got me provoked 
I'm gonna cut your ass up like a line of coke 
I'm gonna roll your crew up like a fat ass roach 
Put you in my ashtray 'cause you just got smoked 
 
Lights out 
You're talking too loud 
So just shut your mouth 
Who the fuck are you now? 
 
Lights out 
Can you feel it now? 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now? 
 
Another classic case you crash and burn 
And it's true you're dead now 
It's light out, your last song 
The world has turned it's face you'll never find 
And it's true you're dead now 
It's light out, your last song 
Walls are closing in, their falling down 
 
Lights out 
You're talking too loud 
So just shut your mouth 
Who the fuck are you now? 
 
Lights out 
Can you feel it now? 
We're calling you out 
Who the fuck are you now? 
 
Lights out 
You're talking too loud 
Who the fuck are you now? 
Who the fuck are you now?

(It's my town! 
It's my town! 
It's my town!) 
This is my town 
(It's my town! 
It's my town! 
It's my town!) 
This is my town 
 
Yo, fuck this scene 
Hit the strip, 
Get my picks 
Got some sniffles in the sack 
Run this town like a spinner on a track 
Come on, laid back 
To attack in the lac 
We ain't cuttin' no slack 
Girl, what you know about that? 
I ain't tryna be a lover but I gotta say 
That we could keep it undercover 
When you wanna play 
Blazed up, smoked out outta my mind 
We just cruise around, my town 
All the time 
 
When the sun goes down 
The stars come out like the ghost of yesterday 
So drink 'em down 
'Cause some things never change 
Baby, sing and get loud 
We ain't gonna fuck around 
When the sun goes down 
Let me hear you say 
This is my town 
(It's my town! 
It's my town! 
It's my town!) 
This is my town 
(It's my town! 
It's my town! 
It's my town!) 
This is my town 
 
If the city never sleeps 
Then fuck it, neither will I 
You know we keep it thirty deep 
And we're as high as the sky 
You can watch us, thirty creep us 
We just ride and we ride 
You can watch the fiesta drop from one side to side 
We're breaking the boulevard 
'Cause we get it better 
Whenever you need to find me 
Bitch, you can send me a letter 
Forever drunk and disorderly 
All this vodka I'm pouring me 
Goddamn, and I want it all 
My city of glory 
 
When the sun goes down 
The stars come out like the ghost of yesterday 
So drink 'em down 
'Cause some things never change 
Baby, sing and get loud 
We ain't gonna fuck around 
When the sun goes down 
Let me hear you say 
This is my town 
(It's my town! 
It's my town! 
It's my town!) 
This is my town 
(It's my town! 
It's my town! 
It's my town!) 
This is my town 
 
The streets you walk give you a reason 
'Cause it's all you got 
And that'll never change 
So keep singing that song 
And we can live forever 
Pour a little out for the ones who passed away 
 
When the sun goes down 
The stars come out like the ghost of yesterday 
So drink 'em down 
'Cause some things never change 
Baby, sing and get loud 
We ain't gonna fuck around 
When the sun goes down 
Let me hear you say 
This is my town 
(It's my town! 
It's my town! 
It's my town!) 
This is my town 
(It's my town!

            <field name="lyrics">Pour me, pour me, pour me another, 
It haunts me, haunts me, 
Like no other, 
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home, 
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go, 
So pour me, pour me, pour me another. 
 
I wake up right about the mid-afternoon, 
With the sun in the sky but nights coming soon, 
I walk to the mirror just to fix myself, 
Yeah life gets harder when you love nothing else, 
So I pick my pills from the counter drawer, 
Pick my self-esteem up off the fucking floor, 
I guess I'm a man of no recourse, 
As I crack another bottle, got no remorse, 
And I'll say a little prayer for the child in me, 
I swear I used to be what I truly believe, 
That I'm not just a man with these broken dreams, 
Even I could go to heaven, 
If I'm part the seas, 
So 
 
Pour me, pour me, pour me another, 
It haunts me, haunts me, 
Like no other, 
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home, 
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go, 
So pour me, pour me, pour me another. 
 
People get sick and they watch you bleed, 
When you fall from the top, boy you better believe, 
At the bottom, they got just, yeah, just what you need, 
Well at the bottom, you can't swim 'cause you drank up the sea, 
Then we stop and we look up to the sky, 
They don't ask any questions, they ask us why? 
Don't have any answers, don't know what to say, 
Our knees are getting tired, 
Too tired to pray, 
That's when we laid down into the road, 
We all seem to walk and I guess walking alone, 
And I'm not just a man with these broken dreams, 
Even I could go to heaven, 
If I'm part deceased. 
 
Pour me, pour me, pour me another, 
It haunts me, haunts me, 
Like no other, 
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home, 
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go, 
So pour me, pour me, pour me another. 
 
Time just seems to go on and on, 
On and on, 
And on and on, 
Life inside a bottle all alone, 
All alone, 
The bottles gone, 
I'm not just a man with these broken dreams, 
Even I could go to heaven, 
If I'm part deceased, 
Whats life inside a bottle if it's cold? 
One more song and I'm finally free, 
I'll meet you here in heaven, between the sea, 
'Cause I'm not just a man with these broken dreams, 
Even I could go to heaven, 
If I'm part deceased. 
So 
 
Pour me, pour me, pour me another, 
It haunts me, haunts me, 
Like no other, 
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home, 
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go, 
So pour me, pour me, pour me another. 
 
Pour me, pour me, pour me, pour me, 
Pour me another, 
Pour me, pour me, pour me, pour me, 
Pour me another.</field>

Drink 'til we all black out

Drink, got swag 
Yeah we keep it the same 
Mad dogged all up

Ain't no balled up 
Baby, got bills to pay 
Yeah I'm getting fucked up 
As I'm changing lanes 
Oh my god 
I'm one of a kind 
I'mma smash it up 
It's about that time 
I'll be back to the party 
By the end of the night 
Got Nichole got needs 
And I needs mine 
'Cause Funny Man 
Is just so damn sexual 
Gotta ass on my mind 
It's just so damn edible 
Feast your eyes girl 
I'm so delectable 
Dick like Hulk 
Yeah they call me incredible! 
 
You got your dress pulled up 
I see you're all alone 
I know you ain't no slut 
But I know you're so down 
 
Smash it up, smash it up 
That bitch is off the hook 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I get that girl 
Smash it up, smash it up 
I'll hit it all night long 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I smash I'm gone 
Girl you so hot 
You could spark a match 
Me and funny wanna flip u 
Like an acrobat 
And you could go back home 
In a Cadillac 
Put my name in your phone 
It's the man in black 
Got a big ol' mouth 
Gotta nasty match 
On my back 
And you straddling 
And I'mma fan of that 
We could go home 
And open up a can of that 
I'll put my prize in your box 
Like cracker jacks 
Oh wait that's 
Just me getting shit faced 
Gimme pulling out my blue tooth 
And brief case 
And replace 
Everything I said wrong 
But then it wont be 
A Hollywood Undead song 
 
You got your dress pulled up 
I see you're all alone 
I know you ain't no slut 
But I know you're so down 
 
Smash it up, smash it up 
That bitch is off the hook 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I get that girl 
Smash it up, smash it up 
I'll hit it all night long 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I smash I'm gone 
 
I wanna tear it up 
Before we tear it down 
I wanna light it up 
Before we burn it down 
We gonna get fucked up 
Drink 'til we all black out 
So fucking start it up 
 
Smash it crash it 
What's only crackin' 
It's me and you girl 
Now that's what's happenin' 
Let's take a little gin 
From my stabbing cabinet 
Grab the can 
That's lights camera action 
Let me take care 
Of the satisfaction 
Grab a six pack 
When I get off the wagon 
Pull a little laugh 
On Michael Jackson 
I'll smash it now 
'Cause I know she's down 
 
Smash it up, smash it up 
That bitch is off the hook 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I get that girl 
Smash it up, smash it up 
I'll hit it all night long 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I smash I'm gone 
Smash it up, smash it up 
This bitch is off the hook 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I get that girl 
Smash it up, smash it up 
I'll hit it all night long 
Smash it up, smash it up 
And once I smash I'm gone 
Smash it up, smash it up 
Smash it up, smash it up</field>

You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin' those gums 
Like you the boss 
You should check your chin 
Oh no you don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin' those gums 
But just when I'm wrong 
'Cause you don't want none 
 
Let me take you back 
So back in time 
And make the front page news 
Livin' lives of crime 
'Cause your grand mood shined 
Outlaws to be exact 
We're gettin' somethin' new 
And we never turned back 
Six shots, point blank 
Aimin' at your face 
Imma quick draw 
Then I'm gone without a trace 
And I'll rob a bank 
While chee and steal 
Derail a fuckin' train 
'Cause you know that I will 
You need to pay your dues 
And get cement shoes 
And we're still on the run 
The most ruthless crew 
 
You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin' those gums 
Like you the boss 
You should check your chin 
Oh no you don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin' those gums 
But just when I'm wrong 
'Cause you don't want none 
 
I'm a heart break kid 
I'm a stick up kid 
Bang. bang 
Tommy gun 
Yous a punk ass bitch 
Knocked out 
One punch 
Like a superhero 
Banged up crapped out 
Now your back to zero 
Boom bing po 
King kong do doubt 
If you blow a mission 
Imma have to dry you out 
You can make it up 
The deets train off of the ground 
Imma switch plates 
Shake it you know how 
Work gets around 
All bets are in 
I see you roll the dice 
Looks like another seven 
It's the end of your life 
 
You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin' those gums 
Like you the boss 
You should check your chin oh 
You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin' those gums 
But just when I'm wrong 
'Cause you don't want none 
 
It's no matter 
Just a matter of time 
It don't matter to three 
It ain't no matter of mine 
If you keep your mouth shut 
Then you'll be just fine 
If you keep running gums 
You better look out behind 
I see you N to the D E A D 
You got the full clip 
It's just cockin' empty 
Ur the cock of the walk 
But you walk too far 
Now your cock's on the block 
Of the boulevard 
I'm the J O H to the N Y 3 T 
You lucky you ain't dead 
If you know they sent me 
 
You don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin' those gums 
Like you the boss 
You should check your chin 
Oh no you don't know what it's like 
To get your head lumped in 
You keep flappin' those gums 
But just when I'm wrong 
'Cause you don't want none 
 
U N to the D E A D 
You got your fist raised 
But your legs are shaking 
U N to the D E A D 
You know that I'm the shit 
That's why you tryin' to take me 
We can go around the corner 
I ain't catchin' a case 
This will all be over quick 
Imma do what it takes 
So your betting all you want 
But never sneak out of place 
Or Imma roll your ass up 
And smack the lips off your face 
You better not run 
'Cause my bullets are faster 
I'd never really hit a bitch 
So I'm gonna smack ya 
This wont even be a fight 
'cause I'm knockin' her out 
And your nicknamed dick 
So keep it out of your mouth 
U N to the D E A D 
Better be known 
We do this shit on a daily 
U N to the D E A D

There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
 
Wake up in the middle of the semi of the night 
With some tears on my pillow and this blood on my knife 
And my soul has stained these sheets but they pull up to the side 
Who's blood could this be is it yours or is it mine 
Take the knife and twist it wheres my heart she missed it 
And you know I don't wanna die but baby you insisted 
Breathing is a luxury that I just shouldn't have 
My heart just keeps on beating and its more than you can stand 
Baby please just tell me how we ever went so wrong 
We used to sing together and we used to sing a song 
We could never sing forever because now my voice has gone 
Guess I'm gone forever and you knew it all along 
 
I can see blood all over my hands 
The longer you lay next to me the further I ran 
Whats it all worth how much can you stand 
The longer you stay close to me the further I ran 
 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
 
I'm only evil when I need to be but you did this so easily 
I tried to treat you equally and listen to your reasoning 
But you waited so eagerly while plotting and deceiving me 
You came behind me secretly and shattered every piece of me 
I had nothing to give so I gave you my life, 
You didn't wanna see me live so you gave me your knife, 
Did it hurt as you tiptoed coming from behind, 
You took away my kids so I guess you killed me twice, 
Drag me into the night cos its the one thing you keep, 
You knew that I had to die so you could finally sleep, 
There's blood all over your knife you know you've  burned yourself, 
And its a matter of time before you burn in hell, 
 
I can see blood all over my hands 
The longer you lay next to me the further I ran 
Whats it all worth 
How much can you stand 
The longer you stay close to me the further I ran 
There's blood on my hands 
Lure me more so tell me course nor weaving slowly oh 
Wont you hold me lure me more so tell me course nor 
Weaving slowly oh wont you hold me 
I can see blood all over my hands 
The longer you lay next to me the further  I ran 
Whats it all worth how much can you stand the longer 
You stay close to me the 
I can see blood all over my hands the longer you lay 
Next to me the further I ran whats it all worth how 
Much can you stand the longer you stay close to you the further I ran 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands 
There's blood on my hands</field>

Here's the massacre 
A mausoleum fit for me 
Lived a hundred years,  
A hundred years I didn't see 
Gave all my hope away 
Isn't any left for me? 
Bombs are splitting atoms 
What can the future bring? 
We can fill a million choirs 
And wait till children sing 
We can walk a million miles 
And end up in the sea 
And our lungs just keep filling 
And lying when we breathe 
The world's filled with liars 
Liars like me 
And I look at my child 
It's finite, this feeling 
Eyes blue like the sky 
I see all of this meaning 
I reach up to God and ask if I'm dreaming 
I'm so sorry I don't have those things that you're needing 
And darling, a kiss 
Kiss me I'm leaving 
 
When the end is getting closer 
And the earth has burned the sky 
Now repent 'cause it's all over 
Just let me die 
 
As my body lies here broken 
And I'm carried to the light 
Now my heart is finally open 
So just let me die

'Cause we are, we are 
We are built from broken parts 
 
If you can lose it all, then welcome to Broadway 
Silicone dreams and your name on the Marque 
And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly 
It's hotter here in hell, but it's getting real dark see 
So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely 
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends 
And every step, another step, you're walking on my dreams 
And every breath, another breath you're breathing when I breathe 
I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go 
I'm married to the devil in the city of angels 
So come all you wicked to the world of the empty 
I know I need it all, so baby don't tempt me 
I'm knocking on our door, nope, nobody sent me 
Just checking all you bitches like I'm checking this check sheet 
So put your hats on, Lohner don't get soft 
You can see God, when I take my mask off 
 
We are, we are 
We are made from broken parts 
We are, we are 
We are broken from the start

They were beating in the dark 
'Cause we are, we are 
We are built from broken parts 
 
The fame is your best friend, you love it no questions, 
Beating down the door is the face of rejection 
And once again, it's a tragedy anthem 
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessing 
Who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream? 
'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen 
With a gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky 
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn't think he can die 
So grab a pick and an axe, 'cause we try, we cry 
Into the bottle of Jack, we die inside, 
So when you look in his eyes, what you see now? 
Murder the monster you've made and watch him bleed out 
We're in a life where it's kill or lose 
Just lie motherfucker till you hear the truth 
From under the street, through the gutters of youth 
Just cry motherfucker yeah, I'm talking to you 
 
We are, we are 
We are made from broken parts 
We are, we are 
We are broken from the start 
And our hearts, our hearts 
They were beating in the dark 
'Cause we are, we are 
We are built from broken parts 
 
(No one) From the city of angels (No one) 
An empty vessel of devils (Can take away what's ours) is there no one to save us? 
Through my eyes see the world that you gave us 
 
(No one) From the city of angels (No one) 
An empty vessel of devils (Can take away what's ours) is there no one to save us?

We are, we are 
We are made from broken parts 
We are, we are 
We are broken from the start 
And our hearts, our hearts

'Cause we are, we are 
We are built from broken parts 
 
(We are, we are)From the city of angels 
An empty vessel of devils 
(We are, we are) is there no one to save us? 
Through my eyes see the world that you gave us

            <field name="lyrics">I can't believe 
That when I breathe 
That there's something good inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
So close to me 
That memory 
Of that one good thing inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
Yeah 
 
If I went out the back door, nobody would stop me 
But, where would I go? 
'Cause I ain't ever had a real home 
So, what do I know? 
So, I could keep runnin', hide until they find me 
But, what would that do? 
If they could only know what I knew 
What would it do? 
I shoulda' seen the writin' on the wall 
Instead, I'm left to fall 
'Cause the longer I'm away, 
I'll always stay the same 
Lookin' back, when I thought I knew it all 
Instead, I'm left to fall 
Did I throw it all away? 
 
I can't believe 
That when I breathe 
That there's something good inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
So close to me 
That memory 
Of that one good thing inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
Yeah 
 
Don't you know, little boy, They'll lay you to waste, man 
Little do they know, every song is a lifespan 
Yeah, they've taken one, but I'm takin' my last chance 
To hold all we know and let go with both hands 
Though, don't you know that plots are made from concrete 
Right through the stone, can you hear my heart beat? 
Beats through my bones, like no memory left me 
Not for a second or a minute when I dream 
I wanna go home, like a home that I'll keep 
You can dig six or sixty-six feet 
We can live forever, still your misery missed me 
Hold this song together with a bottle of whiskey 
Look into the mirror, and the lines that time drew 
Seen 'em painted white in the eyes that shine through 
My heart beats heavy in an open chest 
And, I wanna say goodbye, but there's nobody left 
 
I can't believe 
That when I breathe 
That there's something good inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
So close to me 
That memory 
Of that one good thing inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
Yeah 
 
I broke it all, and I put to the test 
Put your hands in mine, and feel this emptiness 
There's no beat in my chest 
'Cause there's nothin' left 
No, it ain't goodbye, it's a last caress 
What's another dream? 
You could hardly sleep 
Can you believe bad things only happen to me? 
God knows one day, you will finally see 
That's scares will heal, but we're meant to bleed 
Do you realize I would lie for you? 
Please out my last breath, I would die for you 
I know I'm no good, but my heart beats true 
You know I'm gonna fight, though I must be scared to lose 
You took me in, and I fucked it up again 
And an empty promise, no, I won't pretend 
'Cause in the end, we need someone to solve 'em 
Nobody can fix me if I'm part of the problem 
 
I can't believe 
That when I breathe 
That there's something good inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me 
So close to me 
That memory 
Of that one good thing inside of me 
Just one good thing inside of me

            <field name="lyrics">Good night! 
Sleep tight! 
Don't let the dead bite! 
 
Johnny 3 and he's dipping in the four-door 
.44 and it's pointed at your window 
Ain't a good shot, here come four more 
Getting hot so I play in the snow 
In a town made wicked, made from these wicked things 
See the dead on the cover of a magazine 
See my smile, it was born from amphetamines 
Better duck 'cause it's war on my enemies 
Oh God, I think I lost it, oh no 
Lost some, wanna watch the rest go 
A mad man when I'm mixed with SoCo 
And who would've thought a man could sink to so low? 
Who wants to die from the Mossberg shotty? 
Putting holes in the hotel lobby 
All you fake bitches are just another hobby 
And I'll let you dig where I dump your body 
 
What would you do if I told you I hate you? 
What would you do if your life's on the line? 
What would you say if I told you I hate you? 
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind! 
 
You know I got a grenade and it's got your name on it 
I'mma spit on your grave and engrave a dick on it 
People say I'm insane and to put the brakes on it 
Let me buy you a drink, how 'bout a Roofie, Gin, and Tonic? 
Yeah, Charlie Scene seems to be so hated 
It's just me being intoxicated 
'Cause being sober's so overrated 
Hollywood Undead what have you created? 
I know that we have never really met before 
But tell me does this rag smell like chloroform? 
You know that I'm the reason people lock their doors 
But I got nothing but time so I'mma wait on the porch 
You got nowhere to run to so don't try hiding 
'Cause I'm known to be like Jack Nicholson from The Shining 
Yeah, I'm breaking your door down so don't try fighting 
Yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed or the dead keep biting 
 
What would you do if I told you I hate you? 
What would you do if your life's on the line? 
What would you say if I told you I hate you? 
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind! 
 
Good night! 
Sleep tight! 
Don't let the dead bite! 
Wrap a rope around your head! 
And watch you as you take flight! 
 
You better check twice, look under your bed 
Turn on your night light and cover up your head 
'Cause we do exist and there's no need to pretend 
That you're not afraid of meeting the Undead 
Red, red rum when you look into these eyes 
Say goodnight 'cause it's almost your bed time 
Buckle up 'cause it's time to fly 
You got a first-class ticket to Colombia neck ties 
Take a seat, you can sit in the front row 
The voice in your head is just me in your headphones 
Everybody knows that we're the devil's heroes 
Come and get a ticket, follow me to the creep show 
 
What would you do if I told you I hate you? 
What would you do if your life's on the line? 
What would you say if I told you I hate you? 
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind! 
 
Good night! 
Sleep tight! 
Don't let the dead bite! 
Wrap a rope around your head! 
And watch you as you take flight! 
Good night! 
Sleep tight! 
Don't let the dead bite! 
Wrap a rope around your head! 
And watch you as you take flight!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I can't see because I'm staring at a blank wall (Blank wall) 
I can't breathe because my fucking thoughts are choking me now 
I can't grieve for the souls that are so lost (Are so lost) 
I can't leave because my fucking self is holding me down 
Imagine cold hands up to your throat 
The thought alone makes you swallow your hope 
And now it's harder to cope 
And I don't know where I'll go 
These fallacies I don't believe, and fear that nobody knows 
 
It's a red night and I don't see any light 
And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die 
 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost but can be found inside my mind 
Goodbye 
 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky 
Goodbye 
 
Watch as we all ? 
We all fall apart 
We all fall apart 
 
Would you forgive me if I told you that I lied like you? (Fuck you) 
So full of hate with the love to lose 
Would you deny it if I asked you just to tell the truth 
'Cause in the end you gotta decide what side to choose 
Imagine cold hands holding your heart 
The thought alone can only tear you apart 
I know you wish it would end, it's sad it's only the start 
These memories they only mean my soul is empty and dark 
 
It's a red night and I don't see any light 
And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die 
 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost but can be found inside my mind 
Goodbye 
 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky 
Goodbye 
 
It's a red night and I don't see any light 
And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die 
It's a red night, if it's wrong or it's right 
And if I don't fight it's like being buried alive 
 
It's a red night and I don't see any light 
And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die 
It's a red night, if it's wrong or it's right 
And if I don't fight it's like being buried alive 
 
'Cause I, I wanna feel anything 
And I know that we all think we can't be wrong 
Soon we all be gone 
And I, I don't know what this means 
But if I knew anything, I'd know for sure 
We'll all be gone 
 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost but can be found inside my mind 
Goodbye 
 
As I look up from the ground 
I see darkness all around 
And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky 
Goodbye</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
'Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be 
How can I sleep at night there's a war inside my head 
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed 
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed 
'Cause I am a lion, and you are dead 
 
Heres a story of everything we'll ever be 
You can hide but some of us can never leave 
And if you go I don't need those little things 
They remind me of all our little dreams 
Can you hear the words, all I can say 
We can watch the world even if they walk away 
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today 
You where born a lion and a lion you will stay 
 
I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see the lion when you look inside of me 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
'Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be 
 
Remember an army of all those little kids 
Livin' life like they only get a little bit 
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle-end 
I'd rather die then watch you givin' in 
I'm sorry daughter but you're fathers not the same 
I can look into your eyes and I swear that I will change 
But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I say you can hide 
Beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain 
After all only so much we can say 
Words can lose their meaning once you walk away 
Promise me that you'll love me, watch me as I fade 
I'll give you all the things that these lions never gave 
The hands on the clock and the things we cannot change 
Tearin' out the pieces and take back what I made 
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save 
'Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay 
 
I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see the lion when you look inside of me 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep 
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be 
 
Hey! I never meant to let go 
All I want and you're all I'll ever wanna know 
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home 
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home 
Hey! I never meant to let go 
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know 
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home 
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home 
Hey! 
 
I am a lion and I want to be free 
Do you see the lion when you look inside of me 
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep

Who left me outside 
I'm bent, I'm not broken 
Come live in my life 
All the words left unspoken 
Are the pages I write 
On my knees and I'm hoping 
That someone holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight 
 
Welcome to the world and all the land in it was wasted 
The blood upon your hands and the wickedness that made it 
Sing or scream it all and the memories keep fading 
See the exit wound, dear God what have we taken? 
Guess I'll say a prayer and I'll kiss into the air 
I'll look into the sky, send them straight to nowhere 
We all dug the grave, can't shake away the shame 
Quiver in the sky but you're shaken all the same 
You left us with the guns and all of them unloaded 
Teach us how to shoot but you taught us how to hold them 
All the weight of all the world is right between your shoulders 
Heavy is the heart when the world keeps growing colder 
 
Who left the door open 
Who left me outside 
I'm on my knees and I'm hoping 
That someone holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight 
 
Two sides to every story, here's a little morning glory 
Breakfast of a mirror, dying slow seems a little boring 
Burning like a flag, walking straight into the breeze 
'Cause there's two types of people, you are weak or you are me 
Yeah what's another life time like mine 
We all die a little sometimes, it's alright 
Did you come to say your goodbyes to this life? 
We all hurt a little sometimes, we're alright 
So mothers hold your children, don't you ever let 'em go 
There is weakness in your grip and they are holding all our hope 
Don't you ever let me go (Don't you ever let me go) 
Don't you ever let me go (Don't you ever let me go) 
 
Who left the door open 
Who left me outside 
I'm on my knees and I'm hoping 
That someone holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight 
 
Someone left the door open 
Who left me outside 
I'm bent, I'm not broken 
Come live in my life 
All the words left unspoken 
Are the pages I write 
On my knees and I'm hoping 
That someone holds me tonight 
Hold me tonight</field>

Been waiting for too long 
Started my own plot

Damned if I'm damn wrong

Like I'm gonna stop now 
Like I'm gonna cop out 
Show these motherfuckers 
I ain't willing to drop out 
So maybe I'm pissed off 
Because I feel ripped off 
This industry is a bitch 
And she'll rip your dick off

I've put in too much work 
I've dealt with too much hurt 
I've worked way too hard for this 
But we live in dark places, dark places 
 
When you come from nothing 
You want a dove or something 
So I started to run 
And just kept on gunning 
Dark heart, dark thoughts 
In a blacked out room 
Macked out, Cadillacs 
Click-clack, ka-boom 
Sung you a song 
The words went right through 
And I can't haunt a house 
If it haunts me too 
So let's draw the line 
And it's me and it's you 
I do it all the time 
And Johnny three don't lose 
Can you write some checks that you can't cash? 
So I'm a little bitter, baby, keep on coming back 
Yeah, there's just some things that I can't stand 
A little trigger-happy, so come on, let's dance 
Yeah, fuck your virtue 
Your lie and your meaning 
With the writing on the wall 
But you just can't read it 
Comes back around 
Man, you better believe it 
If you got a dark heart 
I'm gonna motherfucking bleed it 
 
I've come way too far for this 
I've put in too much work 
I've dealt too much hurt 
I've worked way too hard for this 
But we live in dark places, dark places 
I've come way too far for this 
I've put in too much work 
I've dealt with too much hurt 
I've worked way too hard for this 
But we live in dark places, dark places 
 
Who's that walking up your block? 
Pissed off with two Glocks 
With a forty in his fist 
And a fifth of moon rocks 
Got his sleeves cut off 
With marijuana tube socks 
Smoking pot in the drop-top 
Bumping Kid Rock 
I'mma smoke another spliff 
And chase it down with six shots 
That guy's cockier than shit 
Like a guy with six knocks 
And I can't stop saying dick 
Dick, dick and then cock 
Hick-a-dickery-dick-a-dick-a-dickery-dock 
So talk shit and get socked 
Or kick rocks and get lost 
Or get dropped and get topped 
This hip-hop shit gets hot 
This is not a pit stop 
And I'm not gonna stop 
Until I'm on the top 
Like your mom on a cop 
So when you see me in your hood 
Yeah, you better think twice 
Let me give you all a muy poquito piece of advice 
If you push me any further 
It's the end of your life 
And I'll kill you like the sixteen bars 
I killed on this mic 
 
I've come way too far for this 
I've put in too much work 
I've dealt too much hurt 
I've worked way too hard for this 
But we live in dark places, dark places 
I've come way too far for this 
I've put in too much work 
I've dealt with too much hurt 
I've worked way too hard for this 
But we live in dark places, dark places 
 
I've come way too far for this 
I've worked way too hard for this 
I've come way too far for this 
I've worked way too hard for this 
But we live in dark places, dark places</field>

These are the only cards that you dealt me out 
This is the moment that we won't be held down 
Our words are broken but their spoken aloud 
So come together, come together again 
The time is now let Armageddon begin 
They say beginnings always starts with the ends 
I say forever and forever amen 
 
Forget what you are 
Forget what you feel 
Stand apart but fall together 
Nothing ever lasts forever 
 
We're born to live, we're born to die 
We're forced to swallow these pills and to never ask why 
What I've become? What can you see? 
That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease 
Everybody's got this disease 
Everybody's got this disease 
 
Leaving my pain, hang in the gallows 
Cast the rain, feeling so hollow 
Run into shame, deep in the shallow 
Not the same but feeling so hollow 
I crashed the train just to start a revolution 
I'm not insane I just want to be free 
It's not the same if it's our execution 
Let them all see you're undead just like me 
So I'm to blame, the one to follow 
Give it away, got nothing to follow 
Fuck the fame, fuck the sorrow 
Live with the day and never tomorrow 
 
Forget what you are 
Forget what you feel 
Stand apart but fall together 
Nothing ever lasts forever 
 
We're born to live, we're born to die 
We're forced to swallow these pills and to never ask why 
What I've become? What can you see? 
That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease 
Everybody's got this disease 
Everybody's got this disease 
 
I tried to believe 
on my knees it's so hard 
And they pick and they pull 
and they tear you apart 
But they won't let me go 
No they won't let me go 
And I'm dying baby, dying baby 
Dying so slow 
Walk in the world, it's so empty and dull 
In the land of the beautiful, beauty is cold 
They won't let me go 
No they won't let me go 
And I'm dying baby, dying baby 
Dying alone 
 
We're born to live, we're born to die 
We're forced to swallow these pills and to never ask why 
What I've become? What can you see? 
That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease 
Everybody's got this disease 
Everybody's got this disease 
Everybody's got this disease 
Everybody's got this disease</field>

Dim fucking dreams of a Hollywood cage 
Perfect, pitch-perfect babe 
Kingdom may come, but look what we made 
Slaughter and fuck what comes after 
The meaningless madness, maniacal laughter (Pray) 
And what else can you take? 
Your hands put together, so holy, you hate 
Another fucking madman 
Another motherfucker with a motherfucking handgun 
Come all you weak, come all you wicked 
I got some heart but we get it, bitches 
Does everybody in the world have to fucking die? 
Does everybody in the world have to fucking die? 
Everybody in the world have to fucking die? 
Everybody in the world has to fucking die? 
 
I am a thief and my father is a bastard 
Who am I? I am you 
My ego it eats and it needs an answer 
Do or die, let the hate burn through 
Take a deep breath as you look in my soul 
I devour your dreams and I live in your home 
It comes from under the bed 
The foul smell and hot breath 
A need in your head 
A close relative of death 
We're coming inside 
Kill the fucking hunter and you're killing the pride 
In the tide, I'll survive 
But will the fucking world leave me buried alive? 
 
Does everybody in the world have to fucking die? 
Does everybody in the world have to fucking die? 
Everybody in the world have to fucking die? 
Everybody in the world has to fucking die? 
 
Die! 
 
You will not be anything 
An after-thought, a memory 
You'll cut bullets when you leave 
You have nightmares, I have dreams 
We need Mother Marry White 
Hold in breath and wait to die 
Just another shallow man 
Zipped up in a body bag 
Just another shallow man 
Zipped up in a body bag 
Just another shallow man 
Zipped up in a body bag 
Just another shallow man 
Zipped up in a body bag 
Just another shallow man

I think of you now and then 
The memories never end when 
Gravity pulls you in 
(You in, you in, you in, you in) 
 
I remember looking back 
Converse and a starter cap 
Now I'm sitting, wishing that 
Wishing I could just go back 
I was happy with no fame 
Ford Fiesta, switching lanes 
Buying 40's with some change 
The Southern California days 
 
I watch you pass me by 
My words they can't describe 
But I can see the gravity 
Way up from the sky 
We leave the past behind 
'Cause we all wanna fly 
Deep down in life you can't deny 
We're all the same inside 
 
'Cause I 
I think of you now and then 
The memories never end when 
Gravity pulls you in 
 
'Cause I 
I think of you now and then 
We'll never be there again when 
Gravity pulls you in 
 
Oh, gravity! 
Oh, gravity! 
Oh, gravity! 
Oh, gravity! 
 
I remember looking back 
Walkin' around, saggin' khaks 
Dime sacks, alley cats 
Burned out, always slack 
Now I got a platinum plaque 
And life seems to stay the same 
Knowing that I'll never change 
Southern California days 
 
Gravity can't stop 
The hope and the have-nots 
This artery's a part of me 
And blood is all I'm gonna be 
I'm gonna see concrete 
Bottles and bad dreams 
I'm everything and anything 
A memory that never leaves 
 
'Cause I 
I think of you now and then 
The memories never end when 
Gravity pulls you in 
 
'Cause I 
I think of you now and then 
We'll never be there again when 
Gravity pulls you in 
 
Deep in the black is the place I call home 
Taking me back to the place I belong 
Deep in the black, I can find my way home 
Please take me back to the place I belong 
 
'Cause I 
I think of you now and then 
The memories never end when 
Gravity pulls you in 
 
'Cause I 
I think of you now and then 
We'll never be there again when 
Gravity pulls you in

How fucked up are we inside 
Breaking up in your empty eyes 
Where's the truth in all your lies? 
Watched you cry, you felt me die 
These tears could fill up an empty tide 
Looking for a last goodbye 
I burned the world for you and I 
If I could do it again 
Would it be alright? 
Or am I living a sin 
Just being by your side 
Wake up fuck love 
Just tampering off your make up 
Wake up, enough's enough 
I sold my soul for tainted love 
 
Let go, oh 
Love isn't good enough 
Let go, oh 
Love isn't good enough 
And the waves in the sea 
They slip away just like me 
So let go, oh 
You weren't good enough 
 
All those empty eyes 
They were twisted by design 
What was hidden right behind? 
Sometimes fear can leave you blind 
Yeah God forsake the ones who make 
The temped heart go out and break them 
Vicious now, fucking vicious now 
Some remember every story 
Every inch between the lonely 
Every voice that ever told me 
Only one could ever hold me 
Felt it in between, I remember when I dream 
But you're vicious now, yeah you're vicious now 
 
Let go, oh 
Love isn't good enough 
Let go, oh 
Love isn't good enough 
And the waves in the sea 
They slip away just like me 
So let go, oh 
You weren't good enough 
 
What's love? 
It's true 
Dark hearts don't break, they bruise 
Fuck love, fuck you 
I'm dying just to hurt you too 
 
Let go, oh 
Love isn't good enough 
Let go, oh 
Love isn't good enough 
And the waves in the sea 
They slip away just like me 
So let go, oh 
You weren't good enough

Only dark hearts 
Only dark hearts (You're vicious now, yeah you're vicious now!)

            <field name="lyrics">I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone. 
I checked my head, but no one's home. 
The mood is right, the party is on. 
Looks like tonight, I'll be drinking alone 
 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself. 
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself. 
Higher than a kite, with nobody by myself 
 
By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself 
By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself 
 
One more shot then it's time to roll 
Smoke these crops and I'm out the door 
Chug some rock, but I sip Patron 
Hit that spot till you lose control 
You died? I'll go out alone 
Bitch, you must be out your dome 
Fresh new kicks, I cut the floor 
Ludicrous, I throw them vogues 
Life of the party got the bitches laughing 
Funny on-point, his joke's cracking 
Grind on the wall just to get some action 
Looking in the mirror like I'm Michael Jackson 
'Cause this is risky, don't try to diss me 
I get more pussy than a bowl of Friskies 
I roll so low, can't keep up with me 
You go home early like you're fucking sixty 
You're coming down my highest peak 
And think you're having trouble speaking 
You a freak and I like freaking 
Me, myself, and I've been drinking 
Blowing up my cell but I don't think I'mma answer 
I'm all by myself so I don't think I'mma answer 
 
I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone. 
I checked my head, but no one's home. 
The mood is right, the party is on. 
Looks like tonight, I'll be drinking alone 
 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself. 
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself. 
Higher than a kite, with nobody but myself 
 
By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself 
By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself 
 
Pick myself up in my Mitsubishi 
Said "What's up? It's nice to meet me" 
Never met someone so damn freaky 
Who, at the same time, is such a sweetie 
So when everybody else is being such a puss 
Doesn't mean you can straight get off the hook 
I don't need another partner to shake my tush 
I can party all night and slay some bush 
So I'mma go out and do some thrashing 
Show everybody what the fuck is cracking 
'Cause this motherfucker can do some damage 
If you don't think so, you can suck my package 
'Cause I don't need no static when I feed my habits 
So don't be combatant when I wreak some havoc 
From this weed I'm having, where's my keys, goddamnit? 
I should be on half of me and three's on taxing 
On my knees, I'm blacking out, I need some action 
Like a peon tapping from this seed I'm packaging 
Your knees are shagging, let me see what happens 
When your cheeks are clapping, Charles P. Is rapping 
 
Blowing up my cell but I don't think I'mma answer 
I'm all by myself so I don't think I'mma answer 
 
I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone 
I checked my head, but no one's home 
The mood is right, the party's on 
Looks like tonight, I'll be drinking alone 
 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Higher than a kite, with nobody but myself 
 
Me and my cup, almost solo and faulty beer 
I'm seeing double but there's only one guy here 
Motherfucker, I'm getting weird 
Motherfucker, yeah, let's get weird 
 
Blowing up my cell but I don't think I'mma answer 
 
I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone 
I checked my head, but no one's home 
The mood is right, the party's on 
Looks like tonight, I'll be drinking alone 
 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else 
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself 
Higher than a kite, with nobody but myself 
 
Let's get weird

No I don't know

But here I go (but here I go) 
 
Love to drug, I'm an addict 
Ditch my heart just to kick the habit 
People might think I'm problematic 
Fuck it I'm alone in a world of static 
Tragic but I stand alone 
With an empty chest it's a dial tone 
And I must confess so pick up the phone 
And If there's nothing left, then I'm leaving home 
Living in the shadow of someone else 
Till I took a deep breath and I found myself 
Heard the bang from the ricochet 
Maybe I was born just a cast away 
 
I'll stay away from 
This pain I came from 
Can't run away from 
What's been said and done 
With all these days gone 
Been fighting so long 
I can't break away from it all 
 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
'Cause I don't know 
No I don't know 
But here I go 
Here I go 
Here I go 
But here I go 
But here I go 
 
So easy to hang with no one to love 
It's hard to dream when I'm thinking of 
So hard to watch when I'm starting to run 
And now it's all over, overdone 
I'm just a victim with this 
Sickness within, I'm just 
A memory faded slowly and only the lonely know me 
Stand on top building so 
Starting down with the world below 
Half way to heaven with no where to go 
Can anybody help me there? No 
 
I'll stay away from 
This pain I came from 
Can't run away from 
What's been said and done 
With all these days gone 
Been fighting so long 
I can't break away from it all 
 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight

Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
Don't even try to save me tonight 
'Cause I don't know 
No I don't know 
 
But here I go 
All those times without you out you (but here I go) 
All those times without you (but here I go) 
All those times without you out you 
All those times without you (but here I go)

Reckless to the day I rest my bones 
There's no use trying to save my soul 
There's no use trying to save my soul

Theres too much confusion,

Business men they drink my wine, 
Plowmen dig my earth, 
None with a level on their mind, 
Nobody out of this world. 
No reason to get excited, 
The thief he kindly spoke, 
There are many here among us, 
Who think that life is but a joke, 
But you and I, we've been through that, 
And this is not our fate, 
So let stop talking falsely now, 
The hour is getting late. 
All along the watchtower, 
Princes kept the view, 
While all the women came and went, 
Barefoot servants too. 
Outside in the cold distance, 
A wild cat did growl, 
Two riders were approaching, 
And the wind began to howl. 
All along the tower, 
Everywhere, 
Everywhere I went...</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Down the street you can hear her scream "you're a disgrace" 
As she slams the door in his drunken face, 
And now he stands outside and all the neighbours start to gossip and drool. 
He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad, 
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?" 
Against the door he leans and starts a scene, 
And his tears fall and burn the garden green. 
And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually. 
A little Indian brave who before he was ten, played war games in 
the woods with his Indian friends, and he built a dream that when he 
grew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief. 
Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow 
He would sing his first war song, 
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong, 
Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night 
And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually. 
There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown, 
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound 
And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die. 
She drove her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled 
"You won't hurt me no more." 
But then a sight she'd never seen made her JUMP AND SAY 
"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way" 
And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going. 
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, 
Eventually.</field>

I‘m going to try an' get my soul free

We are golden 
And we've got to get ourselves 
Back to the garden 
Then can i walk beside you 
I have come here to lose the smog 
And i feel to be a cog in something turning 
Well maybe it is just the time of year 
Or maybe it's the time of man 
I don't know who I am 
But you know life is for learning 
We are stardust 
We are golden 
And we've got to get ourselves 
Back to the garden 
By the time we got to woodstock 
We were half a million strong 
And everywhere there was song and celebration 
And i dreamed i saw the bombers 
Riding shotgun in the sky 
And they were turning into butterﬂies 
Above our nation 
We are stardust 
Billion year old carbon 
We are golden 
Caught in the devil's bargain 
And we've got to get ourselves

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens 
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood 
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B 
Goode 
Who never ever learned to read or write so well 
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell. 
(Chorus) 
Go Go 
Go Johnny Go Go (x4) 
Johnny B 
Goode 
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack, 
Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track 
Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade, 
Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made, 
People passin' by they would stop and say 
"Oh my but that little country boy can play" 
(Chorus) 
His momma told him "some day you will be a man, 
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band 
Many people comin' from miles around, 
To hear you play your music till the sun go down, 
Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin 
'Johnny B 
Goode' tonight"

Footprints dressed in red

A broom is drearily sweeping 
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life 
Somewhere a queen is weeping 
Somewhere a king has no wife 
And the wind, it cries Mary 
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow 
And shine the emptyness down on my bed 
The tiny island sags downstream 
'Cause the life that lived is, is dead 
And the wind screams Mary 
Will the wind ever remember 
The names it has blown in the past 
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom 
It whispers no, this will be the last 
And the wind cries Mary</field>

And then she spread her wings high over me 
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow 
And I said, "Fly on my sweet angel, 
Fly on through the sky, 
Fly on my sweet angel, 
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side" 
Sure enough this morning came unto me 
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise 
And my angel she said unto me, 
"Today is the day for you to rise 
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, 
You're gonna rise" 
And then she took high over yonder 
And I said, "Fly on my sweet angel,

There's a Red House over yonder, baby 
That's where my baby stays 
Well, I ain't been home to see my baby, 
in ninety nine and one half days. 
'Bout time I see her, 
Wait a minute something's wrong here 
The key won't unlock this door. 
Wait a minute something's wrong baby, 
Lord, have mercy, this key won't unlock this door, 
something's goin' on here. 
I have a bad bad feeling 
that my baby don't live here no more. 
That's all right, I still got my guitar 
Look out now  
. 
I might as well go on back down 
go back 'cross yonder over the hill 
I might as well go back over yonder 
way back over yonder 'cross the hill,

Alive but the war is here to stay 
So my love catherina and me 
Decide to take our last walk thru the noise to the sea 
Not to die but to be reborn 
Away from the lands so battered and torn 
Forever forever 
Oh say can you see it's really such a mess 
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest 
Giant pencil and lipstick-tube shaped things 
Continue to rain and cause screamin' pain 
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red 
As our feet find the sand 
And the sea is straight ahad 
Straight up ahead 
Well it's too bad that our friends can't be with us today 
Well it's too bad 
The machine that we built 
Would never save us that's what they say 
That's why they ain't comin' with us today 
And they also said it's impossible 
For a man to live and breathe underwater 
Forever was a main complaint 
Yeah and they also threw this in my face they said 
Anyway you know good and well 
It would be beyond the will of god 
And the grace of the king 
Grace of the king 
Yeah 
Ooo 
So my darling and I make love in the sand 
To salute the last moment ever on dry land 
Our machine it has done its work played its part well 
Without a scratch on our body when we bid it farewell 
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile 
Before our heads go under we take our last look at the killing noise 
Of the out of style 
The out of style out of style oh yeah 
Oooo 
So down and down and down and down we go 
Hurry my darlin' we mustn't be late

She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me 
And she told me a story yesterday, 
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea 
And then she spread her wings high over me 
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow 
And I said, "Fly on my sweet angel, 
Fly on through the sky, 
Fly on my sweet angel, 
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side" 
Sure enough this morning came unto me 
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise 
And my angel she said unto me, 
"Today is the day for you to rise 
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, 
You're gonna rise" 
And then she took high over yonder 
And I said, "Fly on my sweet angel, 
Fly on through the sky, 
Fly on my sweet angel, 
Forever I will be by your side"</field>

mind together 
then come on across to me 
We'll hold hands an' then we'll watch the sun rise 
.....from the bottom of the sea 
But first 
Are You Experienced? 
Ah! Have you ever been experienced? 
Well, I have 
I know, I know 
you'll probably scream n' cry 
That your little world won't let go! 
But who in your measly little world are trying to prove that 
You're made out of gold and -a can't be sold 
So-uh, Are You Experienced? 
Ah! Have you ever been experienced? 
Well, I have 
Ah, let me prove it to you,.......... 
Trumpets and violins like up here in the distance 
I think they're calling our names 
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will ha 
if you just, take hold of my hand 
oh! But Are You Experienced? 
Have you ever been experienced? 
Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful.</field>

His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away 
A hand came out and happened to pin that bagge on his chest 
It said get out there man and a do your best 
And he's called the astro man 
And he's flyin' higher than 
That old faggot superman 
Ever could 
Oh, they call him cosmic nut 
And he's twice as dence as donald duck 
And he'll try his best to screw you up 
The rest of your mind 
Oh, look out, my guitars 
Astro man, flyin' across the sky 
Two times higher than 
That old faggot superman 
Ever, ever could 
Ever could 
There he goes, there he goes 
Where he stops, no one knows 
There he goes, there he goes, uh 
He's tryin' to, tryin' to blow out the rest of your mind 
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind 
Talkin' about lookin for peace of mind 
Astro man will leave it in pieces 
Have you put our trouble behind him 
Make you fly around in pieces 
Yeah, blow out the rest of your mind 
Astro man will blow out the rest of your mind 
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind 
Ooo-hoo 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Blow out the rest of of your mind</field>

I'm lookin' all around 
Hmm mm mm 
Well I'm lookin' out my belly button window 
And I see a whole lot of frowns 
And I'm wonderin' if they don't want me, around 
What seems to be the fuss out there 
Just what seems to be the hang 
Cause you know if you don't want me this time around 
Yeah, I'll be glad to go back to spirit land 
And even take a longer rest 
Before a comin' down the shoot again 
Man I sure remember the last time, baby 
They were still talkin' about me then 
So if you don't want me now 
Make up your mind 
Where or when 
Make up your mind 
If you don't want me now 
Give or take 
You only got two-hundred days 
Cause I ain't comin' down this way too much more, again 
You know they got pills for ills, and thrills, and even spills 
But I think your just a little too late 
So I'm comin' down into this world daddy 
Regardless of love and hate 
I'm gonna sit up in your bed mamma 
And just a grin right in your face 
And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates 
Ha, and say I hope I'm not too late 
If there's any questions make up your mind 
Give or take 
If there's any questions make up your mind 
Give or take 
You got only two-hundred days 
And I'm lookin' out my belly button window 
And I sware I see nothing but a lot of frowns 
And I won't live if they don't want me, around</field>

Queen jealousy, envy waits behind him, 
Her fiery Green gown sneers at the grassy ground. 
Blue are the life giving waters, taken for granted, 
they quietly understand. 
Once happy Turquois armies lay opposite and ready 
but wonder why the fight is on. 
But they're are all bold as love 
they're all bold as love 
Yeah, they're all bold as love 
Just ask the axis 
My Red is so confident, 
That it flashes trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria 
Orange's young and full of daring 
But very unsteady for the first go around. 
My Yellow in this case is not so mellow in fact I'm trying to say 
it's frightened like me, and all these emotions of mine 
keep holding me from giving my life to a Rainbow like you, 
But I'm A...yeah 
I'm Bold as Love, yeah, yeah 
Well I'm Bold, Bold as Love 
Hear me talking 
I'm Bold as love, 
Just ask the axis, he knows everything.

And the day is, too 
There's nothing left here to meet me 
But the velvet moon 
All my loneliness I have felt today 
It's a little more than enough 
To make a man throw himself away 
And I continue 
To burn the midnight lamp 
Alone 
Now the smiling portrait of you 
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall 
It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at all 
It's just the ever falling dust 
That makes it so hard for me to see 
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor 
Facing coldly towards the door 
I continue 
To burn the midnight lamp 
Lord, alone 
Loneliness is such a drag 
So here I sit to face 
That same old fire place 
Gettin' ready for the same old explosion 
Goin' through my mind 
And soon enough time will tell, 
About the circus in the wishing well 
And someone who will buy and sell for me 
Someone to toll my bell 
But I continue 
To burn the midnight lamp 
Lord, alone 
Darlin' can't ya hear me callin' you? 
So lonely 
Gonna have to blow my mind 
Lonely.</field>

As she slams the door in his drunken face, 
And now he stands outside and all the neighbours start to gossip and drool. 
He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad, 
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?" 
Against the door he leans and starts a scene, 
And his tears fall and burn the garden green. 
And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually. 
A little Indian brave who before he was ten, played war games in 
the woods with his Indian friends, and he built a dream that when he 
grew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief. 
Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow 
He would sing his first war song, 
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong, 
Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night 
And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually. 
There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown, 
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound 
And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die. 
She drove her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled 
"You won't hurt me no more." 
But then a sight she'd never seen made her JUMP AND SAY 
"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way" 
And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going. 
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, 
Eventually.</field>

And she fell down .. 
right down dead 
She took me past the outskirts of infinity 
Well I.. 
I made a love to you lil' girl when you'r sleepin 
and you felt no pain 
I did remember, loved in your dream into that night 
and I've seen your smile till stayin' 
and I milion miles adventure the way from you that i'm on

You could hear it from the door 
Inside the judge was stepping down 
While the jury cried for more, more, more 
Cried for more, cried for more 
Hey you better leave that boy's soul alone 
Oh stop that passing the jury 
Grab me a tendon and me a nurse 
Oh, the trial was bad enough 
Yes, but this is ten times worse 
Just then bolt of lightning 
Showed the court house out of shape 
And while everybody knelt to pray 
The drifter made his escape 
The drifter did his escape 
Yeah 
So long</field>

spaceships and even space people? 
Mr

His dusty boots is his cadillac 
Flamin' hair just a-blowin' in the wind 
ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin 
He left home when he was seventeen 
The rest of the world he had longed to see 
And everybos knows boss 
A rolling stone gathers no moss 
Now you'd probly call him a tramp 
But it goes a little deeper than that 
He's a highway chile 
Now Some people say he had a girl back home 
messed around and did a bit a wrong 
They me tell it kinda hurt him bad 
Kinda made him feel pretty sad 
 
I couldn't say what went through his mind 
Anyway he left the world behind 
Everybody knows the same old story 
in love or war you can lose your glory 
Now you'd probably a-call him a tramp 
But I know it goes a little deeper than that 
He's a highway chile 
Walk on brother

Hey 
Look at the sky runt a hell-fir red 
Somebody's house is burnin' 
Down down down down 
Down down yeah 
Well I asked my friend 
Where is that black smoke comin' from? 
He just coughed and changed the subject 
And said uh, well I think it might snow some 
So I left him sippin' his tea 
And I jumped I my chariot and rode off to see 
Just why and who could it be this time 
Yeah yea yeah yeah 
Sisters and brohers daddies mothers standin' around cryin' 
When I reached the scene the flames were making a ghostly whine 
So I stood on my horse's back and I screamed without a whack 
I say oh baby why did you burn you brother's house down? 
Hey 
Hey 
Hey go get me something 
Hey 
Look at the sky turn a hell-fire red, lord 
Somebody's house is burning 
Down down down down 
Look at the sky run a hell-fire red, lord 
Somebody's house is burning 
Down down down down 
Well someone stepped from the crowd 
He mas nineteen miles high 
He shouts we're tired and disgusted 
So we paint red through the sky 
I say the truth is straight ahead 
So don't burn you self instead 
Try to learn instead of burn 
Hear what I say 
Yeah yeah 
So I finally rode away 
Byt I'll never forget that day 
Cause when I reached the vally 
I looked way down 'cross the way 
A giant boat from space 
Landed with eerie grace 
And came and take all the dead away 
Hey 
Hey 
Hey 
Hey what'd I say 
Look at the sky turn a hell-fire red lord 
Somedbody's house is burning 
Down down down down 
Look at the sky turn a hell-fire red lord 
Somedbody's house is burning 
Down down down down 
Look at the sky turn, look at the sky turn a hell-fire red

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens 
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood 
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B 
Goode 
Who never ever learned to read or write so well 
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell. 
(Chorus) 
Go Go 
Go Johnny Go Go (x4) 
Johnny B 
Goode 
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack, 
Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track 
Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade, 
Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made, 
People passin' by they would stop and say 
"Oh my but that little country boy can play" 
(Chorus) 
His momma told him "some day you will be a man, 
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band 
Many people comin' from miles around, 
To hear you play your music till the sun go down, 
Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin 
'Johnny B 
Goode' tonight"

Take me, take me by my hand 
C'mon, c'mon tell me 
I'm your sweet lovin' man 
C'mon, c'mon and tell me 
That I'm the best man in the land 
Good God almighty, let me move you 
Little girl, come on let me move you 
Let me move you 
Got your body, I just wanna move you 
If I don't live another day 
I just wanna move you, little girl today</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Once upon a time you dressed so fine 
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you? 
People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall" 
You thought they were all kiddin' you 
You used to laugh about 
Everybody that was hangin' out 
Now you don't talk so loud 
Now you don't seem so proud 
About having to be scrounging for your next meal. 
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be without a home 
Like a complete unknown 
Like a rolling stone? 
You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely 
But you know you only used to get juiced in it 
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street 
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it 
You said you'd never compromise 
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize 
He's not selling any alibis 
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes 
And ask him do you want to make a deal? 
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be on your own 
With no direction home 
Like a complete unknown 
Like a rolling stone? 
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns 
When they all come down and did tricks for you 
You never understood that it ain't no good 
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you 
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat 
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat 
Ain't it hard when you discover that 
He really wasn't where it's at 
After he took from you everything he could steal. 
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be on your own 
With no direction home 
Like a complete unknown 
Like a rolling stone? 
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people 
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made 
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things 
But you'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe 
You used to be so amused 
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used 
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse 
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose 
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal. 
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be on your own 
With no direction home 
Like a complete unknown 
Like a rolling stone?</field>

But I believe you could help me out anyway 
Ah sack it to me 
Would you believe babe I've been looking for a sole 
That feels like you 
For some time 
Excuse me wihile I see 
If the gypsy in me is right 
If you don't mind 
Well he signals me ok 
So I think it's safe to say 
I'm gonna make a play 
Ah yeah 
See me walk towards you baby 
Ah give me some

Cold cold winter stone

Where can you be baby 
Where can you be 
There were three sugar cane walls

But the sillyest move welted all those inside

A snowin' in a cold blizzard 
Where are you in this a hot cold summer? 
Where are you in this a hot cold summer? 
Where are you in this a hot cold summer? 
God, god, god 
Around about this time the telephone 
Blew its horn across the room 
Scared little annie 
Clean out of her mind 
Out of her mind 
And grabbed little annie from the sink just in time 
And the telephone just keeps on screamin' 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
"hello," said my shaky voice 
"well, how you doing" 
I started to stuter 
Ah, ah, can't you tell that I'm doin' fine 
Can't you tell I'm donin' fine 
It was my baby talkin' 
Way down across the border 
She says "I'm goin' to hurry to ya, I've been a fool, 
And I'm tired of cryin'" 
Ah, ah, 
Yeah 
I said a long 
Long, hot summer night

So glad my baby's comin' to rescue me

The thirteenth of any time, powered by fools 
I can see 'em comin' 
Wearing a blue armoured coat 
You're sittin' here with your violins 
Hittin' wrong notes 
Look over yonder, he's comin' my way 
When he's around, I never have a happy day 
(you even bust my guitar strings) 
Look over yonder, look over yonder, look over yonder etc. 
Look over yonder 
Well, he's talkin' to my baby 
They found my peace pipe on her 
Now they're draggin' her away 
Lord knows we don't need a devil like him beatin' us around 
Well, he's knockin' on my door 
How my house is tumblin' down 
Now don't you come no closer 
The path is keepin' me bolder 
Wait by my door baby 
Unless you want to start another war 
Look over yonder, hey 
Look over yonder 
Look over yonder 
Look over yonder</field>

That's my drink man tha's my drink alright 
Make it a double or eh 
Sombody has to sing 
Somebody will sing 
Somebody will sing right? 
I don't know 
Y'all pass me that bottle 
And I'll sing you all a real song 
Yeah! 
Let me get my key ahum 
Well I'm looking through harlem 
My stomach squeal just a little more 
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints 
Pulls up to my soap-box door 
Now a lady with a pearl-handled necktie 
Tied to the driver's fence 
Breathes in my face 
Bourbon and coke possesed words 
Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell 
Or was it just an accident? 
You know how I felt then 
And so a 
Before I could ask was it the east or west side? 
My feet they howled in pain 
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep 
But not as deep in my mind as the rain 
And as they pulled away I could see her words 
Stagger and fallin' on my muddy tent 
Well I picked them up brushed them off 
To see what they say 
And you wouldn't believe 
'come around to my room with the tooth in the middle 
And bring along the bottle and a president' 
And-eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby 
Especially when your only friend 
Talks sees looks and feels like you 
And you do just the same as him 
Gets very lonely up this road baby 
Yeah hmm yeah 
Got more to say 
Well I'm riding through la ha 
On a bicycle built for fools 
And I seen one of my old buddies 
And he say 'you don't look the way you usually do' 
I say ' well some people look like a coin-box' 
He say 'look like you ain't got no coins to spare' 
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this 
I just picked up my pride form underneath the pay phone 
And combed this breath right ou of my hair 
And sometimes it's not so easy 
Especially when your only friend 
Talks sees looks and feels like you 
And you do just the same as him 
I just got out of a scandinavian jail 
And I'm on my way straight home to you 
But I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror 
To make sure my friend's here with me too 
And you know good well I don't drink coffee 
So you fill my cup full of sand 
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom 
Sharing lipstick around the broken edge 
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on 
And your cat he attacks me from his pil-box ledge 
And I thought you were my friend too 
Man, my shadow comes in line before you 
I'm finding out that it's eh not so easy 
Specially when your only friend 
Talks, looks, sees, and feels like you 
And you do the same just like him 
Lord it's so lonely here hmmmm yeah 
Yeah! 
Pass me that bottle over there 
Yeah yeah ok</field>

Rain burdend in a park-side pool

Diggin' everything

Yeah! And I’m here to tell you about it 
So you might as well pick up on it! 
I’m a man 
At least I’m tryin’ to be 
I’ve lived before 
The other half of me 
I’ve lived before 
That you don’t want me 
But in this search 
For nothing desperately 
Oh, I’m tryin’ tryin’ 
Not to be a fool 
I’m tryin’ tryin’ 
Lord to keep my cool, baby tryin’ so hard to keep it together 
After I find, baby 
That true love of mine 
I’m just rollin’ screamin’ 
Cryin’ flyin’ 
Can’t be trusted, but busted 
Rolling Stone 
You’re a woman 
At least you say you are 
You’re a woman 
At least you look like you are 
You’re a woman 
At least you taste like you are 
But you can take it off 
In bed with my guitar 
And then you leave them 
Throw me outside 
To cry, cry 
To the moon and the nighttime 
Save my soul, 
You can’t find 
All you want is a ticket to ride 
After you show me everything 
It did prove otherwise 
You just rollin’, screamin’, cryin’ good love is sometime, but can’t be trusted

About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea

And said i shall return tomorrow 
And i said fly on my sweet angel 
Fly on through the sky 
Fly on my sweet, sweet angel 
Tomorrow i shall have you by my side 
Sure enough this mornin' came to me 
Silver wings silhouetted against the golden rose of today's sunrise 
And the angel she bent down and told me 
You'll never have to worry about this place just wipe your weepin' eyes 
I'll take you where you've never been, you can fly 
I looked around and i thought 
Fly on my little angel 
Fly on through the sky 
Fly on my sweet angel 
Tomorrow i'll be by your side 
I got my wings to fly

Take my hand, you're gonna be my man

You can hear happiness staggering on down the street 
Footprints dressed in red 
And the wind whispers Mary 
A broom is drearily sweeping 
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life 
Somewhere a queen is weeping 
Somewhere a king has no wife 
And the wind, it cries Mary 
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow 
And shine the emptyness down on my bed 
The tiny island sags downstream 
'Cause the life that lived is, is dead 
And the wind screams Mary 
Will the wind ever remember 
The names it has blown in the past 
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom 
It whispers no, this will be the last 
And the wind cries Mary</field>

I just wanna know about, the rooms behind

Do I see a vacuum there, or am I going blind?

Things like 'Love the World' and 'Let your fancy

I have lived here before, the days of ice, 
And of course this is why I'm so concerned,

The smell of a world that has burned. 
Well, maybee, maybe it's just a change of

I can dig it, I can dig it baby, I just want to see. 
So where do I purchase my ticket, 
I would just like to have a ringside seat,

I want to hear and see everything, 
I want to hear and see everything,

See where I was wounded, 
Remember the scar ? 
Now you can't see a thing ... 
And I feel no pain -- 
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets 
Green and blue .. 
Canyons too 
Singing about Atlantis love songs. 
The Valleys of Neptune is arising. 
2. 
Mercury liquid .. 
Emerald's shining 
Telling me where I came from -- 
Honey Sun .. 
Pourquise Bed he 
lays in -- .. 
on the Burning 
edge Horizon. 
I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ... 
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam -- 
See the wind make love to all 
the ocean .. 
Joy spread and 
the massage got home -- 
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ... 
Purple and gold .. 
the Armies of the Lord 
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ... 
The Valleys of Neptune is arising -- 
3. 
Look out East coast, but you're 
gonna have a neighbor, 
A rebirth land ... 
the praying Burning Sands. 
We know there were worlds 
so much older ... 
And they shall rise, and 
tell us much more the truth of man -- 
4. 
I see visions of sleeping peaks 
erupting ... 
releasing all hell that 
will shake the Earth from end to end -- 
And this ain't bad news, good news, 
or any news .. 
it's just the truth, 
Better save your souls while 
you can -- 
Singing about the New Valleys 
of the Sunrise .. 
Rainbow clean, 
the world is gonna be ... 
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ... 
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Well, I'm standing here, freezing, inside your golden garden 
Uh got my ladder, leaned up against your wall 
Tonight's the night we planned to run away together 
Come on Dolly Mae, there's no time to stall 
But now you're telling me... 
I think we better wait till tomorrow 
Hey, yeah, hey 
(I think we better wait till tomorrow) 
Girl, what 'chu talkin' 'bout ? 
(I think we better wait till tomorrow) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Got to make sure it's right, so until tomorrow, goodnight. 
Oh, what a drag. 
Oh, Dolly Mae, how can you hang me up this way ? 
Oh, on the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today 
Now I'm standing here like some turned down serenading fool 
Hearing strange words stutter from the mixed mind of you 
And you keep tellin' me that ah... 
I think we better wait till tomorrow 
What are you talkin' 'bout ? 
(I think we better wait till tomorrow) 
No, can't wait that long 
(I think we better wait till tomorrow) 
Oh, no 
Got to make sure it's right, until tomorrow, goodnight, oh. 
Let's see if I can talk to this girl a little bit here... 
Ow ! Dolly Mae, girl, you must be insane 
So unsure of yourself leaning from your unsure window pane 
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing something from a tree ? 
Click bang, oh what a hang, your daddy just shot poor me 
And I hear you say, as I fade away... 
We don't have to wait till tomorrow 
Hey ! 
We don't have to wait till tomorrow 
What you say ? 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
It must have been right, so forever, goodnight, listen at 'cha. 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Ah ! Do I have to wait ? Don't have to wait 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
It's a drag on my part 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) Don't have to wait, uh, hmm ! Ah, no ! 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait, yeah ! 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Oh, oh 
I won't be around tomorrow, yeah ! 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Don't have to wait 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Goodbye, bye bye ! 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Oh, what a mix up 
Oh, you gotta be crazy, hey, ow! 
Don't have to wait till tomorrow</field>

He was walking along the road 
And I asked him, where are you going 
And this he told me 
I‘m going on down to yasgur's farm 
I‘m going to join in a rock ‘n' roll band 
I‘m going to camp out on the land 
I‘m going to try an' get my soul free 
We are stardust 
We are golden 
And we've got to get ourselves 
Back to the garden 
Then can i walk beside you 
I have come here to lose the smog 
And i feel to be a cog in something turning 
Well maybe it is just the time of year 
Or maybe it's the time of man 
I don't know who I am 
But you know life is for learning 
We are stardust 
We are golden 
And we've got to get ourselves 
Back to the garden 
By the time we got to woodstock 
We were half a million strong 
And everywhere there was song and celebration 
And i dreamed i saw the bombers 
Riding shotgun in the sky 
And they were turning into butterﬂies 
Above our nation 
We are stardust 
Billion year old carbon 
We are golden 
Caught in the devil's bargain 
And we've got to get ourselves 
Back to the garden</field>

Some call it magic, the search for the grail 
Love is the answer and you know that for sure 
Love is a flower, you got to let it, you got to let it grow 
So keep on playing those mind games together 
Faith in the future, outta the now 
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas 
Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind 
Yeah we're playing those mind games forever 
Projecting our images in space and in time 
Yes is the answer and you know that for sure 
Yes is surrender, you got to let it, you got to let it go 
So keep on playing those mind games together 
Doing the ritual dance in the sun 
Millions of mind guerrillas 
Putting their soul power to the karmic wheel 
Keep on playing those mind games forever 
Raising the spirit of peace and love

            <field name="lyrics">There are places I remember 
All my life though some have changed 
Some forever not for better 
Some have gone and some remain 
All these places have their moments 
With lovers and friends I still can recall 
Some are dead and some are living 
In my life I've loved them all 
But of all these friends and lovers 
There is no one compared with you 
And these memories lose their meaning 
When I think of love as something new 
Though I know I'll never lose affection 
For people and things that went before 
I know I'll often stop and think about them 
In my life I love you more 
Though I know I'll never lose affection 
For people and things that went before 
I know I'll often stop and think about them 
In my life I love you more 
In my life I love you more...</field>

was like some forgotten scenes; 
Seems that all I really was doing 
was waiting for Y O U. 
Dressed like little girls and boys, 
playing with their little toys; 
Seems like all we really were doing 
was waiting for L O V E. 
 
No need to be alone 
No need to be alone 
It's real love, it's R E A L . 
Yes, it's real love, it's R E A L . 
 
From this moment on I know 
exactly where my life will go; 
seems that all I really was doing 
was waiting for L O V E. 
No need to be afraid 
No need to be afraid 
It's real love, it's R E A L . 
Yes, it's real love, it's R E A L . 
More I didn't love before, 
But in my heart I wanted more; 
Seems like all I really was doing 
was waiting for Y O U. 
No need to be alone 
No need to be alone 
It's real love, it's R E A L .

'Cause it's a long way to go 
A hard row to hoe 
Yes it's a long way to go

Take my hand 
Life is what happens to you 
While you're busy making other plans

            <field name="lyrics">I read the news today oh boy 
About a lucky man who made the grade 
And though the news was rather sad 
Well I just had to laugh 
I saw the photograph 
He blew his mind out in a car 
He didn't notice that the lights had changed 
A crowd of people stood and stared 
They'd seen his face before 
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords. 
I saw a film today oh boy 
The English Army had just won the war 
A crowd of people turned away 
But I just had a look 
Having read the book, I'd love to turn you on... 
Woke up, got out of bed, 
Dragged a comb across my head 
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup, 
And looking up I noticed I was late. 
Found my coat and grabbed my hat 
Made the bus in seconds flat 
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, 
and Somebody spoke and I went into a dream 
I heard the news today oh boy 
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire 
And though the holes were rather small 
They had to count them all 
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. 
I'd love to turn you on.

            <field name="lyrics">As soon as you're born they make you feel small 
By giving you no time instead of it all 
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school 
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool 
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years 
Then they expect you to pick a career 
When you can't really function you're so full of fear 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV 
And you think you're so clever and classless and free 
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
There's room at the top they are telling you still 
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill 
If you want to be like the folks on the hill 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
If you want to be a hero well just follow me 
If you want to be a hero well just follow me.</field>

Singing, "Have a marijuana if you can" 
His name was David Peel 
And we found that he was real 
He sang, "The Pope smokes dope every day" 
Up come a policeman shoved us up the street 
Singing, "Power to the people today!" 
New York City.. 
New York City.. 
New York City 
Que pasa, New York? 
Que pasa, New York? 
Well down to Max's Kansas City 
Got down the nitty gritty 
With the Elephants Memory Band 
Laid something down 
As the news spread around 
About the Plastic Ono Elephants Memory Band! 
And we played some funky boogie 
And laid some tutti frutti 
Singing, "Long Tall Sally's a man." 
Up come a preacherman trying to be a teacher 
Singing, "God's a red herring in drag!"

Well we did the Staten Island Ferry 
Making movies for the telly 
Played the Fillmore and Apollo for freedom 
Tried to shake our image 
Just a cycling through the Village 
But found that we had left it back in London 
Well nobody came to bug us 
Hustle us or shove us 
So we decided to make it our home 
If the Man wants to shove us out 
We gonna jump and shout 
The Statue of Liberty said, "Come!"

Late in the afternoon 
What am I doing here at all? 
Ain't no doubt about it 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Somehow the wires got crossed 
Communication's lost 
Can't even get you on the telephone 
Just got to shout about it 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Well, here in the valley of indecision 
I don't know what to do 
I feel you slipping away 
I feel you slipping away 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Well now, you say you're not getting enough 
But I remind you of all that bad, bad, bad stuff 
So what the hell am I supposed to do? 
Just put a bandaid on it? 
And stop the bleeding now 
Stop the bleeding now 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Well, well, well 
I know I hurt you then 
But hell, that was way back when 
Well, do you still have to carry that cross? (drop it) 
Don't want to hear about it 
I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Don't want to lose you now

You like to fence in your world 
And settle down when you're old 
You can run from pole to pole 
And never scratch your soul

Was it in a dream, was it just a dream? 
I know, yes I know 
Seemed so very real, it seemed so real to me 
Took a walk down the street 
Thru the heat whispered trees 
I thought I could hear (hear, hear, hear) 
Somebody call out my name as it started to rain 
Two spirits dancing so strange 
Ah! b'wakawa pouss?, pouss? 
Ah! b'wakawa pouss?, pouss? 
Ah! b'wakawa pouss?, pouss? 
Dream, dream away 
Magic in the air, was magic in the air? 
I believe, yes I believe 
More I cannot say, what more can I say? 
On a river of sound 
Thru the mirror go round, round 
I thought I could feel (feel, feel, feel) 
Music touching my soul, something warm, sudden cold 
The spirit dance was unfolding 
Ah! b'wakawa pouss?, pouss? 
Ah! b'wakawa pouss?, pouss? 
Ah! b'wakawa pouss?, pouss? 
Ah! b'wakawa pouss?, pouss?

            <field name="lyrics">I read the news today oh boy 
About a lucky man who made the grade 
And though the news was rather sad 
Well I just had to laugh 
I saw the photograph 
He blew his mind out in a car 
He didn't notice that the lights had changed 
A crowd of people stood and stared 
They'd seen his face before 
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords. 
I saw a film today oh boy 
The English Army had just won the war 
A crowd of people turned away 
But I just had a look 
Having read the book, I'd love to turn you on... 
Woke up, got out of bed, 
Dragged a comb across my head 
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup, 
And looking up I noticed I was late. 
Found my coat and grabbed my hat 
Made the bus in seconds flat 
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, 
and Somebody spoke and I went into a dream 
I heard the news today oh boy 
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire 
And though the holes were rather small 
They had to count them all 
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. 
I'd love to turn you on.

But I guess we'll both just have to be patient 
'Cause it's a long way to go 
A hard row to hoe 
Yes it's a long way to go 
But in the meantime 
Before you cross the street 
Take my hand 
Life is what happens to you 
While you're busy making other plans

With all your little ploys 
Your mind has changed the world 
And you're now forty years old 
You got all you can carry 
And still feel somehow empty 
Don't ever be afraid to fly 
All you beautiful boys 
Creating multiple plays 
You like to fence in your world 
And settle down when you're old 
You can run from pole to pole 
And never scratch your soul 
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back 
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back 
Don't be afraid to be afraid</field>

She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni, 
Ought to see her rock 'n' roll with her blue jeans on, 
She's not very fat just skin and bone. 
But I love her, she loves me, 
All are happy now we can be, 
Making love underneath the apple tree. 
I told her mama and her papa too, 
Just exactly what I want to do, 
I want to get married on a night in June, 
And rock and roll by the light of a silvery moon, 
And I love her, she loves me, 
All are happy now we can be, 
Making love underneath the apple tree. 
She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire, 
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire, 
Everybody turns when my baby walks by, 
She's something to see, she really catches the eye. 
That's why I love her, she loves me, 
All are happy now we can be, 
Making love underneath the apple tree. 
That's why I love her, she loves me,

Making love underneath the apple tree..</field>

Kicked around for no reason 
Thrown out without reason like tools

And die in a prison as a rule

Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken 
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate 
 
We live in a prison

And wait for no reason for you 
We laugh in a prison

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now

666 is your name 
So while you're jerking off each other 
You better bear this thought in mind 
Your time is up you better know it 
But maybe you don't read the signs 
Free the people now 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now 
Free the people now 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now 
Well you were caught with your hands in the kill 
And you still got to swallow your pill 
As you slip and you slide down the hill 
On the blood of the people you killed 
Stop the killing (Free the people now) 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now 
Stop the killing (Free the people now)

            <field name="lyrics">Temperature's rising 
Fever is high 
Can't see no future 
Can't see no sky 
My feet are so heavy 
So is my head 
I wish I was a baby 
I wish I was dead 
Cold turkey has got me on the run 
My body is aching 
Goose-pimple bone 
Can't see no body 
Leave me alone 
My eyes are wide open 
Can't get to sleep 
One thing I'm sure of 
I'm in at the deep freeze 
Cold turkey has got me on the run 
Cold turkey has got me on the run 
Thirty-six hours 
Rolling in pain 
Praying to someone 
Free me again 
Oh I'll be a good boy 
Please make me well 
I promise you anything 
Get me out of this hell 
Cold turkey has got me on the run 
Oh, oh, oh, oh.</field>
