This is a song full of metaphors 
All I be needing is tobacco and draw 
Better let me in to your country though 
Then I can show you what you’re missing me for 
I’m a night kind of animal 
Got a receiver what you testing me for 
I was scared so I ate ‘em all 
They tasted good but they make me look old 
And ooh, you teach like a toothache, 
I’m not here for my sake, how long will this mickey take 
And ooh, there’s heavy entertainment, out here on the pavement 
The men about you gotta get away 
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya? 
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya? 
I’ll think you’re famous if that’s what ya want 
But you can pick your own pulpit, you must fill your own fonts 
Bring some wine and some Sensodyne 
Then you can be my favourite dodo 
Anyone fancy Monaco 
I’m a placebo they’re chasing me fool 
Don’t be scared you could eat ‘em all 
They taste good but they make you look old 
Ooh, you sick little cup cake, 
You could be a keepsake, you jukebox to generate 
And ooh, I’m heavy entertainment, in need of containment 
I’m mad about you, gotta get away 
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya? 
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya? 
Anyone fancy Monaco? 
Go get a portable recliner brain 
Must take a photo for sure 
Got our problems and a real long name 
And she gets high on rollin’ roll-ups 
Ooh, you teach like a toothache, 
I’m not here for my sake, how long will this mickey take 
And ooh, there’s heavy entertainment, out here on the pavement 
The men about you gotta get away 
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya? 
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya? 
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya? 
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I could be an animal, for many years to come 
It would be understandable if this animal had fun 
My wayward soul will never set me free 
And commitments a miracle, I'm physical you see 
I'm not your lover, baby 
I'm not the one 
I won't meet your mother, lady 
I, don't do love 
You won't buy my attitude, 
so its solitude for free 
And I can't help being rude, 
if you get to close to me 
You are the one, with your finger on the gun 
So I am that animal, and animals will run 
I'm not your love's, baby 
I'm not the one 
I won't meet your mother, lady 
I, don't do love 
I cant believe 
It's not in me 
You see me leave 
If I can't breathe 
I could be an animal, for many years to come 
It would be understandable, if this animal had fun 
And I've got my alibi, so I'll say goodbye 
I'm not your lover, baby 
I'm not the one 
I've been too smothered lately 
I, don't do love 
I can't believe 
That you cant see 
It's not in me 
Now see me leave 
I, don't do love 
I, don't do love 
I, don't do love 
I, don't do love 
I, don't do love 
I, don't do love.</field>

Did you ever get the feeling that someone died 
Hide away in your ivory tower 
And cover me in your golden shower 
Did I make you laugh when I played the clown 
And was I the dog that bit you when you put it down 
Break it nicely break it slow 
Break it so I got no place to go 
Ego a go go now you've gone solo 
Living on a memory 
Where you been lately 
And do you still hate me 
Could you offer an apology 
Aaah turn away 
Aaah fade to grey 
Where were you when the party ended 
Were you stiching up the wounds that you thought I need mending 
Wonderland has crashed to the ground 
The circus has gone all that's left is the clowns 
Did I break your heart when I stole your thunder 
Was there woodworm in the table your feet are under 
Break it nicely break it slow 
Break so I got no place to go 
Ego a go go now you've gone solo 
Living on a memory 
Now you've gone stately 
And yes you do hate me 
Could you offer an apology 
Aaah turn away 
Aaah fade to grey 
Aaah I hope you've strayed 
Aaah and got laid 
Ego a go go.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">We became the parade 
On the streets that 
we once cleaned 
Expendable soldiers 
smiling at anything 
Raised on a feeling 
Our lives would have meaning 
Eventually 
We were once the answer, 
and then you discover 
You're actually just one thing 
after another 
And what was the question 
And why was the lesson 
So deafening 
This is all that matters now 
And that was all that happened 
Anyhow 
You can look back 
but don't stare 
Myabe I can love you 
Out of there 
And when I went away 
What I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say 
Eight letters, three words 
one meaning 
And outside forces didn't 
make it easy 
So I thoughts I'd go 
before you leave me 
Self reservation 
was no explanation 
For anything 
But the truth is more than 
we'll ever comprehend 
I'm just starting to 
understand my friend 
All of that distance 
Cos I fell in love 
with the enemy 
This is all that matters now 
And that was all that happened 
Anyhow 
You can look back 
but don't stare 
Maybe I can love you 
Out of there 
And when I went away 
What I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say 
Eight letters, three words 
one meaning 
And when I went away 
What I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say 
Eight letters, three words 
one meaning 
At last 
We meet on no man's land 
Footprints in the sand 
We meet on no man's land 
At last 
And when I went away 
What I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say 
Eight letters, three words 
one meaning 
And when I went away 
What I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say 
Eight letters, three words 
one meaning, 
One meaning 
Just one meaning</field>

They don't need to see you cry 
I can't promise I will heal you 
But if you want to I will try 
To sing this summer serenade 
The past is done we've been betrayed, It's true 
Some might say the truth will out 
But I believe without a doubt in you 
You were there for summer dreaming 
And you gave me what I need 
And I hope you find your freedom 
For eternity 
For eternity 
Yesterday when we were walking 
You talked about your ma, and dad 
What they did that made you happy 
What they did that made you sad 
We sat and watched the sun go down 
Then picked a star before we lost the moon 
Youth is wasted on the young 
Before you know it's come and gone, too soon 
You were there for summer dreaming 
And you gave me what I need 
And I hope you find your freedom 
For eternity 
For eternity 
For eternity 
To sing this summer serenade 
The past is done we've been betrayed, It's true 
Youth is wasted on the young 
Before you know it's come and gone, too soon 
You were there for summer dreaming 
And you are a friend indeed 
And I hope you find your freedom 
For eternity 
You were there for summer dreaming 
And you are a friend indeed 
And I know you find your freedom 
Eventually 
For eternity

When you're near 
There's such an air 
Of spring about it 
I can hear a lark somewhere 
Begin to sing about it 
There's no love song finer 
But how strange the change 
From major to minor 
Everytime we say goodbye 
There's no love song finer 
But how strange the change 
From major to minor 
Everytime we say goodbye.</field>

And your story's been told 
No one's unhappy and no one got old 
And your heart doesn't break 
And it won't weigh a ton 
When life is just a sitcom 
And that's not the answer 
You're a sole survivor 
'cause your soul survived 
The first to understand it, the last one alive 
And you know will live 
Forever 'cause that's just how it goes 
'til we all remember what everybody knows 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
You've been heading down the road now 
In front of seven billion souls now 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
I know something doesn't feel right 
When you're blinded by the headlights 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
You would die for each other 
And you probably will 
For every lover a lover, if looks could kill 
I would die in your arms 
'cause that's the way to go 
And I won't disappoint you 
'cause you will never know 
For every second that I wasted 
Every secret that I told 
Every lie I've ever whispered 
To everyone involved 
I couldn't be more sorry 
About how I got things done 
I just wanna be john travolta 
To olivia newton-john 
You've been heading down the road now 
In front of seven billion souls now 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
I know something doesn't feel right 
When you're blinded by the headlights 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
You've been heading down the road now 
In front of seven billion souls now 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
Just keep your eyes on the highway 
I know something doesn't feel right

I said have we met before? 
She said hardly 
She had a curry stain 
That was down her cardie 
But her teeth were clean 
So I said smartly 
I'm falling in love again 
I'm so in lust with you 
Pillow over head again 
I'll suffocate with you 
If you ask me to 
She was educated at this school called RADA 
She was made to go by her mother 
And financed by her father 
She said Room 211 and I said (laugh) rather 
I got her name wrong once or twice 
I said I'll call ya Carol, yeh? 
She said that would be nice 
I'm falling in love again 
I'm so in lust with you 
My Pillow over head again 
I'll suffocate with you 
If you ask me to 
So I strolls of to the reception 
And I ask for me room key 
The Maitre'D - Hello 
He seemed pleased to meet me 
I went to the lift and pressed button two 
But very discreetly 
The doors close and she went for my briefs 
See me 
Falling in bed again 
I'm so in lust with you 
Pillow over head again 
I'll suffocate in you 
If you ask me to 
Ohhhhh to 
But in the throws of passion 
It hit my right between the head 
I looked down at her 
She had a bit of cabbage stuck between her teeth 
And I said 
I think I'm in love with ya 
I want ya kids an' getting married to ya 
And she said 
Chill out 
Rome wasn't built in a day 
And I said I wasn't on that job.</field>

But I ain't keen on living either 
Before I fall in love 
I'm preparing to leave her

Oh yeah 
And now I'm gonna get me so happy 
I think there's something you should know

Take back your singing in the rain

What a kick just my buddies and me 
(What a kick just my buddies and me) 
We won the race 
Got out of the place 
I went back home got a brand new face 
For the boys on Mtv (boys on Mtv) 
 
But today the way I play the game has got to change

Well it looks like the road to heaven 
But it feels like the road to hell 
And when you shake your ass 
They notice fast 
Some mistakes were built to last 
That's what you get 
That's what you get 
I just hope you understand sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
All we have to see now 
Is that I don't belong to you 
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah

And you get a little wasted 
It's just a little light entertainment 
Embrace it 
It might just save your life 
You always say you're sorry 
But you never know what for 
And it's been happening more and more 
Act your age and not your shoe size 
And blah blah blah blah blah 
That's your role model 
Slammin’ the door 
So it's only natural to feel 
The guilt of a nation 
It's only human when your young 
You're gonna cry 
Don't worry baby 
If you get a little high 
It's just a phase to get you through 
Getting by 
So you get a little restless 
And you get a little wasted 
It's just a little light entertainment 
Embrace it 
It might just save your life 
So where else can you go to 
Cause no one's given you the book 
About what to say and how to feel 
And what you should and shouldn't have took 
It’s feelings that your fearing 
That’s why you step outside your mind 
Don't look back 
Cause if you don't crack 
You get to sing this lullaby 
You get to sing this lullaby 
Don't worry baby if you get a little high 
It's just a phase to get you through getting by 
You do lots of complaining and do nothing to change it 
Well that's a little light entertainment 
Embrace it, it might just save your life 
Or it might just change your life</field>

Doing it for liable 
It's suing season 
And I am broke 
Buy me some happy 
Find me some passion 
Will it ever happen? 
Heaven knows 
Sometimes you've got to get the joke 
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat 
Who put this spanner in my spokes? 
I can't change how it's wrote 
Classy or flashy 
At home with Lassie 
They all walk past me 
I wouldn't know 
Make me a new man 
Find me a new plan 
I am a sports fan 
A real bloke 
Sometimes you've got to get the joke 
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat 
Who put this chainsaw in my spokes? 
I can't change how it's wrote 
When my ship comes in 
She'll be on it 
Eating a fresh kebab 
And I want it 
And I want it now

Sometimes you've got to get the joke 
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat 
Who put this chainsaw in my spokes?

It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat 
You get the dagger, I the cloak 
I can't change how it's wrote

the only man who made you come 
When you cried 
you cried for us 
and when we died you died alone 
gravity's calling 
don't go home 
where are we? 
Did what I could 
for one of us 
I always thought it was for you 
and when I lied 
oh, I lied for us 
because you never heard the truth 
I am lying alone tonight 
don't go home 
where are we? 
If we are ghosts 
(a long, long time ago) 
It looks like we could have made it better 
We are ghosts 
(long, long time) 
me and you 
We are ghosts 
(long, long time ago) 
we could have made it 
We are ghosts 
(long, long time...) 
me and you 
(..ago) 
Look at the time it's taken me 
to get away from what was said 
I'll never leave 
I'll always love 
you know that all those words are dead 
bearing it yours tonight 
move aside 
I'm taking you home 
On the radio 
she was that summer song 
Packing them in 
making them dance 
a lot of the roam 
taking the time 
to sing it 
I don't need you 
but I'm lost 
lost without you tonight 
have you no heart 
where are we? 
Hold 
a long life ghost 
we are forced 
they're taking down our sattelite 
we are chosen things 
I'll follow your star tonight 
(We are ghosts) 
if not tonight 
then when will she say 
we're not ghosts</field>

Welcome to the zoo 
Bitter disappointments 
Except for one or two 
Some of them are angry 
Some of them are mean 
Most of them are twisted 
Few of them are clean 
Now when you go dancing 
With young men down at the disco 
Just keep it simple 
You don't have to kiss though 
Don't waste time with the idiots 
That think that they're heroes 
They will betray you 
Stick with us weirdos 
For all your days and nights 
I'm gonna be there 
I'm gonna be there, yes I will 
Go gentle through your life 
If you want me I'll be there 
When you need me I'll be there 
For you 
Don't try to make them love you 
Don't answer every call 
Baby be a giant 
Let the world be small 
Some of them are deadly 
Some don't let it show 
If they try and hurt you 
Just let your daddy know 
Now when you go giving your heart 
Make sure they deserve it 
If they haven't earned it 
Keep searching it's worth it 
For all your days and nights 
I'm gonna be there 
I'm gonna be there, yes I will 
Go gentle through your life 
If you want me I'll be there 
When you need me I'll be there 
For you 
Go gentle to the light 
I'm gonna be there 
I'm gonna be there, yes I will 
If all your days are nights 
When you want me I'll be there 
Say my name and I'll be there 
For you</field>

Base, b-b-b-base 
Base, base 
Hello, hi 
How you mean? 
[Robbie Williams:] 
Bang, bang, gonna do it big 
I was born to die but I chose to live 
Bang, bang, all in your face 
Walk on in like I own the place 
Bang, bang, no dignity 
I'm gonna lay you out like 1, 2, 3 
Bang, bang, I'll tell you boy 
It's gonna be a long summer 
[Big Narstie, Robbie Williams:] 
(How you mean?) From the left to the right 
(Shout!) To the people down below 
(Yo) Are you having a good time, or do you just not know? 
(Turn up, throw it up) From the front to the back 
Sing along with me 
Everybody's coming just a little temperamental 
Everybody in the place go mental 
[Atlantic Horns, Big Narstie:] 
The world's going crazy, can't stop it 
They've been pulling me, squeezing me, feeling me and I love it 
Go mental 
The world's in my head and it's spinning 
The rhythm of life is unkind but I keep grinning 
Go mental 
[Robbie Williams:] 
Bang, bang, I shot you dead 
Put you down and went to bed 
Bang, bang, all over town 
I cocked a verse and then I shot you down 
Bang, bang, no dignity 
I'll be a playful beast and you're history 
Bang, bang, I'll get you boy 
It's gonna be the longest summer 
[Atlantic Horns:] 
The world's going crazy, can't stop it 
They've been pulling me, squeezing me, feeling me and I love it 
The world's in my head and it's spinning 
The rhythm of life is unkind but I keep grinning 
[Big Narstie:] 
Lyrical [?] 
Majorly gassed like R Kelly wearing pink [?] 
I will upon them all up like Iniesta 
Man is gonna turn up (Base) 
Big zaggers, man is gonna burn one (Base) 
Hello, hi, cuz I'm giving them vibes

Wake up in the afternoon 
Cover up the mirror 
Just to get a better view 
Been around the world 
And never even left the room 
And I 
I can't figure out 
Why 
So I just scream and shout 
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe 
I'm going crazy, going crazy, going crazy 
I believe I'm losing my mind 
Everybody's looking at me, but I don't see them 
Living for the weekend, caught in the deep end 
Tryin'a tread water, do it for my unborn daughter 
Lamb to the slaughter, life's getting shorter 
Trying to get high off a quarter 
I'm fly in a saucer, my life is a corker 
Star, pop bottles, date top models 
Middle finger in the air, not a care, going full throttle 
Where's the love though? 
Nobody cares about that 
Where's the club? Where's the drugs though? Front row 
Follow the flow, Megaupload 
Feel the adrenaline rush 
Who's the mug though? I don't know 
I 
I can't figure out 
Why 
So I just scream and shout 
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe 
I'm going crazy, going crazy, going crazy 
I believe I'm losing my mind 
Living in a bubble, my life is a puzzle 
I'm caught in the rubble, now pass me a shovel 
Now pass me a shot, and make it a double 
I'm a whole lot of trouble and I don't do subtle 
It's all or nothing, I don't wanna juggle 
No crabs in a bucket, I don't wanna huddle 
I've got my own name, tryn'a figure out the whole game 
Going insane, 150 in the slow lane 
Getting ahead of myself 
My God, already thinking how can I better myself 
Should I be somebody else? Should I be pacing myself? 
My car's a rocket, and if I get too carried away 
I wouldn't know when to stop it 
I 
I can't figure out 
Why 
So I just scream and shout 
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe 
I'm going crazy, going crazy, going crazy 
I believe I'm losing my mind 
Trying to get a hold of 
Trying to get a hold of you 
Trying to get control of 
Trying to get control of me 
Trying to get a hold of 
Trying to get a hold of you 
Trying to get control of 
Trying to get control of me</field>

Fall under your control 
Go out and paint the world

It should be focusing on me 
It would be better 
Never going to lose that wonder 
Fall under your control 
Go out and get the girl 
And paint her gold 
With tears in my eyes 
And love in my soul

Somewhere gold 
Never going to lose that wonder 
Fall under your control 
Go out and paint the world

You alright star

No star 
I don 't feel proper 
1st Verse 
I went to the dr to get a prescription 
I told him little fact and lots of fiction 
About a bad back that I ain't got 
He tried to sell me faith healing 
But I think not 
I want Xanax, Vicadin and Oxycotton 
Funky fill the form out 
So I can drop em' 
I've got all these demons 
And I can't stop em' 
To tell you the truth Doc 
I might have a problem 
Robert Williams take one adoral with water in the 
morning 
As if I'm goin' to take one tablet I'm Keith Moon 
Dick head 
Chorus 2 
He said this one's to take you up 
Wow how 
He said this one's to take you down 
When I take um I don't feel sound 
And I look rather? Round 
You alright star 
No star 
You alright star

2nd Verse 
You know what Doc its alright and all 
I just heart me leg its not terminal 
But a pain killer could help for whats wrong with my 
knee 
And I'm a little bit down from too much tea 
Got me own collection can't get an erection 
If I take em' too long they'll fuck me complextion 
That's right If I take em for like more than a few 
days I get that haunted look 
Give me loads of pills

Chorus 3

Middle 8 ish 
Now if you go to the barber shop long enough then

And if go to the doctors regular, then you gots to be

Well I've got 5 or 6 if I'm at a loss 
Do I have a history of drug abuse, well I never tick 
that box 
And I now that some of you are going to be really 
really cross 
The drug's stop working so prescription pills are 
boss 
The glory days are gone and we've all stopped havin' 
it 
No raves no more just bedside cabinet 
Sleepers are great but don't start dabbing it 
The world carries on spinning we're mad in it 
Take that, take that 
Chorus 3 
He said this one's to take you up 
Wow how 
He said this one's to take you down 
Wow how

Stepping into your machine 
Hoping I can turn it on 
She dances all night and sleeps all day 
Her room's a mess, her dad's away 
She puts her heroes on the wall 
With her green light 
Green light 
To hold a faded flower to my chest 
Green light, green light 
Cause only faded flowers are the best 
She said the things you will expect 
From magazines, her intellect 
These are words I will forget 
She likes the boys that sing the songs 
Something wicked this way comes 
I know I can sing along 
Just give me the green light 
Green light 
To hold a faded flower to my chest 
Green light, green light 
Cause underrated flowers are the best 
I was barely out of school 
She knew someone who I was with 
I've never seen anything like her before 
She is trouble 
Exquisite trouble 
I'm out of your league son 
She seemed to say 
And for a little while 
She was 
Leave the light on 
Leave the light on 
Ohh ohh oh oh, ohh ohh oh oh 
Leave the light on 
Just leave the light on 
Ohh ohh oh oh, ohh ohh oh oh

See the world through it's ancient eyes 
We're living in the wildest times 
I lost my mind a while ago 
When and where I do not know 
We're living in a world of lies 
And we be giving in before it's right 
Hidden heartbeat down below 
at the H 
E 
S 
Hey good looking, won't ya come over here 
tell me few things that I wanna hear 
You can whisper them inside of my ear 
tear down the walls make them disappear 
Hey good looking, won't you come my way 
still got a few songs left to play 
and I got two tickets, would you like to go 
to the H

Did you miss me? 
I know I'm hard to resist 
Y'all can come and help me 
Pick the sweet corn out of this 
It's hard to be humble 
When you're so fuckin' big 
Did you ever meet a sexier 
Male chauvenist pig? 
I'm gonna milk you 'til I turn it into cheese 
Tear your bitten arms and know it 
Please, come take a piece of me 
If you drop me 
I'll fall to pieces on ya 
If you don't see me 
I don't exist 
It's nice to meet you 
Now let me go and wash my hands 
'Cause you just met 
The world's most handsome man 
The world's most handsome man 
Y'all know who I am 
I'm still the boy next door 
That's if you're Lord Litchfield and Roger Moore 
Have I gone up in the world 
Or has the world gone down on me? 
I'm the one who put the Brits in celebrity 
Give in and love it 
What's the point in hating me 
You can't argue with popularity 
Well, you could, but you'd be wrong 
If you drop me 
I'll fall to pieces on ya 
If you don't need me 
I don't exist 
You voted for me 
Now let me see a show of hands 
Here before you stands 
Can you make me laugh and sign this autograph 
Though it's not for me 
Clip and grin, shake and frame, name and shame 
Then I'm outta here 
It's not very complicated 
I'm just young and overrated 
Please don't drop me 
I'll fall to pieces on ya 
If you don't see me 
I don't exist 
It's nice to meet you 
Now let me go and wash my hands 
Here before you stands 
If you drop me 
I'll fall to pieces on ya 
If you don't need me 
I don't exist 
It's nice to meet you 
Now let me see a show of hands 
'Cause you just met 
The world's most handsome man 
The world's most handsome man 
The world's most handsome man 
The world's most handsome man

There’s something crawling up my wrist 
I think it’s dying 
Bless the Lord 
I can’t think straight anymore 
You won’t see me crying 
There’ll be tears before bedtime for sure 
Singing 
I won’t go to war 
Lay down your guns 
What are we fighting for 
I wanna swim in the ocean 
I wanna play in the sea 
I wanna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me, me 
I’m gonna buy a farm 
Write a song 
It won’t change the earth 
Just the people on it 
I was born with 
A silver shovel in my mouth 
Golden balls and a platinum smile 
You won’t hear the last of 
the good, the bad or the brassed off, for sure 
Singing 
I won’t go to war 
Lay down your guns 
What are we fighting for 
I wanna swim with the dolphins 
I wanna play in the sea 
I’m gonna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me 
Then buy a farm 
Write a song 
It won’t change the earth 
Just the people on it 
Hear the sound of a million people sitting down 
Hip to hip 
Lip to lip 
Free your love 
Free love 
Free love 
Singing I won’t go to war 
Lay down your guns 
What are we fighting for 
I wanna swim with the dolphins 
I’m gonna play in the sea 
I’m gonna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me, me 
Singing I won’t go to war 
Lay down my guns 
What are we fighting for 
I wanna play with the dolphins 
I want to play in the sea 
I’m gonna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me, me 
Hear the sound of a million people sitting down 
Hip to hip 
Lip to lip 
Free your love

Someone said as we shook hands 
She was just Miss Jones to me 
Then I said Miss Jones 
You're a girl who understands 
I'm a man who must be free. 
And all at once I lost my breath 
And all at once was scared to death 
And all at once I own the earth and sky 
Now I met Miss Jones 
And well keep on meeting till we die 
Miss Jones and I 
And all at once I lost my breath

            <field name="lyrics">I hope there's a golden age 
I pray for my sanity 
Where we don't have to answer to anyone 'bout anything 
This is not like a brochure 
Flying cars and sex machines 
We are all so compliant 
'cause eveything is what it seems 
And it can't be the satellite 
To tell you how loved you are 
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far 
And I don't feel myself again 
I thought I'd be fixed by now 
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow 
Give me something to die for 
Or design a quiet mind 
Something to like mankind for 
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I. 
You've been bending so long now 
You think it's standing up 
And they line up behind you to build you up, buttercup 
We can lose all meaning 
Quicker than a credit card 
And not everyone's healing, so try your best and don't love too hard 
Cause they can't build a satellite 
To tell you what's in your heart 
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far 
And I don't feel myself again 
I thought I'd be fixed by now 
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow 
Give me something to die for 
Or design a quiet mind 
Something to like mankind for 
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I. 
Will I ever feel the waking 
Naked as a lullaby 
Don't ask me to explain again 
I can't lie to my heart and I 
And I don't feel myself again 
I thought I'd be fixed by now 
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow 
Give me something to die for 
Or design a quiet mind 
Something to like mankind for 
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I. 
My heart and I 
My heart and I 
I've been feeling so lonely 
Feeling so low 
So low I almost let go.</field>

I'll shelter you make it alright to cry 
And you'll help too 'cos the faith in myself 
Has run dry 
We are love and I just wanna hold you near 
Know no fear we will see heaven from here 
I see real love in your eyes 
And it fills me up when you start to cry 
I just wanna hold you near 
We will see heaven from here 
Well it all seems out of reach 
I will take that blame if it keeps the peace 
My self life's short 
Wish they'd make it more easy to follow 
And I've been caught with nothing but 
Love on my mind 
We are love don't let it fall on deaf ears 
Now it's clear we have seen heaven from here.</field>

Remember me? 
I'm the man you thought I'd never be 
The boy who you reduced to tears 
The lad called 'thingy' for six whole years 
Yeah that's right, my name's Bob 
The one who landed the popstar's job 
The one who you told 'look don't touch' 
The kid who wouldn't amount to much 
Well I'm here and you're still there 
With your fake sportscar and receding hair 
Dodgy Farah trousers that you think are smart 
Married to the woman that teaches art 
Married to the life, married to the school 
I want to sing and dance sir, now who's the fool? 
Sing and dance? You thought I was barmy 
'Settle down thingy, join the army!' 
And who are you to tell me this? 
The dream I want I'll have to miss 
Sir is God, he's been given the right 
To structure lives overnight 
Now I know life's true path 
Tanks and guns, that'll be a laugh 
No, not me 
I'm a mega civilian. 
I won't lead my life riding pillion 
But thanks for the advice and I'm sure it'll do 
For the negative dickheads just like you 
As for now, I've a different weapon 
Stage and screen is about to beckon 
And here I sit in first class 
Bollocks sir, kiss my ass.</field>

God bless you Uncles Sam 
You got a cool gene pool

And God knows I love to tan 
Making cents and dead Presidents 
Before I could count to ten 
With a nation behind me 
can't stop the limey

"Everyone suggesting, inferring, in bold type 
The idiots and actually the minority 
That I'm wasted, that I'm strung out 
Well, they all should be wondering why the hell I'm not! " 
[Verse 1: Robbie Williams] 
I'm gonna speak my truth, I think I'm losing it 
Feel kinda liberated just a little bit 
And I'm a Big Mac short of a Happy Meal 
Not sure what to say or how to feel 
[Chorus: Rufus Wainwright] 
Checking into Hotel Crazy 
Leaving all my bags in the lobby 
The velvet stairs don't make a sound 
As we're hitting up to a higher ground 
Holding on to something that's gone in the wind 
Holding on to something that's gone in the wind 
[Verse 2: Robbie Williams] 
I've got the right to vote and I can reproduce 
And I can tell a lie just like I tell the truth 
I have crazy thoughts, I do crazy deeds 
I have special times for my special needs 
I present myself as a normal dude 
Look you in the eye when I talk to you 
Just a touch of the old socio 
Is it empathy? I guess I'll never know 
[Interlude] 
"It's sensational, I really only care about me 
Is this the end of the road? I want a new road 
And the only thing that they should be checking out is my ass" 
[Chorus: Rufus Wainwright] 
Checking into Hotel Crazy 
Leaving all my bags in the lobby 
The velvet stairs don't make a sound 
As we're hitting up to a higher ground 
[Bridge: Rufus Wainwright] 
Checking into Hotel Crazy 
Do disturb me 
Gonna make you mad 
Gonna make you sad 
Gonna make you all of it here

Holding on to something that's gone in the wind 
Holding on to something that's gone in the wind

Jesus what am I gonna do with this crush 
So get the old fella and whack it up against her tush 
How peculiar 
Bend your long legs against the sofa 
In the Dorchester you can get your all bran 
I'm not into hard sports 
Oh I haven't got a clue what to do with you 
Jesus all the things my head is going through 
God what am I going to do with this crush 
Just whack the old man out and get it up

I am a depressed man 
Not sure what I'm doing all of the day

I've been there and I should know oh face it 
I'll stick up for auntie Sally 
Worzel's just a dirty scally fragrant 
Mia Farrow's patching marrows down at the place where all the face fit 
Robin Cousins doing dozens on a little pudding so he rakes it 
I'm the reserection 
I may steal your soul 
I am very evil 
I live for rock and roll 
Shirley Bassey's playing Lassie up a pole in Tallahassee hates it 
Norris McWhirter's doing furters in a little place how's he fake it 
It's another appetiser I can go and buy a Tizer laced fit 
I don't know where I've been but I know where I've been is near a lake 
I'm an erection 
I may steal your soul 
I am very evil 
I live for rock and roll 
I am an erection 
I may steal your soul 
I am very evil 
Only for rock and roll.</field>

Anything, they say 
A million sweet temptations 
A billion times a day 
Pale imitations is all I got 
I want it all and you got the lot

I don't want to hurt you 
Ain't that what the players say? 
While they seal your fate 
And lie right to your face 
I don't want to hurt you 
'Cause I recognise the truth 
That you cannot be replaced 
So I'm just not going to 
So you've chosen me 
And honoured me with your love 
You showed me a world 
And what it could be made of 
Thought you were crazy 
To put your trust in me 
'Cause I doubted myself 
From the beginning so completely 
[Chorus] 
I don't want to hurt you 
Ain't that what the players say? 
While they seal your fate 
And lie right to your face 
I don't want to hurt you

They look at me and I look back at them 
I slip into a chair 
They say are you prepared I said I do not know 
Sometimes I feel it but I can't explain 
Sometimes I need and want them through my vains 
Now there's ten in front of me 
Asking me what do I see 
I see nothing but butterflies and 
Tests I did not know 
The answers will not show 
And all I see is butterflies and 
Sometimes I feel it but I can't explain 
Sometimes the answer's running to my brains 
And in the long run you always said I'll be there beside you 
And in the long run you always thought I'll be there to guide you 
Sometimes I feel it but I can't explain 
Sometimes I need it like a running train 
Sometimes I feel it in my pride 
Sometimes I take it in my stride 
Slow down feelings 
Loved up with you 
I can't feel my legs 
I can't feel you 
Slow down feelings 
Loved up with you 
The night before an hour, too 
On my back and leaving you 
Falling down the stairs and seen it through 
Falling down feelin' this 
Monday morning I feel out of sorts 
But that's ok 
Dried up and dreaming 
Punching and screaming

I got a pretty young thing right on top of me 
Come inside, girl 
Some people just ain't goin' like it 
I can't dance, I can't sing 
But I made it this far 
You'd think they'd be happy for me 
And I'm so loaded, I guess I could stop 
'Cause absolutely nothing about me loves this little rock 
And I cry all night why don't you love me 
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, our hands in the air

Who came third in World War 2 
did Sooty sleep with Sue, 
These things I think about, 
when i'm with out with you... 
What are the holes in biro's for 
which one's which in the Corrs 
did Geff Hurst really score, 
Coz frankly your a bore, 
and i'm not... 
And if it's leavin' season your second on the bill 
If you wont leave me baby i'll find someone who will, 
I tried love, i'm sorry 
I tried love... 
Does God ever get it wrong 
Where has Gary Barlow gone 
Why is Christmas Day so long 
It just goes on and on.. 
and on, 
Like you, 
And if it's leavin' season your the second on the bill 
If you wont leave me baby i'll find someone who will, 
I tried love, i'm sorry

Do duh duh duh duh duh duh, 
duh duh, duh duh... 
Do duh duh duh duh duh duh, 
duh duh, duh duh, 
I tried love, i'm sorry

Do you think Adam fancied Eve 
What if Eve could not conceve 
And he had to breed with Steve, 
We'd all be gay....

Buy up the rights to my book 
And live on a ranch from what the box office took 
I go on visit the set 
They'll call me their savior 
All the people wills come 
Celebrity lives on the moon 
But I'll be back home in June

I tell `em that it`s true 
I let them watch with amazement

On what I'm going through 
Because it isn't the sort of thing I'd normally do 
Ask me what 
I'll say I think it's good for you

I can make no sense of the nonsense said 
That thing that is sad and bare 
My filter's broke so I'm resigned 
To say the first thing that comes to me mind 
Chisels off the chestnut Bonaparte 
How much for a broken heart 
Came for the money 
Staying for the art 
Now be a good girl and play your part 
Your precious heart 
It scared me from the start of this 
My soul in the dark 
Prepare me for the light 
I'm in and out of love 
Just like anyone 
I'm in and out of love 
Can't you see 
I'm in and out of love 
Just can't get enough 
You're in and out of love 
Just like me 
Time don't change things I do 
Cold and dead 'cause I'm sicker than you 
Careless now, if you care back 
Wish I could do a little better than that 
I'll admit that I'm out of my depth 
When I leave it with nothing left 
The DNA is not all mine 
It's not my fault 
It's my design 
Your precious heart 
It scared me from the start of this 
My soul in the dark 
Prepare me for the light 
I'm in and out of love

I've been told I could if I tried 
I did not like what was implied 
So I tried, the flowers died 
I guess I'm just a short term ride 
I'll be a cameo in your dream 
A big pop hero soda stream 
How good was I on your team 
You'd like me now, I'm really clean 
Your precious heart 
It scared me from the start of this 
My soul in the dark 
Prepare me for the light 
I'm in and out of love 
Just like anyone 
I'm in and out of love 
Can't you see 
I'm in and out of love 
Just can't get enough 
You're in and out of love

It was a very good year for city girls 
Who lived up the stair 
With all the perfume hair 
And it came undone 
When I was twentyone 
When I was thirtyfive 
It was a vary good year 
It was a very good year for blue blooded girls of indipendant means 
We'd hide in limousenes 
There chouffers would drive 
When I was thirtyfive 
But now the days are short 
I'm in the autumn of the year 
And now I think of my life as village wine from fine old keggs 
From the brim to the dreggs 
It poured sweet and clear 
It was a very good year.</field>

It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

You're sentimental, 'cause so am I 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely 
You can tell at a glance what a swell night this is for romance 
You can hear, dear Mother Nature murmuring low "Let yourself go" 
So please be sweet, my chickadee 
And when I kiss ya, just say to me 
"It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's de limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely" 
Time marches on and soon it's plain 
You've won my heart and I lost my brain 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely 
Life seems so sweet that we decide 
It's in the bag to get unified 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely 
See the crowd in that church 
See the proud parson plopped on his perch 
Get the sweet beat of that organ sealing our doom 
Here goes the groom – boom! 
How they cheer and how they smile 
As we go galopping down the aisle 
It's divine, dear, it's de-vene, dear, it's de-wunderbar, it's de-victory 
It's de-velop, it's de-vinner, it's de-voix, it's de-lovely 
The night is tired and so we take 
The few hours off to eat wedding cake 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely 
It feels so fine to be a bride 
And how's the groom while he's slightly fried 
It's divineful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely 
To the pop of champagne off we hop in our plush little plane 
Till a bright light through the darkness cosily calls Niagara Falls 
Well, my love, our day's complete 
What a beautiful bridal suite 
It's de-reamy, it's de-rousy, it's de-reverie, it's de-rhapsodie 
It's de-regal, it's de-royal, it's de-ritz, it's de-lovely 
We settle down as man and wife 
To solve the riddle called married life 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely</field>

It's not unusual to have fun with anyone 
but when I see you hanging about with anyone 
It's not unusual to see me cry, 
oh I wanna' die 
It's not unusual to go out at any time 
But when I see you out and about 
it's such a crime 
if you should ever want to be loved by anyone, 
It's not unusual it happens every day 
no matter what you say 
you find it happens all the time 
love will never do what you want it to 
why can't this crazy love be mine 
It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone 
It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone 
but if I ever find that you've changed at anytime 
it's not unusual to find out 
that I'm in love with you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">At dead of night, when strangers roam 
The streets in search of anyone who'll take them home 
I lie alone, the clock strikes three 
And anyone who wanted to could contact me 
At dead of night, 'til break of day 
Endless thoughts and questions keep me awake 
It's much too late 
Where've you been? 
Who've you seen? 
You didn't phone when you said you would! 
Do you lie? 
Do you try 
To keep in touch? You know you could 
I've tried to see your point of view 
But could not hear or see 
For jealousy 
I never knew time passed so slow 
I wish I'd never met you, or that I could bear to let you go 
At dead of night, 'til break of day 
Endless thoughts and questions keep me awake 
It's much too late 
Where've you been? 
Who've you seen? 
You didn't phone when you said you would! 
Do you lie? 
Do you try 
To keep in touch? You know you could 
I've tried to see your point of view 
But could not hear or see 
For jealousy 
Where've you been?

Heroes let 'im down so he sleeps with the 
Light on 
And there's nothin' left to do but kneel down and Pray 
Sail away with Caesar if you're a non believer 
Everybody gets high if you're a 
Diamond geezer 
It's the devil that needs ya so go out and play 
Blame yourself it's easier 
There's no need to trouble her you trouble her 
*Chorus* 
Jesus in a camper van He said sorry to 
Leave you but I've done all I can 
I suppose even the son of God 
Gets it hard sometimes 
Especially when he goes around 
Saying I am the way 
And now it's four in the mornin' yes yes y'all in 
No one can shoot but everybody's scoring 
Trust me it's boring get down and pray 
They told you not to meddle with the bass and 
The treble 
There's dust on your needle and you think that You're a rebel 
You're Evel Knievel so get down and pray 
Blame yourself it's easier 
There's no need to trouble her you trouble her 
*repeat chorus* 
I am the way, I am the way, I am the way 
I am the way 
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am the way

Martin grew out of his A-team vest 
And nicked the pedals off my BMX 
And he says that he's had sex with a girl, for effect 
I lost my virginity, the year above us had discovered E 
And I said it weren't for me, twelve pounds, fifty 
What will we grow up to be 
What will we grow up to see

Rain's never cold when you're young 
We were devoted to us from the start 
I know too much how to feel ..

Happy propaganda, just add vodka and stir 
Sing "My Way" and mean it, karaoke overkill 
We all should know better but I bet we never will! 
We're insecure, making me think I'm not fit to lace your drink 
I've seen you in Marbella, you're a real player, taking it easy 
We all know we shouldn't and that is why we do it 
Here's my glass house, why don't you come and view it? 
Sing "My Way" and mean it karaoke overkill 
We all should know better, but I bet we never, 
the sooner the better, 
I'll send you a letter, said...

And I'm gonna take it cos they wanna give 
Can you blame me? Don't need to spend my bread

Must be thinking that I'll wake up dead 
In the morning I can't handle shit 
And it's beginning to bore me 
Just get on with it 
Kill me or cure me You've got a powerful lawyerWell I've got money for ya 
I know why I appall ya 
But I fucked your daughter I got friends stay up till the end

And they're killing me, but kiling me slowly 
There was a time when we were fine and I could 
tolerate you 
I do believe that you should leave 'cos I've grown to 
hate you 
Should I be weak and turn my cheek 'cos I'm scared to 
fall 
But I just don't know you and you don't know me at 
all 
I've been told that love's a celebration 
But I've lost faith through frustration 
And it's killing me, but killing me slowly 
You paint my picture black, the joke's on me 
And I don't wanna laugh 
Remember the good times 
Won't you bring them back someday, somehow 
I don't mid feeling blue 
If I could smile just like you do 
And it's killing me, killing me slowly 
I can't go on alone pretending nothing's wrong 
Maybe I just want to belong somewhere, somehow,

Searching hard 
Down in the wilds 
Of love 
Summon me now 
Summon my life away 
Summon me onto another day 
A hand through the clouds 
Keeps knocking me down 
It's no less than I deserve 
They built museums 
I dont visit them 
I've made enough trouble of my own 
Into the night 
Searching hard 
Look for the light 
Of love 
Summon me now 
Summon my life away 
Summon me on to another day 
Summon the evening winter waves of falling down again 
I sing from the chaos in my heart 
My heart 
Then comes the evening 
That makes life worth living 
Shoving the shoes out in the light

Carolers as if it were Christmas Eve 
Im disappointed and I dont know why 
She gave me laughter, hope, and a sock in the eye 
In my young life I know something 
Now, I've never tried to create a wow 
Wows are few, frustration more common 
I can feel in my soul thats I game the come-on 
(chorus) 
Kiss me with your mouth 
Your love is better than wine 
Kiss me with your mouth 
Your love is better than wine 
But wine is all I have 
Will your love ever be mine? 
Faces fall before my feet 
Like blood onto a clean white sheet 
When I grow old I wont forget 
To innocence my only dept 
Wow I feel so fresh today 
Barefoot in the snow, to make love in the hay 
The stars are bright in the abise 
Now I feel his arms explode inside your kiss 
(chorus) 
(kiss me)

I was wounded baby 
That's fighting talk where I'm from 
And I'm not moving baby 
Spent my life dancing with shadows in strobe lights 
It's allright, everything mellows in sunlight 
And now London's got its gimmicks 
And New York's had its minute 
But Knutsford City Limits 
I'll never change 
I've been running nearly all my life 
It left me broken baby 
When the meter ran out on life 
I used my tokens lady 
Spent my life dancing with shadows in strobe lights 
It's allright, everything mellows in sunlight

Saying I can't do my job 
Well I just kept dancing 
Don't hate me 'cause I'm handsome 
And the beat will never stop

If you stay you won't be sorry 
Cos we believe in you 
Soon you'll grow, So take a chance 
With a couple of Kooks hung up on romancing 
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry 
A funny old crib on which the paint won't dry 
I bought you a pair of shoes 
A trumpet you can blow and a book of rules 
Of what to say to people when they pick on you 
Cos if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty 
Kooky too 
Won't you stay in our lover's story 
If you stay you won't be sorry 
Cos we believe in you 
Soon you'll grow, So take a chance 
With a couple of Kooks hung up on romancing 
If you ever have to go to school 
Remember how they messed up this old fool 
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads 
I'm not much cop at fighting other people's dads 
And if the homework brings you down 
Then we'll throw it on the fire 
And take the car down town 
Won't you stay in our lover's story 
If you stay you won't be sorry 
Cos we believe in you 
Soon you'll grow, So take a chance 
With a couple of Kooks hung up on romancing 
Won't you stay in our lover's story 
If you stay you won't be sorry

I've been stood by you for ages. 
Stay calm and carry on, 
maybe nothing is wrong. 
Is it the comfort of 
this information or 
is it the freedom that you feel. 
Sit on the angel of liberation oh, 
for a second I believe her. 
And all you hear, aaaah 
while you're here, aaaaah. 
Don't call it a comeback, 
look what I invented here.. 
I thought it was easy, 
they came it took it away from us. 
The last days of disco. 
All raved up, 
bitter is the pill of devotion. 
Read between the noise, 
all you discoboys (all you discoboys) 
The fascination of 
a boy and girl in love, 
for a second I can see her. 
In the mirror ball, 
the human animal, 
the creature that I fear. 
And all you hear,aaaaah, 
while you're here, aaaaaaaaaaah 
Don't call it a comeback, 
look what I invented here.. 
I thought it was easy, 
they came it took it away from us. 
The last days of disco. 
The last days of disco. 
The last days of disco. 
And all you hear,aaaaah, 
while you're here, aaaaaaaaaaah 
Don't call it a comeback, 
we'll hold an event in here 
this space is beautiful, 
I decide when it is over 
Don't call it a comeback, 
look what I invented here.. 
I thought it was easy, 
they came it took it away from us. 
The last days of disco. 
The last days of disco. 
The last days of disco.

Come out and play, the future lies with you 
Now you can be sure love is the cure 
What we're searching for is to have a jolly good time 
Crazy days but you'll get me through 
And here I'll stay holding on to you 
Now you can be sure our thoughts unpure 
We'll unlock the door and we will have a jolly good time 
It can happen in any season 
We don't need any reason to sit around and wait 
The world can change in a second 
So I find the sunshine beckons me 
To open up the gate and dream 
And dream 
Lazy days, don't let them get you down 
Wear your smile, I don't want to see you frown 
Don't let them get you down 
It can happen in any season 
We don't need any reason to sit around and wait 
The world can change in a second 
So I find the sunshine beckons me 
To open up the gate and dream

You made a miracle mother 
I'll make a man out of me 
Daddy where's the sun gone from the sky? 
What did we do wrong, why did it die? 
And all the grown ups say 'sorry kids we got no reply 
If you're willing to change the world 
Let love be your energy 
I've got more than I need 
When your love shines down on me 
Every tear that you cry 
Will be replaced when you die 
Why don't you love your brother? 
Are you out of your mind? 
Daddy where's the sun gone from the sky? 
What did we do wrong, why did it die? 
And if you've got no love for me then I'll say goodbye 
If you're willing to change the world 
Let love be your energy 
I've got more than I need 
When your love shines down on me 
If you're willing to change the world 
Let love be your energy 
I can't contain how I feel 
When your love shines down on me 
Well if you want it come and make a stance 
So when it's in your hands 
People show me love 
Well if you want it come and make a stance 
So when it's in your hands 
People show me love 
If you're willing to change the world

There's nothing left for you to fear 
Shake your ass come over here 
Now scream 
I'm a burning effigy 
Of everything I used to be 
You're my rock of empathy, my dear 
So come on let me entertain you 
Let me entertain you 
Life's too short for you to die 
So grab yourself an alibi 
Heaven knows your mother lied 
Mon cher 
Separate your right from wrongs 
Come and sing a different song 
The kettle's on so don't be long 
Mon cher 
So come on let me entertain you 
Let me entertain you 
Look me up in the yellow pages 
I will be your rock of ages 
Your see through fads and your crazy phases yeah 
Little Bo Peep has lost his sheep 
He popped a pill and fell asleep 
The dew is wet but the grass is sweet my dear 
Your mind gets burned 
With the habits you've learned 
But we're the generation that's got to be heard 
You're tired of your teachers and your school's a drag 
You're not going to end up like your mum and dad 
So come on let me entertain you 
Let me entertain you 
Let me entertain you 
He may be good he may be outta sight 
But he can't be here so come around tonight 
Here is the place where the feeling grows 
You gotta get high before you taste the lows 
So come on 
Let me entertain you 
Let me entertain you (entertain you) 
So come on let me entertain you 
Let me entertain you (entertain you) 
Come on, come on, come on, come on

            <field name="lyrics">Wake up on Sunday morning 
Everything feels so boring 
Is that where it ends 
Live your life thru a lens 
Hair is the new hat, brown is the new black 
She shouldn't wear this he shouldn't wear that 
Pleasure at leisure make mine a double measure with friends 
Fashion tardis down at Quo Vadis 
Who laughs the longest who drives the hardest 
Pleasure at leisure make mine a double measure with friends 
Just because I ain't double barrelled 
Don't mean I haven't travelled well 
Can't you tell! 
Oh no it's quite appalling 
Your conversation is boring as hell, oh well! 
Wake up on Sunday morning 
And everything feels so boring 
Is that where it ends 
With your life thru a lens 
And now your boyfriend's suspicious 
So go home and wash the dishes 
And wash them well so he can't tell 
She's looking real drab just out of rehab 
I'm talking football she's talking ab fab 
Your clothes are very kitch 
Just because your daddy is rich 
You sound so funny with your voice all plummy 
Now your cheque's just bounced better run to your mummy 
And you know it's a class act she'll never ask for it back 
Just because I ain't double barrelled 
Don't mean I haven't travelled well 
Can't you tell! 
Mix with the local gentry and don't crash Tarquin's Bentley 
I'll take the bends with our life thru a lens 
You're scared of the poor and needy 
Is that why you're all inbreedy? 
They're just like you, they need love too 
Wake up on Sunday morning 
And everything feels so boring 
Is that where it ends 
With your life thru a lens 
And now your boyfriend's suspicious 
So go home and wash the dishes 
And wash them well so he can't tell.</field>

With my hair down in my eyes 
And she says 'hi' 
And I hurry to the breakfast table 
While the kids are going off to school, goodbye 
And she reaches out and takes my hand 
And squeezes it and says "how you feelin' hon? " 
And I look across at smiling lips 
That warms my heart 
And I see my morning sun 
And if that's not loving me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
There's no such thing as Dr 
Suess 
Disneyland and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feeling low 
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind 
Sometimes I call him up knowing he's busy 
And ask if he could get away and meet me 
And maybe grab a bite to eat 
And he drops what he's doing 
And hurry's down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
He sits waiting patiently and smiles when he first sees me 
Because he's made that way 
And if that's not loving me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes 
There's no such thing as make believe 
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves, no B 
B 
guns 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feeling low

Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola [LP version: Coca-Cola] 
C-o-l-a cola 
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance 
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola 
L-o-l-a Lola la-la-la-la Lola 
Well I'm not the world's most physical guy 
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine 
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola 
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand 
Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man 
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola 
Well we drank champagne and danced all night 
Under electric candlelight 
She picked me up and sat me on her knee 
And said dear boy won't you come home with me 
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy 
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola 
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola 
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola 
I pushed her away 
I walked to the door 
I fell to the floor 
I got down on my knees 
Then I looked at her and she at me 
Well that's the way that I want it to stay 
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola 
La-la-la-la Lola 
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls 
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola 
La-la-la-la Lola 
Well I left home just a week before 
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before 
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand 
And said dear boy I'm gonna make you a man 
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man 
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man 
And so is Lola

Even if you're the best

Or we will both be losers 
I'm ashamed I ever tried to be 
higher than the rest 
But brother I am not alone 
We've all tried to be 
on top of the world somehow 
Cos we have all been losers 
I don't wanna be laid down 
No I don't wanna die knowing 
That I spent so much time 
when I was young 
Just trying to be a winner 
So I wanna make it clear now 
I wanna make it known 
That I don't care about any of 
that sh*t no more 
Don't care 'bout being a winner 
Or being smooth with women 
Or going our on Fridays 
Being the life of parties 
No, no more 
No 
There will always be 
someone worse than you 
Sister, don't let it 
get to your head 
Cos you won't be on 
top of the world so long 
In constant competition 
This ain't about no one 
in particular 
But I could list a few 
I'm removing myself 
from the queue 
Don't care 'bout being a winner 
Or being smooth with women 
Or going our on Fridays 
Being the life of parties 
Don't care 'bout being harder 
Or being Daddy's favourite 
Or if you think I'm a mimic 
Or if I am a loser 
Don't care 'bout being a winner 
Or being smooth with women 
Or going out on Fridays 
Being the life of parties 
Don't care 'bout being harder

            <field name="lyrics">When he saw her getting of the bus 
It seemed to wipe away the years 
Her face was older, just a little rough 
But her eyes were still so clear 
He drank his coffee and he hurried out 
Across before she walked away 
Then he approached her like a little child 
Too scared for what he had to say 
"Hello, Louise, 
Remember me? 
Now should we part 
Or stay awhile? 
As if we were still lovers" 
She took a moment just to recognise the man she'd known so well before 
And as he started to apologise 
Lose any bitterness she bore 
She gently put her finger on his lips 
To let him know she understood 
And with her suitcase standing on the floor 
Embraced him like a lover would 
He told louise 
"You look so good 
It's just you see 
You make me feel 
As if we were still lovers" 
It's not always true that time heals all wounds 
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal 
The memories of something really good 
Something truly real, that you never found again 
And though they talked for just a little time 
Before she said she had to go 
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign 
That told him all he had to know 
And so Louise 
Waved from the bus 
And as she left 
She gave that smile 
As if they were still lovers</field>

I'd rather jump and run away 
Than see it burn

And I think it's time for me to not be home alone 
I think I'll put the cat out and give the dog a bone 
I hardly know ya but I like your figure 
Suppose I read about you in the Mirror 
They think there's something everybody should know 
Chorus x 2 
You love me x 3 You need me I'm a liar 
You want me You need me You want me I'm a liar.</field>

I'll hold contempt for the divine 
If not for my spine 
I wouldn't see it through 
Now I like the peaks 
And waiting for a heart to speak 
Ogres and freaks sold love to you 
Cos love is you, love is what you put me through 
I am lost, you are too 
Love is you 
One minute you're fine 
Then love would go and change its mind 
I have lost all this truth 
Loving you 
Thought I had to say something 
What I should have said is nothing 
Kept it swept under the rug 
You know, what's mad is I'm in pain 
cos I made you sad 
And you still don't understand at all 
Love is you, love is what I'm going through 
I have lost, you have too 
Love is you 
One minute you're fine 
Then love would go and change its mind 
I have lost all that's true 
Loving you 
Cos love is you, love is what you made me do 
I'm forsaken, you were too 
Love is you 
One minute that you fight 
Then love would go and change its mind 
I have lost all that truth 
Loving you</field>

I will never let go completely 
One day your hands will be 
Strong enough to hold me 
I might not be there for all your battles 
But you'll win them eventually 
I'll pray that I'm giving you all 
That matters 
So one day you'll say to me 
I love my life 
I am powerful 
I am beautiful 
I am free 
I love my life 
I am wonderful 
I am magical 
I am me 
I love my life 
I am not my mistakes 
And god knows I've made a few 
I started to question the angels 
And the answer they gave was you 
I can not promise there won't be sadness 
I wish I could take it from you 
But you'll find the courage 
To face the madness 
And see it because it's true 
I love my life 
I am powerful 
I am beautiful 
I am free 
I love my life 
I am wonderful 
I am magical 
I am me 
I love my life 
Find the 
Others

Like yours 
Run far 
Run free 
I'm with you 
I love my life 
I am powerful 
I am beautiful 
I am free 
I love my life 
I am wonderful 
I am magical 
I am me 
I love my life 
I am powerful

I love my life 
I am wonderful

Is forever young 
Your shadow on the pavement 
The dark side of the sun 
Gotta dream the dream all over 
And sleep it tight 
You don't wanna sing the blues 
In black and white 
And let's hope that spring's eternal 
For everyone 
If it ain't broken, break it 
All the damage done 
Try and love somebody 
Just wanna love somebody right now 
There's just no pleasing me 
Try and love somebody 
Just wanna love somebody right now 
Lady, lay your love on me 
Ballad in the rainbow just melts away 
There's not enough minutes in an hour 
Or hours of the day 
A song played in a circle 
That never skips a beat 
A stranger on a country 
That I have yet to meet 
And let's hope that spring's eternal 
For everyone 
Your lifetime in a second 
Though the damage done 
Try and love somebody 
Just wanna love somebody right now 
'Cause there's just no pleasing me 
Try and love somebody 
Just wanna love somebody right now 
Lady, lay your love on me 
It'll come in your sweet time, Lord 
I just gotta let you in 
The blind leadin' the blind, Lord 
Getting underneath your skin 
I can feel you in the silence 
Saying let forever be 
Love, only love will set you free 
I wanna love somebody 
Just wanna love somebody right now 
There's just no pleasing me 
Try and love somebody 
Just wanna love somebody right now 
Lady, lay your love on me 
It'll come in your sweet time, Lord 
I just gotta let you in 
The blind leadin' the blind, Lord 
Getting underneath your skin 
I can feel you in the silence 
Saying let forever be 
Love and only love will set you free

Oh the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear, 
And he shows them, pearly white, 
Just a jackknife has old MacHeath, babe, 
And he keeps it, out of sight, 
Ya know when that shark bites with his teeth, dear, 
Scarlet billows start to spread, 
Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, babe, 
So there's never, never a trace of red 
On the sidewalk, oh, Sundy morning, dontcha know, 
Lies a body just oozin' life, 
And someone's sneakin' 'round the corner, 
Could that be our boy, Mack the knife? 
From a tug boat, down by the river, dontcha know, 
There's a cement bag just dropping on down, 
That cement's there, it's there for the weight, dear, 
Five'll bet ya ten old Macky's back in town 
D'ja here 'bout Louie Miller, he disappeared, baby, 
After drawing out all, his hard-earned cash, 
And now MacHeath spends, he spends just like a, like a sailor, 
Could it be, could it be, could it be, our boy's done something rash? 
Now Jenny Diver, oh Sukey Tawdry, 
Look out Miss Lotte Lenya, and ole Lucy Brown, 
Yeah, the line forms on the right, babe, 
Now that Macky's back in town 
I said Jenny Diver, woah, oh Sukey Tawdry, 
Look out Miss Lotte Lenya, and ole Lucy Brown, 
Yes, the line forms on the right, babe, 
Now that Macky's, back in town... 
Look out, old Macky is back, WOW!!!.</field>

To reel 'em in 
It's a song I sung before 
And a song I'm gonna sing again 
I mean every word 
I don't mean a single one of them 
Oh Lord 
Make me pure 
But not yet 
Tell a joke 
Tell it twice 
If no one else is laughing 
Then why am I 
I split my sides both times 
And laugh untill I cry 
Oh Lord 
Please, make me pure 
But not yet 
Don't have to try 
I just dial it in 
I've never found a job 
That for me was worth bothering 
I've got a ton of selfish genes 
And lazy bones beneath this skin 
Oh Lord 
Make me pure 
But not yet 
Smoking kills 
Sex sells 
I've got one hand in my pocket 
But the other one looks cool as hell 
I know I'm gonna die 
So my revenge is living well 
Oh Lord 
Make me pure 
But not yet 
I stopped praying 
So I hope this song will do 
I wrote it all for you 
I'm not perfect 
But you don't mind that, do you? 
I know you're there to pull me through 
Aren't you? 
So I look for love 
I like the search 
And I'll be standing for election 
All across the known Universe 
That every president 
Get the country she deserves 
Oh Lord 
Make me pure 
But not yet 
And I've been seeing 
Somebody's wife 
She said she'd leave him for me 
And I said that wasn't wise 
You can't lie to a liar 
Because of all the lies 
Oh Lord 
Please make me pure 
But not yet</field>

From sun up till the moon on his back. 
Send the villains to Hades, a hit with the ladies 
a stallion, in the sack. 
You cant get your life back, when right follows left Jack, 
The more you see, the less you know. 
When others would leak it, his service is secret. 
Plays God when its your time to go. 
Queen and country safe and sound, with villains six feet under ground. 
And no one knows cause no ones found any trace of a man for all seasons. 
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone....so alone 
And you and i wouldn't have a clue, whose doing what, why, when and who, up the 
creek with no conoe, 
wathc out for the man for all seasons, loves 'em and leaves 'em alone......so 
alone (but safe at home) 
From the House of Lords saving Norfolk broads, 
Commoners and land a gentry. 
His word is Bond with a brunette or blonde, baby its so elementry. 
For the man never ends, stop your life with one stare, 
See the film you'll know how it goes 
This aint no fiction, just check the diction, with pro quo, a pro's pro. 
Hey fellas, dont be jealous, when the madfe him they broke the mould 
So 
chrasimatic, with an a automatic, 
Never prematurely shooting his load. 
Queen and country safe and sound, with villains six feet under ground. 
And no one knows cause no ones foundany trace of a man for all seasons.

            <field name="lyrics">There was me and my monkey 
And with his dungarees and roller blades smoking 
filter tips 
Reclining in the passenger seat of my super-charged 
jet black Chevrolet 
He had the soft-top down (he liked the wind in his 
face) 
He said 'Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said 'no' 
He said 'that's where we're gonna go - you need a 
change of pace' 
And we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and 
the neon signs 
He said 'I left my wallet in El Segondo' and proceeded 
to take two grand of mine 
We made tracks to The Mandalay Bay Hotel 
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as 
well? 
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a 
smile he said 
'If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, then 
we've got a monkey bed!' 
 
Me and my monkey 
With a dream and a gun 
I'm hoping my monkey don't point that gun at anyone 
Me and my monkey 
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid 
Trying to understand why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did 
 
We got the elevator, I hit the 33rd floor 
We had a room up top with the panoramic views like 
nothing you'd ever seen 
before 
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke 
He ran his little monkey fingers through yellow pages 
Called up some escort services and ordered some okey 
doke 
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door 
In walked this big bad ass baboon into my bedroom with 
three monkey whores 
'Hi! My name is Sunshine - these are my girls 
Lace my palm with silver baby and oh yeah, they'll 
rock your world' 
So I watched pay-per-view and polished my shoes and my 
gun 
Was diggin' old Kurt Cobain singing 'bout lithium 
There came a knock at the door and in walked Sunshine 
'What's up? You'd better get your ass in here boy, 
your monkey's having too 
much of a good time!' 
 
Me and my monkey 
Drove in search of the sun 
Me and my monkey 
Don't point that gun at anyone 
Me and my monkey 
Like Billy The Kid 
Trying to understand why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did 
 
Got tickets to see Sheena Easton, the monkey was high 
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he 
died 
We left before encores, he couldn't sit still 
Sheena was a blast baby but my monkey was ill 
We went to play black-jack, kept hitting twenty three 
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at 
me 
Or was it my monkey? I couldn't be sure 
It's not like you'd never seen a monkey in 
rollerblades and dungarees before 
Now don't test my patience 'cause we're not about to 
run 
That's a bad ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun 
'My name is Rodriguez', he says with death in his eye 
'I've been chasing you for a long time amigos, and now 
your monkey's gonna die!' 
Me and my monkey 
Drove in search of the sun 
Me and my monkey 
We don' wanna kill no Mexican 
But we got ten itchy fingers 
One thing to declare 
When the monkey is high 
You do not stare 
You do not stare 
You do not stare 
Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here 
boy 
And I ain't about to run 
Put your gun down boy 
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow</field>

(duet with Jonathan Wilkes) 
Written by Dave Dreyer, Al Jolson and Billy Rose 
[spoken] 
Robbie: (american accent) Johnny and Robbie 
Jonathon: What you talking like that for, you're from Stoke! 
Robbie: I dunno but I can't stop here pally 
Like the wallpaper sticks to the wall 
Like the C sharp clings to the C 
Like you'll never get rid of your shadow 
You'll never get rid of me 
Let all the others fight and fuss 
Whatever happens, we've got us. 
[Me and my shadow] 
We're closer than pages that stick in a book 
We're closer than ripples that flow in a brook 
[Strolling down the avenue] 
Wherever you find him, you'll find me, just look 
Closer than a miser or the bloodhounds to Liza 
 
Me and my shadow 
We're closer than smog to all of L.A. 
We're closer than Ricky to confessing he's gay?? 
Not a soul can bust this team in two 
We stick together like glue 
And when it's sleeping time 
That's when we rise 
We start to swing 
Our clocks don't chime 
What a surprise 
They ring-a-ding-ding! 
Happy New Year! 
[Me and my shadow] 
And now to repeat what I said at the start 
They'll need a large crowbar to break us apart 
We're alone but far from blue 
Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar 
We'll hit a few late spots, and then a few more 
We'll wind up at Stringy's and maybe ? show 
Life is gonna be we-wow-whee! 
For my shadow and me! 
[spoken] 
Jonathon: Can we do that again 
Robbie: No, I'm too tired 
Jonathon: Please Rob 
Robbie: No, I'm swung out 
Jonathon: I'll give you some money 
Robbie: I don't need money 
Jonathon: What about a cup of tea 
Robbie: Not thirsty 
Jonathon: I'll won't tell anyone you're gay. 
(Both Laugh) 
Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar 
We'll hit all the late spots, and then a few more 
We'll wind up at Stringy's and maybe ? show 
Life is gonna be we-wow-whee! 
For my shadow and me!.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">The year before I thought of leaving 
I cant remember what I did 
Us in bed in Maida Vale basements 
When you left 
Westend winters 
High heel clatters 
Morning dawning 
Nothing matters 
When we took a cab 
Back when cabs had somewhere to go 
And we'd meet the stars 
When stars were people you'd want to know 
We were new to fame 
woaooh oh oh oh 
I'm so glad you came 
Some of us fell by the wayside 
Others had it and threw it away 
Some carried on pretending 
That it was not ending today 
Once admired 
Oh so tired 
Lose it all 
In the night time 
And we took a cab 
Back when cabs had somewhere to go 
And we'd meet the stars 
When stars were people you'd want to know 
We were new to fame 
I'm so glad I came 
It took me years to find my own song 
And for years I thought I'd just sing along 
But the words were wrong 
A tune that is true lives on and on 
It will still be here when I'm gone 
And we took a cab 
Back when cabs had somewhere to go 
And we'd meet the stars 
When stars were people you'd want to know 
We were new to fame 
wo oho hoh 
I'm so glad we came 
And we'd take a cab 
Back when cabs had somewhere to go 
And we'd meet the stars 
When stars were people you'd want to know 
We were new to fame 
wo oho hoh 
I'm so glad I came</field>

And we're praying it's not too late 
Millennium 
Some say that we are players 
Some say that we are pawns 
but we've been making money since the day that we were born 
Got to slow down, cause we'll low down. 
 
Round and round in circles live a life of solitude 
'till we find ourselves a partner someone to relate to 
Then we slow down, before we fall down. 
 
We've got stars directing our fate 
And we're praying it's not too late 
'cause we know we're falling from grace 
Millennium 
Live for liposuction, detox for your rent 
Overdose for Christmas and give it up for Lent 
My friends are all so cynical refuse to keep the faith 
We all enjoy the madness 'cause we know we're gonna fade away. 
 
We've got stars directing our fate 
And we're praying it's not too late 
'cause we know we're falling from grace

Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough 
Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough

(Sometimes you know) 
And when we come we always come too late 
I often think that we were born to hate 
get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes.

She was a real hot hoochie-koocher 
She was the roughest, toughest frail 
but Minnie had a heart as big as a whale 
Hodee-hodee-hodee-ho 
Heedey-hee-dee-hee-dee hee 
Hidee-hidee-hidee-ho 
OO 
She messed around with a bloke named Smoky 
She loved him though he was a tad cokey 
He took her down to Chinatown 
Where he showed her how to kick the gong around 
Hidee-Hidee-Hidee-hi 
Wooh 
Heedey-hee-dee-hee-dee hee 
Ahooyop 
She had a dream about the King of Sweden 
He gave her things that she was needin' 
he gave her a home built of gold and steel 
A diamond car with platinum wheels 
hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hi () 
hodee-hodee-hodee-hodee-hodee-hodee-ho () 
Uoo -woo 
Uoo ho ho 
He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses 
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses 
He had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes 
She sat around and counted them a million times 
Hidee-Hidee-Hidee-hi

But it doesn't do me any good 
Love the way they smiled at me 
Held their face for eternity 
Now let them all fly off 
When it comes down 
It all comes down 
And you will not be found 
When it's over 
It?s all over 
Even if I make a sound 
I'll be misunderstood 
By the beautiful and good 
In this city 
None of it was planned 
Take me by the hand 
Just don't try and understand 
Trying to be misunderstood 
Just a product of my childhood 
And still I find myself outside 
You can't say I haven't tried 
Perhaps I tried too hard 
No excuses 
I won't apologise 
Or justified your lies 
Come and find me 
Tell them to me 
Look me in the eyes 
I'll be misunderstood 
By the beautiful and good 
In this city 
None of this was planned 
Take me by the hand 
Just don't try and understand 
Can't forgive – sorry to say 
You don?t know you're guilty anyway

Tried again at 11, got sent straight to voicemail 
You said you needed a calm, quiet night alone 
But that don't explain why you're not picking up the phone 
Now I'm driving through the city like a bullet in my seat 
And I hold my breath when I hit your street 
You were restless when you told me everything was alright 
One quiet night alone 
If nothing is wrong 
How come you're not home 
[Chorus] 
And it's almost 3AM 
When you decide to show? 
You're gonna tell me where you've been 
Don't spare me details, I wanna know 
What does he look like? 
What does he talk like? 
Thought you wanted to make this work 
But you're sending me mixed signals 
[Verse 2] 
With lowered emotion 
You greet me and I'm overcome 
'Cause your body language is speaking in another tongue 
First you tell me that you needed some excitement in your life 
Then you grab the handle and turn the knife 
Accusations of obsessive misbehaviour 
Like we ain't been down to hell and back 
And made untrue 
I thought that was you 
[Chorus] 
And it's almost 3AM 
When you decide to show 
You're gonna tell me where you've been 
Don't spare me details, I wanna know 
What does he look like? 
What does he talk like? 
Thought you wanted to make this work 
But you're sending me mixed signals 
[Bridge] 
And in the dusk we fall apart 
The sun's got his elbow 
In the rib cage of town 
I'm breaking down 
[Chorus] 
And it's almost 3AM 
When you decide to show 
You're gonna tell me where you've been 
Don't sugarcoat it, girl, I want the blow-by-blow 
What does he look like? 
What does he talk like? 
Thought you wanted to make this work 
But you're sending me mixed signals 
Yeah, sending me mixed signals 
[Outro] 
Darling, darling believe me 
Know that, no you don't need me 
Break up, you know it won't please me 
Sweetheart, let me down easy 
Cut me loose, baby, don't tease me 
Oh Lord, let me down easy

            <field name="lyrics">How do you rate the morning sun 
After a long and sleepless night 
How many stars would you give to the moon 
Do you see those stars from where you are 
Shine on the lost and loneliest 
The ones who can?t get over it 
And you always wanted more than life 
But now you don?t have the appetite 
In a message to the troubadour 
The world don?t love you anymore 
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun 
Stuck inside the rainbow years 
And you could happen to me 
?Cause I?ve been close to where you are 
I drove to places you have seen 
It all seems so familiar 
Like they?d been sent to kill ya 
It doesn?t take an astronaut 
To float into space is just a thought 
The morning brings a mystery 
The evening makes it history 
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun 
And the village drunk 
Sadly passed away 
It was a shame 
I never knew his name 
I wonder if he sat there every morning 
And watched the sun rise 
How do you rate the morning sun 
It was just too heavy for me 
And all I wanted was the world 
If you are the starlet in the sun 
Don?t go wasting your time 
?Cause there is no finish line 
And you don?t see anything 
Not even love not anything 
The night could take the man from you 
A sense of wonder overdue 
The morning brings a mystery 
The evening makes it history 
Who am I to rate the morning sun</field>

Your uncle sells drugs 
Your cousin is a cutter 
Your grandma is a fluffer 
Your granddad's in the gutter 
Your mother is a nutter 
Your mother is a nutter

You're a bad motherfucker 
Helps to know where you come from 
When days are hard and things go wrong 
I pray our weakness makes you strong 
Well, strangers come and lovers leave 
You can rest assured we'll always be 
Your ever loving family

So before you leave when you're old enough 
When you go out on your own and stuff 
You start losing hold of love

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh

He would jump so high

That he lightly touched down 
Told me of the time 
He worked with, with minstrel shows 
Travelling troughout the south 
He spoke with tears for fifteen years 
How his how his dog and him 
They will travel about 
But his dog up and died 
Got up and died 
After twenty years he still grieves 
He said 
I dance now 
at every chance in honky tonks 
for my drinks and tips 
but most the time I, I spend behind these country bars 
You see I drinks a bit 
Then he shook his head 
Oh Lord, when he shook his head

Never been a better time than now 
Guess I found some courage now 
Just to tell you what goes down

I'm the sum total of my ancestors 
I carry their DNA 
We are representatives of a long line of people 
And we carried them around either with 
This long line of people 
That goes back to the beginning of time 
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people 
And we say bring together the lines of me 
When I look back over the years 
At the things that brought tears to my eyes 
Papa said we have to be wise 
To live long lives 
Now I recognize 
What my father said before he dies 
Vocalize things I've left unsaid 
Left my spirit unfed for too long 
I'm coming home to my family 
Where I can be strong 
Be who I planned to be 
Within me my ancestory 
Givin'me continuity 
Would it be remiss to continue in this way 
Would you rather I quit 
Come with the other shit 
Making people's hips sway 
Lip service I pay but I´m nervous 
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep 
Like a lifeline I light lines cause my compassion is deep 
For the people who fashioned me my soul to keep 
And this is who I happen to be 
And if I don't see that I'm strong than I won't be 
This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
Than he did 
But he taught me my culture 
And how to live positive 
I never wanna shame 
The blood in my veins and bring pain 
to my sweet grandfathers face 
In his resting place 
I made haste to learn and not waste 
everything my forefathers earned in tears 
For my culture 
Chorus: 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
(For my culture) 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again. 
Hello Dad, 
Remember me? 
I'm the man you thought I'd never be. 
I'm the boy who you 
Reduced to tears 
Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years 
Yeah, that´s right 
My name´s Bob 
I'm the one 
Who landed the popstar's job 
I'm the one who 
You told look, don´t touch 
I'm the kid 
Who wouldn´t amount to much. 
I believe in the senses sight and sound 
I have always been too loud 
Won't you help me drown it out? 
I'm what I feel 
What I´m feeling is surreal 
I'm a mass of spinnin' wheels 
Always digging in my heels 
Now I got the faith to 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again. 
Lace up your boots we're going back to the roots 
Speaking to my ghetto youths freak freaking for loot 
And nice things, better check what your future brings 
It's now and your forefathers for the know how 
Go now into the world without hatred 
Use your head 
If the needle is wise be the thread 
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by birth 
Spreading the Lords word over this broad earth 
This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
than he did 
But he told me my culture 
And how to live positive 
I never wanna shame 
The blood in my veins and bring pain 
To my sweet grandfathers face 
in his resting place 
I make haste to learn and not waste 
everything my forefathers earned in tears 
For my culture 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again 
(For my culture) 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
Your on your feet again 
Your feet again

            <field name="lyrics">Don't show your true colours 
Let them lie follow someone else's dream 
One day I'll look back at this and die 
But you won't know what it means 
To never see me 
Did we sail you down river? 
Do you run around all day avoiding mirrors? 
Do you find comfort in the hate? I 
S this abuse too late? 
My heart's just bleeding for you 
And this is my fuck you to you 
By the time you were into my blood 
I was all of seventeen 
You were the light of my life 
And the darkness in-between 
Whatever that means 
Did we sail you down river? 
Do you run around all day avoiding mirrors? 
Do you find comfort in the hate? I 
S this abuse too late? 
My heart's just bleeding for you 
And this is my fuck you to you 
I used to see you in my dreams 
But I could not compete 
Then you taught me the value 
Of never losing sleep 
How you sink like a home 
Putting children on the street 
Is it anger or sympathy 
How I sail you down river? 
But you must feel some disdain 
Then I'll forgive you 
All day long you are night 
But I am vaguely right 
My hearts just bleeding for you 
This is a fuck you 
This is my fuck you to you</field>

            <field name="lyrics">And now the end is near 
So I face the final curtain 
My friend, I'll say it clear 
I'll state my case of which I'm certain 
I've lived a life that's full 
I've travelled each and every highway 
And more, much more than this 
I did it my way 
Regrets, I've had a few 
But then again, too few to mention 
I did what I had to do 
And saw it through without exception 
I planned each charted course 
Each careful step along the byway 
Oh, and more, much more than this 
I did it my way 
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew 
When I bit off more than I could chew 
But through it all when there was doubt 
I ate it up and spit it out 
I faced it all and I stood tall 
And did it my way 
I've loved, I've laughed and cried 
I've had my fails, my share of losing 
And now as tears subside 
I find it all so amusing 
To think I did all that 
And may I say, not in a shy way 
Oh, no, no not me 
I did it my way 
For what is a man, what has he got 
If not himself, then he has not 
To say the things he truly feels 
And not the words he would reveal 
The record shows I took the blows 
And did it my way.</field>

You said when you'd die that you'd walk 
with me everyday 
And I'd start to cry and say please don't talk that way 
With the blink of an eye the lord came 
and asked you to meet 
You went to a better place but He stole you 
away from me 
And now she lives in heaven 
But i know they let her out 
To take care of me 
There's a strange kind of light 
Caressing me tonight 
Pray silence my fears she is near 
Bringing heaven down here 
I miss your love I miss your touch 
But I'm feeling you everyday 
And I can almost here you say 
"You've come along way baby" 
And now you live in heaven 
But I know they let you out 
To take care of me 
There's a strange kind of light 
In my bedroom tonight 
Pray silence my fears she is near 
Bring your heaven down here 
You taught me kings and queens 
While stroking my hair 
In my darkest hour I know you are there 
Kneeling down beside me 
Whispering my prayer 
Yes there's a strange kind of light 
Caressing me tonight 
Pray silence my fear 
She is near 
Bringing heaven down here 
The next time that we meet 
I will bow at her feet 
And say wasn't life sweet 
Then we'll prepare 
To take heaven down there</field>

Though he's never out on time 
Night after night 
Line after line 
He'll be fine 
I suppose 
The famous Mr 
Jones 
He really should relax 
He's due a heart attack 
Though there's no heart to attack 
Is it an act? 
No one knows 
The naughty Mr 
Jones 
In a world full of weird, you're the oddest ever 
Heard you brought everyone here so much pleasure, clever 
We all know that you know you're a national treasure 
Mrs 
Jones you made the best boy ever, ever 
E-V-E-R 
He's careful with his weight 
Pushes food around the plate 
He can never pass as straight 
Ask his mates 
How it goes 
The careful Mr 
Jones 
Even his mother thinks he's odd 
He hasn't got a proper job 
But he says neither did God 
And he's the Lord 
As it goes 
The mighty Mr 
Jones 
In a world full of weird, you're the oddest ever 
Heard you brought everyone here so much pleasure, clever 
We all know that you know you're a national treasure

The moral of this tale 
Is when everything's for sale 
Good men seldom prevail 
They all fail

In the vessel there's a switch in the middle 
You really shouldn't fiddle cause its toxic 
Listen up 'cos it's a red light

There's a skism in the time mechanism 
There's a skism in the time mekanism 
Never touch that switch

You don't know what it can do. 
Never touch that switch, even if you want to. 
You don't know what it can do. 
See the futures in the distance 
I know I'm facing some resistance 
Getting back within the blink of a bubble 
Time machine never gives us any trouble. 
There's a riot down in Shelton 
Only minutes after Brixton but this city never made it on the telly 
Or the rumble of the nations underbelly 
Never touch that switch, even if you want to. 
You don't know what it can do. 
Never touch that switch, even if you want to. 
You don't know what it can do. 
You know you're heading for a meltdown, and you're living in a tin town 
Thinking that you're gonna be somebody, living in the land of milk and honey

            <field name="lyrics">I come from a land of kebabs and curries 
Second helpings - no worries 
Piled up carbs upon the plate 
Then one day it's too late 
No breakfast, no luncheon 
Just carpets I'll munch on 
A thimble of self esteem 
Glazed nothings for afters and absence of laughter 
The saddest that I've ever been 
You just can't be portly, not this side of fourty 
Showbiz's a single-chinned game 
Scum paparazzi and weight police 
Nasties have narrowed the hall of fame 
No one likes a fat pop star 
Pop is a place for the thin 
No one likes a fat pop star 
We want to hear thin people sing! 
When I get faint I chew through my restraints 
It's the best meal that I've had all week 
If I could eat my own words, I'd tear through the verbs 
But nobody pays me to speak 
No one likes a fat pop star 
Pop is a place for the thin 
No one wants a fat pop star 
I'm sorry, we can't fit you in! 
Now you've upset me - I feel like a snack! 
A packet of minstrels, a pie and a nap 
So whats wrong with that? 
No breakfast, no luncheon 
Just carpets I'll munch on 
And a thimble of self esteem 
Glazed nothing for afters and absence of laughter 
The thinnest that I've ever been 
Thank you!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Tell me a story 
Where we all change 
And we'd live our lives together 
And not estranged 
I didn't lose my mind it was 
Mine to give away 
Couldn't stay to watch me cry 
You didn't have the time 
So I softly slip away... 
*CHORUS* 
No regrets/ they don't work 
No regrets now/ they only hurt 
Sing me a love song 
Drop me a line suppose it's just a point of view 
But they tell me I'm doing fine 
I know from the outside 
We looked good for each other 
Felt things were going wrong 
When you didn't like my mother 
I don't want to hate but that's 
All you left me with 
A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy of 
How we all could live 
*CHORUS* 
No regrets/ they don't work 
No regrets now/ they only hurt 
(we've been told you stay up late) 
I know they're still talking 
(you're far too short to carry weight) 
The demons in your head 
(Return the videos they're late) 
If I could just stop hating you 
(goodbye) 
I'd feel sorry for us instead 
Remember the photographs (insane) 
The ones where we all laugh (so lame) 
We were having the time of our lives 
Well thank you it was a real blast 
No regrets/ they don't work 
No regrets/ they only hurt 
Write me a love song 
Drop me a line 
Suppose it's just a point of view 
But they tell me I'm doing fine 
Everything I wanted to be every 
Time I walked away 
Everytime you told me to leave 
I just wanted to stay 
Everytime you looked at me and 
Everytime you smiled 
I felt so vacant you treat me like a child 
I loved the way we used to laugh 
I loved the way we used to smile 
Often i sit down and think of you 
For a while 
Then it passes and i think of 
Someone else instead 
I guess the love we once had is 
Officially dead.</field>

The days of rage 
are not behind me 
I have to 
Live outside the law 
Cos I'm a naughty boy 
with a dirty habit 
Trying to use some 
teenage magic 
Picking pennies off the floor 
Oh when she comes 
She comes for hours 
Stun 
She don't fake for no one 
She don't fake for no one 
And if love 
Gets in the way of you 
Let's do what we're 
supposed to do 
And all lay low 
Oh baby please 
Beggin you darling please 
Under the covers 
You and me are 
not like the others 
You and me are 
not like the others 
Please 
Beggin you darling please 
God loves a lover 
You and me are 
not like the others 
You and me are 
not like the others 
You do something 
that reminds me 
I've no resistance, 
follow blindly 
Baby that's what 
I came here for 
Cos you pull me out 
of my sedation 
Practice high street meditation 
And other sexual metaphors 
So when you come 
You come for hours 
Stun 
I don't fake for no one 
She don't fake for no one 
And if love gets in 
the way of you 
Let's do what we're

Sending out a message 
To the corners of the universe

The situation's so much worse than I thought 
Can you hear the boy stood 
In the middle of the milky way 
From ten billion miles away? 
This is not where I belong 
Never was, take me home 
Come dance while we still can 
Cause the plans they have 
For man ain't no good 
I tried to warn you all, you all, you all 
Cause I've been ticking like a time bomb 
I've bit my tongue so much it's all gone

She's showing me faces I should never have seen 
Well these are strange days we're living in today 
C'est la vie I say 
I hope I'm old before I die 
I hope I live to relive the days gone by 
I hope I'm old before I die 
But tonight I'm gonna live for today 
So come along for the ride 
I hope I'm old before I die 
She's not feeling stable, she's unable to breathe 
Her heart's beating faster so I'll ask her to leave 
These are strange days we're living in today 
Am I straight or gay ? 
I hope I'm old before I die 
I hope I live to see the day the Pope gets high 
I hope I'm old before I die 
Well tonight I'm gonna live for today 
So come along for the ride 
I hope I'm old before I die 
Well these are strange days we're living in today 
C'est la vie I say, I say

I hope I'm old before I die 
I hope I live to relive the days gone by 
I hope I'm old before I die

So come along for the ride 
I hope I'm old before I die 
I hope I'm old before I die 
Old before I die 
Old before, old before I die and die and die and die 
Old before I die 
Old before I die.</field>

I'm only several words into this song 
Yesterday yes was the equation 
Now todays no what's the occasion 
I used to be the bird that always flew 
Did I sit on the fence 
Because all I can think of is you 
I've never been more confused 
I look at the phone but it's all bad news 
When I check for the text 
Like a neurotic chancer 
The verb is a void cause no is the answer 
I used to be the boy who played it cool 
Then I sat on the fence 
And all I could think of is you 
Oh, did we enter the friend zone 
And oh, is there any way back 
I thought we had a strong connection 
You said it had to be perfection 
Please let me be the one to break that rule 
I don't know what went wrong 
Cause I don't have a clue 
Like a knife and a fork and a big bowl of soup 
And I sat on the fence 
And now all I can think of is you 
Why, why.. 
why, why, why, why</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Like to reminisce about a time I’ve never had 
A book that no one read 
A film that never made me sad 
And you remind of a place I've never been 
And something no one said 
When I was 17 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
You'll wake up in it 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
But you probably won't admit it 
Remember when we never struggled through 
A bad time we never had 
A love we never fell into 
Please don't remind me to forget 
'Cause forgiveness is a place 
I ain't got used to yet 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
You'll wake up in it 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
But you probably won't admit it 
All I ever wanted 
Was to radiate your home 
But I guess it doesn't matter 
So come reminisce about a time we didn't have 
I hear there's a sequel to that film that never made you sad 
Don't rewrite my history 
Cause you'll never really know 
How much you didn’t mean to me 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
You'll wake up in it 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
But you probably won't admit it 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
You'll wake up in it 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
But you probably won't admit it

            <field name="lyrics">(Originally performed by Ella Fitzgerald in 1943) 
It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place 
Except you and me 
So set 'em' up Joe, I got a little story 
I think you should know 
We're drinking my friend, to the end 
Of a brief episode 
Make it one for my baby 
And one more for the road 
I know the routine, put another nickel 
In the machine 
I feel kind of bad, can't you make the music 
Easy and sad 
I could tell you a lot, but it's not 
In a gentleman's code 
Make it one for my baby 
And one more for the road 
You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet 
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say 
And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me 
Till it's talked away 
Well that's how it goes, and Joe I know your gettin' 
Anxious to close 
Thanks for the cheer 
I hope you didn't mind 
My bending your ear 
But this torch that I found, It's gotta be drowned 
Or it's gonna explode 
Make it one for my baby 
And one more for the road.</field>

I'd die without you 
Without you, without you 
You're one of God's better people 
And you don't know 
That's why you're special 
It must hurt to see your favorite man 
Lose himself again and again 
And I know you that you're my only friend 
From way back when 
My wish was pure 
It was oh so pure 
It was pure 
I couldn't love you more 
Now I can't live this without you 
I'd die without you 
Without you 
Now I can't live this without you 
I'd die without you 
Without you, without you 
And everybody's going to step aside 
As you spread your wings and you will fly 
And take me to the other side where they know 
'cos I don't know no more 
I just don't know no more 
I don't know 
Let me love you so 
Now I can't live this without you 
I'd die without you

Do you believe stars disappear

All these dreams, 
All these lies, 
All that sleeping around...

Empty rooms, 
All this, all this...

With a certain reputation 
To alleviate the cash

Take my loose change 
And build my own space station 
Just because you can, man 
Ain't no refutin' or disputin'

Act highfalutin while

So I never say sorry 
There's a doll inside 
A doll inside a doll inside a dolly 
Hello, dolly 
I put a bank inside a car 
Inside a plane inside a boat 
It takes half the western world 
Just to keep my ship afloat 
And I never ever smile 
Unless I've something to promote 
I just won't emote

Shelter me from pain

Wish they'd take you back 
'Cos you miss heaven 
Too many bags to pack 
So leave them where they are 
Tonight you're flying on a golden dream

Everybody's talking 
Nobody's listening 
Too busy thinking 'bout what you've been missing 
Everybody said you're gonna take it 
Too far baby now 
Well come on 
When you're done with lovin' 
It comes down to nothing 
Can you feel it 
Can you feel it 
Can you feel it

Why don't you come and deny it? 
You know you can't deny it

Was self-fulfilling prophecy 
I need to change the sounds 
That shape my life 
And if you die before I leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around there's no one here 
To love me and hold me 
Take me dancing 
I love music 
Keep on singing 
We won't lose it 
Picture me there 
Missing no one 
If young hearts run free 
Why can't we go on 
Go on 'till they kick us out 
We've everything to talk about 
I could bring a song into your life 
If you should die before I leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around there's no one here 
To love me and hold me 
Maybe I've been away too long 
I know I'm not always right but is that wrong 
They say there's nothing I can do 
But talk to strangers and wait for you 
If you should die before I leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around there's no one here 
To love me and hold me 
And if you die before I leave 
What on earth becomes of me

They´re playing off-on-off-on-off with the lights 
Without permission they just dizz up the lights 
And they're not seeing the lights, alright 
I wish they go and talk to Jesus instead 
Cause now they're bored and want to mess with my head 
I know I´m lonely but I won´t share my bed

When I was young I didn't know what to do 
I started thinking maybe I was dead too 
A world of actors watching me, watching you 
Till I hadn´t a clue what was true 
Don´t send the sandman to a sensitive kid 
And make-up monsters in my house where they live 
You'll beat the demons that they scare themselves with 
I know cause you know that I did

I'm the man you thought I'd never be. 
The boy who you reduced to tears, 
The lad called "thingy" for six whole years. 
Yeah that's right, my names bob, 
The one who landed the popstars job. 
The one who you told: "Look don't touch" 
The Kid who wouldn'y amount to much. 
Well I'm here, and you're still there 
With your fake sports car and receding hair 
Dodgy, farout trousers that you think are smart 
Married to the woman that teaches art 
Married to the life 
Married to the school 
"I want to sing and dance sir" 
Now who's the fool? 
Sing and dance, you thought I was barmy 
"Settle down thingy, join the army" 
And who were you to tell me this 
The dream I want I'll have to miss 
Sir is god, he's been given the right 
To structure lives overnight. 
Now I know life's true path, 
Tanks and guns, that'll be a laugh. 
Nah, not me, I'm a mega civillian 
I won't leave my life riding pillion 
But thanks for the advice and I'm sure it'll do 
For the negitive dickheads just like you. 
As for now the different weapon 
Stage and screen is about to beckon 
And here I sit in first class 
Bollocks sir, kiss my ass..</field>

Ease into the rhythm when I hear that sound 
My momma taught me and I do not back down 
Hey pretty woman, I love the way you move 
Winding down low to that baseline groove 
The way you're dancing got me in the mood 
Daddy told me it's what grown folks do 
Let me tell ya now 
Hey pretty woman Imma testify 
Hey pretty woman make a grown man cry

You can make me beg 
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar) 
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna 
The way you move your legs 
Well, it just ain't proper 
Why don't you shake 
what you've been given from your momma? 
Hey pretty woman, come and hold my hand 
Dance the Charleston to that old swing band 
I know that it's getting late but you don't mind 
Let's take a taxi and get back to mine 
Hey pretty woman, your daddy don't know 
Take what you want from me, I can't say no 
Just put your hands on my body, let me taste your lips 
I put my hands on your body, baby, work those hips 
[Chorus] 
You can make me beg 
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar) 
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna

Well, it just ain't proper

Hey pretty woman, na, na, na, I'm in love 
You are the only one I'm thinking of 
Hey pretty woman, if you feel the same 
Just say "hey there, boy, bring that beat back again"

You can make me beg 
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar) 
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna, wanna

A little more romantic 
Creep up on you 
While you sleep 
I'll make you less attractive 
Born without a spine 
Why dont you try 
Being kind 
For those attempting their mother's way 
You'll find a way to soldier on 
For those whose love evaporates 
I pray you find where you belong 
All the words I have repressed 
Are coming out today 
I guess 
It is justice not respect and avarice 
And that just leaves comtempt 
For you all 
Oh oh oh 
Yeah yeah 
Yeah 
I am just a simple man 
With simple expectations 
Deep regrets 
They're seldom met 
God speed my generation 
And with ? on my mind 
I should try being kind 
For those about to die 
We salute you 
For those of about to cry 
We love you 
For those about to die 
We salute you 
For those of about to cry 
We love you</field>

C is for coming on strong 
Cos everyone knows 
Till the death of it all 
We're not going home 
You' set out to dance 
Real hard to find 
Only the brave, expanding the mind 
You were hands in the air 
Cos love was the drug 
You breaking the law 
Making it up 
The Dj said "Raver, get off the speaker 
You're blocking the laser for the dance off 
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway 
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway 
These are the days that make sense of my life 
Like a galaxy rising into the night 
I get a little bit high and then loaded alone 
I am not going home 
I go out dancing, raving with strangers 
Unwound emotion on the dance floor 
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway 
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway 
One scream for the last romantic 
One heart for the last romantic 
One hope for the last romantic 
One scream one dream

In the middle of the sea 
When you close your eyes 
Tell me what you hear 
Tell me what you feel 
When you cross that heart 
And you hope to die 
You might get your chance 
It could be tonight, could be tonight 
Oooooohooooohooo 
Can you feel it coming 
Oooooohooooohooo 
Can you feel the calling 
So put your hand in my hand 
Watch them burning 
down this island 
To see your brown eyes there 
Lit by the riots that they're 
running from 
It's just a bad day 
Not a bad life 
I've seen your eyes 
You were bona fide 
Born to fight 
There'll be someone here 
When they come for me 
They need to cross that place 
Where a heart should be, 
where a heart should be 
Oooooohooooohooo 
Can you feel the calling 
(Repeat) 
May this moment of surrender 
Live in your heart forever 
The earth will move and shake 
But they can never keep us apart 
Born to the life they gave us 
Of bitterness and failures 
Though I may lose myself 
They can never keep us apart 
We're in a land on fire 
In the middle of the sea 
When I close my eyes 
Only you, only me 
Oooooohooooohooo 
This is our finest hour 
Underneath the seats of power 
The earth will break the chains 
You know they'll never 
keep us apart 
So put your hand in my hand 
God knows, we own this island 
The truth will move and shake 
But they can never keep us apart</field>

Oh child, the knots in your back 
'Cause you've been holdin' on 
I feel you when you're reachin' out 
I'll talk you through memories 
Just keep breathin' with me 
It's time to hold my hand 
And walk into the revolution 
And there's no one to touch 
And you've been thinkin' too much 
You only hurt yourself 
When it's all about retribution 
I see the pain in your face 
I'm payin' rent for this space 
It's time to lead you on 
Come on, it's a revolution 
When you can't keep on keepin' on 
And everything you lean upon it open, gone 
Everybody falls sometimes, but love shines on 
And on, and on, and 
With love in your eyes 
And a flame in your heart 
You're gonna find yourself some resolution 
A million miles with one step 
And you'll find yourself yet 
Walkin' with the revolution 
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on 
With the revolution (Talkin' 'bout a revolution) 
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on 
With the revolution (Walkin' with the revolution) 
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on 
With the revolution (Takin' you higher) 
Oh, a love lingers on 
You're just feelin' let down 
I know you're tired 
But when it's time to sleep, you're gone forever 
Make friends with your past 
Then you can leave it at last 
It's time to find yourself 
Walkin' with the revolution 
When you can't keep on keepin' on 
And everything you lean upon it open, gone (open, 
gone) 
Everybody hurts sometimes, but love shines on 
And on, and on, and 
Time and time's on your side 
There's no need to hide 
I feel your pain 
Don't talk to me about evolution 
A million miles with one step 
And you'll find yourself yet 
When you're walkin' with the revolution 
Walkin' with the revolution</field>

Beat me up on the beach 
What a lovely holiday 
There`s nothing funny left to say 
This sombre song would drain the sun 
But it won`t shine until it`s sung 
No water running in the stream 
The saddest place we`ve ever been 
Everything I touched was golden 
Everything I loved got broken 
On the Road to Mandalay 
Every mistake I`ve ever made 
Has been rehashed and then replayed 
As I got lost along the way 
There`s nothing left for you to give 
The truth is all that you`re left with 
Twenty places then at dawn 
We will die and be reborn 
I like to sleep beneath the trees 
Have the universe at one with me 
Look down the barrel of a gun 
And feel the Moon replace the Sun 
Everything we`ve ever stolen 
Has been lost returned or broken 
No more dragons left to slay 
Every mistake I`ve ever made 
Has been rehashed and then replayed 
As I got lost along the way 
Save me from drowning in the sea 
Beat me up on the beach

25 and I’ve come alive 
21 was the time to come undone 
Doesn’t everyone 
Very young and very ape 
I would drink and stay up very late 
And hate the sun 
And now my heart kicks up a fuss 
I’m a rolling stone 
They say I’m dangerous but I’m never alone 
I know that you’re like me 
You want your kids to free 
We’ll be a rolling stone 
Got an A in attitude 
Spent money on drugs to suite my mood 
Guess I’m just like you 
Being young is over rated 
One day I’ll be old and understated 
But before I’m through 
I run naked through the streets 
Be a rolling stone 
Define indid feet 
In joy being alone 
I know that you’re like me 
You want your kids to free 
Be a rolling stone 
Oh When we die we’ll find out other ways 
For getting drunk and throwing it all away 
Today is tomorrow 
I worry about yesterday 
Its all in your head 
So get out of your hair 
 
And now your heart kicks up a fuss 
Your a rolling stone 
They say I’m dangerous but your never alone 
I know that you’re like me 
You want your kids to free 
We’ll be a rolling stone 
You rolling stone

I'd sing forever if I could 
Maybe I should 
I'm that good 
You better believe it 
You've been affectionate 
You dirty bunch of sluts 
So disproportionate 
Loving you so much 
I'm hung like a dolphin 
Maybe I've said too much 
[Outro] 
Yeah, I'm semi-serious with you right now 
God bless you all, I love you so much 
I love you so much 
Auf Wiedersehen 
Bless you all, I love you so much 
I love you so much 
Auf Wiedersehen 
Bless you all, I love you so much 
I love you so much 
Auf Wiedersehen 
Bless you all, I love you so much 
I love you so much

Someone that you can lean on 
When times are tough 
Maybe there's a reason

You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive 
Sometimes I wonder cause 
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y 
[Verse 2] 
Maybe you came from outer space 
Maybe I can help you let go 
When you walk around the place 
All that I can hear is your echo 
If I heard what you've been saying 
Then you know it isn't right 
There's always something I'm not doing 
That won't keep you satisfied 
Let's get it on, and on, and on, and on

Why do you always doubt that there can be a better way? 
It doesn't make me wanna stay 
Why don't we break up? 
There's nothing left to say 
I've got my eyes shut 
Praying they won't stray 
And we're not sexed up 
That's what makes the difference today 
I hope you blow away 
You say we're fatally flawed 
Well I'm easily bored, is that ok? 
Strike me off your list 
Make this the last kiss, I'll walk away 
Why don't we talk about it? 
I'm only here don't shout it 
Given time we'll forget 
Let's pretend we never met 
Why don't we break up?

Screw you, I didn't like your taste 
Anyway, I chose you and that's all gone to waste 
It's Saturday, I'll go out 
And find another you 
Why don't we... 
Why don't we break up? 
There's nothing left to say

Mine, yours and then the truth 
And we can put it down to circumstance 
Our childhood, then our youth 
Out of some sentimental gain I wanted you to feel my pain 
But it came back return to sender 
I read your mind and tried to call 
My tears could fill the Albert Hall 
Is this the sound of sweet surrender? 
What a shame we never listened 
I told you through the television 
And all that went away was the price we paid 
People spend a lifetime this way 
Oh what a shame 
So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus 
And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us 
I wrote a letter in my mind 
But the words were so unkind 
About a man I can't remember 
I don't recall the reasons why 
I must have meant them at the time 
Is this the sound of sweet surrender? 
What a shame we never listened 
I told you through the television 
And all that went away was the price we paid 
People spend a lifetime this way 
And that's how they stay 
Oh what a shame 
Words come easy, when they're true 
Words come easy, when they're true 
So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus 
And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us 
Now we can put it down to circumstance 
Our childhood then our youth 
What a shame we never listened 
I told you through the television 
And all that went away was the price we paid

And that's how they stay 
Oh what a shame.

I've done the freezing 
I'm walking out 
Madonna's calling me 
She's got to be 
obscene to be believed 
That's her routine 
Not what she means to me 
I found myself 
by circumstance 
across a room 
where people dance 
And quite by chance 
she' danced right next me

I want to tell you a secret 
We're having drinks 
with Kate and Stella 
Gwyneth's here 
she's brought her fella

Where a little rock a little roll assimilate 
And I don't care what you think you know

I made it easy to be me so yeah, It's easy to be me

Hey, hey, hey 
There's no room in my bed 
But while you're here just bow your head 
Then you can shine my shoes 
Shine my shoes 
Get out of my lane boy, you're not in my league 
Some are born to thrive 
And some to under-achieve 
Here's something that'll make you sick 
I'm as happy as a pig in shh

I've been amazed, I've been betrayed

You only get the best with me 
I wanna give you everything 
And anything you ask of me I will

Now first of all baby, what's my name? 
Spell it backwards you read game 
I'm known for splittin' wigs and readin' brains 
And when I say splittin' wigs and readin' brains 
I mean breakin' it down conversation-wise 
Let me explain 
I'm in your corner, girl be on my team 
Together we could fulfill each other's life dream 
We both Gemini so we got 2 sides 
Our zodiac sign is the perfect sign 
Cuz she replied, "All Gemini's lie" 
I guess this is what it feels like when doves cry 
Your attitude is deep cover 
Won't give me the number 
Cold play me out like a foul, a bleep or a blunder 
It's like a burnin' in the chest, a cardiac arrest 
You look like you havin' fun puttin' me thru stress 
So in between time and in the meantime 
You do your thing and I do mine 
But don't play wit my mind 
Shorty, shorty 
Won't you please get naughty with me 
And if you really wanna 
I can be your fantasy 
You are so afraid, oh baby

Paranoia

I don't wake up early every morning 
'Cause the more I sleep the less I have to say 
Scared of you always thinking that I'm boring 
Stop me yawning my life away 
Tender young confusion 
Send black mariah for blue delusions 
Lays heavy oh so heavy 
On my mind 
I'm so sick of people's expectations 
Leaves me tired all the time 
If your home's full of useless aggravation 
Then don't bring it to mine 
I seem to spend my life 
Just waiting for the chorus 
'Cause the verse is never nearly 
Good enough 
The hooligan half of me 
That steals from Woolworths 
While the other lives for love 
I'm so sick of people's expectations 
Leaves me tired all the time

Time makes time 
A memory between us 
Am I still impossible to read? 
While the whole world was looking at you 
You came and wrapped yourself around me 
You feel the sun 
A work in progress 
I'm so far away from where I wanna be 
You stole my heart 
But my madness 
Is taking the man right out of me 
You said, we could have been good together 
I complicate so easily 
While the whole world was looking at you 
You wrapped yourself around me 
So wonderful 
Feeling so vulnerable 
You'll never know what you did to me 
Can't disguise 
I'm hiding behind my eyes 
You could've meant the whole world to me</field>

These are canapés and not hand grenades 
And that's the choice we made 
Go USA 
Or Taliban chic 
If you got massive hands 
Or tiny feet 
Life hands you lemons then sell lemonade 
It's the choice we made 
So 
I'm gonna sell a soda pop 
I wanna sell soda pop 
I'm gonna sell soda pop 
I wanna sell soda pop 
Soda! 
yoda! 
Bop shoo wop 
We like the birds 
We go likely lads 
I go on strike 
We're not scab scab scabs 
The love we lost when no one stayed 
It's the choice we made 
They wanna know 
About the clothes we wear 
If we swing both ways 
But who stays there 
As long as we get paid we don't care 
The choice is theirs 
So 
I'm gonna sell a soda pop 
I wanna sell soda pop 
I'm gonna sell soda pop 
I wanna sell soda pop 
Soda! 
yoda! 
Bop shoo wop 
Come enjoy the madness 
How you dance through the fire is all 
That matters now 
How can you resist us? 
We are the business 
So 
I'm gonna sell a soda pop 
I wanna sell soda pop 
I'm gonna sell soda pop 
I wanna sell soda pop 
Soda! 
yoda! 
Bop shoo wop 
Come enjoy the madness 
How you dance through the fire is all 
That matters now 
How can you resist us? 
We are the business 
So, so, so, so!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I know I'll stand in line, 
until you think you have the time 
to spend an evening with me 
And if we go some place to dance 
I know that there's a chance 
you won't be leaving with me 
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place 
and have a drink or two 
And then I go and spoil it all 
by saying something stupid 
like :"I love you" 
I can see it in your eyes 
you still dispise the same old lines 
you heard the night before 
And though it's just a line to you 
for me it's true 
it never seemed so right before 
I practice everyday 
to find some clever lines to say 
to make the meaning come true 
But then I think I'll wait 
until the evening gets late 
and I'm alone with you 
The time is right 
your perfume fills my head 
the stars get red 
and oh, the night's so blue 
And then I go and spoil it all 
by saying something stupid 
like: "I love you" 
The time is right 
Your perfume fills my head 
The stars get red 
and oh, the night's so blue 
And then I go and spoil it all 
by saying something stupid 
like: "I love you" 
"I love you" (3x)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You can't manufacture a miracle 
The silence was pitiful - that day 
And love is getting too cynical 
Passion's just physical - these days 
You analyse everyone you meet 
But get no sign - the loving kind 
Every night you admit defeat 
And cry yourself blind 
If you can't wake up in the morning 
'Cause your bed lies vacant at night 
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely 
Can't control it - try as you might 
May you find that love that won't leave you 
May you find it by the end of the day 
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely 
Something beautiful will come your way 
The DJ said on the radio 
Life should be stereo - each day 
And the past that cast the unsuitable 
Instead of some kind of beautiful 
You just couldn't wait 
All your friends think you're satisfied 
But they can't see your soul, no, no, no 
Forgot the time feeling petrified 
When they lived alone 
If you can't wake up in the morning 
'Cause your bed lies vacant at night 
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely 
Can't control it - try as you might 
May you find that love that won't leave you 
May you find it by the end of the day 
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely 
Something beautiful will come your way 
(It'll come your way) Some kind of beautiful 
(It'll come your way) Some kind of beautiful 
(It'll come your way) Some kind of beautiful 
(It'll come your way) 
All your friends think you're satisfied 
But they can't see your soul, no, no, no 
Forgot the time feeling petrified 
When they lived alone 
If you can't wake up in the morning 
'Cause your bed lies vacant at night 
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely 
Can't control it - try as you might 
May you find that love that won't leave you 
May you find it by the end of the day 
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely 
Something beautiful will come your way 
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely 
Something beautiful will come your way</field>

So get my peeps 
To call your peeps 
'Cause we've got nothing to say 
 
Don't feed the models 
Don't look at police 
Don't go to Crenshaw boule 
'Cause whitey can get fleeced

This isn't just a hurricane 
When you know what's coming, 
It's a soul transmission 
As we walk through history together 
Do you think we still come 
from this world we live on? 
It's a sole condition 
How does it feel 
What do you want me to say? 
Cos I said it feels like being 
Alone on Christmas day 
Pretty soon the world will start shaking 
Living in a tremolo 
And I don't get injured 
In my soul transmission 
How does it feel 
What do you want me to say? 
I said it feels like being 
Alone on Christmas day 
Sights and sounds 
At the end of the day 
Make me feel like being 
Alone on Christmas day 
Go keep it up, 
It's your soul transmission 
Go keep it up, 
It's your soul transmission 
Go keep it up, 
It's your soul transmission 
Go keep it up, 
It's your soul transmission 
Waiting in an empty cathedral 
To look at what I'm running from 
And I don't get nervous 
It's a soul transmission 
How does it feel 
What do you want me to say? 
I said I feel like being 
Alone on Christmas day 
Sights and sounds 
At the end of the day 
Make you feel like being

Name of Cocaine Katie 
She makes my temperature freeze 
She's got a blood red powder 
When she gives a shout 
She'll bring you to your knees 
Well we were being clever playing God games forever 
She said she only meant to please 
But I'm someone's brother, got a father and a mother 
You know I'm going to have to leave 
South of the border 
I think you oughta 
South of the border 
I think you oughta 
'cos you know you're gonna have to leave 
To a place where you can breathe 
And you know there's no reprieve 
There'll be tears on leaving 
But there won't be no grieving 
'cos a city soon forgets 
To me it's magic 
To the landlord it's tragic 
He's got another room to let 
There'll be the same old faces in the same old places 
Where my youth was well misspent 
But I tow the line and move the time 
To a town called "No Regrets" 
South of the border 
I think you oughta 
South of the border 
I think you oughta 
'cos you know you're gonna have to leave 
To a place where you can breathe 
And you know there's no reprieve

            <field name="lyrics">I'll tell you all a story 
'bout a man who isn't here 
Who had a pocket full of chemicals 
Some cigarettes and beer 
I went out to ibiza runnin' 
From the pourin' rain 
I drank a poco loco and I'd never be the same 
I met up with some boys 
They called themselves the diamond dogs 
They were either on the dancefloor 
Or dealing in the bogs 
And a reformed gangster got me 
And he said that he found god 
He looked me in the eyes 
And he started speaking tongues 
Speaking tongues, speaking tongues 
Everybody on the island speaking tongues 
Speaking tongues, speaking tongues 
Everybody on the island speaking tongues 
Everybody's sayin' take that, take that 
And I'm about to do exactly that-ah 
And I'm the cheeky fucker at the back-ah 
Before a disco biscuit disco-nap 
In balearic sunshine I went out for a swim 
But I heard they'd sent 
A posse to the rocks to do me in 
But I met some friends 
With faces who were pretty mighty men 
They told me if they come for you my brother 
We will go for them 
I whistled down a taxi 
Just to save us all some grief 
The taxi man had weed 
And pills he'd bought from the police 
He'd seen me on the tv 
Said he didn't like my songs 
It's the only sense he made 
Cause then he started speaking tongues 
Speaking tongues, speaking tongues 
Everybody on the island speaking tongues 
Speaking tongues, speaking tongues 
Everybody on the island speaking tongues 
Ahh, ahh 
Ahh, ahh 
Everybody's sayin' take that, take that 
And I'm about to do exactly that-ah 
And I'm the cheeky fucker at the back-ah 
Before a disco biscuit disco-nap 
I met a girl from preston 
Who wanted sex right there and then 
She lead me to a hotel 
But they wouldn't let me in 
I begged and I pleaded 
With the man who owned the place 
Eventually he'd had enough 
And punched me in the face 
I made a promise to that gangster 
That I would not commit 
To another night on the white 
I'd have to deal with it 
But I had a poco loco mescaline 
Comin' on strong 
I really couldn't help it man 
I started speaking tongues 
Speaking tongues, speaking tongues 
Everybody on the island speaking tongues 
Speaking tongues, speaking tongues 
Everybody on the island speaking tongues 
Speaking tongues, speaking tongues 
Everybody on the island speaking tongues 
Speaking tongues, speaking tongues 
Everybody on the island speaking tongues 
Everybody's sayin' take that, take that 
And I'm about to do exactly that-ah 
And I'm the cheeky fucker at the back-ah 
Before a disco biscuit disco-nap 
Everybody's sayin' take that take, that-ah 
And I'm about to do exactly that-ah

I was the boy with the flash clothes 
She was the girl with the acid stare 
I saw her at the place 
You knows she knows you know 
How she shakes 
When she jacks her body 
To the sounds of Oran Juice Jones 
and Jocelyn Brown 
Oh spread your wings 
Before they fall apart 
Home is where the hurt is darlin' 
Follow your heart 
So she walks into this dead end bar 
Sticks her handbag 
On the chair 
So she walks into this dead end bar 
Puts hers handbag on the chair 
And she waits 
For words we shared 
When we were 15 and still cared 
Cos she feels I'm a scar from the wound that time cant 
heal 
And I said 
Don't let your dreams out of your head 
Stick it to the man instead 
Don't fool your heart 
Lying about the fears that you had back then 
Did you try to change your life 
Did you ever try to change your life 
You repeat and repeat and repeat 
Now what's up with that 
Now she loves somebody else 
In flash clothes 
She was the girl with the acid stare 
And now she paid to have 
One of those 
And she weighs the word she says 
And she knows 
You exist 
Now she feels I'm the scar from the wound that time cant 
heal 
Oh spread your wings 
Before they fall apart 
Home is where the hurt is darlin 
Follow your heart 
Spread your wings 
Before they fall apart 
Home is where the hurt is darlin 
Follow your heart

Yeah I got out on parole, Wahey! 
Yeah erm erm you can just er pick up the phone 
'd like to talk to you please 
I've seen misery and have a strange empathy 
With a woman who kidnaps her lover 
This love ain't a dream I know it's obscene 
The calls that I left for your mother 
I've been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me 
I know you have doubts I hear when you shout

Of easy lays

And is this real coz I feel fake

This is how I feel in the summertime 
This is how I feel in the summer 
Got my glass of shandy 
And I feel fine 
This is how I play, yeah 
And if your love has met it's sad refrain 
Believe me you will love again 
All the best laid plans of my mice and men wrong 
It's written in this song, oh 
This is how we feel in the summertime 
This is how we feel in the summer 
What's mine is yours 
What's yours is mine 
This is how I play, yeah 
This is how we feel in the summertime 
This is how we feel in the summer 
Take it back to the summer of 89 
This is how I play, yeah, oh 
This is how we feel in the summer, oh 
Spoken: 
The Mondays, the Roses 
Blocking all your noses 
Wearing baggy clothes 
In our Buffalo poses 
Bank tellers, stroppy little fellas 
Loved up in the clubs 
Of football thugs 
No malice 
A dicky dread locks 
Boozin' off your socks 
Big fish little fish 
Card board box 
Gimme french kiss 
I'll love you from the rain 
I dream of Santa Ana on the road to Mandalay 
In the summertime 
Where the weather is hot 
In the summertime 
Where the weather is hot 
On my mind 
On my mind 
In the summertime 
Where the weather is hot 
In the summertime 
I got shivers 
Down my spine</field>

Co-caine 
Look at the mess we all made of ourselves 
I don't remember it well 
Everyone trying to be someone else 
I was someone else as well 
But it's all right 
When you're getting the show right 
Co-caine 
Co-caine 
Can you recall all the cubicle scenes? 
Didn't we talk well? 
Professional northerners we might of been 
We got a new walk as well 
But it's all right 
When you get your stroll right 
Co-caine 
Co-caine 
Stuck in a lift with a vacuum nosepipe 
Stuck where the god sights fronting star fight 
Super Tony 
Going too far Tony 
And yes it's all about me again boys 
This is the part where I do the northern way 
Super Tony 
Going too far Tony 
Co-caine 
Co-caine 
Isn't it nice that our fingers make V's? 
Let's throw 'em all night 
I got a nose bleed and nobody cares 
Up with the big heads 
But it's all right 
When you're so bright 
Stuck in a lift with a vacuum nosepipe 
Stuck where the god sights fronting star fight 
Super Tony 
Going too far Tony 
And yes it's all about me again boys 
This is the part where I do the northern way 
Super Tony 
Going too far Tony 
And that what holier-than-I 
But didn't I do well? 
Shovelling snow with the best of the worst 
People you know well 
But it's all right 
cos you're snow white 
Stuck in a lift with a vacuum nosepipe 
Stuck where the god sights fronting star fight 
Super Tony 
Going too far Tony 
And yes it's all about me again boys 
This is the part where I do the northern way

Sleep sleep feel the deep, 
Get away from the devil in all? 
Don't you want to see 
What you could have won 
Bittersweet, your defeat baby 
I'm much sicker than you 
All you are is colours 
And your colours run 
Isn't it genius that you give tonight 
You just keep on doing harm 
Could only see the sense in being superblind 
And just keep on keeping on 
I can't help thinking about me 
put a thought in for me 
I'm the genius behind me 
Maybe I shouldn't have said it 
Here's to the next century 
What will they think if they think about me 
Here it is, what a lie say a prayer, 
For the way it should be 
We are people they don't believe 
Wish your mother wouldn't bother 
Won't she just stay out of your mind? 
Or should they stay when you make them leave 
Isn't it genius that you give tonight? 
You just keep on doing harm 
Could only see the sense in being superblind 
And just keep on keeping on 
I can't help thinking about me 
put a thought in for me 
I'm the genius behind me 
Maybe I shouldn't have said it 
Here's to the next century 
What will they think if they think about me 
I can't help think about me 
Won't you put a prayer in for me 
You could talk and think about me 
It's like these props know when we're dancing 
We can pray our way out of here 
You're like a new wave old romantic 
Try to break our heart but got stuck on it 
Superblind 
When your superblind 
Keep you out of mind 
Because we all know 
Cos we didn't care</field>

And now she's screaming 
So I've got to turn the track up 
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up 
I know this girl she likes to switch teams 
And I'm a fiend but I'm living for a love supreme

Run by feet 
It's trying 
Take your soul 
Before you're leaving until 
Break you down 
If you 
Don't break through 
Take back control 
When you feel like hope is gone 
And there's no need to soldier on 
No surrender 
Don't you surrender, my love 
I bite the world, the world bite back 
This shout of love is not an act 
And I care less if you don't understand 
So when they'll send the symphony 
It will be written just for me 
The most joyest melody 
Seek control 
Avoid the pain 
Wake up 
And do it again 
This is your home 
This is your life 
Take back control 
When you feel like hope is gone 
And there's no need to soldier on

Now don't you surrender, my love 
Cos you're not here for very long 
So when you leave go with a song 
No surrender 
Let it be no surrender, my love 
Treat me like a king 
Kiss me like a stranger

Treat me like a king

Skinny white sailor, the chances were slender, 
The beauties were brief 
Shall I mourn your decline with some thunderbird wine 
And a black handkerchief? 
I miss your sad virginia whisper, 
I miss the voice that called my heart 
Sweet gene vincent 
Young and old and gone 
Sweet gene vincent 
Who, who, who slapped john? 
White face, black shirt 
White socks, black shoes 
Black hair, white strat 
Bled white, died black 
Sweet gene vincent 
Let the blue caps roll tonight 
At the sock hop ball in the union hall 
Where the bop is their delight 
Here come duck-tail danny dragging uncanny annie, 
She’s the one with the flying feet 
You can break the peace, daddy sickle grease 
But the beat is reet complete 
And the jump-back honey in the dungarees, 
Tight sweater and a pony-tail 
Will you guess her age when she comes back-stage, 
The hoodlums bite their nails 
Black gloves, white frost 
Black crípe, white lead 
White sheet, black knight 
Jet black, dead white 
Sweet gene vincent 
There’s one in every town 
And the devil drives till the hearse arrives 
And you lay the pistol down 
Sweet gene vincent 
With nowhere left to hide 
With lazy skin and ash-tray eyes 
And perforated pride 
Sail away, boys 
Take me home 
Country roads 
So farewell, mademoiselle knicker-bocker hotel 
Goodbye to money owed 
When your leg still hurts, but you need more shirts 
You got to get back on the road

I'll blow your sock off

Turn that smile upside down 
Happy people don't have sex 
Now Robbie, everybody swings both ways 
From the butchest, the bandits 
the fairest, the faggots and singers 
with everything they need 
Everybody swings both ways 
Face it Robbie, you're a little bit gay 
Shall we dance? 
I'm getting hot on the pavement 
Can you find me some grass? 
I have a certain arrangement 
Up the Khyber Pass 
Oh ya, let's get high with some fruit cake 
Fruit cake and tea 
And after I've done her 
Well you can do me 
Oh boy 
Don't hedge your bets, double down 
if you want to get ahead in Tinsel Town 
Just follow me you enormous clown 
Clever people don't have sex 
Now Rufus, everybody swings both ways 
The bully, the bigot

Hi out there 
This is Shaun Goldberg and you're listening to W.A.N.K. 
This evening I've got someone really interesting with me. 
He's over from old England and his name is.. 
Robbie Williams. 
[Rob:] 
Cor blimey bleedin' Mary Poppins! 
[Announcer:] 
Great, right on! You know we've been hearing about this boy band that was really big over there. 
Can you tell us a little bit about it Robbie? 
[Rob:] 
First of all, I'd like to say thank you very much for having me in the first place 
but to answer your question I can't really answer it. 
I suppose it was a bit like this.................. 
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
Riding in your limos 
Hanging with your bimbos 
Riding my old faithful 
Bigger pin-up than Betty Grable 
Kipper in the papers 
Coke and whisky chasers 
I ain't supposed to pose 
But I don't care 
I was a teenage millionaire 
A teenage millionaire 
A teenage millionaire 
Yeah, yeah 
Services for Britain 
Pouting like a kitten 
Dinner with Diana 
I'm a social Stokey spanner 
Waiting for my knighthood 
She can pin it on my manhood 
I ain't supposed to pose 
But I don't care 
I was a teenage millionaire 
A teenage millionaire 
A teenage millionaire 
Yeah, yeah 
A teenage millionaire 
(It works out sometimes it's funny 
Being stupid makes you lots of money) 
Bothered Judy Garland 
When I ordered Barbara Cartland 
Champagne in my bidet 
The press all had a field day 
You may think it's an outrage 
My cleaner¡äs wearing bondage 
She makes my place a mess 
But I don't care

I hear your name and I'm aflame 
Aflame with burning desire 
That only your kiss can put out the fire 
For ever, lover, I have waited for 
You're the mate that fate had me created for

You're riding high in April, 
Shot down in May 
But I know I'm gonna change that tune, 
When I'm back on top in June. 
That's life, and as funny as it may seem 
Some people get their kicks, 
Stompin' on a dream 
But I don't let it get me down, 
'Cause this fine ol' world keeps spinning around 
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, 
A poet, a pawn and a king. 
I've been up and down and over and out 
And I know one thing: 
Each time I find myself flat on my face, 
I pick myself up and get back in the race. 
That's life 
I can't deny it, 
I thought of quitting, 
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it. 
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try, 
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly 
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, 
A poet, a pawn and a king. 
I've been up and down and over and out 
And I know one thing: 
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face, 
I just pick myself up and get back in the race 
That's life 
That's life and I can't deny it 
Many times I thought of cutting out 
But my heart won't buy it 
But if there's nothing shakin' come this here july 
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I smoked Consulate and Park Drive 
Drank Newcy Brown, learned how to skive 
Polo mints to hide my breath from my Mum 
Did a little weed 'cause it felt like fun 
Did a little speed if my friends had some 
Nicked Volkswagon badges, I'm a Beastie Boys son 
Me so horny, me so young, and I still get my washing done 
Auntie Jo died of cancer, God didn't have an answer 
Rhythm was a dancer, any room for a chancer 
That's me in the corner, thanks Sir 
Wore a Troop track suit, British Knights shoes 
Kangol hat like L.L 
Cools 
Before I was having it, having it large 
They nicked the B.M.X 
from out my garage 
And I knew it was Tire from off the estate 
'Cause every time I saw him he smiled like we were mates 
From then on in, I'd have to walk to me Nan's and I'll dream my dreams for a sea of prams 
Like a hooligan on the football stands and I threw the V's to Leeds and West Ham 
And then I ran, I ran so far away 
Down Scotia Road to a taxi bay 
Then I ran again 'cause I couldn't pay 
Young Muslim didn't get his fare that day 
I apologise today 
Things look better when they start 
That's how the 80's broke my heart 
And who are you calling poof 
You like Wham, man 
I hate that stuff 
And then my Granddad died and left a hole in the family 
And lots of women there to nanny me 
School was a laugh, they didn't have A.D.D 
Thick was the term they used for me 
Over and over, repeatedly, over and over 
Take my breathe away, pass the bidley bidley bidley bidley bong 
Pass it on the left hand side 
Right turn, Clyde 
That girl in the fourth year got pregnant 
She was raised Catholic, brilliant 
I cried, she cried, we cried 
Her youth died 
Drank cider in the cemetery 
The year above us had discovered 'E' 
And I said it weren't for me 
Twelve pounds fifty 
I could rob my mum's purse and buy one off Chalky 
Met a girl on Monday, drank fizzy pop on Tuesday 
Fingered her on Wednesday, and on Thursday and Friday, and on Saturday 
Dumped by Sunday 
Things look better when they start 
That's how the 80's broke my heart 
The wonder years I've played my part 
That's how the 80's broke my heart 
I lost my virginity to a girl called Anne-Marie 
Well, she said she fancied me 
And then she said "Fuck me" and I thought fuck me 
And I'm all talk and it'll be over too quickly 
And it was but I couldn't care less 
I'd seen a girl's part, made a mess on her dress 
Oh yes, you're now rocking with the best 
Second person in my year that had seen a breast 
I'm in my 30s now and I'm still impressed 
Why the Falklands Mum, and what have they done 
Where do girls come, where do girls come from, where do girls come from 
It's the 80's what you looking at, you mong 
So young, so long, so young, so long 
Too short, so long 
What you looking at, you mong

            <field name="lyrics">The 90s 
Picking up the story 
from where I left off 
It's 1990 now 
So school can fu.ck off 
I got no GCSEs, 
nothing higher than a 'D' 
I couldn't tell me Mum 
because she'd batter me 
Me and Tate sat on the bowling green 
Life was a sh.itter 
We had five quid between us 
And bought us six cans of bitter 
I took me ten Benson home 
And I smoked through the sorrow 
If I could just avoid me Mum 
Maybe I'd tell her tomorrow 
I stumbled through the door 
I said Mum it's like this 
She said "That man's been on the phone 
And you've made the list 
You're in that boy band son 
Come and giz' us a kiss" 
Phoned up Martin and Rich 
And carried on getting pissed 
Boys I don't believe it 
I'm gonna be famous 
Pick you up in a Porsche 
and buy you lots of trainers 
I met the other guys 
one seemed like a cock 
I think it's going to be like New Kids On The Block 
I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy 
(I only wanted to get down) 
I hate those that hate me 
I can't forgive and it's crazy 
Baby 
Now I'm a video star 
(I'm making trouble in this town) 
Do you know who you are? 
(For the five of us) 
Baby 
I adopted four brothers, 
Some I liked more than others 
One was like a brother from another mother 
But the lead singer made it hard to like him 
And I still loved him 
despite him 
The first three months 
you know I nearly quit 
I played snooker with my Dad 
he said "Don't be a dick 
Unload the bullets 
you're mind is a gun 
You're gonna shoot yourself when they're number one" 
I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy 
(I only wanted to get down) 
I hate those that hate me 
I can't forgive and it's crazy 
Baby 
Now I'm a video star 
(I'm making trouble in this town) 
Do you know who you are 
(For the five of us) 
Baby 
Now it's dinner with Versace 
And lunch with Princess Diana 
And I'm gonna get belted if I go out of my manor 
Cause as much as we were loved 
We were also hated 
The boys got jealous 
Cause the girls got plated 
And now we're famous and that 
and we're dancing and that 
And I'm thinking I can sing 
why am I stood at the back 
So fu.ck the band 
give me Sambuka and gak 
Now we're all a bag of nerves 
Were not a band of brothers 
 
I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy 
(I only wanted to get down) 
I hate those that hate me 
I can't forgive and it's crazy 
Baby 
Now I'm a video star 
(I'm making trouble in this town) 
Do you know who you are? 
(For the five of us) 
Baby 
And now it's breaking my heart 
because the dream's turned to sh.it 
It ain't broke but I'll break it in a little bit 
And I'm always in trouble 
but I've stopped saying sorry 
Everybody's worried 
What the fu.ck's wrong with Robbie 
He's not answering his phone 
He's not talking to me 
I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury 
And now I'm running away 
from everything that I've been 
And I'm pissed and I'm fu.cked 
and I'm only nineteen 
I can't conform no more 
I can't perform no more 
 
But the boys know I'm fu.cked 
and so they show me the door 
And if the truth be told 
I wasn't fit enough to stay 
So I put my head down 
and walked away 
That was the 90's 
90 to 95 
I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy 
(I only wanted to get down) 
I hate those that hate me 
I can't forgive and it's crazy 
Baby 
Now I'm a video star 
(I'm making trouble in this town) 
Do you know who you are 
(For the five of us)

Act One is about to begin in 8 seconds. 
[VERSE ONE:] 
First you can't act, now you can't stop, 
(What's my motivation?) 
I used to like you.. 
a lot, 
(I was the class nerd) 
Exactly who I'm s'posed to be, 
(I'm totally Strasberg) 
You play a doctor on TV, 
(What you're doing is SO brave) 
[VERSE TWO:] 
Deep down you're dirty but you try, 
(I'm a good person) 
The truth would break you so you lie, 
(I want my work to matter) 
It's in the choices that you make, 
(I want to inspire) 
No talent, just fate. 
[CHORUS:] 
I don't know where you begin, 
I end, we start 
Again, 
They need, you love, 
We all watch 
The Actor Acting. 
[VERSE THREE:] 
Good from far but far from good, 
(All I have is my instinct) 
You love to act, I wish you would, 
(It's not acting, it's re-acting) 
Act like you're not from out of space, 
(When I'm on stage I feel alive) 
You know ambition isn't grace, 
(For me it's the craft) 
[VERSE FOUR:] 
Made of Sex, Maida Vale, 
(Would I do better in New York) 
You are the Alpha Male, 
(I'm just too pretty for that role) 
You are the good, you are the great, 
(The words have power) 
Now let me fill you with my hate.

Past the days of yes, yes, Charlene 
Coke in the bogs till seven in the morning 
Look the wrong way and we end up brawling 
When I had a bit of beef with you know who 
And I fucked a few female stars or two 
Nearly everything I said I'd end getting screwed 
Spitting at the paps, looking rude in the news 
Oh yes, you're still rocking with the best 
Second person in my year to have touched a breast 
I'm nearly forty now and I'm still impressed 
Here's the midlife crisis I guess 
Oh, I recall taking in the wonder of it all 
I'm still looking for an answer through the looking grass 
Still not concentrating at the back of the class 
No thanks, Sir, this one's for you 
It's like a Vd clinic: only pricks are in it 
So fucking dull and professional and timid 
To be frank, Sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer 
I still want to get laid by you, right 
Now I know I've got fat, but make no mistake 
Every million that I make they bake me a cake 
So I've got plenty, a hundred and twenty 
Wear clothes of tweed like Amanda Gentry 
I still want to get you naked 
I'll see you in the summer, so glad you could make it 
I'll be that mega white thing, fast as lightning 
A Knebworth shape but twice as frightening 
If they can't be bothered then I promise you this 
If they won't entertain you then I'll do my fucking best 
Still looking for an answer through the looking grass 
Still not concentrating at the back of the class 
No thanks, Sir, this one's for you 
It's like a Vd clinic: only pricks are in it 
So fucking corporate and professional and timid 
To be frank, Sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer 
I still want to get laid by you 
Would you let me lay you down right here? 
Would you let me live? 
Still looking for an answer through the looking grass 
Still not concentrating at the back of the class 
No thanks, Sir, this one's for you 
It's like a Vd clinic: only pricks are in it 
So fucking dull and professional and timid 
To be frank, Sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer

Still not concentrating at the back of the class

You started making me love 
Don't stop making it up 
Let's make it over and over and over 
Baby your cure could change the world 
Cause your cure sure changed me 
Little by little 
You started making me love 
You started making me love 
I was reckless 
You joined in too 
I liked that about you 
You saw it all that first night 
The best and worst of me 
But it didn't make you leave 
I was never going to fall in love

A promise that I couldn't keep

I used to pile up promises then leave town 
You should've heard my best excuses 
so profound and so untrue 
But now I wake up next to you 
Each time I slip feels like the world conspires 
To underline my most impure desires 
Thought all of those who swear by love 
they were mental through and through 
But now I wake up next to you 
And the nights are sill as long as they ever were 
All the things that could go wrong, well they still occur 
But when the violent sun breaks the morning air 
it will find me there 
Next to you 
I had to lose myself for years to find this 
Mistook the cruelty and abuse for kindness 
Didn't know yet what to keep zipped shut 
my own blindness stole the view 
But now I wake up next to you 
And the nights are still as long as they ever were 
And all things that could go wrong, well they still occur 
But when the violent sun breaks the morning air 
it will find me there

When did it all go right? 
When did it all go right? 
Where did it all go right?

I used to pile up promises then leave town 
You should have heard my best excuses 
so profound and so untrue 
But now I wake up next to you 
When did it all go right? 
I'll always walk back from the edge 
And find a way to you 
Where did it all go right? 
I'll always walk back from the edge 
Find a way to get to you 
When did it all go right? 
I'll always walk back from the edge 
And find a way to you 
Where did it all go right?

Why not leave your job and come on tour with us? 
Before I drop dead and die

Got a house in LA, I'm still paying for it…

No water running in the stream, the saddest place we've ever seen 
Everything i touched was golden, 
Everything i loved got broken

Has been rehashed and then replayed

There's nothing left for you to give,

Twenty paces then at dawn, we will die and be reborn 
I like to sleep beneath the trees, 
Have the universe at one with me 
Look down the barrel of a gun and feel the moon replace the sun 
Everything we've ever stolen 
Has been lost, returned or broken, 
No more dragons left to slay

I swim through cracks 
And leave with words 
I can't take back 
You see the trouble with me 
Monkey see monkey do 
There's no u in tomorrow 
A better offer came through 
You see the trouble with you 
There's no trouble with you 
So when you say that you love me 
That stops me loving you 
So she stays 
On sunset strip 
Our hearts so full 
I drown in it 
She's waiting for 
My words to break 
The one true love 
I couldn't make 
So she walks 
That golden mile 
Men will try 
And catch her eye 
We both know 
What could have been

And terribly cross in Kent 
They're down in Hull 
And the isle of Mall 
Is seething with discontent 
They're nervous in northumberland 
And Devon is down the drain 
They're filled with wrath on Firth of Forth 
And sullen on Salisbury plain 
In Dublin they're depressed lads 
Maybe because they're Celts 
For drake is hurrying West, lads 
And so is everyone else 
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! 
Misery is here to stay 
There are bad times just around the corner 
There are dark clouds hurtling through the sky 
And it's no good whining 
About a silver lining 
For we know from experience they won't roll by 
With a scowl and a frown we'll keep our peckers down 
And prepare for depression and doom and dread 
We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag 
And wait until we drop down dead 
They're nervous in Nigeria 
They're all going crazy in Crete 
In Bucharest they're so depressed 
They're frightend to cross the streets 
In maine the melancholia 
Is deeper than tongue can tell 
In Monako all the croupiers know 
They haven't a hope in hell 
In far away Australia 
Each wallaby is well aware 
The world's a total failure 
Without any time to spare 
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! 
Suffering and dismay 
There are bad times just around the corner 
The horizon is gloomy as can be 
There are black birds over 
The greyish cliffs of Dover 
And the rats are preparing to leave the BBC 
We're unhappy breed and very bored indeed 
When reminded of something that Nelson said 
While the press and the politicians nag, nag, nag 
We'll wait until we drop down dead 
There are bad times just around the corner 
And the outlook's absolutely vile 
There are home fires smoking from Windermere to Woking 
And we're not going to tighten our belt and Smile Smile Smile 
At the sound of shots 
We'd just as soon as not 
Get a hot water bottle and go to bed 
We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag 
And wait until we drop down dead 
I like your story Land of Hope and Glory 
Wait until we drop down dead</field>

There she goes, there she goes again 
She calls my name, pulls my train 
No-one else can heal my pain 
And I just can't contain 
This feeling that remains 
There she goes 
There she goes again 
Chasing down my lane 
And I just can't contain 
This feeling that remains.</field>

With her hands in her head 
And she screamsHe gets a kick out of being the plot soIt seemsHe makes you all laugh so she's the one 
Doing harm 
But how can you fight when she's not The one under his arm 
These dreams have let you downTake it don't break it just turn it aroundThese dreams won't let you down 
You never stopped loving his misfortunateLazy waysAll the memories that you should've had 
Are a cabaret hazeThere's just a hole where you know he 
Should've beenThere's no one worse off than youWhen you can't describe what you've seen 
These dreams have let you downTake it don't break it just turn it aroundThese dreams won't let you down 
Where do you go when you're all aloneIn your bedDo you cry in your sleep 'cos it's better unsaidHave you forgotten your past becauseThat's how it seemsIs it too hard to think so you editYour dreamsAnd play them back again and again 
These dreams have let you downTake it don't break it just turn it aroundThese dreams won't let you down 
These dreams have let you downTake it don't break it just turn it aroundThese dreams won't let you downYou've got tomorrow tomorrowYou've got tomorrow tomorrowYou've got tomorrow tomorrowYou've got tomorrow tomorrowYou've got tomorrow tomorrow.</field>

Starin' at the lonely avenue (avenue)

Things like a lover's vow 
Things that we don't do now

Memories are all I have to cling to (cling to) 
And heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to (betcha got me now)

Still can hear the jukebox softly playin' (playin') 
And the face each day I see belongs to you (belongs to you) 
Though there's not a single sound and there's nobody else around 
It's just me thinkin' of the things we used to do

What's behind your eyes makes you a star 
I want to take my time on earth 
And give it meaning 
They say you get what you deserve 
I know the feeling 
Those dumb looks only get you so far 
What's behind your eyes makes you a star 
[Chorus] 
I'm gonna walk onto that stage like it's my destiny 
Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies 
If tomorrow I should die, these are my memories 
I'm gonna take this simple life and make history 
I dream a fantasy and then achieve it 
Repeat the greatest lie till they believe it 
You and me, not gods, define us now 
You come in screaming, leave in silence 
[Chorus] 
Oh, I'm gonna walk onto that stage like it's my destiny 
Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies 
If tomorrow I should die, these are my memories 
I'm gonna take this simple life and make history 
[Bridge] 
Let's fly higher than the mocking birds 
They won't touch us way up here 
In the sole asylum of the universe 
A man can disappear 
Raise a glass to the disfunctional 
It's never ever too late 
I fell like miracles are happening 
If I could just get out the way 
I want to take my time on earth 
And give it meaning 
They say you get what you deserve 
I know the feeling, feeling, feeling 
[Chorus 2] 
You've gotta walk onto that stage like it's your destiny 
Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies 
If tomorrow you should die, these are your memories 
You've gotta take this simple life and make history</field>

Then laugh at you and hate you 
Then they fight you - then you win 
When the truth dies 
Very bad things happen 
They’re being heartless again 
I know it’s coming 
There’s going to be violence 
I’ve taken as much 
As I’m willing to take 
Why do you think 
We should suffer in silence 
When a heart is broken 
There’s nothing to break 
(Chorus Backing Vocal: 
Want you to love me 
Want you to be 
The heavens above me 
Eternally) 
You’ve been mixing 
With some very heavy faces 
The boys have done a bit of bird 
They don’t kill their own 
And they all love their mothers 
But you’re out of your depth son 
Have a word 
I know it’s coming 
There’s going to be violence 
I’ve taken as much 
As I’m willing to take 
Why do you think 
We should suffer in silence 
The heart is broken 
There’s nothing to break 
All is wonderful in past lives 
Dreaming of the sun she warms 
You should see me in the afterlife 
Picking up the sons of dust 
When you think we're lost 
We're exploring 
What you think is worthless 
I'm adoring 
You don’t want the truth 
Truth is boring 
I got this fever need to 
Leave the house leave the car 
Leave the bad men where they are 
Leave a few shells in my gun 
Stop me staring at the sun 
I know it’s coming 
There’s going to be violence 
I’ve taken as much 
As I’m willing to take 
Why do you say 
We should suffer in silence 
My heart is broken

I was always stoned 
You knew I was a piss-head 
That’s why I never phoned 
So why’d you act surprised 
I was drunk on the day we met 
When I see you with your new man 
Something stirs inside of me 
It’s not that I want you back 
It’s how ugly love can be 
Be still my foolish pride 
I couldn’t love you anyway 
Like a baseball cap worn backwards 
Like calling cocaine gear 
Like a pair of Evisu jeans 
We were so last year 
And we got high all the time 
Night after night 
Line after line 
How did I make ‘I love you’ sound sincere 
When you were just a one-night-stand 
That lasted a year 
We were always fighting 
You thought the drama did us good 
Well I found it really boring 
Get off the cross we need the wood 
Say hi to your mum and dad 
It’s all their fault anyway 
Like Patrick Cox and girl power 
Jean Claude van Damme and Cheers 
Vanilla Ice and Take That 
We were so last year 
Getting high all the time 
Night after night 
Line after line 
How did I make ‘I love you’ sound sincere 
When you were just a one-night-stand 
That lasted a year 
Like a baseball cap worn backwards 
Like calling cocaine gear 
Like a pair of Evisu jeans 
We were so last year 
Getting high all the time 
Night after night 
Line after line 
How did I make ‘I love you’ sound sincere 
When you were just a one-night-stand 
That lasted a year 
All in the name of entertainment 
We could come to some arrangement 
Just a one-night-stand 
That lasted a year</field>

A falcon flies in two straight lines 
Red five standing by

But everybody should 
Them and us

Till they decide which God is best 
Free yourself from liberation 
From Lake Geneva to the freeland station

Suburbia's a slipstream to a memory 
of a time when you were close to me 
I pretend 
I'm there again 
I close my eyes and see you 
better than before 
then I feel you touch me 
and it's 1984 
I know what you will say 
before you start 
in my heart 
We're the Pet Shop Boys 
We're the Pet Shop Boys 
Every thought's a fashion or a crime 
and every boy is just a waste of time 
but I pretend 
it was different then 
Maybe it's a habit 
Maybe it's a sin 
But I find out 
when I try it on 
it crawls beneath my skin 
Once it gets inside me 
it won't go 
Now I know 
We're the Pet Shop Boys 
We're the Pet Shop Boys 
Rent 
Shopping 
Being boring 
It's alright 
It's a sin 
I'm not scared 
In denial 
I want a dog 
I want a lover 
Can you forgive her? 
Do I have to? 
What have I? What have I? 
What have I done to deserve this?</field>

I went to the world 
My weakness got stronger every day 
Though my chequered history's appalling 
In the line of beauty I lay fallen 
I found a girl 
She's my weakness, gets stronger every day 
Every day 
I can't promise I will love you 
For the rest of your life 
But you know I'm gonna be there 
For the rest of mine 
We pour our hearts into a box 
Seal that box with chains and locks 
And then we hide it 
Don't dare look inside it 
In case the feeling shows 
You could spend all your life 
With that damn box 
Trying to keep it closed 
Went around the world in 80 lovers 
Don't think really anyone recovered 
Go see the world 
Let your weakness get stronger every day 
Every day 
I took photographs of mars 
Left my footprints on the moon 
I wanted the universe 
Then they sent you 
We pour our hearts into a box 
Seal that box with chains and locks

Got run down by an avalanche 
R: No! 
J: Oh, don’t worry, she’s a game girl you know 
Got up and finished 4th 
R: The kid’s got guts 
J: Havin’ a nice time? 
Grab a line 
R: Have you heard that Mimsy Star 
J: Oh, what now? 
R: She got pinched in the ass to bar 
J: Slushed again, ey? 
R: She was stoned 
J: Well did you evah 
R: Nevah 
R + J: What a swell party this is 
J: Hey check out that ass! 
R: Aah, that’s a lovely dress, 
Do you think I could talk her out of it? 
It’s great 
J: Ah, it’s great 
R: So grand 
J: So grand 
R + J: This wo-…-nderland

R: Old camembert 
R + J: Like ba, ba rum 
J: Ba ba ba bum 
R: Don’t dig that kind of crooning, chum 
R + J: Have you heard, it’s in the stars 
Next July we collide with Mars 
Well did you evah 
What a swell party 
A swell party 
A swellegant, elegant party this is 
J: I drink to your health 
R: Naah, let’s drink to your wealth 
J: You’re my bon ami 
R: Hey, that’s French 
J: Liberty

Didn't care who's coming next 
Nights spent rolling out for danger 
Days spent waking up with strangers 
Leave 
You're not as strange as me 
Drinking, drugging, rock and roll 
Appliances you put in holes 
Supermodels, movie stars 
Waitresses and girls from Mars 
Weren't you 
They just weren't you 
[Chorus 1] 
She said I love you so 
Maybe it's easy, it's easy 
How could I ever know 
Things ain't been that easy, not easy for me 
But when you know, you know 
This one I'll never let, never let go 
Hard to know which lies to keep 
Talking in someone else's sleep 
You wear a mask for long enough 
You just forget to take it off 
Not you 
You could see right through 
[Chorus 2] 
Around you I'm just myself 
And maybe it's easy, it's easy 
When I found you, I found myself 
You made it so easy, so easy for me 
But when you know, you know 
This one I'll never let, never let go 
[Bridge] 
I built a kingdom up on the hill 
If you hadn't found me, I'd be there still 
Up on that hill 
Your tank rolled right through 
Love's a revolution, revolution for two 
[Chorus 3] 
She said I love you so 
Maybe it's easy, it's easy 
How could I ever know 
She hates the same people as, people as me 
But when you know, you know 
This one I'll never let, never let go</field>

I like to get my feet with their teeth 
I think its time I found myself a supermodel 
I haven't had one of those yet 
You said you dealt well when your parents separated 
Lots of drugs, lots of blows, lots of bags, hurry up already 
Oh daddy do look what you did to your daughter 
Shes got an eating disorder

I like to get my feet with their teeth

She touched my face and called me her loverI never thought that I'd need another

She wouldn't notice anything else but me

Dancing at discos, and moaning at phone bills 
Torremolinos and sun burnt in high heelsSwap it and sell it and drop it and smell itAll those years ago

All is given up.

What are you thinking? 
At the worst of my mind 
With this thunderbird wine 
Baby, I'm drinking 
What a waste of all this peace , 
Baby steps and two more sleeps 
Till I get to say sorry 
I get hysterical, historical; 
of love is just chemical 
Give us something to stop me 
Only you know me 
Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday 
You don't know cos you're not there 
You simply found the words to make a lot of feelings fade away -or(our model feelings)

When you were collecting 
For you sex appeal 
He was in killing fields 
Over you 
You went 
And took away his self respect 
Put him out like a cigarette 
You blow 
Chorus: 
Don’t bother coming home 
You said all you’ve got to say 
He can get with the girls again 
Cos he’s a charming man 
It’s true 
He can drink with the boys tonight 
And have a fight, alright 
And spew 
You’re history 
You’re history 
Got your tits done 
And moved out the very next day 
All you left was the bill to pay 
What a front 
Could she not see what you’re a righteous man? 
A gun in hand 
Cupid stunned 
He used to want your love 
Now he wants you to go away 
He can drink till he’s comatosed 
Yeah he rocks the most 
Can't you see 
He’s got diamonds in his eyes tonight 
Could give you quite a fright 
No sympathy 
You’re history 
You’re history 
Don’t bother coming home 
You said all you’ve got to say 
He can get with the girls again 
Cos he’s a charming man 
It’s true 
He can drink with the boys all night 
And have a fight, alright 
And spew 
He will drink till he’s comatosed 
Yeah, He rocks the most 
Can’t you see? 
He’s got diamonds in his eyes tonight 
Could give you quite a fright 
Yes siree 
You’re history

The citadel lay breached and undefended 
You brought a love I'd never known before

Hung up on romancing 
 
We bought a lot of things 
To keep you warm and dry 
A funny old crib 
On which the paint won't dry 
 
I bought you 
A pair of shoes 
A trumpet you can blow 
And a book of rules 
 
Of what to say to people 
When they pick on you 
'cause if you stay with us 
You're gonna be pretty kooky too

Go to school 
Remember how they messed up 
This old fool 
 
Don't pick fights 
With the bullies or the cads 
I'm not much cop at fighting 
Other people's dads 
 
And if the homework 
Brings you down 
Then we'll throw it on the fire 
And take the car down town 
 
Won't you stay

Well, we were being clever, playing God games forever 
She said she only meant to please 
But I'm someone's brother, got a father and a mother 
You know I'm going to have to leave

I think you oughta 
South of the border 
I think you oughta 
 
'Cause you know you're gonna have to leave 
To a place where you can breathe 
And you know there's no reprieve 
 
There'll be tears on leaving 
But there won't be no grieving 
'Cause a city soon forgets 
To me it's magic  
To the landlord it's tragic 
He's got another room let 
 
There'll be the same old faces in the same old places 
Where my youth was well misspent 
But I tow the line and move the time 
To a town called 'No Regrets' 
 
South of the border 
I think you oughta 
South of the border 
I think you oughta

Phoenix from the Flames 
We will rise together 
They will know our names 
Can you feel it 
Shelter me from pain 
I always wanna feel this way 
 
Everybody's talking 
Nobody's listening 
Too busy thinking about what you've 
Been missing 
Everybody said you're gonna take it 
Too far baby now 
Well come on 
 
When you're done with lovin' 
It comes down to nothing 
Can you feel it 
Can you feel it 
Can you feel it 
 
Phoenix from the Flames 
We will rise together 
They will know our names 
Can you feel it 
Shelter me from pain 
I always wanna feel this way 
Oh yeah 
Just like a Phoenix from the Flame 
 
Phoenix from the Flames 
We will rise together 
They will know our names 
Can you feel it 
Shelter me from pain 
I always wanna feel this way 
Oh yeah 
Just like a Phoenix from the Flame 
 
Why don't you come and deny it 
You know you can't deny it 
I always wanna feel this way 
Just like a Phoenix from the Flames

I know you have doubts I hear when you shout 
'cause I understand you see 
 
I was concerned when you're sad 
You'd rather wake up dead to spend a day with me 
I know that's not you I know and it's true 
They don't understand you like I do 
 
I've been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me 
I know you have doubts I hear when you shout 
'cause I understand you see 
 
Hi! It's me again  
Yeah I got out on parole 
Yeah erm erm you can just er pick up the phone  
'd like to talk to you please 
 
I've seen misery and have a strange empathy 
With a woman who kidnaps her lover 
This love ain't a dream I know it's obscene 
The calls that I left for your mother 
 
I've been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me  
I know you have doubts I hear when you shout  
'cause I understand you see 
 
I love you too And erm perhaps one day we can meet 
Face to face this time 
Ha! I'm sorry about that letter I sent you 
The newspaper cuttings and stuffs and blood ha</field>

With her hands in her head 
And she screams 
He gets a kick out of losing the plot so it seems 
He makes you all laugh so she's the one 
Doing harm 
But how can you fight when she's not 
The one under his arm 
 
These dreams have let you down 
Take it don't break it just turn it around 
These dreams won't let you down 
 
You never stopped loving his misfortunate 
Lazy ways 
All the memories that you should've had 
Are a cabaret haze 
There's just a hole where you know he 
Should've been 
There's no one worse off than you 
When you can't describe what you've seen 
 
These dreams have let you down 
Take it don't break it just it turn around 
These dreams won't let you down 
 
Where do you go when you're all alone 
In your bed 
Do you cry in your sleep cos it's 
Better unsaid 
Have you forgotten your past because 
That's how it seems 
Is it too hard to think so you edit 
Your dreams 
And play them back again and again 
 
These dreams have let you down 
Take it don't break it just turn it around 
These dreams won't let you down 
 
These dreams have let you down 
Take it don't break it just turn it around 
These dreams won't let you down 
 
You've got tomorrow tomorrow 
You've got tomorrow tomorrow 
You've got tomorrow tomorrow 
You've got tomorrow tomorrow 
You've got tomorrow tomorrow

Ask me when, (ta ra ra ra) 
I say it started when I met you (ta ra ra ra ra ra) 
And ever since then I knew that the past couldn't last 
For right now, I think I'm running 
A race that I know I'm gonna win 
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing 
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing 
 
If people say I'm crazy, I tell 'em that it's true 
Let them watch with amazement 
Say it won't last beyond breakfast 
It's a phase he's going through 
Denigrate or speculate on what I'm going through 
Because it isn't the sort of thing I would normally do 
 
Ask me what, (ta ra ra ra) 
I say I think it's good for you (ta ra ra ra ra) 
Believe it or not, I know where it's all leading to 
I feel like taking all my clothes off 
Dancing to the Rite of Spring 
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing 
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing 
I wouldn't normally do this kind of -

And the night is fun 
I think it's time for me to not be home alone 
I think I'll put the cat out and give the dog a bone 
I hardly know you, but I like your figure 
Suppose I'll read about you in The Mirror 
I think there's something everybody should know

With what you said 
No it's not in my head

Day after day 
 
Why don't we talk about it 
Why do you always doubt that there can be a better way 
It doesn't make me want to stay 
 
Why don't we break up 
There's nothing left to say 
I got my eye shut praying they won't stray 
Oh! When I sexed up 
That's what makes the difference today 
I hope you blow away 
 
You said we're fatally flawed 
When I'm easily bored, Is that okay? 
Write me off your list 
Make this the last kiss 
I'll walk away 
 
Why don't we talk about it 
I'm only here 
Don't shout it 
Given time we'll forget 
Let's pretend we never met 
 
Why don't we break up

Oh! When I sexed up

Screw you I didn't like your taste 
Anyway, I chose you 
And that's all gone to wasted 
Saturday I'll go out and find another you 
 
Why don't we, Why don't we break up 
There's nothing left to say

When I'm not much use 
But it's killing me, killing me slowly 
 
They all say 
I'm too restless 
But words cut deep 
When you're defenceless 
And they're killing me, but killing me slowly 
 
There was a time when we were fine 
And I could tolerate you 
I do believe that you should leave 
'Cause I've grown to hate you 
Should I be weak and turn my cheek 
'Cause I'm scared to fall 
But I just don't know you 
And you don't know me at all 
 
I've been told that love's a celebration 
But I've lost faith through frustration 
And it's killing me, but killing me slowly 
 
You paint my picture black 
The joke's on me 
And I don't wanna laugh 
Remember the good times 
Won't you bring them back someday, somehow 
 
I don't mind feeling blue 
If I could smile just like you do 
And it's killing me, killing me slowly 
 
I can't go on alone 
Pretending nothing's wrong 
Maybe I just want to belong 
Somewhere, somehow, somehow

millennium 
 
some say that we are players 
some say that we are pawns 
but we've been making money since the day that we were born 
then slow down before we fall down 
 
we've got stars directing our fate 
and we're praying its not too late 
cause we know we're falling from grace 
millennium 
 
live for liposuction 
and detox for your rent 
overdose at Christmas 
and give it up for lent 
my friends are all so cynical 
refuse to keep the faith 
we all enjoy the madness cause we know we're gonna to fade away 
 
we've got stars directing our fate 
and we're praying it's not too late 
cause we know we're falling from grace 
millennium 
 
come and have a go if you think you are hard enough [Repeat: x2] 
 
millennium [Repeat: x2] 
 
we've got stars directing our fate 
and we're praying it's not too late 
cause we know we're falling from grace 
millennium 
 
and when we come we always come to late 
i often think that we were born to hate 
get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes (X2) 
 
we've got stars directing our fate 
(millennium)and we're praying its not too late

            <field name="lyrics">Tell me a story 
Where we all change 
And we'd live our lives together 
And not estranged 
 
I didn't lose my mind it was 
Mine to give away 
Couldn't stay to watch me cry 
You didn't have the time 
So I softly slip away 
 
No regrets they don't work 
No regrets they only hurt 
Sing me a love song 
Drop me a line 
Suppose it's just a point of view 
But they tell me I'm doing fine 
 
I know from the outside 
We looked good for each other 
Felt things were going wrong 
When you didn't like my mother 
 
I don't want to hate but that's 
All you've left me with 
A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy of 
How we all could live 
 
No regrets they don't work 
No regrets they only hurt 
(We've been told you stay up late) 
I know they're still talking 
(You're far too short to carry weight) 
The demons in your head 
(Return the videos they're late) 
If I could just stop hating you 
(Goodbye) 
I'd feel sorry for us instead 
 
Remember the photographs (insane) 
The ones where we all laugh (so lame) 
We were having the time of our lives 
Well thank you it was a real blast 
 
No regrets they don't work 
No regrets they only hurt 
Write me a love song 
Drop me a line 
Suppose it's just a point of view 
But they tell me I'm doing fine 
 
Everything I wanted to be every 
Time I walked away 
Every time you told me to leave 
I just wanted to stay 
Every time you looked at me and  
Every time you smiled 
I felt so vacant you treat me like a child 
I loved the way we used to laugh 
I loved the way we used to smile 
Often I sit down and think of you 
For a while 
Then it passes by me and I think of 
Someone else instead 
I guess the love we once had is 
Officially dead</field>

Early morning when I wake up

Of easy lays 
The pause button's broke on my video 
And is this real cos I feel fake

Teach me things I don't need to know

I met her father she met my mother 
We didn't have anywhere else to go 
She said to me when we grow older 
Will we still need young love on 
Our shoulders 
Does it just fade away 
Will we ever know? 
 
She touched my face and called me 
Her lover 
I never thought that I'd need another 
 
[Chorus:] 
Your cool suburban sun 
You're foolin' everyone 
You win some, you lose some 
 
I didn't know what we had found 
Just caught the bus and rode it to town 
She wouldn't notice anything else but me 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Dancing at discos 
And moaning at phone bills 
Torremolinos and sun burnt in high heels 
Swap it and sell it 
And drop it and smell it 
All those years ago 
 
She touched my face and called me 
Her lover 
I never thought that I'd need another 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
[Repeat: x3] 
Now it's gone, now it's gone,

Wash it off 
Got a fist of pure emotion 
Got a head of shattered dreams 
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind me now 
 
[Chorus] 
whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
I just want you back for good 
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it 
You'll be right and understood 
 
Unaware but underlined I figured out the story 
It wasn't good 
And in the corner of a mind I celebrated glory 
But it wasn't to be 
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free 
Can't you find a little room inside for me 
 
[Chorus] 
 
And we'll be together, this time is forever 
So complete in our love 
We will never be uncovered again 
 
Mosh!

I'll make a man out of me 
 
Daddy where's the sun  gone from the sky? 
What did we do wrong, why did it die? 
And all the grown ups say 'sorry kids we got no reply' 
 
If you're willing to change the world 
Let love be your energy 
I've got more than I need 
When your love shines down on me 
 
Every tear that you cry 
Will be replaced when you die 
Why don't you love your brother? 
Are you out of your mind? 
 
Daddy where's the sun gone from the sky 
What did we do wrong, why did it die 
And if you've got no love for me then I'll say goodbye 
 
If you're willing to change the world 
Let love be your energy 
I've got more than I need 
When your love shines down on me 
 
If you're willing to change the world 
Let love be your energy 
I can't contain how I feel 
When your love shines down on me 
Well if you want to come and make a stance 
So when it's in your hands 
People will show me love 
 
Well if you want to come and make a stance 
So when it's in your hands 
People show me love 
 
If you're willing to change the world 
Let love be your energy 
I got more than I need 
When your love shines down on me 
 
If you're willing to change the world 
Let love be your energy 
I can't contain how I feel 
When your love shines down on me

            <field name="lyrics">Love is calling earth 
Do you know how much is hurts? 
I didn't die overnight 
In the wind I had candlelight 
I'm controlled by my fear 
All the voices in my head 
That I can hear 
 
Please don't hurt me 
 
How do I learn 
To give and love and be loved in return 
If this is heaven I'm falling 
I'd rather run and jump away 
Than to see it burn 
I feel I could die 
Before I sleep I kiss your cheek 
And say goodbye 
 
I'm so sorry 
Please don't hurt me 
 
This is love calling earth 
Do you know how much it hurts? 
I didn't die overnight 
In the wind I had candlelight 
 
I'm controlled by my fear 
And all the voices in my head  
That I can hear 
 
I'm so sorry 
Please don't hurt me 
 
If you could see me through my mother's eye 
Only then would you begin to realise 
All the places I have ever been 
Have scared me half to death or 
somewhere in-between 
 
I'm so sorry 
Please</field>

Beat me up on the beach 
 
What a lovely holiday 
There's nothing funny left to say 
 
This somber song would drain the sun 
But it won't shine until it's sung 
 
No water running in the stream 
The saddest place we've ever been 
 
Everything I touched was golden 
Everything I loved got broken 
On the road to Mandalay 
Every mistake I've ever made 
Has been rehashed and then replayed 
As I got lost along the way 
 
There's nothing left for you to give 
The truth is all that you're left with 
Twenty paces then at dawn 
We will die and be reborn 
 
I like to sleep beneath the trees 
Have the universe at one with me 
Look down the barrel of a gun 
And feel the moon replace the sun 
 
Everything we've ever stolen 
Has been lost returned or broken 
No more dragons left to slay 
Every mistake I've every made 
Has been rehashed and then replayed 
As I got lost along the way 
 
Save me from drowning in the sea 
Beat me up on the beach 
What a lovely holiday 
There's nothing left to say</field>

Need permission to land 
I don't wanna rock, DJ 
But your making me feel so nice 
When's it gonna stop, DJ? 
Cos you're keepin' me up all night 
 
Singin' in the classes 
Music for your masses 
Give no head 
No backstage passes 
Have a proper giggle 
I'll be quite polite 
But when I rock the mic 
I rock the mic

You got no love, then you're with the wrong man 
It's time to move your body 
If you can't get a girl

It's time to move your body 
 
I don't wanna be sleazy 
Baby just tease me 
Got no family planned 
Houston, can you hear me?

You're not the only ones who feel this 
So scared of what we're doing 
All the time 
 
Here comes wasted head-space 
Paranoia 
Anger, misplaced feelings 
Leave me nowhere 
All the time 
 
I don't wake up early in the morning 
'Cause the more I sleep the the less I have to say 
Scared of you always thinking that I'm boring 
Stop me yawning my life away 
 
Tender young confusion 
Send black mariah for blue delusions 
Lays heavy oh so heavy 
On my mind 
 
I'm so sick of people's expectations 
Leaves me tired all the time 
If your home's full of useless aggravation 
Then don't bring it to mine 
 
I seem to spend my life 
Just waiting for the chorus 
'Cause the verse is never nearly 
Good enough 
 
The hooligan half of me 
That steals from Woolworths 
While the other lives for love 
 
I'm so sick of people's expectations 
Leaves me tired all the time 
If your home's full of worthless aggravation 
Then don't bring it to mine 
 
Singing for the lonely 
We're not the only ones who feel this 
So scared of what I'm doing 
All the time 
 
Singing for the Lonely 
We're not the only ones who feel this 
Scared of what we're doing

All the lonely hearts in London 
Caught a plane and flew away 
And all the best women are married 
All the handsome men are gay 
You feel deprived 
 
Yeah are you questioning your size? 
Is there a tumour in your humour, 
Are there bags under your eyes? 
Do you leave dents where you sit, 
Are you getting on a bit? 
Will you survive 
You must survive 
 
When there's no love in town 
This new century keeps bringing you down 
All the places you have been 
Trying to find a love supreme 
A love supreme 
 
Oh what are you really looking for? 
Another partner in your life to 
Abuse and to adore? 
Is it lovey dovey stuff, 
Do you need a bit of rough? 
Get on your knees 
 
Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear 
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment 
That echoes in your ear 
Saying love will stop the pain 
Saying love will kill the fear 
Do you believe 
You must believe 
When there's no love in town 
This new century keeps bringing you down 
All the places you have been 
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme 
 
I spy with my little eye 
Something beginning with (ah) 
Got my back up 
And now she's screaming 
So I've got to turn the track up 
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up 
I know this girl she likes to switch teams 
And I'm a fiend but I'm living for a love supreme 
 
When there's no love in town 
This new century keeps bringing you down 
All the places you have been 
Trying to find a love supreme 
A love supreme 
 
Come and live a love supreme 
Don't let it get you down 
Everybody lives for love 
 
Come and live a love supreme 
Don't let it get you down 
Everybody lives for love

All God's children fade and die

Amen you do it again 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep 
And when you're coming down I'll be asleep

21 was the time to come undone 
Doesn't everyone 
 
Very young and very ape 
I'm gonna drink and stay up very late 
And hate the sun 
 
And now my heart kicks up a fuss 
I'm a rolling stone 
They say I'm dangerous 
But I'm never alone 
 
I know that you're like me 
You want your kicks for free 
You'll be a rolling stone 
 
Got an A in attitude 
Spent money on drugs to suit my mood 
I guess I'm just like you 
 
Being young is over-rated 
One day I'll be old and understated 
But before I'm through.... 
 
I'll run naked through the streets 
Be a rolling stone 
Defiance in defeat, enjoy being alone 
 
I know that you're like me 
You want your kicks for free 
Be a rolling stone 
 
When we die we'll find out other ways 
For getting drunk and throwing it all away 
Today is tomorrow and not yesterday 
It's all in your head 
So get out of your head 
 
And now your heart kicks up a fuss 
You're a rolling stone 
They say you're dangerous 
But you're never alone 
 
I know you're just like me 
You want your kicks for free 
Be a rolling stone

Wed hide from the light on the village green when I was seventeen. 
When I was twenty-one, it was a very good year. 
It was a very good year for city 
Girls who lived up the stairs 
With perfume hair that came undone 
When I was twenty-one. 
 
When I was thirty-five, it was a very good year. 
It was a very good year for blue-blooded 
Girls of independent means. 
Wed ride in limousines. their chauffeurs 
Would drive when I was thirty-five. 
 
But now the days are short, Im in the 
Autumn of the year 
And now I think of my life as vintage 
Wine from fine old kegs 
From the brim to the dregs. it poured 
Sweet and clear. it was a very good year.</field>

Strolling down the avenue 
Me and my shadow 
Not a soul to tell our troubles to 
And when it's twelve o'clock 
We climb the stair 
We never knock 
For nobody's there 
Just me and my shadow 
All alone and feeling blue 
When the sun sets on the far horizon 
And the parlor lamps begin to glow 
Jim and Jack and John 
Put their slippers on 
They're all set but we'restill on the go 
So lonely 
Me and my shadow 
Strolling down the avenue 
Me and my shadow

And he'd dance for you 
In worn out shoes  
 
With silver hair a ragged shirt 
And baggy pants 
He would do the old soft shoe 
 
He would jump so high 
Jump so high 
Then he lightly touch down 
 
He told me of the time he worked with 
Minstrel shows travelling 
Throughout the south 
 
He spoke with tears of fifteen years 
How his dog and he 
They would travel about. 
 
But his dog up and died 
He up and died 
And after twenty years he still grieved 
 
He said "I dance now 
At every chance in the Honky Tonks 
For my drinks and tips 
 
But most the time I spend 
Behind these country bars 
You see on I drinks a bit" 
 
Then he shook his head 
Oh lord when he shook his head 
I could swear I heard someone say please 
 
Mister Bojangles

The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square 
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back 
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, "Now, listen, Jack 
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right 
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top 
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'? 
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top" 
The buzzard told the monkey, "You're choking me 
Release your hold and I'll set you free" 
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said 
"Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie" 
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and stay right 
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top</field>

The way you haunt my dreams 
No, no, they can't take that away from me 
 
We may never, never meet again 
On this bumpy road to love 
Still I'll always, always keep  
The memory of 
 
The way you hold your knife 
The way we danced till three 
The way you've changed my life 
No, no, they can't take that away from me 
No, they can't take that away from me 
 
Not without a lawyer, anyway 
 
We may never, never meet again

Can't take that away 
Won't take that away 
Won't take that away 
Can't take that away from me</field>

Starin' at the lonely avenue (avenue) 
Watching lovers holdin' hand an' laughin' (Hahaha) 
And thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do 
 
(Thinkin' of things) Like a walk in the park 
(Things) Like a kiss in the dark 
(Things) Like a sailboat ride 
(Yeah-yeah) What about the night we cried? 
Things like a lover's vow 
Things that we don't do now 
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do 
 
Memories are all I have to cling to (Cling to) 
And heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to (But You've got me now) 
When I'm not thinkin' of-a just how much I love you (I love you too) 
Well, I'm-a thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do (Used to do) 
 
(Thinkin' of things) Like a walk in the park

(Things) Like a sailboat ride 
(Yeah-yeah) What about the night we cried? 
Things like a lover's vow 
Things that we don't do now 
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do 
 
I still can hear the jukebox softly playin' (playin') 
And the face I see each day belongs to you (belongs to you) 
Though there's not a single sound and there's nobody else around 
Well, it's-a just me thinkin' of the things we used to do 
 
(Thinkin' of things) Like a walk in the park

Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do 
 
And the heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to 
Ya got me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do 
 
You were rubbish in that 
Don't start that with me on this album 
Why did you do it like that, that time 
For start to finish there you said I'm wrong 
You said I had to think about Kylie when I was doing this and I was 
You obviously weren't thinking about Kylie,  
You were thinking about June Whitfield 
I can't hear you, I can't hear you 
Well you were thinking about June Whitfield that's who you were thinking about. 
I had to think about somebody and you told me Kylie 
Well listen, you just came in wrong and then it got progressively worse from there. 
You started it wrong 
I can't hear you you're cutting out 
It went bad, bad, bad right towards the end 
Who said bad? When you sang? 
No, when you sang! 
No 
Yes, you can hear me! Look, you started this on your last album, 
I don't want anything to do it! I'm going, goodbye!</field>

You are called the forgotten man 
(is that what they're saying, well did you evah!) 
(what a swell party this is) 
 
And have you heard the story of, 
A boy, a girl, unrequited love 
(sounds like pure soap opera, tune in tomorrow)  
I may cry 
(what a swell party this is) 
 
(what frills, what frocks) What broads! 
(what furs, what rocks!) They're bootiful. 
(Why I've never seen such gaity) Neither have I. 
(Its all just too, too risque really) 
 
This french champagne (domestic) 
(so good for the brain) That's what I was going to say. 
(you know you're a brilliant fellow?) Why thank you 
(pick up jack please don't eat that glass my friend) 
 
(Have you heard, about dear Blanche?) 
(Got run down by an avalanche) No! 
(oh don't worry, shes a game girl you know, got up and finished 4th) 
The kids got guts. (Having a nice time? Grab aline!) 
 
Have you heard that Mimsie Starr (what now) 
She got pinched in the Astor bar 
(sloshed again, eh?) She was stoned. 
Well, did you evah? (Never!) 
What a swell party this is! 
 
Hey, check out that act! (That's a lovely dress) 
You think I can talk her out of it? 
 
It's great, (aah it's great) 
So grand! (so grand) 
It's wonderland! 
La da da da 
 
(We sing), oh we sing 
(so rare) so rare 
(Like old camembert) 
(Like baba au rhum!) 
Don't dig that kind of crooning chum! 
 
Have you heard? It's in the stars 
Next July we collide with Mars. 
Well, did you evah? 
What a swell party, a swell party 
A swelligant, elegant party this is! 
 
(Let's drink to your health) 
No, lets drink to your wealth 
(Your my bon ami) 
Hey, that's french 
(Both) A liberty fraternity 
 
Have you heard? It's in the stars 
Next July we collide with Mars. 
Well, did you evah? 
What a swell party, swell party 
Swelligant, elegant party this is!</field>

I'm everybody that I know  
And being known for being wrong 
 
And if I'm not mistaken 
This is my heart breaking 
I'm the man that threw it all away 
 
Destiny is calling, telling me to be boring  
And I don't care anyway, 
Gonna be nobody someday 
Gonna be nobody someday 
 
I'm the demon that you fear 
I'm the joker, I'm the thief 
I'm the lonesome cowboy ridin' 
I'm the Indian chief 
 
Gotta watch my figure 
Boy, if I get much bigger 
They'll stick a pin in me  
And I'll blow away 
 
But I get richer 
While they take my picture 
Taking my soul away 
Gonna be nobody someday 
Gonna be nobody someday 
 
I'm a moonlight serenade 
I'm your bed when you are cold 
I'm the captain of Titanic 
I'm the passenger in the hall 
 
From the way I'm thinking 
We'll both be sinking 
I knew before we sailed away 
 
Hit the tip of my eagle 
It's all you saw anyway 
Gonna be nobody someday 
Gonna be somebody 
Gonna be somebody, la la la</field>

I think its dying  
Bless the Lord

You won't see me crying

Singing  
I won't go to war  
Lay down your guns

I want to swim in the ocean  
I want to play in the sea  
I want to love my brother  
Love my brother loving me, me  
 
I'm gonna buy a farm  
Write a song  
It won't change the earth  
Just the people on it  
 
I was born with  
A silver shovel in my mouth  
Golden balls and a platinum smile  
 
You won't hear the last of  
the good, the bad or the brassed off, for sure  
 
Singing  
I won't go to war  
Lay down your guns  
What are we fighting for  
 
I want to swim with the dolphins 
I want to play in the sea  
I'm gonna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me  
 
Then buy a farm  
Write a song  
It won't change the earth  
Just the people on it  
 
Hear the sound of a million people sitting down  
Hip to hip  
Lip to lip  
Free your love  
Free love  
Free love  
 
Singing I won't go to war  
Lay down your guns

I'm gonna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me, me

A book that no-one read 
A film that never made me sad 
And you remind of a place I've never been 
 
And something no-one said 
When I was 17 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
 
You'll wake up in it 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
But you probably won't admit it 
 
Remember when we never struggled through? 
A bad time we never had 
A love we never fell into 
Please don't remind me to forget 
 
'Cause forgiveness is a place 
I ain't got used to yet 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
 
You'll wake up in it 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
But you probably won't admit it 
 
All I ever wanted 
Was to radiate your home 
But I guess it doesn't matter 
So come reminisce about a time we didn't have 
 
I hear there's a sequel to that film that never made you sad 
Don't rewrite my history 
'Cause you never really know 
How much you didn't mean to me 
 
One fine day 
In the middle of the night 
You'll wake up in it 
One fine day 
 
In the middle of the night 
But you probably won't admit it</field>

            <field name="lyrics">It was me and my monkey 
Him with his dungarees and Rollerblades 
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet black Chevrolet 
He had the soft top down 
He liked the wind in his face 
He said ?Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said ?No' he said ?That's where we're gonna go, you need a change of place' 
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he said 
?I left my wallet in El Segundo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine 
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel 
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well 
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said 
If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, and we've got a monkey bed' 
 
Me and monkey 
With a dream and a gun 
Hoping my monkey 
Don't point that gun at anyone 
Me and monkey 
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid 
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did 
 
And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor 
He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen before 
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke 
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages 
Called up escort services and ordered some okie doke 
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door 
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores 
?Hi, my name is Sunshine. These are my girls. Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world' 
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun 
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium 
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine 
What's up, you better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good time' 
 
Me and my monkey 
Drove in search of the sun 
Me and my monkey 
Don't point that gun at anyone 
Me and my monkey 
Like Billy the Kid 
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did 
 
Got tickets to see Sheena Easton 
The monkey was high 
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died 
We left before encores 
He couldn't sit still 
Sheena was a blast baby 
But my monkey was ill 
When I played black jack 
Kept hittin' 23 
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me 
Or was it my monkey 
I couldn't be sure 
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before 
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run 
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun 
?My name is Rodriguez' he says with death in his eye 
?I've been chasing you for a long time amigos 
And now your monkey is gonna die' 
 
Me and my monkey 
Drove in search of the sun 
Me and my monkey 
We don't want to kill no Mexican 
But we got ten itchy fingers 
One thing to declare 
When the monkey is high 
You do not stare 
You do not stare 
You do not stare 
 
Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy 
And I ain't about to run 
Put your gun down boy 
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow</field>

Y'all can come and help me pick the sweetcorn out of this. 
It's hard to be humble 
When you're so fucking big 
Did you ever meet a sexier male chauvinist pig 
 
I'm gonna milk it till I turn it into cheese 
Tell your babes in arms and OAP's 
Come take a piece of me 
 
If you drop me I'll fall to pieces on you 
If you don't see me I don't exist 
It's nice to meet you 
Now let me go and wash my hands 
Cause you just met the world's most handsome man 
The world's most handsome man 
 
Y'all know who I am 
I'm still the boy next door 
That's if you're Lord Litchfield and Roger Moore 
If I've gone up in the world 
Or is the world gone down on me 
I'm the one who put the Brits in celebrity 
 
Give in and love it 
What's the point in hating me 
You can't argue with popularity 
Well you could 
But you'd be wrong 
 
If you drop me I'll fall to pieces on you 
If you don't need me I don't exist 
You voted for me 
Now let me see a show of hands 
Keeping for your stands 
 
Can you make me laugh and sign this autograph 
Though it's not for me 
Flip a grin, shake a thing, name a shame 
Then I'm out of here 
It's not very complicated 
I'm just young and overrated 
 
Please don't drop me I'll fall to pieces on you 
If you don't see me I don't exist 
It's nice to meet you 
Now let me go and wash my hands 
Keeping for your stands 
 
Please don't drop me I'll fall to pieces on you

I can get you a surgeon 
24 hours a day. 
Wasn't Jean Genie a Rolling Stones hit? 
I'm about to be blown away. 
 
Come on, sing it 
 
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows 
Oh my sunset rodeo. 
 
Hot fudge 
Here comes the judge 
There's a green card and a way 
The holy ghost 
And the whole east coast 
Are moving to LA 
And we've been 
Dreaming of this feeling 
Since 1988 
Mother, things have got to change 
I'm moving to LA. 
 
Take the piss 
I was English 
God bless you Uncle Sam. 
You got a cool gene pool 
And I went to school 
And God knows I love to tan. 
Making cents and dead presidents 
Before I could count to ten. 
With the nation behind me 
Can't stop the limey 
She's on her back again. 
 
Come on, sing it 
 
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows 
Oh my sunset rodeo. 
 
Hot fudge 
Here comes the judge 
There's a green card and a way 
The holy ghost 
And the whole east coast 
Are moving to LA 
'Cause we've been 
Dreaming of this feeling 
Since 1988 
Mother, things have got to change 
I'm moving to LA, LA, LA 
 
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows 
Oh my sunset rodeo. 
 
Hot fudge 
Here comes the judge 
There's a green card and a way 
The holy ghost 
And the whole east coast 
Are moving to LA 
'Cause we've been 
Dreaming of this feeling 
Since 1988 
Mother, things have got to change 
I'm moving to 
 
Keep a-moving keep a-moving, keep a-moving to LA

Johnny long strokes to the grave 
Saving all the stamps and spend it on a kettle

If you lick it, then lick it battery 
Good and properly all night if you want 
 
I haven't got a clue what to do with you 
I need for you to love me so much 
Jesus what am I gonna do with this crush 
Just get the old fella and wack it up against her tush 
 
How peculiar 
 
Bend your long legs against the sofa  
In the Dorchester you can get your All Bran 
I'm not into hard sports 
 
Oh I haven't got a clue what to do with you 
Jesus all the things my head is going through 
God what am I going to do with this crush 
Just wack the old man out and get it up against your tush 
 
How peculiar 
 
Jesus what am I to do man 
I am a depressed man 
Not sure what I'm doing all of the day 
How peculiar 
 
I am all of the above man 
I have what you want man

Your shadow on the pavement  
The dark side of the sun  
Gotta dream the dream all over  
And sleep here tight  
You don't want to sing the blues  
In black and white  
 
And it's hope that spring's eternal for everyone  
If it ain't broken break it or the damage done  
 
Trying to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
There's just no pleasing me  
Trying to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Baby lay your love on me  
 
Violet in the rainbow just melt away  
There's not enough minutes in the hour  
Or hours in the day  
The song played in a circle that never skips a beat  
The stranger in a country that I have yet to meet  
 
And it's hope that springs eternal for everyone  
Got a lifetime in a second oh the damage done  
 
Trying to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Guess there's just no pleasing me  
I want to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Baby lay your love on me  
 
It'll come in your sweet time, Lord  
I just gotta let you in  
The blind leading the blind, Lord  
Getting underneath your skin  
I can feel you in the silence  
Saying let forever be  
Love, only love, will set you free  
 
I want to love somebody  
Want to love somebody right now  
There's just no pleasing me  
I want to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Lay lay, lay your love on me  
 
It'll come in your sweet time, Lord  
I just gotta let you in

Getting underneath your skin

I've slept with girls on the game 
I've got my Catholic shame

What shape of insanity 
Keeps leading you back to me? 
 
So put your hands across the water

Come soon 
 
Don't want to piss on your parade  
I'm here to make money and get laid 
Yeah I'm a star but I'll fade 
If you ain't sticking your knives in me  
You will be eventually 
 
To all you Sharons and Michelles 
With all your tales to sell 
Save your meat money well 
I'm glad that spending a night with me 
Guaranteed you celebrity. 
 
And I can't talk in a crowd 
When I'm alone I'm too loud 
You're done, your daddy's proud  
Thank you for keeping me company 
You've all been so nice to me 
 
So put your hands across the water

Oh Lord 
I feel 
Nothing 
I know much smarter men 
Never got this far 
 
I got too many regrets  
I've smoked too many cigarettes 
I've had more blondes than brunettes 
I'm not expecting your sympathy 
But it's all been too much for me

And now she lives in heaven 
But I know they let her out

Bringing heaven down here

You've come a long way baby

Pray silence my fear

You taught me kings and queens 
While stroking in my head 
In my darkest hour 
I know you are there 
Leaning down beside me 
Whispering my prayers 
There's a strange kind of light

Oh child the knot's in your back  
'Cause you've been holding on  
I feel you when you're reaching out  
 
I'll talk you through memories  
Just keep breathing with me  
It's time to hold my hand  
And walk into the revolution  
 
When there's no one to touch  
And you've been thinking too much  
You only hurt yourself  
When it's all about retribution  
 
I see the pain in your face  
And praying rare for this space  
It's time to lead you on  
C'mon, it's a revolution  
 
When you can't keep on keeping on  
And everything you lean upon is all but gone  
Everybody falls sometimes  
But love shines on  
And on and on and  
 
With love in your eyes and a flame in your heart  
You're gonna find yourself some resolution  
A million miles with one step  
You'll find yourself yet  
Walking with the revolution

Talking about the revolution

Walking with the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Taking you higher  
 
Old love lingers on  
You're just feelin it wrong  
I know you're tired  
But when it's time to sleep you're gone forever  
 
Make friends with your past  
And you can leave it at last  
It's time to find yourself  
Walking with the revolution  
 
And you can keep on keeping on and  
Everything you lean upon is all but gone  
Everybody hurts sometimes  
But love shines on and on and on and  
 
Time and tide's on your side  
There's no need to hide  
I feel your pain  
Don't talk to me about evolution  
A million miles with one step  
You'll find yourself yet  
When you're walking with the revolution  
 
Walking with the revolution

            <field name="lyrics">You can't manufacture a miracle 
The silence was pitiful that day. 
A love is getting too cynical 
Passion's just physical these days 
You analyze everyone you meet 
But get no sign, love ain't kind 
Every night you admit defeat 
And cry yourself blind 
 
[Chorus:] 
If you can't wake up in the morning 
Cause your bed lies vacant at night 
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely 
Can't control it, try as you might 
May you find that love that won't leave you 
May you find it by the end of the day 
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely 
Something beautiful will come your way 
 
The DJ said on the radio 
Life should be stereo, each day 
In the past you cast the unsuitable 
Instead of some kind of beautiful, you just couldn't wait 
All your friends think you're satisfied 
But they can't see your soul no, no, no 
Forgot the time feeling petrified, when they lived alone 
 
[Chorus 
 
Some kind of beautiful (will come your way) [Repeat: x4] 
 
All your friends think you're satisfied 
But they can't see your soul no no no 
Forgot the time feeling petrified 
When they lived alone

The storm was blowing through you. 
 
Waiting for god, 
To stop this. 
I'm too young and,

Everyone around you was corrupted,  
Say something. 
 
There's no dignity in death, 
To sell the world your last breath. 
Your still fighting over everything you left, 
Oh. 
 
I saw you standing at the gate, 
When Marlon Brando passed away. 
You had that look upon your face,  
Advertising Space. 
And no one learned from your mistakes, 
The little profits go to waste. 
All that's left in any case, 
Is advertising space. 
Oh 
 
Through your eyes the world was burning, 
Please be gentle I'm still learning. 
He seemed to say,  
As you kept turning up. 
 
They poisoned you with compromise, 
At what point did you realize. 
Everybody loves your life, 
But you. 
 
A special agent for the man, 
Water gates and Vietnam. 
No one really gave a damn, 
D'ya think the sea I'm aiding?

Don't go home 
Where are we 
 
If we are ghosts 
(A long long time ago) 
It looks like we could have made it baby 
We are ghosts 
(A long long time) 
Me and you 
We are ghosts 
(A long long time ago) 
We could have made it 
We are ghosts 
(A long long time) 
Me and you 
(Ago) 
 
Look at the time its taken me 
To get away from what was said 
I'll never leave 
I'll always love 
You know that all those words are dead 
Buried in yours tonight 
Move aside 
I'm taking you home 
 
On the radio 
She was that summer song 
Packing them in 
Making them dance 
A law of her own 
Taking the time to sing it 
I don't need you 
But I'm lost 
I'm lost without you tonight 
Have you no heart 
Where are we 
(Everybody sing it) 
 
Hold 
A love like gold 
Then fold 
They're taking down our satellite 
We are ghosts 
Josephine 
I'll follow your star tonight 
We are ghosts 
If not tonight 
Then when will she say 
(Everybody sing it) 
We're not ghosts</field>

I cannot hear what you say 
Except for the occasional word 
Sulphates a sentimental sight it bothers me 
No longer king of bloke and bird 
 
All of my life 
Searching hard 
Down in the wires 
Of love 
 
Summer me now summer my life away 
Summon me onto another day 
 
A hand through the clouds keeps 
Knocking me down 
It's no less than I deserve 
They built museums I don't visit them 
I've made enough trouble of my own 
 
Into the night 
Searching hard 
Look for the light 
Of love 
 
Summer me now summer my life away 
Summon me on to another day 
 
Summer the evening, winter ways 
Are falling down again 
I sing from the chaos in my heart, my heart 
 
Then comes the evening that 
Makes life worth living 
Shoving the shoes out in the light 
She walks in, I can hear her</field>

To reel 'em in  
It's a song I sung before  
And a song I'm gonna sing again  
I mean every word  
I don't mean a single one of them  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
 
Tell a joke 
Tell it twice 
If no one else is laughing there why am I 
I split myself both times and laugh till I cry 
Oh Lord, please make me pure  
But not yet 
 
I don't have to try  
I just dial it in  
I've never found a job that for me was worth bothering  
I got a ton of selfish genes and lazy bones  
Beneath this skin  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
 
Smoking kills 
Sex sells  
I've got one hand in my pocket but the other one looks cool as hell  
I know I'm gonna die so my revenge is living well  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
 
I stopped praying 
So I hope this song will do  
I wrote it all for you  
I'm not perfect but you don't mind that, do you?  
I know you're there to pull me through, aren't you?  
 
So I look for love  
I like the search  
And I'll be standing for election all across the known universe  
Let every president get the country she deserves  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
 
And I've been seeing  
Somebody's wife  
She said she'd leave him for me and I said that wasn't wise  
You can't lie to a liar because of all lies  
Oh Lord, please make me pure  
Not yet</field>

Harder thinkers make me miserable  
Everything is unforgivable

Met you with me

Teach me with your brain  
All right  
 
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
 
Things that I say  
When I say nothing at all  
It leaves a taste in my stomach  
And its no taste at all  
 
I can sing, I can't dance  
But it don't stop me at all  
Its a ball and I'll call , if I call you at all  
 
Love is the reason but it won't pay my rent  
Only baloney fill your dish in the dent  
I won't be happy till the moneys been spent  
I forget to forget, oh forget, oh forget  
 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah</field>

The only gift you gave to me 
Was self-fulfilling prophecy 
I need to change the sounds  
That shape my life 
 
And if you die before I leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around there's no one here 
To love me and hold me 
 
Take me dancing 
I love music 
Keep on singing 
We won't lose it 
 
Picture me there 
Missing no one 
If young hearts run free 
Why can't we go on 
 
Go on 'til they kick us out 
We've everything to talk about 
I could bring a song into your life 
 
If you should die before I leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around there's no one here 
To love me and hold me 
 
Maybe I've been away too long 
I know I'm not always right but is that wrong 
They say there's nothing I can do 
But talk to strangers and wait for you 
 
If you should die before I leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around there's no one 
To love me and hold me 
 
If you should die before I leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around there's no one

Why don't you try being kind

Creep upon you while you sleep 
And make you less attractive 
 
Born without a spine 
Why don't you try being kind 
 
For those out drinking their mother's wake 
You'll find a way to soldier on 
For those whose love evaporates 
I pray you find where you belong 
 
Oh the words I have repressed 
Are coming out today I guess 
It's justice not respect I'm after 
And that just leaves comtempt 
For you all 
 
I am just a simple man 
With simple expectations 
With deep regrets they're seldom met 
God speed my generation 
 
And with Crowley on my mind 
I should try being kind

I was the boy with the flash clothes 
She was the girl with the acid stare 
I saw her at The Place 
You know she knows you know 
How she shakes when she jacks her body 
To the sounds of Oran Juice Jones and 
Jocelyn Brown 
 
Oh spread your wings before they fall apart 
Home is where the hurt is darling 
Follow your heart 
 
So she walks into this dead end bar 
Sticks her handbag on the chair 
So she walks into this dead end bar 
Puts hers handbag on the chair 
And she weights the words we shared 
When we were fifteen and still cared 
'Cause she feels I'm a scar from the wound 
That time can't heal 
 
And I said 
Don't let your dreams out of your head 
Stick it to the man instead 
Don't fool your heart lying about 
The feelings that you had back then 
Did you try to change your life? 
Did you ever try to change your life? 
You repeat and repeat 
And repeat and repeat 
Now what's up with that? 
 
Now she loves somebody else 
In flash clothes 
She was the girl with the acid stare 
And now she'd pay to have one of those 
 
And she weighs the word she says 
And she knows you exist 
Now she feels 
I'm the scar from the wound 
That time can't heal 
 
Oh spread your wings before they fall apart 
Home is where the hurt is darling 
Follow your heart 
 
Spread your wings before they fall apart 
Home is where the hurt is darling 
Follow your heart

Then laugh at you and hate you. 
Then they flight you, 
Then you win. 
 
When the truth dies, 
Very bad things happen. 
They're being heartless, 
Again. 
 
I know, its gonna, there's gonna be violence 
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take 
Why do you think we should suffer in silence 
When a hearth is broken there's nothing to break 
 
You've been mixing, 
With some very heavy faces. 
They boys have done, 
A bit of bird. 
 
They don't kill their own, 
and they all love their mothers. 
But you're out of your depth son, 
Have a word. 
 
I know, its gonna, there's gonna be violence 
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take 
Why do you think we should suffer in silence 
The heart broken there's nothing to break 
 
All is wonderful in this life, 
Dreaming of the sun she warms. 
You should see me in the afterlife, 
Picking up the songs of lures. 
 
When you think we're lost, we're exploring. 
What you think is work because I'm adoring. 
You don't want the truth, truth is boring. 
I've got this fever need to, 
Leave the house, 
Leave the car, 
Leave the bad men where they are, 
I'll leave a few shells in my gun, 
And stop me starring at the sun. 
 
I know, its gonna, there's be gonna violence 
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take 
Why do you think we should suffer in silence 
My heart is broken there's nothing to break.</field>

What a brave place to be  
 
So we dive  
On sunset strip  
Our hearts so deep  
I drown in it  
And as it breaks  
I swim through cracks  
And leave with words  
I can't take back  
 
You see the trouble with me  
Monkey see monkey do  
There's no you in tomorrow  
A better offer came through  
You see the trouble with you  
There's no trouble with you  
So when you say that you love me  
That stops me loving you  
 
So she stays  
On sunset strip  
Our hearts so full  
I drown in it  
She's waiting for  
My words to break  
The one true love  
I couldn't make  
 
So she walks  
That golden mile  
Men will try  
And catch her eye  
We both know  
What could have been  
On sunset strip

Time machine never gives us any trouble.  
There's a riot down in Shelton  
Only minutes after Brixton but this city never made it on the telly  
Or the rumble of the nations underbelly  
 
Never touch that switch, even if you want to.  
You don't know what it can do.  
Never touch that switch, even if you want to.  
You don't know what it can do.  
 
You know you're heading for a meltdown, and you're living in a tin town  
Thinking that you're gonna be somebody, living in the land of milk and honey  
Listen up 'cause it's a red light, and the futures blowing up tight  
There's a schism in the time mechanism, there's a schism in the time mechanism  
 
Never touch that switch, even if you want to.  
You don't know what it can do.  
Never touch that switch, even if you want to.  
You don't know what it can do.  
Never touch that switch, even if you want to.  
You don't know what it can do.  
Never touch that switch, even if you want to.  
You don't know what it can do.</field>

I don't miss you 
Just who you used to be 
And you don't ring true 
So please stop calling me 
 
Your I love yous 
Are ten a penny 
You're dropping clues 
Like you've got any 
You got to choose 
There's been so many 
 
I love you baby 
But face it she's Madonna 
No man on Earth 
Could say that he don't want her 
 
This look of love 
Says I'm leaving 
You're frozen now 
I've done the freezing 
I'm walking out 
Madonna's calling me 
 
She's got to be 
Obscene to be believed 
That's her routine 
Not what she means to me 
 
I found myself by circumstance 
Across a room where people dance 
And quite by chance she danced right next to me 
 
I love you baby 
But face it she's Madonna 
No man on earth would say that he don't want her 
It's me not you  
I've got to move on 
You're younger too 
But she's got her groove on 
I'm sorry love 
Madonna's calling me 
 
Madonna, Madonna 
 
I want to tell you a secret 
 
We're having drinks 
With Kate and Stella 
Gwyneth's here 
She's brought her fella 
But all I wanna do 
Is take Madonna home 
 
I love you baby 
But face it she's Madonna 
No man on earth 
Would say that he don't want her 
 
It's me not you 
I've got to move on 
You're younger too 
But she's got her groove on 
I'm sorry love 
Madonna's calling me</field>

The Romans did what they did 
Now everything's come down to this 
It's just you and I, our kin! 
 
We could send a million to the moon 
But why can't I get on with you? 
Cellophane around my mouth 
Stops the anger sipping out 
 
Our deaf and dumb dinners 
Gravy in the mud 
No singles, just fillers 
Sometimes I wish I could 
But I can't behave 
 
I know it's not the heathen in me 
It's just that I've been bleeding lately, 
Internally 
Don't turn to me, 
Bite your tongue, the torrid weapon 
You could learn a useful lesson 
 
What's so great about the Great Depression 
Is it a blast for you? 
Blasphemy 
 
Words cut like a knife through Vaseline 
You can't really mean what you mean 
When you say what you say 
So tourettes make them come out that way, 
Wish I was here well I wish you weren't 
Your gift of anger's better burnt 
If nothing's said then nothing's learnt 
I though I wasn't but I'm really hurting 
 
Our deaf and dumb dinners, 
There's gravy in the mud 
And I can't behave 
No, it's not the heathen in me 
It's just that I've been bleeding lately, 
Internally 
 
Don't turn to me 
Bite my tongue, the torrid weapon 
We could learn a useful lesson 
What's so great about the Great Depression 
Was it a blast for you, 
Blasphemy 
 
A great adventure Christmas in the snow 
Senile Dementia maybe, what a way to go 
I can't behave 
I know it's not the heathen in me 
It's just that I've been bleeding lately, 
Internally 
So turn to me 
Bite your tongue, your torrid weapon 
We could learn a useful lesson 
In a greatness great depression 
It's not a blast for me, 
It's blasphemy</field>

Well he's never been quite right

And that somebody's you 
But what can I do? 
 
I love you but I don't like you

She likes me different she likes me strange in her own way she's just the same 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
Psycho evolution your pollution makes it difficult for weirdos, 
Just another humanoid reaction to the voices in this town 
Every Saturday at the plaza guess the gender unless you'd rather, 
He is a lesbian but that's ok she is the center of attention for another day 
In the universe we are magenta you can join us if you enter, 
Because you're different and you are strange in your own way you're just the same 
 
Time isn't lost where devotion is I never wasted a life, 
Space is the place where the soul is far from the safe and the norm 
In the off stream they call it cavarade but they'll say that won't they, 
I want it different I like it strange in my own way I haven't changed 
It's insulting to be mislead by the hairdo of a god head 
They show reverence but that's OK we are the center of the universe anyway

Look what I invented here,

They can't take it away from us, 
The last days of disco 
 
All raved out, bitter is the pill of devotion 
Read between the noise, all you disco boys 
The fascination of, 
A boy and girl in love, 
For a second I could see that 
In the mir above, 
The human animal or a creature that I feel 
 
I'm all your here

This space is beautiful 
I'll decide when it is over 
So don't call it a comeback,

After a long and sleepless night? 
How many stars would you give to the moon? 
Do you see those stars from where you are? 
Shine on the lost and loneliest 
The ones who can't get over it 
 
You always wanted more than life 
But now you don't have the appetite 
In a message to the troubadour 
The world don't love you anymore 
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun? 
 
Stuck inside the rainbow years 
You could happen to me 
Cause I've been close to where you are 
I've drove to places you have seen 
It all seems so familiar 
Like they've been sent to kill ya 
 
It doesn't take an astronaut 
To float in a space is just a thought 
The morning brings a mystery 
The evening makes it history 
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun? 
 
And the village drunk 
Sadly passed away, 
It was a shame I never knew his name 
I wonder if he sat there every morning 
 
Watched the sunrise 
 
How do you rate the morning sun 
It's just too heavy for me 
And all I wanted was the world 
If you were the star let in the sun 
Don't go wasting your time 
Cause there is no finish line 
And you don't see anything, 
Not even love not anything, 
The night can take the man from you 
A sense of wonder overdue 
The morning brings a mystery 
The evening makes it history 
Who am I to rate the morning sun?</field>

All you are is colors 
And your colors run 
 
Isn't it genius that you give tonight 
You just keep on doing harm 
Could only see the sense in being superblind 
And just keep on keeping on 
 
I can't help thinking about me 
Put a thought in for me 
I'm the genius behind me 
Maybe I shouldn't have said it 
Here's to the next century 
What will they think if they think about me 
 
Here it is, what a lie say a prayer, 
For the way it should be 
We are people they don't believe 
Wish your mother wouldn't bother 
Won't she just stay out of your mind? 
Or should they stay when you make them leave

Maybe I shouldn't have said it 
Here's to the next century

I can't help think about me 
Won't you put a prayer in for me 
You could talk and think about me 
 
It's like these props know when we're dancing 
We can pray our way out of here 
You're like a new wave old romantic 
Try to break our heart but got stuck on it 
Superblind 
 
When your superblind 
Keep you out of mind 
Because we all know 
Cos we didn't care.</field>

I pray for my sanity 
Where we don't have to answer to anyone 'bout anything 
 
This is not like a brochure 
Flying cars and sex machines 
We are all so compliant 
'Cause everything is what it seems 
And it can't be the satellite 
To tell you how loved you are 
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far 
 
And I don't feel myself again 
I thought I'd be fixed by now 
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow 
Give me something to die for 
Or design a quiet mind 
Something to like mankind for 
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I. 
 
You've been bending so long now 
You think it's standing up 
And they line up behind you to build you up, buttercup 
We can lose all meaning 
Quicker than a credit card 
And not everyone's healing, so try your best and don't love too hard 
Cause they can't build a satellite 
To tell you what's in your heart 
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far 
 
And I don't feel myself again 
I thought I'd be fixed by now 
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow 
Give me something to die for 
Or design a quiet mind 
Something to like mankind for 
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I. 
 
Will I ever feel the waking 
Naked as a lullaby 
Don't ask me to explain again 
I can't lie to my heart and I 
 
And I don't feel myself again 
I thought I'd be fixed by now 
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow 
Give me something to die for 
Or design a quiet mind 
Something to like mankind for 
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I. 
 
My heart and I 
My heart and I 
 
I've been feeling so lonely 
Feeling so low 
So low I almost let go.</field>

Everything I touched was golden 
Everything I loved got broken 
On the road to Mandalay 
Every mistake I've ever made 
Has been rehashed and then replayed 
As I got lost along the way 
 
There's nothing left for you to give 
The truth is all that you're left with 
Twenty paces then at dawn 
We will die and be reborn 
 
I like to sleep beneath the trees 
Have the universe at one with me 
Look down the barrel of a gun 
And feel the moon replace the sun 
 
Everything we've ever stolen 
Has been lost returned or broken 
No more dragons left to slay 
Every mistake I've ever made 
Has been rehashed and then replayed 
As I got lost along the way 
 
Save me from drowning in the sea 
Beat me up on the beach 
What a lovely holiday 
There's nothing funny left to say</field>

Do the rudebox, shake your rudebox 
Do the rudebox, shake your rudebox 
Do the rudebox, shake your rudebox 
 
Okay then back to basics 
Grab your shell toes and your fat laces 
A little hand clap for some funk faces 
And make your body move in the following places 
 
Goes up your back and then down your spine 
And when it hits your head 
 
Okay then back to baseheads 
Dance like you just won at the special Olympics 
I got the rudebox of the back of a spaceship 
So sick I just had to take it 
 
The R.U.D.E.B.O.X. 
Up yer jacksy, split yer kicks 
Sing a song of Semtex 
Pocket full of Durex, body full of Mandrex 
 
Are we gonna have sex 
Will you wear your knee socks, back to the rudebox 
 
Got this double fantasy where we just never stop 
I got one design and that's to funk you to the top 
Know what's on my mind there's only one thing you will find 
I got one design and that's to bump you 'til you drop 
 
Rudebox, do the rudebox, 'cause you so nasty 
Rudebox, shake your rudebox, why you so nasty 
Rudebox, do the rudebox, 'cause you so nasty 
Rudebox, shake your rudebox, why you so nasty 
 
Okay then back to spaceship 
Take both pills fuck the Matrix 
Jack those jills shake your Playtex 
Rock 3 stripes not the asics 
 
A.D.I.D.A.S 
Old school 'cause it's the best, yes 
TK max cost less, yes 
Jackson looks a mess bless 
 
Okay then what to do 
If you try to jack me I'll rudebox you 
If you rudebox me I'll rudebox your whole crew 
'Cause it's what I do ain't that right boo, true 
 
I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border 
'cause the sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter 
I did it like this, you did it like that 
I love it when you double clap clap 
 
Got this double fantasy where we just never stop 
I got one design and that's to funk you to the top 
Know what's on my mind there's only one thing you will find 
I got one design and that's to bump you 'til you drop 
 
Rudebox, do the rudebox, 'cause you so nasty 
Rudebox, shake your rudebox, why you so nasty 
Rudebox, do the rudebox, 'cause you so nasty 
Rudebox, shake your rudebox, why you so nasty 
 
Okay then check the tan line 
Make your body shape like you're stood on a landmine 
Call me on my mobile not the landline 
And the jack the mainline at the same time 
 
Okay this is what we do 
Got a jam so fresh it's nice for you 
Okay give it what you got 
And dial 808 for the bass to drop 
 
Okay then what's the fracas 
Grab your cardy your lead hat and your bus pass 
You don't sweat much for a fat lass 
Grab your rudebox 'cause your box is righteous 
 
Okay bum rush the show 
I got high speed dubbing on my stereo 
And all the tunes in the box are the cherrio 
I know I told you before, did you hear me though? 
 
Got this double fantasy where we just never stop

I only wanna feel the sun

Every others passed to remind of the time 
All the lovers living in limbo divine 
Bah-um, bah-um,bah-um

Conversation, echoes like ghosts on the town

Candice's inner business 
She wants the boys to notice 
Her rainbows, and her ponies 
She was educated 
But could not count to ten 
How she got lots of different horses 
By lots of different men 
And I say 
 
Liberate your sons and daughters 
The bush is high 
But in the hole there's water 
You can get some, when they give it 
Nothing sacred, but it's a living 
 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too loud or a little too close 
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat 
And she thinks she's made of candy 
 
Ring a ring of roses 
Whoever gets the closest 
She comes and she goes 
As the war of the roses 
Mother was a victim 
Father beat the system 
By moving bricks to Brixton 
And learning how to fix them 
Liberate your sons and daughters 
The bush is high 
But in the hole there's water 
As you win 
She'll be the Hollywood love 
And if it don't feel good 
What are you doing this for 
Now tell me 
 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too high or a little too low 
Got no self-esteem and vertigo 
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy 
Hey ho here she goes 
Either a little too loud or a little too close 
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat 
And she thinks she's made of candy 
 
Liberate your sons and daughters 
The bush is high 
But in the hole there's water 
As you win 
She'll be the Hollywood love 
And if you don't feel good

What are you doing it for 
What are you doing it for 
What are you doing it for 
What are you doing it for 
What are you doing it for 
What are you doing it for

There's a hurricane in the back of her throat

            <field name="lyrics">We became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned 
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything 
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually 
 
We were once the answer and then you discover 
You're actually just one thing after another 
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening? 
 
This is all that matters now 
And that was all that happened anyhow 
You can look back but don't stare 
Maybe I can love you out of there 
 
And when I went away what I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say: 
Eight letters, three words, one meaning 
 
And outside forces didn't make it easy 
So I thought I'd go before you leave me 
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything 
 
But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend 
I'm just starting to understand, my friend 
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy 
 
This is all that matters now 
And that was all that happened anyhow 
You can look back but don't stare 
Maybe I can love you out of there 
 
And when I went away what I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say: 
Eight letters, three words, one meaning 
 
And when I went away what I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say: 
Eight letters, three words, one meaning 
 
At last, we meet on no man's land 
Just footprints in the sand 
We meet on no man's land, at last 
 
And when I went away what I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say: 
Eight letters, three words, one meaning 
 
And when I went away what I forgot to say 
Was all I had to say: 
Eight letters, three words, one meaning 
 
One meaning

            <field name="lyrics">When I look you in the eyes, 
Something deep inside me dies, 
'Cause I know you won't get better, better, better 
You'd rather be right done with love, 
The only thing I understood 
Nothing's ever good enough. 
 
I stumble through the words as they're leaving me, 
Tremble at the side of Your Majesty, 
And I cut myself just to get them out. 
 
This time I'll be different, I promise you, 
This time I'll be special, you know I will, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes. 
This time I'll be better, I want you to know, 
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes 
 
You took my youth, you took my health, 
And if you're not here I find myself 
You're supposed to make this better, better, better 
No self-control and no reason why, 
If I don't change, then we both die, 
This is it for you and I. 
 
Blisters at the end of my fingertips, 
Praying to a god I don't think exist 
Will you listen now? 
Can you forgive me somehow? 
 
This time I'll be different, I promise you, 
This time I'll be special, you know I will, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes. 
This time I'll be better, I want you to know, 
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes 
 
Closer now to the end, 
If love was the answer, 
Then hope was the question 
Closer now, let's pretend 
We've never been out here before. 
 
This time I'll be different, I promise you, 
This time I'll be special, you know I will, 
don't leave with me in your eyes. 
This time I'll be better, I want you to know, 
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so, 
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes</field>

The bitter end, coming home again  
(Let me be your gospel / Baby, we've got history)

And those that don't go fuck yourself

Welcome to the zoo. 
Bitter disappointments. 
Except for one or two. 
Some of them are angry. 
Some of them are mean. 
Most of them are twisted. 
Few of them are clean. 
 
Now when you go dancing with young men down at the disco. 
Just keep it simple. 
You don't have to kiss though. 
Don't waste time whit the idiots 
Think that they're heroes. 
They will betray you. 
Stick with us weirdos. 
 
For all your days and nights 
I'm gonna be there, 
I'm gonna be there, yes I will. 
Go gentle through your life. 
If you want me I'll be there. 
When you need me I'll be there for you. 
 
Don't try to make them love you. 
Don't answer every call. 
Baby be a giant. 
Let the world be small. 
Some of them are deadly. 
Some don't let it show. 
If they try and hurt you. 
Just let your daddy know. 
 
Now when you go 
Giving your heart make sure they deserve it. 
If they haven't earned it. 
Keep searching, it's worth it. 
 
For all your days and nights (days and night) 
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) 
I'm gonna be there, yes I will. 
Go gentle through your life (through your life) 
If you want me I'll be there (If you want me I'll be there) 
When you need me I'll be there for you. 
 
Go gentle to the light (to the light) 
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) 
I'm gonna be there, yes I will. 
If all your days are nights (days are nights) 
When you want me I'll be there (If you want me I'll be there) 
Say my name and I'll be there for you</field>

With my hair down in my eyes  
And she says hi  
And I hurry to the breakfast table  
While the kids are going off to school, goodbye  
And she reaches out and takes my hand  
And squeezes it and says "how you feelin' Hon?"  
And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart  
And I see my morning sun  
And if that's not loving me  
Then all I've got to say  
 
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime  
There's no such thing as Dr. Suess  
Disneyland and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime  
And when my self is feeling low  
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind  
 
Sometimes I call him up knowing he's busy  
And ask if he could get away and meet me  
And maybe grab a bite to eat  
And he drops what he's doing and hurry's down to meet me  
And I'm always late  
He sits waiting patiently and smiles when he first sees me  
Because he's made that way  
And if that's not loving me  
Then all I've got to say  
 
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes  
There's no such thing as make believe  
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves, no B.B. guns  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time

            <field name="lyrics">Folks here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher 
She was a red-hot hoochie coocher 
She was the roughest toughest frail 
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale 
 
Hodehodehodeho (Hodehodehodeho) 
Hodehodihidehi (Hodehodihidehi) 
Hidehidehidehi (Hidehidehidehi) 
Ho-oh! (Ho-oh!) 
 
She messed around with a bloke named Smokie 
She loved him though he was a tad cokey 
He took her down to Chinatown 
And showed her how to kick that gong around 
 
Hidehidehidehi (Hidehidehidehi) 
Whoah-y-oh-y-oh-y-oh (Whoah-y-oh-y-oh-y-oh) 
Hedehedeheyeye (Hedehedeheyeye) 
Yawhoahh-pop! (Yawhoahh-pop!) 
 
She had a dream about the king of Sweden 
He gave her things that she was needin' 
He gave her a home built of gold and steel 
A diamond car with platinum wheels 
 
Hidehidehidehi (Hidehidehidehi) 
Hodehodehodeho (Hodehodehodeho) 
Whoah! (Whoah!) 
 
He gave her a townhouse and his racing horses 
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses 
He had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes 
She sat and counted them all a million times 
 
Hidehidehidehi (Hidehidehidehi) 
Whoah-whoah! (Whoah-whoah!) 
Hedehedehedehe (Hedehedehedehe) 
Whoah-uh-whoah-uh-whoa-uh-whoah (Whoah-uh-whoah-uh-whoah-uh)

Up on lenox avenue 
On that famous thoroughfare 
With their noses in the air 
High hats and arrowed collars  
White spats and fifteen dollars 
Spending every dime 
On a wonderful time 
 
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to 
Why don't you go where harlem flits 
Puttin' on the Ritz 
 
Spangled gowns upon a bevy of high browns 
From down the levee, all misfits 
Puttin' on the Ritz 
 
That's where each and every lulu bell goes 
Every thursday evening with her swell beaus 
Rubbing elbows 
 
Come with me and we'll attend their jubilee 
And see them spend their last two bits 
Puttin' on the Ritz

Looking at you 
Let me melt a while in your company 
I unwind in your rapture 
I'm an overture to your symphony 
 
Time makes time 
A memory between us 
Am I still impossible to read? 
 
While the whole world was looking at you 
You came and wrapped yourself around me 
 
You feel the sun 
A work in progress 
I'm so far away from where I wanna be 
You stole my heart 
But my madness 
Is taking the man right out of me 
 
You said, we could have been so good together 
I complicate so easily 
 
While the whole world was looking at you 
You wrapped yourself around me 
 
So wonderful 
Feeling so vulnerable 
You'll never know what you did to me 
Can't disguise 
I'm hiding behind my eyes 
You could've meant the whole world to me</field>

All the lonely hearts in London 
Caught a plane and flew away 
The best women are married 
The handsome men are gay 
You feel deprived 
 
Yeah are you questioning your size? 
Is there a tumour in your humour 
Are there bags under your eyes? 
Do you leave dents where you sits? 
Are you getting on a bits? 
Will you survive 
You must survive 
 
When there's no love in town 
A new century is bringing you down 
All the places you have been 
Trying to find a love supreme 
A love supreme 
 
Oh what are you really looking for? 
Another partner in your life to abuse and to adore? 
Is it lovey dovey stuff 
Do you need a bit of rough? 
Get on your knees 
 
Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear 
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment 
That echoes in your ear 
Saying love will stop the pain 
Saying love will kill the fear 
Do you believe 
You must believe 
 
When there's no love in town 
A new century is bringing you down 
All the places you have been 
Trying to find a love supreme 
A love supreme 
 
When there's no love in town 
A new century is bringing you down 
All the places you have been 
Trying to find a love supreme 
Our love supreme, our love supreme 
Our love supreme</field>

What's behind your eyes makes you a star 
 
I'm gonna walk onto that stage like it's my destiny 
Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies 
If tomorrow I should die, these are my memories 
I'm gonna take this simple life and make history 
 
I dream a fantasy and then achieve it 
Repeat the greatest lie till they believe it 
You and me, not Gods, define us now 
You come in screaming, leave in silence 
 
Oh, I'm gonna walk onto that stage like it's my destiny 
Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies 
If tomorrow I should die, these are my memories 
I'm gonna take this simple life and make history 
 
Let's fly higher than the mocking birds 
They won't touch us way up here 
In the sole asylum of the universe 
A man can disappear 
Raise a glass to the disfunctional 
It's never ever too late 
I feel like miracles are happening 
If I could just get out the way 
 
I want to take my time on earth 
And give it meaning 
They say you get what you deserve 
I know the feeling, feeling, feeling 
 
You've gotta walk onto that stage like it's your destiny

A mistake in love 
Two people who stop trying enough 
Don't want a brand new life 
This one's just right 
Why would I throw it all away? 
 
Won't you hold me now? 
Just before I stop breathing 
I know I promised I wouldn't leave here without you 
Please, don't let me go 
While they play the last song ever 
The last chance to hold each other forever 
 
Hold me now, I've still got words worth hearing 
I just wanna be a human being 
Hold me now, we all know what I'm fearing 
I think I see the light, am I disappearing?

The idiots and actually the minority 
That I'm wasted, that I'm strung out 
They all should be wondering why the hell I'm not 
 
I'm gonna speak my truth, I think I'm losing it 
Feel kinda liberated, just a little bit 
And I'm a Big Mac short of a happy meal 
Not sure what to say or how to feel 
 
Checking into Hotel Crazy, leaving all my bags in lobby 
The velvet stairs don't make a sound as we're heading up to higher ground 
 
Holding onto something that's gone in the wind 
Holding onto something that's gone in the wind 
 
I've got the right to vote, and I can reproduce 
And I can tell a lie, just like I tell the truth 
I have crazy thoughts, I do crazy deeds 
I have special times, for my special needs 
 
I present myself as a normal dude 
Look you in the eye when I talk to you 
Just a touch of the old socio 
Is it empathy I guess I'll never know 
 
It's sensational, I really only care about me 
And if it's the end of the road, I want a new road 
And the only thing they should be checking out is my ass 
 
Checking into Hotel Crazy, leaving all my bags in lobby 
The velvet stairs don't make a sound as we're heading up to higher ground 
 
Checking into Hotel Crazy, do disturb me 
Gonna make you mad, gonna make you sad, gonna make you wanna be here 
 
Holding onto something that's gone in the wind 
Holding onto something that's gone in the wind 
Holding onto something that's gone in the wind 
Holding onto something that's gone in the wind

Why you feel weird 
 
One day you're gonna be told about 
How daddy let his demons out 
Yeah, he made them scream and shout 
 
One day soon you'll be old enough 
You'll go out on your own and stuff 
If you start losing hold of love, it's because 
 
Your uncle sells drugs 
Your cousin is a cutter 
Your grandma is a fluffer 
Your granddad's in the gutter 
Your mother is a nutter 
Your mother is a nutter 
We are mad motherfuckers 
Sure, you're a bad motherfucker 
 
And I'd like to sing a song that says that you'll be fine 
But now you know me, so you know that I'd be lying 
One of the things you get from me and your mother 
Is that we're bad motherfuckers, sure, you're a bad motherfucker 
 
Helps to know where you come from 
When days are hard, and things go wrong 
I pray our weakness makes you strong 
 
Well, strangers come and lovers leave 
You can rest assured we'll always be 
Your ever-loving family 
 
So before you leave when you're old enough 
When you go out on your own and stuff 
You start losing hold of love, it's because

Ease into the rhythm when I hear that sound 
My momma taught me and I do not back down 
 
Hey pretty woman, I love the way you move 
Winding down low to that baseline groove 
The way you're dancing got me in the mood 
Daddy told me it's what grown folks do 
 
Let me tell ya now 
Hey pretty woman Imma testify 
Hey pretty woman make a grown man cry 
 
You can make me beg 
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar) 
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna 
The way you move your legs 
Well, it just ain't proper 
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma? 
 
Hey pretty woman, come and hold my hand 
Dance the Charleston to that old swing band 
I know that it's getting late but you don't mind 
Let's take a taxi and get back to mine 
 
Hey pretty woman, your daddy don't know 
Take what you want from me, I can't say no 
Just put your hands on my body, let me taste your lips 
I put my hands on your body, baby, work those hips 
 
You can make me beg 
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar) 
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna

You are the only one I'm thinking of 
Hey pretty woman, if you feel the same 
Just say "Hey there, boy, bring that beat back again"

All that I can hear is your echo 
If I heard what you've been saying 
Then you know it isn't right 
There's always something I'm not doing 
That won't keep you satisfied 
Let's get it on, and on, and on, and on 
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y 
 
So you wanna find a real man? 
Make him fall in love? 
No matter how thick your skin is 
Never thick enough 
Someone that you can lean on 
When times are tough 
Maybe there's a reason 
 
Girl, I don't know why you get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive (When I touch it) 
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive (And you love it, yeah) 
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive 
Sometimes I wonder 'cause 
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y 
 
Just finding reasons 
That I can make you happy, happy 
Just finding reasons 
That I can make you happy at all 
 
Girl, I don't know why you get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive (When I touch it) 
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive (And you love it, yeah) 
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive 
Sometimes I wonder 'cause

Oh, I've been shaking

She says that she's never afraid 
Just picture everybody naked 
She really doesn't like to wait

Give me something 
I could take to ease my mind slowly 
Just have a drink 
And you'll feel better 
Just take her home 
And you'll feel better 
Keep telling me that it gets better 
Does it ever? 
Help me 
It's like the walls are caving in

No medicine is strong enough 
Someone help me 
I'm crawling in my skin 
Sometimes I feel like giving up

It isn't in my blood 
It isn't in my blood 
Looking through my phone again feeling anxious 
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this 
I'm trying to find a way to chill 
can't breathe, oh

Your words cut deeper than a knife 
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life 
Got a feeling that I'm going under 
But I know that I'll make it out alive 
If I quit calling you my lover 
Move on 
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe 
Shaking, falling onto my knees 
And now that I'm without your kisses 
I'll be needing stitches 
Tripping over myself 
Aching begging you to come help 
And now that I'm without your kisses 
I'll be needing stitches 
Just like a moth drawn to a flame 
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain 
Your bitter heart cold to the touch 
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow 
I'm left seeing red on my own 
Got a feeling that I'm going under

Why you gotta get my hopes up? 
You said that you were staying over 
But then I woke up to the cold air 
How could you make me believe 
That there was something in between you and me? Yeah 
I look around and I don't see you 
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
You didn't leave your number for me 
Left me without a warning, baby 
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
And I thought you really felt this 
When we were talking about breakfast 
You made it seem like we connected 
I guess I just didn't expect this 
How could you make me believe 
That there was something in between you and me? Yeah 
I look around and I don't see you 
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
You didn't leave your number for me 
Left me without a warning, baby 
I said, where were you in the morning, baby? 
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
(Where were, where were you?) 
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
(Where were, where were you?) 
And I hope you had a good reason 
'Cause I know you had a good time 
And I'm looking up at the ceiling 
And I keep wondering why 
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
(Where were you in the morning?) 
You didn't leave your number for me

Scrolling through my notes 
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah 
Waking up to headlines 
Filled with devastation again 
My heart is broken 
But I keep going 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside 
Now, I know it 
Yeah, I know it 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
It's hard to sleep at night 
Knowing what's outside 
Feeling hopeless 
I need focus 
You hit me with words 
I never heard come out your mouth 
To be honest 
I don't want it, no 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me

It's not that I can't find the words to say

And I don't want to take that away 
How many times can I see your face? 
How many times will you walk away? 
I just have to let you know 
I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame 
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same 
And I have to be honest with you baby 
Tell me If I'm wrong, and this is crazy 
But I got you this rose 
And I need to know 
Will you let it die or let it grow? 
Die or let it grow? 
It's not that I don't care about the love you have 
It's not that I don't want to see you smile 
But there's no way that he can feel the same 
Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild 
How many times can I see your face?

We want each other, no one will break first 
So many nights, trying to find someone new 
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know 
When people ask about us, now 
we just brush it off 
I don't know why we act 
like it means nothing at all 
I wish that I could tell you 
that you're all that I want, yeah 
I pretend that I'm not ready 
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
And you say hi like you just met me 
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe 
Can't help but think every song's about me 
And every line, every word that I write 
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh 
Don't want to ask about it 'cause you might brush it off 
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all 
I don't know why I won't admit 
that you're all I want 
I pretend that I'm not ready 
Why do we put each other through hell?

All the stars in the sky can see 
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Can't believe the places that you take me

Nobody gets too close 
A sight of a soul when it's breaking 
Making my heart grow cold 
And the deeper she's sinking, I'm begging her

She's got a bad raputation 
She's all that

Every morning is the same 
You walk on by my house 
I wanna call out your name 
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are 
From where I'm standing 
You got me thinking 
What we could because 
I keep craving, craving 
You don't know it but it's true 
Can't get my mouth to say the words 
They wanna say to you 
This is typical of love 
Can't wait anymore 
Won't wait I need to tell you 
How I feel 
When I see us together, forever 
in my dreams 
You're with me 
We'll be everything I want us to be 
In front there, who knows? 
Maybe this will be the night 
That we kissed 
For the first time 
Or is that just me 
And my imagination? 
We walk 
We laugh and spend our time 
Walking by the ocean side 
Our hands are gently intertwined 
A feeling I just can't describe 
All this time it's been too long 
Thinking we cannot belong 
To something so damn beautiful 
So damn beautiful 
I keep craving, craving 
You don't know it but it's true 
Can't get my mouth to say the words 
They wanna say to you 
This is typical of love 
Can't wait anymore 
Won't wait, I need to tell you 
How I feel 
When I see us together, forever 
in my dreams 
You're with me 
We'll be everything I want us to be 
In front there, who knows? 
Maybe this will be the night 
That we kissed 
For the first time 
Or is that just me

Imagination, imagination 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
In my dreams 
You're with me 
We'll be everything I want us to be 
In front there, who knows? 
Maybe this will be the night

But being and feeling alone was too much to face 
Though everyone said that she was so strong 
What they didn't know was that she could barely carry on

Sometimes it all gets a little too much 
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up 
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same 
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much 
She would always tell herself she could do this 
She would use no help it would be just fine 
But when it got hard she would lose her focus 
So take my hand and it will be alright 
And she knew that she would be okay

He's walking around 
like he's number one 
Went downtown 
and you got him a gun 
So don't you shoot that thing at me 
Don't you shoot that thing at me 
You know that you got my sympathy

Close your eyes, you can't hide 
Try to forget me, but I'm everywhere 
I'm the smell on your sheets 
You weren't ready when you left me there 
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me" 
Yeah, bet it hurts it gets worse, you know nobody 
Said it would be fair, oh

Tryna fix me up but I'm not broken

Told you not to tell me that too quickly 
Take it slow it's not a race 
And you keep on tryna reel me in, but

            <field name="lyrics">Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep 
Dreaming about the things that we could be 
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard 
Sitting, no more counting dollars 
We'll be counting stars 
Yeah we'll be counting stars 
I see this life like a swinging vine 
Swing my heart across the line 
And my face is flashing signs 
Seek it out and you shall find 
Old, but I'm not that old 
Young, but I'm not that bold 
I don't think the world is sold 
I'm just doing what we're told 
I feel something so right 
Doing the wrong thing 
I feel something so wrong 
Doing the right thing 
I could lie, could lie, could lie 
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive 
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep 
Dreaming about the things that we could be 
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard 
Sitting, no more counting dollars 
We'll be counting stars 
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep 
Dreaming about the things that we could be 
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard 
Sitting, no more counting dollars 
We'll be, we'll be counting stars 
I feel the love and I feel it burn 
Down this river, every turn 
Hope is a four-letter word 
Make that money, watch it burn 
Old, but I'm not that old 
Young, but I'm not that bold 
I don't think the world is sold 
I'm just doing what we're told 
I feel something so wrong 
Doing the right thing 
I could lie, could lie, could lie 
Everything that downs me makes me wanna fly 
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep 
Dreaming about the things that we could be

Dreaming about the things that we could be 
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard

Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep 
Thought I didn't need love to be complete 
Guess I didn't know 
That I just got this crazy feeling 
I've been making someone wait for me, for me 
You're all I think about when I'm awake 
Part of every night and every day 
And everything's a mess when you're away 
Now I know 
All of this is good and really old 
I'm having trouble sleeping on my own 
Feeling like a house but not a home 
I want you to know 
That I just got this crazy feeling 
I've been making someone wait for me, for me 
Guess I need a watch to tell the time 
Guess I need the sun to help me shine 
And I really need you in my life 
Now I know 
That you give me this crazy feeling 
And you won't have to wait no more for me, for me

And I do my best to try to do it in style 
Haven't seen you in a while girl 
Our love is on trial (you run wild, you run wild) 
When I call you, you never wanna pick up 
Cause everything that I do is never ever enough 
You only like it when it rains 
And when I'm stuck in the mud 
(You run wild, you run wild, yeah) 
Don't want your love, want your love 
But I just can't get enough 
Don't want your love, want your love 
But I just can't get enough 
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor 
You mess me up, and still I come back for more 
Don't want your love 
I'm not asking for much, I'm just trynna be fair 
This road we're on is going nowhere 
If we keep on running like a couple of kids 
Who just get lost in the woods 
And now they're losing their wits 
I'm overcome with it, this is ridiculous 
How every time we get together, you're the one I miss 
I feel powerless and I don't want to split 
You run wild, you run wild 
Don't want your love, want your love 
But I just can't get enough 
Don't want your love, want your love 
But I just can't get enough 
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor 
You mess me up, and still I come back for more 
Don't want your love 
That's it it's now or never, I can't do this forever 
Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild 
That's it it's now or never, I can't do this forever 
Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild 
Don't want your love, want your love 
But I just can't get enough 
Don't want your love, want your love 
But I just can't get enough 
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor 
You mess me up, and still I come back for more 
Don't want your love, want your love

No blinds in the place where I live 
Daybreak open your eyes 
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night 
Still, we're changing our minds here 
Be yours, be my dear 
So close with you on my lips 
Touch noses, feeling your breath 
Push your heart and pull away, yeah 
Be my summer in a winter day, love 
I can't see one thing wrong 
Between the both of us 
Be mine, be mine, yeah 
Anytime, anytime 
Ooh you know I've been alone for quite a while, 
haven't I 
I thought I knew it all 
Found love but I was wrong 
More times than enough 
But since you came along 
I'm thinking, baby 
You are bringing out a different kind of me 
There's no safety net that's underneath 
I'm free, fallin' all in you 
Fell for men who weren't how they appear 
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here 
We're free, fallin' all in you 
Fast forward a couple years, yeah 
Grown up in the place that we live 
Make love, then we fight 
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night baby 
I guess we can't control 
What's just not up to us 
Be mine, be mine, yeah 
Anytime, anytime 
Ooh you know I've been alone for quite a while, 
haven't I 
I thought I knew it all 
Found love but I was wrong 
More times than enough 
But since you came along

Fell for men who weren't how they appear 
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here 
We're free, fallin' all in you 
Every time I see you, baby, I get lost 
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up 
Every night I'm with you I fall more in love 
Now I'm laying by your side 
Everything feels right since you came along 
I'm thinking, baby 
You, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me 
There's no safety net that's underneath 
I'm free, fallin' all in you 
Fell for men who weren't how they appear 
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here 
We're free, fallin' all in you

            <field name="lyrics">I'm sorry if I seem uninterested 
No I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent 
And truly, I ain't got no business here 
But since my friends are here 
I just came to kick it but really 
I would rather be at home all by myself 
not in this room 
With people 
who don't even care about my well-being 
I don't dance, don't ask 
I don't need a girlfriend 
So you can go back, please 
enjoy your party 
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner 
waiting for this to be over 
With this girl who's hollering 
I can hardly hear 
Over this music I don't listen to 
and I don't wanna get with you 
So tell my friends that I'll be over here 
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh 
I ask myself what am I doing here? 
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here 
And I can't wait 
till we can break up outta here 
Excuse me if I seem a little 
unimpressed with this 
An anti-social pessimist 
but usually I don't mess with this 
And I know you mean only the best 
And your intentions aren't to bother me 
But honestly I'd rather be 
Somewhere with my people 
we just kick it 
And just listen to some music with the message 
like we usually do 
And we'll discuss our big dreams 
How we plan to take over the planet 
So pardon my manners 
I hope you'll understand it 
That I'll be here 
Not there in the kitchen with this girl 
Who's always gossiping about her friends 
So tell them I'll be here 
Right next to this boy who's throwing up 
Cause he can't take 
what's in his cup no more 
Oh God why am I here? 
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh 
I ask myself what am I doing here? 
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here 
And I can't wait 
till we can break up outta here 
Hours later 
congregating next to the refrigerator 
Some girl's talking bout her haters 
She ain't got none 
How did it ever come to this 
I shoulda never come to this 
So holla at me 
I'll be in the car when you're done 
I'm standoffish 
don't want what you're offering 
And I'm done talking 
Awfully sad it had to be this way 
So tell my people 
that I'm ready when their ready 
And I'm standing by the Tv with my beanie low 
Yo I'll be over here 
And I'll be over here 
No I'll be over here 
No I'll be over here</field>

I swear to God to you, there's nobody else 
You're gonna say that I'm lying

Was honest and sincere and that you were different 
And when we kissed I felt like that kid in love, yeah

Look me in the eyes, my lover (he-ey) 
I know what you did last summer 
Tell me where you've been 
I know (x7) (ah-ah) 
(he-ey) 
I know (x7) (ah-ah, ah-ah) 
I didn't mean it, no, 
I didn't mean it, mean it, no 
(ah-ah, he-ey) 
Can't seem to let you go, 
Can't seem to hold you close 
(ah-ah, ah-ah) 
I know 
When she looks me in the eyes 
They don't seem as bright 
No more, no more 
I know 
That she loved me at one time 
Would I promise her that night 
Cross my heart and hope to die 
It's tearing me apart 
(it's tearing me apart) 
She's slipping away 
(I'm slipping away) 
Am I just hanging on to 
All the words she used to say? 
The pictures on her phone 
(the pictures on my phone) 
She's not coming home 
(I'm not coming home) 
Oh, na, na, na, yeah 
I know what you did 
Last summer (ah-ah) 
Just lied to me, 
"there's no other" (he-ey) 
I know what you did last summer 
Tell me where you've been 
I know what you did 
Last summer (ah-ah) 
Look me in the eyes, my lover (he-ey) 
I know what you did last summer 
Tell me where you've been 
I know (x7) 
I know (x7) (no, no, no) 
Can't seem to let you go, 
Can't seem to keep you close 
(hold me close) 
Can't seem to let you go, 
Can't seem to keep you close 
(you know I didn't mean it, though) 
Tell me where you've been lately (x2) 
(just hold me close) 
Tell me where you've been lately (x2) 
(don't, don't, don't, don't let me go) 
Can't seem to keep you close, 
Can't seem to let you go 
(I didn't mean it, though) 
I know you didn't mean it, though (x2) 
(I don't wanna let you go) 
To me you didn't mean it, 
Though (x2) (no, no, no) 
(can't seem to let you go, 
Seem to let you go) 
I know you didn't mean it, though 
(hold me close)

Every morning is the same 
You walk on by my house 
I wanna call out your name 
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are 
From where I'm standing 
You got me thinking 
What we could because 
I keep craving, craving 
You don't know it but it's true 
Can't get my mouth to say the words 
They wanna say to you 
This is typical of love 
Can't wait anymore 
Won't wait I need to tell you 
How I feel 
When I see us together, forever 
in my dreams 
You're with me 
We'll be everything I want us to be 
In front there, who knows? 
Maybe this will be the night 
That we kissed 
For the first time 
Or is that just me 
And my imagination? 
We walk 
We laugh and spend our time 
Walking by the ocean side 
Our hands are gently intertwined 
A feeling I just can't describe 
All this time it's been too long 
Thinking we cannot belong 
To something so damn beautiful 
So damn beautiful 
I keep craving, craving 
You don't know it but it's true 
Can't get my mouth to say the words 
They wanna say to you 
This is typical of love 
Can't wait anymore 
Won't wait, I need to tell you 
How I feel 
When I see us together, forever 
in my dreams 
You're with me 
We'll be everything I want us to be 
In front there, who knows? 
Maybe this will be the night 
That we kissed 
For the first time 
Or is that just me 
And my imagination? 
Imagination, imagination 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
In my dreams 
You're with me 
We'll be everything I want us to be 
In front there, who knows? 
Maybe this will be the night 
That we kissed 
For the first time 
Or is that just me 
And my imagination? 
I keep craving, craving 
You don't know it but it's true 
Can't get my mouth to say the words

It's like the walls are caving in 
Sometimes I feel like giving up 
But, I just can't 
It isn't in my blood 
Laying on the bathroom floor 
Feeling nothing 
I'm overwhelmed and insecure 
Give me something 
I could take to ease my mind slowly 
Just have a drink 
And you'll feel better 
Just take her home 
And you'll feel better 
Keep telling me that it gets better 
Does it ever? 
Help me 
It's like the walls are caving in 
Sometimes I feel like giving up 
No medicine is strong enough 
Someone help me 
I'm crawling in my skin 
Sometimes I feel like giving up 
But I just can't 
It isn't in my blood 
It isn't in my blood 
Looking through my phone again feeling anxious 
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this 
I'm trying to find a way to chill 
can't breathe, oh 
Is there somebody who could 
Help me 
It's like the walls are caving in 
Sometimes I feel like giving up 
No medicine is strong enough 
Someone help me 
I'm crawling in my skin 
Sometimes I feel like giving up 
But I just can't 
it isn't in my blood 
It isn't in my blood 
I need somebody now 
I need somebody now 
Someone to help me out 
I need somebody now

Maybe this is dumb 
But it feels like there was something 
From the moment that we touched 
Cause, it's alright, it's alright 
I wanna make you mine 
The way you're lightin' up the room 
Caught the corner of my eye 
We can both sneak out the back door 
We don't have to say goodbye 
Cause, it's alright, it's alright 
To waste time tonight 
Maybe I'm just a kid in love 
Maybe I'm just a kid in love 
Oh, baby 
If this is what it's like falling in love 
Then I don't ever wanna grow up 
Maybe I'm just a kid in love 
Maybe I'm just a kid in love 
Oh, baby 
It'd be cool if it's the two of us 
But I don't ever wanna grow up 
Cause I got it all, all 
And I got it all 
And I don't ever wanna grow up 
Said your place is kinda cozy 
Your parents are out of town 
Baby, there's no pressure 
But if you're down, I'm down 
Cause, it's alright, it's alright 
To just talk tonight 
But if you're feeling kinda crazy 
Turn down the lights 
We can take our time 
Do whatever you like 
I'ts alright, it's alright 
I wanna make you mine 
Maybe I'm just a kid in love 
Maybe I'm just a kid in love

I'd really like to get to know you 
Start discovering your secrets 
Underneath these very sheets 
Your skin's so perfect up against me 
Your lips are talking when we don't speak 
And I never wanna leave this 
Cause there's so much left to see

I don't wanna share this with anybody else 
I wanna get lost, and I wanna get lost 
We go out to shows but why do we go 
If we're only gonna see it through the screen on our phones? 
If we're all here together then why are we watching alone? 
The world's so much bigger than posing for pictures 
If all that we need's at the tips of our fingers 
Then how did this happen that we all fell so out of touch? 
Hold on, time out, help me

Tell me how it feels cause I know the hardest part 
Is when you're holding something real 
You can see it in the dark 
I'll tell you how it feels and here's the hardest part

I know it's more than just a friendship 
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah 
Do I gotta convince you that you shouldn't fall asleep? 
It'll only be a couple hours 
And I'm about to leave 
Do you got plans tonight? 
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan and I 
And I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight 
‘Cause I can't get you off my mind 
Can't get you off my mind 
Can't get you off my mind 
I can't seem to get you off my mind 
Let's get lost tonight 
Let's get lost tonight 
Baby, you and 
I can't seem to get you off my mind 
Do you got plans tonight? 
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan and I 
And I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight 
‘Cause I can't get you off my mind 
Can't get you off my mind 
Do you got plans tonight? 
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise 
The only thing I'm thinking ‘bout is you and I 
‘Cause I can't get you off my mind 
Can't get you off my mind 
I can't seem to get you off my mind 
Let's get lost tonight 
Let's get lost tonight 
Baby you and… 
I can't seem to get you off my mind 
Let's get lost tonight 
Let's get lost tonight 
Baby you and… 
I can't seem to get you off my mind</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When I wake up to your footsteps 
As you get up out of bed 
They make a song that sounds so simple 
But it dances in my head 
A melody so perfect 
That it gets me through the day 
And the thought of us forever 
Is one that won't ever go away 
All I need to know is where to start 
Take my hand and show me forever 
So, never will I ever let you go 
So let's hold on together 
To this paper and this pen 
And write down every letter 
To every word we've ever said 
All I need to know is where to start 
Take my hand and show me forever 
So never will I ever let you go 
Let's write our story 
And let's sing our song 
Let's hang our pictures on the wall 
All these precious moments 
That we carved in stone 
Are only memories after all 
Memories after all 
Memories after all 
And oh 
You gave me hope 
But I've gotta let go 
I've gotta let go 
Oh woah 
It's taking its soul 
It's deep in my soul 
Now I've gotta let go 
We wrote our story 
And we sang our song 
We hung our pictures on the wall 
Now those precious moments 
That we carved in stone 
Are all the memories after all</field>

Ripping all the skin from off my bones

I want you close, I want you closer 
But when you're here with me 
It's hard to tell just what you're after

My feelings never change 
What do you want from me? 
What do you want? 
I need to know 
If this is mutual 
Before I go 
And get way too involved 
I want you bad 
Can you reciprocate? 
No, I don't want to have to leave 
But half of you is not enough for me 
This inconsistency,what does it mean? 
You got me questioning the way you act 
I take it back, do I mean anything? 
Just tell me honestly 
You say, you want all of me today 
But tomorrow's not the same

Is this a game? 
When you show up late 
Say "love" at 2 am 
Then tell me you can't stay, girl, yeah 
What do you want from me? 
Baby oh, I need to know

Yeah, when I think about you, babe 
We walked in the rain 
A couple blocks to your apartment 
You told me to come inside 
Caught me staring in your eyes

Ah, what you're doing to me

I clowned it 
Then who's the joker? 
I guess I'm it 
'cause I let it right go when I found it 
Time has never been my best suit 
Now I've got everything except you 
You moved out of my heart, still got the bruise 
I'd give it all back to be next to you 
I turn my radio up and it's just my luck 
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh me? 
I turn my tv on, it's the same old song 
Why are you following me? 
It's like a "missing you" sign 
Is written on my face 
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh? 
It's like everybody knows 
Cause everywhere I go 
The whole world is singing to me 
Cecilia, you're breaking my heart 
You're shaking my confidence daily 
Oh cecilia, I'm down on my knees 
I'm begging you please to come home

I had the girl of my dreams 
And now she's all gone 
Thought that we could last forever 
I was all wrong 
Said the talking was cheap and now I'm flat broke 
She don't even wanna see my face anymore 
She don't wanna say 
Where she's gone away 
But she's on replay 
In my, in my brain 
I'll do what it takes 
Any time and place 
We can turn a breakup into an outbreak 
I turn my radio up and it's just my luck 
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh me? 
I turn my tv on it's the same old song

Although we're many miles apart but I still feel her 
There'll never be another one like my cecilia 
Oh where, oh where could she be? 
Does she still care about me? 
When will she finally come back to, come back to me? 
Cecilia, you're breaking my heart 
You're shaking my confidence daily

Call you up 'cause the time is wasted 
Let's drive, we got nowhere to go 
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle 
Think fast, move quick, don't stumble 
We can't do this alone 
Where do we go? We don't know 
Follow the wind where it blows 
Let's make mistakes and don't look back 
It's now or never 
One of those nights we felt invincible 
And every glass was full, one of those nights 
One of those nights, dancing in the stars 
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights 
We're young, live with no fear 
Kids running wild 
Girls crying dove tears 
We don't have this time for long 
Yeah, we make big plans 
Spending all our change 
Cut up in the night, oh we missed the last train 
It' our time and we're leaving home 
Where do we go? We don't know 
Follow the wind where it blows 
Let's make mistakes and don't look back 
It's now or never 
One of those nights we felt invincible 
And every glass was full, one of those nights 
One of those nights, dancing in the stars 
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights 
Wanna hold on tight to a little of this 
Come now you don't want to miss 
Time of our lives, one of those nights 
Wanna hold on tight to a little of this 
Come now you don't want to miss 
Time of our lives, one of those nights 
Go home it's over, but it's not the end 
Don't wait 'til you're older to begin 
Keep your composure and innocence 
Where do we go? We don't know 
One of those nights, we're driving around 
And it's pouring us down 
One of those nights 
Wanna hold on tight to a little of this 
Come now you don't want to miss 
Time of our lives, one of those nights 
One of those nights we felt invincible 
And every glass was full, one of those nights 
One of those nights, dancing in the stars 
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights 
Wanna hold on tight to a little of this 
Come now you don't want to miss 
Time of our lives, one of those nights 
One of those nights, where she turns those lights down 
And it's only us now

Lately we're as good as gone 
Oh, our love is drunk and is 
Singing me my favorite song 
Me and you 
We were meant to break 
I know that it's true 
But it's much too late 
You're perfectly wrong for me 
And that's why it's so hard to leave 
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me 
You're perfectly wrong for me 
All the stars in the sky can see 
Why you're perfectly wrong for me 
Oh, you know how much it hurts 
Every time you say you hate me 
But when we're making love, you make it worth it 
Can't believe the places that you take me 
There's no use 
We were meant to break 
I know that it's truth 
And it's much too late 
You're perfectly wrong for me 
And that's why it's so hard to leave 
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me 
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me 
All the stars in the sky can see 
Why you're perfectly wrong for me 
Oh and why can't I quit 
When you break my heart open 
I need you more than I know 
Oh and I can't resist 
When you're up against my skin 
I never wanted let you go 
You're perfectly wrong for me 
And that's why it's so hard for me 
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mhm 
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me 
Yeah, but you know that I won't leave 
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, oh 
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me 
And that's why it's so hard for me 
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, yeah 
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me 
Yeah, but you know that I won't leave 
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me 
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me</field>

Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip 
Out the window of the benzo 
We get seen in the rent' 
And I'm like: Woah, see my neck so godamn cold 
Diamonds wet my t-shirt soaked

It's not that I can't find the words to say 
But when she's with him, she seems happier 
And I don't want to take that away 
How many times can I see your face? 
How many times will you walk away? 
I just have to let you know 
I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame 
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same 
And I have to be honest with you baby 
Tell me If I'm wrong, and this is crazy 
But I got you this rose 
And I need to know 
Will you let it die or let it grow? 
Die or let it grow? 
It's not that I don't care about the love you have 
It's not that I don't want to see you smile 
But there's no way that he can feel the same 
Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild 
How many times can I see your face? 
How many times will you walk away?

You can tell me stop if you already know 
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it 
But the look on your face says don't let me go

To end this darling, oh 
And I know you'll find someone who 
Gives you the time I didn't give to you 
I'm running low 
I'm sorry, but I have to go 
And maybe I will never feel 
You gave me something so real 
I'm running low 
I'm sorry, but I have to go 
Thinking back to every night 
That we just laid there for a while 
And when I looked into your eyes 
I never thought I'd say goodbye 
Just know it takes it from me 
To end this darling, oh 
And I know you'll find someone who 
Gives you the time I didn't give to you

Just needed time to, to find my own 
But I promise someone will give you all you want 
Can give you all you need 
And you just gotta see 
I never meant to hurt you, no 
And I know you'll find someone who 
Gives you the time I didn't give to you

But don't move, honey 
Because looks so perfect standing there 
In my American Apparel underwear 
And I know now, that I'm so down 
Your lipstick stain is a work of art 
I've got your name tattooed in an arrow heart 
And I know now, that I'm so down 
Hey Hey Hey 
Let's get out, let's get out 
Cuz It's deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down 
While I was out 
I found myself alone just thinking 
If I showed up with a plane ticket 
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it 
Would you wanna run away too? 
Cuz' all I really want is you 
She looks so perfect standing there 
In my American Apparel underwear 
And I know now, that I'm so down 
I made a mixtape straight out of '94 
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor 
And I know now, that I'm so down

Fly through the sky in my Superman cape 
Watch me walk across this wire 
Tip toe through the coals of a blazing fire 
Watch me fly this kite in the rain 
I'll jump rope with my ball and chain 
Come by and knock on my house of cards 
If it falls I'll rebuild it from the start 
I won't listen to you

Makes me feel like I can't live without you 
It takes me all the way 
I want you to stay 
It's not much of a life you're living 
It's not just something you take, it's given 
Round and around and around and around we go

Ohh, 'cause I need this hole gone 
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving 
'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving

Your words cut deeper than a knife

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain 
Your bitter heart cold to the touch 
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow 
I'm left seeing red on my own

We were holding hands standing toe to toe 
And it felt like an eternity 
Said it felt like an eternity 
'Cause I knew back then we were more than friends 
Two sides of the story, it all depends 
And I'll say it once and I'll say it again 
It'll only end up hurting me 
Years flew by, was less than twelve 
Long division, I need your help 
Can you come on over and work with me? 
Any time you like and make it work for me 
Cause I knew back when if I get you close 
When the times is right maybe I'll propose 
Baby climb up, show me the ropes 
Darling, I want all the strings attached 
I love it when you look at me like that 
And you're the only girl that brings me back 
'Cause, baby, I want all the strings attached 
It's like always and forever 
I won't let the moment pass 
And when I'm with you I feel better 
I want all the strings, all the strings attached 
All the strings attached girl 
All the strings attached girl 
So come on girl let me hold your hand 
Let's go get lost, leave without a plan 
And I know you got the world to see 
But you know you mean the world to me 
And I know right now you got second thoughts 
Do whatever it takes, babe, whatever the cost, yeah 
You know me, not the type of guy 
To sneak around, to do the time 
But you must have me hypnotised 
I'm dead-dead-dead down to be by your side 
Every night 
Darling, I want all the strings attached 
I love it when you look at me like that 
And you're the only girl that brings me back 
'Cause, baby, I want all the strings attached 
It's like always and forever 
I won't let the moment pass 
And when I'm with you I feel better 
I want all the strings 
And baby when you fall down, I'll fall too 
And if you get lost, then I'll get lost with you 
And when the waves crash down 
Then baby I won't move, cause I 
Need all the strings attached 
I love it when you look at me like that 
And you're the only girl that brings me back 
'Cause, baby, I want all the strings attached 
It's like always and forever 
I won't let the moment pass 
And when I'm with you I feel better 
I want all the strings, all the strings attached 
All the strings attached girl

And day by day 
Playing tough is hard enough 
When the sun is out 
Tougher, in rain 
Oh, your touch 
Stringing little pieces of me into us 
Giving me the reason to give all my love 
Making it okay to let go 
When I was little I was so sure of myself 
Yeah, I knew so little but I felt with every cell 
And as I grow older my faith grows old as well 
Yeah, when I was little I was so sure of myself 
Sure of myself (self) 
Sure of myself (self) 
Sure of myself (self) 
Sure of myself (self) 
And if I've lost my way (how am I still here) 
Still standing straight (how am I still here) 
I'm looking up to find I'm tough 
When the sun goes down 
And I feel the change 
Oh, your touch 
Stringing little pieces of me into us 
Giving me the reason to give all my love 
Making it okay to let go 
When I was little I was so sure of myself 
Yeah, I knew so little but I felt with every cell 
And as I grow older my faith grows old as well

I want the world in my hands 
I hate the beach 
But I stand in california with my toes in the sand 
Use the sleeves of my sweater 
Lets have an adventure 
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered 
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours 
You in those little high waisted shorts 
Oh 
She knows what I think about 
And what I think about 
One love, two mouths 
One love, one house 
No shirts, no blouse 
Just us, you find out 
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no 
Cause it's too cold whoa 
For you here 
And now 
So let me hold whoa 
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater 
And if I may just take your breath away 
I don't mind if there's not much to say 
Sometimes the silence guides your mind 
So move to a place so far away 
The goose bumps start to raise 
The minute that my left hand meets your waist 
And then I watched your face 
Put my finger on your tongue 
Cause you love to taste, yeah 
These hearts adore 
Everyone the other beats hardest for 
Inside this place is warm 
Outside it starts to pour 
Coming down 
One love, two mouths 
One love, one house 
No shirts, no blouse 
Just us, you find out 
Nothing I really wanna tell you about 
No no no 
Cause it's too cold whoa

With the kid I grew up with

But you want me to stay 
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away 
And when you try to take me back 
My heavy heart just breaks 
No I can't lift the weight 
Put you in the past, try to forget you cause it's over 
And every time you ask I'll pretend I'm okay 
You're inside my head 
In the middle of the night when I don't feel right 
I dream I can hold you 
And I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah 
You tell me you were happier with him 
But you want me to stay 
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away 
And when you try to take me back

But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight 
And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't life the weight

And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't life the weight 
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks 
And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't lift the weight

We'll just talk about our day 
To try to fill the awkward space tonight 
We'll play the songs we used to love 
While we try to fall in love again 
We don't know who's wrong or right 
We don't even care enough to fight 
We're going through the motions

No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words 
Though we're still talking everyday 
I'm running out of things to say to ya 
What's really gonna break my heart 
Is to have to tell your little brother 
It might be easier to stay 
But it'll never be the same, no ohh no 
And if something doesn't change 
Then we'll keep on sinking further

I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belong 
And every time I ask myself 
Am I turnin' into someone else? 
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am 
I really wanna understand 
I just wanna understand 
I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah 
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them 
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to

I just gotta understand 
I just need to, I need to understand 
I really wanna understand 
Oh, who I am 
You wake up, your whole world's flipped 
It's just different, and you gotta 
You know, you just gotta go with it 
That's just simply growing up 
And not seeing it in a negative way 
And if they see it as if it's been given to you 
I mean, as much as times can be crazy 
You're gonna feel 
Like that's where you're supposed to be 
You're not gonna feel out of place anymore 
You're gonna feel like that's where you were meant to be 
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time 
You just let it go and grow with it 
And you can't hold on to the old you 
Or the old this, or the old that 
Because you change 
And not changing in a bad way 
Just changing because that's what happens in life 
You grow up 
Everyone moves on 
You're just learning 
You stay true to yourself 
Changing isn't a bad thing, it never was 
But at the end of the day, you know 
You're the same person 
And where your heart is 
That doesn't change 
And every time I ask myself 
Am I turnin' into someone else? 
I pray to God that I'm just who I am 
I really wanna understand 
I just wanna understand 
I just need to understand

            <field name="lyrics">You said: I wanna get to know ya 
Why you gotta get my hopes up? 
You said that you were staying over 
But then I woke up to the cold air 
How could you make me believe 
That there was something in between you and me? Yeah 
I look around and I don't see you 
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
You didn't leave your number for me 
Left me without a warning, baby 
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
And I thought you really felt this 
When we were talking about breakfast 
You made it seem like we connected 
I guess I just didn't expect this 
How could you make me believe 
That there was something in between you and me? Yeah 
I look around and I don't see you 
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
You didn't leave your number for me 
Left me without a warning, baby 
I said, where were you in the morning, baby? 
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
(Where were, where were you?) 
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
(Where were, where were you?) 
And I hope you had a good reason 
'Cause I know you had a good time 
And I'm looking up at the ceiling 
And I keep wondering why 
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
(Where were you in the morning?) 
You didn't leave your number for me 
(You didn't leave your number) 
Left me without a warning, babe 
(Left me without a warning) 
I said, where were you in the morning, baby? 
(Where were you in the morning?) 
How do you, how do you just walk away?

            <field name="lyrics">I know a girl, she's like a curse 
We want each other, no one will break first 
So many nights, trying to find someone new 
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know 
When people ask about us, now 
we just brush it off 
I don't know why we act 
like it means nothing at all 
I wish that I could tell you 
that you're all that I want, yeah 
I pretend that I'm not ready 
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
And you say hi like you just met me 
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe 
Can't help but think every song's about me 
And every line, every word that I write 
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh 
Don't want to ask about it 'cause you might brush it off 
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all 
I don't know why I won't admit 
that you're all I want 
I pretend that I'm not ready 
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
And you say hi like you just met me 
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
I pretend that I'm not ready 
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
And you say hi like you just met me 
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

            <field name="lyrics">Here I am, stuck on this couch 
Scrolling through my notes 
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah 
Waking up to headlines 
Filled with devastation again 
My heart is broken 
But I keep going 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside 
Now, I know it 
Yeah, I know it 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
It's hard to sleep at night 
Knowing what's outside 
Feeling hopeless 
I need focus 
You hit me with words 
I never heard come out your mouth 
To be honest 
I don't want it, no 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break

You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away

Like it doesn't exist 
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night 
Feel my tears as they dry 
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier 
From the chandelier 
And I'm holding on for dear life 
Won't look down, won't open my eyes 
Keep my glass full until morning light 
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight 
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life 
Won't look down won't open my eyes

I'm talking loud not saying much

Fire away, fire away 
Ricochets, you take your aim 
Fire away, fire away 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium 
Cut me down 
But it's you who'll have further to fall 
Ghost town, haunted love 
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones 
I'm talking loud not saying much 
I'm bullet proof, nothing to lose 
Fire away, fire away 
Ricochets, you take your aim 
Fire away, fire away 
You shoot me down but I won't fall

You shoot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

Stone hard, machine gun 
Firing at the ones who run 
Stone hard, as bulletproof glass

Oh why can I not conquer love 
And I might have thought that we were one 
Wanted to fight this war without weapons 
And I wanted it I wanted it bad 
But there were so many red flags 
Now another one bites the dust 
Yeah let's be clear I'll trust no one 
You did not break me 
I'm still fighting for peace 
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart 
But your blade it might be too sharp 
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard 
I may snap and I move fast 
But you won't see me fall apart 
Cause I've got an elastic heart 
I've got an elastic heart 
I've got an elastic heart 
And I will stay up through the night 
Let's be clear won't close my eyes 
And I know that I can survive 
I'll walk through fire to save my life 
And I want it I want my life so bad 
I'm doing everything I can 
Then another one bites the dust 
It's hard to lose a chosen one 
You did not break me 
I'm still fighting for peace

You held me down 
I struggle to fly now

We hold on so tight, we cannot deny 
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive 
Yes, there's a scream inside we all try to hide 
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
And I don't care if I sing off key 
I find myself in my melodies 
I sing for love, I sing for me 
I'll shout it out like a bird set free 
No I don't care if I sing off key

No time for love, no time for hate 
No drama, no time for games 
Tough girl whose soul aches 
I'm at home on my own 
Check my phone 
Nothing, though 
Act busy, order in 
Pay TV, it's agony 
I may cry, ruining my makeup 
Wash away all the things you've taken 
And I don't care if I don't look pretty 
Big girls cry 
When their hearts are breaking 
Big girls cry 
When their hearts are breaking 
Big girls cry 
When their heart is breaking 
Tough girl, I'm in pain 
It's lonely at the dark 
Black outs and airplanes 
I still pour you a glass of champagne 
A tough girl 
Whose soul aches 
I'm at home on my own 
Check my phone 
Nothing, though 
Act busy, order in 
Pay TV, it's agony 
I may cry, ruining my makeup 
Wash away all the things you've taken 
And I don't care if I don't look pretty

I wake up alone

Wash away all the things you've taken

I grew up overnight 
I played alone 
I played on my own 
I survived 
I wanted everything I never had 
Like the love that comes with light 
I wore envy and I hated that 
But I survived 
I had a one way ticket to a place where all the demons go 
Where the wind don't change 
And nothing in the ground can ever grow 
No hope, just lies 
And you're taught to cry into your pillow 
But I survived 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I found solace in the strangest place 
Way in the back of my mind 
I saw my life in a stranger's face 
And it was mine 
I had a one way ticket to a place where all the demons go 
Where the wind don't change 
And nothing in the ground can ever grow 
No hope, just lies 
And you're taught to cry into your pillow 
But I survived 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
You took it all, but I'm still breathing 
You took it all, but I'm still breathing 
You took it all, but I'm still breathing 
You took it all, but I'm still breathing 
You took it all, but I'm still breathing 
You took it all, but I'm still breathing 
You took it all, but I'm still breathing 
You took it all, but I'm still breathing 
I have made every single mistake 
That you could ever possibly make 
I took and I took and I took what you gave 
But you never noticed that I was in pain 
I knew what I wanted; I went out and got it 
Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't 
I told you that I would never be forgotten 
And all in spite of you 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing) 
(You took it out, but I'm still breathing) 
I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing) 
(You took it out, but I'm still breathing) 
I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing) 
(You took it out, but I'm still breathing)

Your love lifts me up like helium 
Your love lifts me up 
When I'm down down down 
When I've hit the ground 
You're all I need 
And if you let go 
I'll float towards the sun 
I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up 
But when the fear comes 
And I drift towards the ground 
I am lucky that you're around

You lift me up before I hit the ground!

Hurt me 
There's two of us 
We're bristling with desire 
The pleasure's pain and fire 
Burn me 
So come on 
I'll take you on, take you on 
I ache for love ache for us 
Why don't you come 
Don't you come a little closer 
So come on now 
Strike the match, strike the match now 
We're a perfect match, perfect somehow 
We were meant for one another 
Come a little closer 
Flame you came to me 
Fire meet gasoline 
Fire meet gasoline 
I'm burning alive 
I can barely breathe 
When you're here loving me

You got it in every way 
and can't you see it's you I am watchin' 
I am hot for you in every way 
And turn around, let me see you 
Wanna free you with my rhythm 
I know you can't get enough 
When I turn up with my rhythm 
Your body's poetry, speak to me 
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight? 
Move your body, move your body 
I wanna be your muse, use my music 
And let me be your rhythm tonight

Poetry in your body 
Got me started, it'll never end 
Feel my rhythm in your system 
This is heaven, I'm your only friend 
Feel the beat in your chest 
Beat your chest like an animal 
Free the beast from its cage 
Free the rage like an animal

Some see crazy where I see love 
You fall so low but shoot so high 
Big dreamers shoot for open sky 
So much life in those open eyes 
So much depth, you look for the light 
But when your wounds open, you will cry 
You'll cry out now and you'll question why 
I can see a rainbow 
In your tears as they fall on down 
I can see your soul grow 
Through the pain as they hit the ground 
I can see a rainbow 
In your tears as the sun comes out 
As the sun comes out 
I am here and I see your pain 
Through the storms, through the clouds, the rain 
I'm telling you you cannot escape 
You can do it, just feel, baby 
I can see a rainbow 
In your tears as they fall on down 
I can see your soul grow 
Through the pain as they hit the ground 
I can see a rainbow 
In your tears as the sun comes out 
As the sun comes out 
Here comes the sun 
Smiling down 
Here comes the sun 
Smiling down 
Here comes the sun 
Smiling down 
Smiling down 
I can see a rainbow 
In your tears as they fall on down 
I can see your soul grow 
Through the pain as they hit the ground 
I can see a rainbow

‘cos I'm still here 
I'm winning the war now 
I'm winning it all now 
Watch tears while they fall down 
I'm winning the war now 
I win against ego 
Cast light on the shadow's long 
I'm winning from ego 
I'm lighting the long way home 
Oh the past it haunted me

Singing to the moon, set it free

Singing to the spirit above 
Sing your heart out with all of your love

Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found 
Well it's been rough but we'll be just fine 
Work it out, yeah, we'll survive

And together we'll work out on the escalator 
I will time you as you run up the down 
And you'll measure my footsteps as I blow through this town 
The mean of our heights is divided by the nights 
Which is times'd by the daggers and the route of all our fights, 
The pass of your poem is to swathe me in your knowing 
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it 
Oh, academia, you can't pick me up 
Soothe me with your words when I need your love 
I am a dash and you are a dot 
When will you see that I am all that you've got? 
I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago 
But to you I'm just a novel that you wish you'd never wrote 
I'm greater than x and lesser than y, so why is it 
that I still can't catch your eye? 
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard 
While I sit here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt 
Oh academia you can't pick me up 
Soothe me with your words when I need your love 
You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion 
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on 
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs 
It appears to me the pen has over analysed again 
And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one 
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one 
And if you are a number you're infinity plus one 
And if I am four words then I am needing of your love 
Oh, academia, you can't pick me up 
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

I grew up overnight 
I played alone 
I played on my own 
I survived 
I wanted everything I never had 
Like the love that comes with light 
I wore envy and I hated that 
But I survived 
I had a one way ticket to a place where all the demons go 
Where the wind don't change 
And nothing in the ground can ever grow 
No hope, just lies 
And you're taught to cry into your pillow 
But I survived 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I found solace in the strangest place 
Way in the back of my mind 
I saw my life in a stranger's face 
And it was mine 
I had a one way ticket to a place where all the demons go 
Where the wind don't change 
And nothing in the ground can ever grow 
No hope, just lies

I have made every single mistake 
That you could ever possibly make 
I took and I took and I took what you gave 
But you never noticed that I was in pain 
I knew what I wanted; I went out and got it 
Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't 
I told you that I would never be forgotten 
And all in spite of you 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing 
I'm still breathing

I see your infinite and I 
I see your definite 
You push that shapeshifting smile 
And as your defense falls 
Like your castle walls 
It comes crashing down 
It comes crashing down 
But I heal you 
You don't want love anymore 
But you're drowning, oh 
And I feel you 
You shut love out evermore 
Peace surrounds you, oh

Effortlessly shining, beautiful calm driving

This is the best time to be young and then reborn 
Live like we're gonna die 
Do things we've never done before 
This is the high life, the high life 
No we won't say no 
Beautiful people say go go go 
Beautiful people don't stress stress stress 
They never rest 
Beautiful people say yes 
No we won't say no

So come come come with me 
Let's push on 'til the break of dawn 
I love to party 
And when I'm with you give me some 
I've got the view you see 
Ready set go I drop the bomb 
This is the high life

Oh little girl, there's enough love in this circle, 
You can shackle yourself or be free from this pain

Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing 
You'd worn me down 
I struggled on the ground 
So lost, the line had been crossed 
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk 
You held me down 
I struggle to fly now 
But there's a scream inside we all try to hide 
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny 
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive 
Yes, there's a scream inside we all try to hide 
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die 
And I don't care if I sing off key 
I find myself in my melodies 
I sing for love, I sing for me 
I'll shout it out like a bird set free 
No I don't care if I sing off key 
I find myself in my melodies 
I sing for love, I sing for me 
I'll shout it out like a bird set free 
I'll shout it out like a bird set free 
I'll shout it out like a bird set free 
Now I fly, hit the high notes 
I have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight 
You held me down 
But I fought back loud 
But there's a scream inside we all try to hide 
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny 
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive 
Yes, there's a scream inside we all try to hide 
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no 
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

Black and blue, I'm begging you 
Take me in, I'm surrendering 
Black and blue, but if I'm with you 
If I'm with you, I'll live to fight althrough 
I'll let go, walking into the unknown 
If I surrender, if I lay my arms down

Am I a fighter?

Stuck in a black hole and nothing matters

Why have I, I become paralyzed? 
I can not explain it 
Afraid of the light bringing me to life 
Cause you kicked the door in 
I'm staring into the sun 
You leave me so blinded by love 
Then in you run you drag me out of the dark 
I'm staring into the sun 
Yes, then you come, you got me trusting in love 
You got me blinded by love 
You got me blinded by love 
You got me blinded by love 
Once a cactus and now I am a blooming flower 
See you coaxed me out and you gave me back my power 
And no one can change me, I am a damaged dollar 
I can not get over, they go, I can not follow

I'll strip your bare 'till the truth comes out

And I know it can't be wrong, yeah 
Bring Night! 
Bring the night on! 
'Cuz all that we are after 
Is a little bit of fun 
Chase your shadow 'til the sun goes down 
Chase your shadow 'til the sun goes down 
Bring Night! 
Bring the night on! 
Bring me the moon and stars 
And send away the sun 
Bring Night! 
Bring the night on! 
Or maybe if I'm lucky 
I'll end up in your arms 
Chase your shadow 'til the sun goes down! 
Chase your shadow 'til the sun goes down! 
Chase your shadow 'til the sun goes down! 
Chase your shadow 'til the sun goes down! 
Chase your shadow 'til the sun goes down! 
Chase your shadow 'til the sun goes down! 
Bring Night! Bring the night on!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I'm a Broken Biscuit 
From the cookie jar 
I'm a total misfit 
In the puzzle that's so far 
Careful not to crush me 
In those hungry hands 
Careful not to rush me 
Into this fine romance 
I stand under the weight of your words 
Hoping you won't find me 
I'm terrified of everything I've heard 
Don't swallow 
I'm a damaged dollar 
That no one wants to change 
I'm a bunch of flowers 
That need to be arranged 
Careful what you wish for 
Careful what you say 
I've lowered all my armor 
Risking the pain again 
I stand under the weight of your words 
Hoping you won't find me 
I'm terrified of everything I've heard 
Don't swallow 
I'm standing on the edge of your words 
That is where you'll find me 
I'm paralyzed by all the things that hurt 
But I'm coming 
I stand under the weight of your words 
Hoping you won't find me 
I'm terrified of everything I've heard 
Don't swallow 
I'm standing on the edge of your words 
Standing on the edge of your words 
I'm paralyzed by all the things that hurt 
But I'm coming</field>

I don't wanna fight anymore 
Rough seas will be calm 
I'm home while we weather the storm 
We fall down like dogs playing dead 
Well our love's not worth playing chicken with 
I'm not discarding you like broken glass 
There are no winners when the die is cast 
There's only tears when it's the final dance 
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance 
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance 
This too shall past 
We're right where we're meant to be 
There's things I don't ask 
What I don't know can't hurt me 
We fall down like dogs playing dead 
Well our love's not worth playing chicken with

Swelling up with rain 
That is desperate to be let out 
And I know it's a heavy load 
Carrying those tears around 
Carrying those fears around 
Worry makes the world go round 
You're twisted up like a slipknot 
Tied by a juicehead 
Who just took his t shot, and I know 
There's a hungry dog tugging at your frayed ends 
But he's just playing with you 
He just wants to be your friend 
So don't worry, don't worry 
I'm here by your side 
By your side, by your side 
We're letting go tonight! 
Yesterday is gone and you will be ok 
Place your past in to a book, burn the pages 
Let 'em cook oh 
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today 
Place your past in to a book, burn the pages 
Let em cook 
Eyes stinging from the black smoke 
New hope 
Loose rope, risen from the undertow 
All is well 
We welcome the cry, of the dark night sky 
Swallow me peacefully 
Follow my heart back inside 
So don't worry, don't worry 
I'm here by your side 
By your side, by your side 
We're letting go tonight! 
Yesterday is gone and you will be Ok 
Place your past in to a book, burn the pages

Delivery, a basket filled with pain 
Patience is your virtue, saint o' mine

Without your love tonight 
I'm your groundhog 
And I'm skating on thin ice 
But you see me at your feet and carry me inside 
Can't you see 
I'm wrapped in cellophane 
Watch the blood pump through my veins 
Electricity floods my brain 
Can't hide the pain 
Can't hide the pain 
When you're wrapped in cellophane 
Look at me I'm such a basket case 
While I fall apart 
You'll hide all my pills again 
And all the things I need to hear you say 
You'll watch as all my thoughts 
Get right back on the train 
Can't you see 
I'm wrapped in cellophane 
Watch the blood pump through my veins 
Electricity floods my brain 
Can't hide the pain 
Can't hide the pain

Dirá que soy loco pero que va 
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight 
(I love cheap thrills...) 
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight 
(I love cheap thrills...) 
I don't need no money 
As long as I can feel the beat 
I don't need no money 
As long as I keep dancing 
Come on, come on, turn the radio on 
It's Saturday and I won't be long 
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on 
It's Saturday and I won't be long 
Till I hit the dance floor 
Hit the dance floor! 
I got all I need! 
No I ain't got cash 
No I ain't got cash 
But I got you baby 
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight

Lo que quiero eres tu 
Una noche de rumba 
La pica retumba es actitud 
Dice lo que quieres 
Todo lo que quieres es bailar 
Mami, vámonos, que la noche no va a parar 
De una lluvia de mujeres colombiosa, domenicas 
Morir con aguajera eres tu 
Te voy a dar con sinceridad 
O con toda su sensualidad 
So girl what you're gonna do? 
De una lluvia de mujeres colombiosa, domenicas

Throwing stones at birds who

I am a dark cloud swelling with rain 
Get it out your system 
Get it out of you 
Send them home with blisters 
Send them home, with truth 
Send away the doubters 
Blind them with with your hoof 
Try to save the doubters 
Try to sell good news

            <field name="lyrics">We had love so strong 
My heart couldn't take it 
You took it in your hands and resuscitate it 
You said: me and you against the world 
You said: you and me forever girl 
I felt every cell fall in love with you, but 
I watched you slip 
Slip away, no explanation 
You on your phone 
Your Laptop or on your playstation 
I stared at the diamond 
On my finger and I waited 
But the truth never came 
But I know her name, so see you later 
No, I won't miss you 
I won't cry, I don't regret it 
No, I won't stand for it 
No, I don't need confetti 
And you can treat another to your lies 
You'll never get it 
I'd rather walk alone 
Than let them throw dirty confetti 
I'd rather walk alone 
I'd rather walk alone 
I'd rather walk alone 
Than let them throw dirty confetti 
You hurt my pride, part of me die 
But all of that's ego 
And the house we lived in had no doors 
And it had no windows 
You said: I'm hangin' with the boys 
You said: workin' late to pay our bills 
But I found lipstick on your collar 
Wasn't my color 
I watched you slip 
Slip away, no explanation 
You on your phone 
You're locked up in your playstation 
I stared at the diamond on my finger 
And I waited 
But the truth never came 
But I know her name, so see you later 
No, I won't miss you 
I won't cry, I don't regret it 
No, I won't stand for it 
No, I don't need confetti 
And you can treat another to your lies 
You'll never get it 
I'd rather walk alone 
Than let them throw dirty confetti 
I'd rather walk alone 
Than let them throw dirty confetti 
No, I won't miss you 
I won't cry, I don't regret it 
No, I won't stand for it 
No, I don't need confetti 
And you can treat another to your lies 
You'll never get it 
I'd rather walk alone 
Than let them throw dirty confetti 
I'd rather walk alone 
Than let them throw dirty confetti 
I'd rather walk alone 
I'd rather walk alone 
I'd rather walk alone 
Than let them throw dirty confetti 
I'd rather walk alone 
I'd rather walk alone 
I'd rather walk alone

I'd rather walk alone 
I'd rather walk alone

            <field name="lyrics">Death by chocolate is a myth 
This I know because I lived 
I've been around for broken hearts, and how! 
Lay your head in my hands little girl 
This is only right now 
Death by crying doesn't exist, though 
The headaches feel a bit like it 
You might explode 
But you reach the end of the road 
And you, little tree 
I'm certain you will grow 
Tears on your pillow will dry 
and you will learn 
Just how to love again 
Oh, my weeping willow 
Let your leaves fall and return 
Oh, darling, the seasons are your friend 
Death by anger this is true 
Just let him go he can't hurt you 
Oh, little girl, 
this is such a cruel cruel world 
This is the first, 
of a million broken hearts 
Tears on your pillow will dry 
and you will learn 
Just how to love again 
Oh, my weeping willow 
Let your leaves fall and return 
Oh, darling, the seasons are your friend 
Oh, it won't be long you will grow strong 
Up, up, and away 
He's but a falling leaf 
He's but a falling leaf 
He's but a falling leaf</field>

I'm going down, going down the drain 
Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down

I'm going down, I don't want to change 
I'm going down, going down the drain 
Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down 
So now for restless mind 
I could go either way 
I'm going down, I don't want to change 
I'm going down, going down the drain 
Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you

I didn't know who to trust 
Oh oh 
So I designed a shell 
Kept me from heaven and hell 
Oh oh 
Yeah I have hit a love 
Was all I let myself know, yeah 
Yeah I had locked my heart 
I was imprisoned by dark 
You found me dressed in black 
Hiding way up at the back 
Life had broken my heart, into pieces 
You took my hand in yours 
You started breaking down my walls 
And you covered my heart in kisses 
I thought life passed me by 
Missed my tears, ignored my cries 
Life had broken my heart, my spirit 
And then you crossed my path 
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh 
Then you covered my heart in kisses 
I was down for the count 
As I was down I was out 
Oh oh 
And I had lost it all 
Yes I was scared I was torn 
And I took to the night 
I'd given into the fight 
Oh oh 
And I slipped further dawn 
Yeah I felt like I had drowned 
You found me dressed in black 
Hiding way up at the back 
Life had broken my heart, into pieces 
You took my hand in yours 
You started breaking down my walls 
And you covered my heart in kisses 
I thought life passed me by 
Missed my tears, ignored my cries 
Life had broken my heart, my spirit 
And then you crossed my path 
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh 
Then you covered my heart in kisses 
I was hopeless and broken 
You opened the door for me 
Yeah I was hiding and you let the light in 
And now I see 
That you do for the wounded 
What they couldn't seem to 
You set them free 
Like a butterfly kissing a child with and eye 
For the minor key 
You found me dressed in black 
Hiding way up at the back 
Life had broken my heart, into pieces 
You took my hand in yours 
You started breaking down my walls 
And you covered my heart in kisses 
I thought life passed me by 
Missed my tears, ignored my cries 
Life had broken my heart, my spirit 
And then you crossed my path 
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh 
Then you covered my heart in kisses</field>

I drink water to quench my thirst 
I use my mouth and air to blow balloon up 
I prick with pin to watch it burst 
To make noise I use my breathe 
To unlock doors I use a key 
When I'm looking for something I use my eyes 
I use booze to unlock me 
I sweep so I can sleep 
I sweep so I can sleep 
Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep 
I wear shoes so I can run 
As to avoid the broken glass 
I wear the pants because they suit me 
And to discourage the pinchin' of ass 
I'll tell a joke to make you laugh 
I'll close the door to have a cry 
They say that change and pain is a positive thing 
Have I changed since you died 
I sweep so I can sleep 
I sweep so I can sleep 
Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep

You play the victim perfectly 
Holding your beating heart 
You used to be so smart 
You fluttered around the yard making your magic 
Got to set you free, you were blinded by deceit 
You can't fly away, electric bird 
So now this room's all staged 
While you're stuck there in that cage 
You can't fly away electric bird 
Well you're art, you fell into this part

I've always had the upper hand 
But what good is intellect and therapy 
If I can't respect any man 
Oh I want to play a fair game 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 
You terrify me, we've still not kissed and yet I've cried 
You got too close and I pushed and pushed 
Hoping you'd bite 
So I could run, run and that I did but through the dust 
You saw those teeth marks 
They weren't all yours you had been thrust 
Into a history, that had not worked for me 
Into a history, from which I could not flee 
So go on shake me, shake until I give it up 
Wearing me down baby 
I know that we could make some love 
So go and challenge me, take the reigns and see 
Watch me squirm baby, but you are just what I need

It's a living bad dream 
I hold her hand as the doors close 
And she pales and stifles a scream 
Ali's afraid of Ad-libbing 
Of improvising at jams 
She is not very happy right now 
And spends all her money on grams 
Ade is afraid of commitment 
So Carla dumped him today 
She is very disappointed 
She was hoping he'd beg her to stay 
Ayo he just wants a girlfriend 
He's afraid of dying alone 
He doesn't go out very much 
Sits at home a lot getting stoned 
You see fear is only holding us back 
Look closely amongst all your peeps 
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track 
It is fear, It is fear, It is fear 
Ella is worried about her weight 
She won't eat in public anymore 
She is fucking her ex again 
When they've finished, she sleeps on the floor 
Nate has a heart of gold 
But give it away he will not 
His mother abandoned him at ten 
It's a pain he has never forgot 
Mary's afraid of herself 
Her sentences often cut half 
She will never give her own opinion 
She's afraid that people might laugh 
And I am afraid of sharks 
I will not swim out past my head 
And sometimes I worry 
My boyfriend will die 
My first love is already dead 
You see fear is only holding us back 
Look closely amongst all your peeps 
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track 
It is fear, It is fear, It is fear 
You see fear is only holding us back 
Look closely amongst all your peeps 
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track 
It is fear, It is fear, It is fear 
Candy is having a baby 
She fears she will be like her mom 
Her friends say "relax, take a deep breath 
And march to a different drum" 
Sacha's afraid of her Marco 
She think's that it's all her fault 
But if he did what he does to a stranger 
He'd be locked up and charged with assault 
You see fear is only holding us back 
Look closely amongst all your peeps 
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track 
It is fear, It is fear, It is fear</field>

Never in control 
Fighting a lonely war 
No, I was never in contro-o-ol

Now I ain't boxing anymore

Is a losing battle

I've fallen through the floor again 
Crashed into the basement 
Your pain was swallowing me 
I was like lead ballon 
When I couldn't even get up to 
Turn lights on from the door 
Was swallowing me 
Lord knows you can't trust your head 
When you're standing on the edge 
I'm breaking down 
Lord knows you can't trust your head 
When you're hanging by a thread 
I was breaking down 
And I saw 
Only two footprints in the sand 
Thought you'd abandoned me and 
Let go of my hand 
But you were carrying me 
Carrying me to safety 
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand 
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand 
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand 
Oh what if I had got the things I knew it was I 
Who would have been done with you 
Forgive me, I was lost and found 
Who would never've left my side 
Pick me up when I thought that I would die 
You helped me and I was fine 
Lord knows you can't trust your head 
When you're standing on the edge 
I'm breaking down 
Lord knows you can't trust your head 
When you're hanging by a thread 
I was breaking down 
Only two footprints in the sand 
Thought you'd abandoned me and 
Let go of my hand 
But you were carrying me 
Carrying me to safety 
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand 
Only two footprints in the sand 
Thought you'd abandoned me and 
Let go of my hand 
But you were carrying me 
Carrying me to safety 
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand 
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand

Just blow me up or run me down, or cut my throat

I'll let you know 
Detonate me 
Shoot me like a cannon ball 
Granulate me 
Kill me like an animal 
Decapitate me 
Hit me like a baseball 
Emancipate me 
Free the animal, Free the animal 
I love you so I'm putting you in quicksand 
You take your chances when you kiss the hitman 
The animal's inside of this infinite jest 
Loving you to death, loving you to death

Beautiful pain, baby 
Pour acid rain on me 
Kill me with your loving 
Kill me with your loving 
I'll slice you and dice you 
Like sugar and spice 
I'll do all that you want me to 
I'll beat on the beast in you 
I'll kill you with my with my loving 
I'll kill you with my loving</field>

You want me to thaw out

When you don't go slow, but I know you want more 
You need me to thaw out 
And I know you were worth it 
And I know this could work if 
I could only let you in

I'm not running away 
I'm not running away 
I will feel the pain and stay

I'm not running again

I won't freeze you out 
I'm gonna let you in 
And I won't freeze you out 
Like I have been 
I won't freeze you out

So here's my heart for you to hold 
Feel it beat, feel the warm blood flow through my cold 
Feel it thaw out 
Yeah, I've felt the fear but I push through 
It's so worth loving you, you wanted more

            <field name="lyrics">Feels like a close, it's coming to 
Fuck am I gonna do? 
It's too late to start over 
This is the only thing I, thing I know 
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is 
Find different ways to word the same old song 
Ever since I came along 
From the day the song called "Hi! My Name Is" dropped 
Started thinking my name was fault 
Cause anytime things went wrong 
I was the one who they would blame it on 
The media made me the equivalent 
Of a modern-day Genghis Kahn 
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg 
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls 
Had to change my style 
They said I'm way too soft 
And I sound like Az and Nas, out came the claws 
And the fangs been out since then 
But up until the instant that I went against it 
It was ingrained in me 
That I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought 
No wonder I had to unlearn everything 
That my brain was taught 
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered 
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not? 
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on 
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect 
The artform I was raised upon 
But sometimes you gotta take a loss 
And have people rub it in your face before 
You get made pissed off 
And keep pluggin' it's your only outlet 
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it 
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah 
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times 
How many times can I say the same thing 
Different ways that rhyme? 
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else 
That can relate to my story? 
Bet you feel the same way I felt 
When I was in the same place you are 
When I was afraid to 
[Sia] 
Afraid to make a single sound 
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out 
Afraid I'd never be found 
I don't wanna go another round 
An angry man's power will shut you up 
Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love 
Run out of excuses for everyone 
So here I am and I will not run 
Guts over fear, the time is near 
Guts over fear, I shed a tear 
For all the times I let you push me round 
And let you keep me down, now I've got 
Guts over fear, guts over fear 
[Eminem] 
Feels like a close, it's coming to 
Fuck am I gonna do? 
It's too late to start over 
This is the only thing I, thing I know 
It's like I was there once, single parents 
Hate your appearance 
Did you struggle to find your place in this world? 
And the pain spawns all the anger on 
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs 
Learned who to aim it on 
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit 
Learned how to harness it 
While the reins were off 
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part 
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck" 
Haters started to appreciate my art 
And it just breaks my heart 
To look at all the pain I've caused 
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone? 
The lights go out in the trailer park 
And the window that was closing 
And there's nowhere else I can go with flows in 
And I'm frozen 
Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from 
Just a bunch of playful songs 
That I made for fun 
So to the break of dawn here 
I go recycling the same old song 
But I'd rather make" Not Afraid 2" 
Than another mothafuckin' "We Made You" uh 
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent 
When I discuss my lows and my highs 
My demise and my uprise, pray to God 
I just opened enough eyes later on 
Gave you the supplies and the tools 
To hopefully use it to make you strong 
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt 
Cause I can't explain to y'all 
How dang exhausted my legs felt 
Just having to balance my damn self 
Those dang eggshells, I was made to walk 
But thank you, ma, cause that gave me the strength 
To cause Shady-mania 
So when they empty that stadium 
At least I made it out of that house 
And a found a place in this world when the day was done 
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did 
Was dreamt that one day they would just get accepted 
I represent him or her, anyone similar 
You are the reason I made this song 
Everything you're scared to say 
Don't be afraid to say no more 
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk 
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off 
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you 
When I'm gone 
And to think I was 
[Sia] 
Afraid to make a single sound 
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out 
Afraid I'd never be found 
I don't wanna go another round 
An angry man's power will shut you up 
Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love 
Run out of excuses for everyone 
So here I am and I will not run 
Guts over fear, the time is near 
Guts over fear, I shed a tear 
For all the times I let you push me round 
And let you keep me down, now I've got 
Guts over fear, guts over fear</field>

Often results in psychosomatic 
I admit to enjoying drugs 
They get rid of tension, boredom and static 
Hate those adverse sideeffects 
Forcing the people who love me to scatter 
Excuse me for being such a hypocrit 
The way I see it really doesn't matter 
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me 
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity 
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me 
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity 
To tell you the truth 
I can't believe I love you so much 
So much in fact that 
I don't know whether to weep or wind my watch 
I have a sick sense of humour 
It amazes me how points it scores 
I'm addicted to vice 
My best friends are pushers 
My boyfriends are whores 
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me 
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity 
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me 
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity 
Simple to see why I breathe 
No one bothers me completely 
Simple to see why I breathe 
No one bothers me completely 
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me 
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity 
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me 
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity 
Waking up next to you 
Your morning breath reminds me of Lucy 
The flies in the frontroom 
Buzz round my head and try to seduce me 
If I contract illness 
The last thing I want is to pass it to others 
Fucking leaves guilt pangs 
When I start forgetting the names of my lovers 
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me 
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity 
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me 
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity...</field>

Yes, I have seen enough

I need to be alone 
You're dirty magic, you broke in my heart 
With your black heart 
Now the power's up, and you are thin air 
What an illusion, I could have sworn that you were there 
Smoke and mirrors 
you are just a hollow man, hologram 
Now the power's up, and you are thin air 
What an illusion, I could have sworn that you were there 
Smoke and mirrors 
you are just a hollow man, hologram 
And I fear you'll be back 
Inside all the cracks 
No I can't handle that 
History's heartbreak, was in my mind 
Now I no longer cry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y 
I no longer cry 
Cry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y

            <field name="lyrics">When you fight so hard but nothing seems to turn out right 
When it breaks your heart and life seems like the longest fight 
When all you see is trees but you can't see the forest 
Oh baby turn to me, I'll show you where the light is 
 
You can count on me, I'll stitch you into my heart 
You know I carry , you so deep in my heart 
Oh my, oh my love's in the air 
The fire, the flame, I'm there 
Yes, my love's here on Earth 
The ocean, death and birth 
Yes, my love's in the sky 
The pain you feel tonight 
Through this joy I call life 
So when you feel alone, like nobody will help you 
Just think of me in all my heart I have kept you 
You can count on me, I'll stitch you into my heart 
You know I carry you so deep in my heart 
Oh my, oh my love's in the air 
The fire, the flame, I'm there 
Yes, my love's here on Earth 
The ocean, death and birth 
Yes, my love's in the sky 
The pain you feel tonight 
Through this joy I call life 
Through tsunamis, earthquakes or a broken spirit 
When you scream with no voice, you know I will hear it 
You know I will come running when I feel the Earth move 
Through a flood, toil and blood, through the tides of terror 
Feel my love, feel my love, let it breathe forever 
You know I will come running when I feel the Earth move 
 
Oh my, oh my love's in the air 
The fire, the flame, I'm there 
Yes, my love's here on Earth 
The ocean, death and birth 
Yes, my love's in the sky 
The pain you feel tonight 
Through this joy I call life</field>

You keep on judging me in his name 
You're so quick to shift the focus 
But you can find yourself in today's frame 
But I know he'd approve 
And I've nothing to prove to you 
He smiles down on me lovingly 
Judge me and feel free 
Cause the freer you feel 
The freer you'll let me be 
Judge me and feel free 
Cause the freer you feel 
The freer you'll let me be 
It's truly sad to see 
You suffering so immensely, immensely 
You need distracting 
So you use me conveniently 
But I know he'd approve 
And I've nothing to prove to you 
He smiles down on me lovingly 
Judge me and feel free

What have I done to you 
Kill and run 
Kill and run 
I'm one off the dirty guns 
Kill and run 
Kill and run 
A bullet through your heart 
Interpret your eyes as they die 
Should I die should I now 
Your poor lashes blow 
We've done of sancturary laugh 
You cry all over 
An innocent call 
Hi, close the door, silent cold 
For you 
What what I done to you 
Kill and run 
Kill and run 
I'm one, off the dirty guns

You would never hurt me, desert me or work me

How I missed you when I was gone 
Hurt me so to leave you deceive you, I need you 
I believed in you. 
Oh, I never meant to let you down 
I wait with a stake in my heart 
I never meant to put you down 
I'm trying not to fall apart 
Now all I have is riches, and pictures, and stitches 
But money could never buy what you gave 
Though my heart is achin' and breakin' I'm makin' 
The most of what you send my way 
Now I want just to hold you, unfold you, I told you 
See, I am coming back for you 
Yeah, I know we will be okay 
Everyday 
The sun shines a little brighter 
I, I never meant to let you down

It knocks me down

My hands shaking with regret 
I've held this dream for such a long long time 
And I wanna get up 
To the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart 
That beats, that beats like a rolling drum 
I saw you standing on the corner 
I saw you standing on your own 
And I get the feeling that it's, it's all a dream 
And I wanna get up 
To the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart 
That beats, that beats like a drum 
When I fall asleep I can see your face 
What I lost in you I will not replace 
And I could run away, I could let them down 
But I will remember your light 
Your light it follows me in darkness 
I'm trying hard but I can't win 
And I've played the victim for a long long time 
And I wanna grow up 
From the rhythm a young 
From the rhythm of a younger heart 
It leads just like a river runs 
That night I sent over the parkway 
The summer's gone and I'm alone 
And I get the feeling that you're somewhere close 
And I wanna get up 
To the rhythm of your wild, to the rhythm of your wild heart 
It beats, been beating since you've gone 
When I fall asleep I can see your face 
What I lost in you I will not replace 
And I could run away, I could let them down 
But I will remember 
When I fall asleep I can see your face 
What I lost in you I will not replace 
And I could run away, I could let them down 
And I know you're gone 
And I know you're gone 
But still I will remember your light 
And if you see me in the darkness 
I hope you know I'm not alone 
I carry you with every breath I take 
I won't let up, I won't let up 
Until the wind is gone 
Until the wind is gone 
Until the wind is gone 
Until the wind is gone 
Until the wind is gone</field>

The hand of a golden giant man 
He's crushing my knuckles 
Splitting my skin, he says he'll let go 
If only I'd ask it of him 
He says 
Girl, it's your call 
You wanna fly 
You wanna fall 
So I shout 
I wanna get away from you 
As fast as I can 
I tell my feet to move it 
I hope they have a plan 
These little black sandals 
Are walking me away 
These little black sandals 
Are heading the right way 
These little black sandals 
Are walking me away 
These little black sandals 
Saved my life today 
So now I'm free 
Free 
From the big bad giant 
Who was stalking me 
Thank you feet, for guiding me 
I'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least 
These little black sandals 
Are walking me away 
These little black sandals 
Are heading the right way 
These little black sandals 
Are walking me away 
These little black sandals 
Saved my life today 
Sometimes I'm tempted 
Sometimes I am 
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man 
He was the line between pleasure and pain 
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim 
These little black sandals 
Are walking me away 
These little black sandals 
Are heading the right way 
These little black sandals 
Are walking me away 
These little black sandals

Memorise where I've gone wrong

I'll stay with you 
But do as I say and not as do 
Trust me and you'll see 
All I want is what is best for you 
Little man your head is full of dreams 
If only I could spend one day touring 
Your imagination 
If I live longer you'll grow faster 
At recognising the traps that cause

Hotel, never much fun 
Not when there's nobody to catch your tears

Fall into the rabbit hole

The minibar, my trusted friend 
Never thought we'd meet again

We will never be, I am the moon 
I long to be apart 
I isolate my heart 
You've drawn me into your world 
Now I too spin limbless 
One wide hand clapping where's the wind 
I stand spanning at your distant wings 
I believe the world it spins for you 
We will never be, I am the moon 
I believe the world it spins for you 
We will never be, I am the moon 
I believe the world it spins for you 
We will never be, I am the moon</field>

Moonquake moonquake 
I want to take a swim in lake moon 
Now I am awake always 
Since I dove into your blue 
Moonquake moonquake 
I want to take a swim in lake moon 
Now I am awake always 
Since I dove into your blue 
She came from the moon ready to fight 
With scales and a tail and a fishy bite 
Ready to destroy all of humankind 
Fierce and fighting with a brook trout mind 
He was born in an airship above the earth 
Strong in legend, my soul's in mirth 
Son of a mime and a performer 
With just a smile for a sweet 
They were never meant to meet (put faith in listen) 
They were never meant to be (oh it never does) 
They were never meant to see (oh but fate didn't listen) 
They were never (didn't listen) 
She's a fish and he's a boy 
Moonquake moonquake 
I want to take a swim in lake moon 
Now I am awake always 
Since I dove into your blue 
Moonquake moonquake 
I want to catch you in my net 
Now I am awake always 
Like the day when I found it 
And then one solstice at a fishing hole 
He was unsure casting his bowl 
She swam right up to him and took the bait 
He reeled her in and made it a date 
When your worlds are worn, you look inside 
Fight the power, stop the divide 
Four eyes, two gills, one human nose 
Wrap your eyes around me in the river floes 
Moonquake moonquake 
I want to take a swim in lake moon 
Now I am awake always 
Since I dove into your blue 
Moonquake moonquake 
I want to catch you in my net 
Now I am awake always 
Like a day when I found it

Now I can't help but feel foolish and ashamed 
I am a broken record, a glitch in your ipod 
But could it be an empty track, a lost melody 
Baby just burn we'll see 
I don't need you to believe in 
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see 
You broke my heart and now this is my arena 
and I'm sold out 
You tried to kick me down 
but you're hearing this now 
when your heart is beating 
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine 
And now I see that your melody was lost on me 
Oh no, I let you fool me once 
Shame on you, fool me twice 
shame on me 
Am I a scratched cd? A glitch in your download? 
But could it be an empty track, a lost melody? 
Baby just burn we'll see 
I don't need you to believe in

Oh baby just burn we'll see

I've got a new faith in me, you'll see, yeah 
You broke my heart and now this is my arena 
and I'm sold out (I'm doing fine without you) 
You tried to kick me down 
but you're hearing this now when your heart is beating

Beat inside me 
Leave you blind 
My love you have found peace 
You were so searching 
For release 
You gave it all 
Into the call 
You took a chance and 
You took a fall for us 
You came thoughtfully 
Loved faithfully 
You taught me honor 
You did it for me 
Tonight you will sleep for good 
You will wait 
For me my love 
Now I am strong 
You gave me all 
you gave all you had 
And now I am home 
My love, leave yourself behind 
Beat inside me 
Leave you blind 
My love, look what you can do 
I am mending 
I'll be with you 
You took my hand 
Added a plan 
You gave me your heart 
I asked you to dance with me 
You loved honestly 
Did what you could release 
I know you're pleased to go 
I won't relieve this love 
Now I am strong 
You gave me all 
You gave all you had 
And now I am home 
My love, leave yourself behind 
Beat inside me 
I'll be with you</field>

Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then 
I got to shoot through 
I got to shoot through 
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then 
Why am I so blue? 
Why am I so blue? 
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then 
I got to shoot through 
I got to shoot through 
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then 
Why am I so blue? 
Why am I so blue? 
Babe, I woke up solo, wished I hadn't let you go 
Babe, I woke up solo, saw your footsteps in the snow 
Babe, I woke up solo, loved you so, I loved you so 
No-no-no-no-no

Momentarily she brings peace to me 
She barely speaks 
But I hear her breathing 
That's all I need 
Someone who's listening 
And still she stays 
Her time is precious 
Until I am safe 
She gives her presence 
Momentarily she brings peace to me 
Momentarily she brings peace to me 
Momentarily she brings peace to me 
Momentarily she brings peace to me</field>

Seems like yesterday 
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed 
For your anger to end 
Oh, Father, I have sinned 
You can't hurt me now 
I got away from you, I never thought I would 
You can't make me cry, you once had the power 
I never felt so good about myself 
Oh, Father, you never wanted to live that way 
You never wanted to hurt me 
Why am I running away 
Maybe someday 
When I look back I'll be able to say 
You didn't mean to be cruel

You can't hurt me now 
I got away from you, I never thought I would 
You can't make me cry, you once had the power

I wish you'd make the most

Hold on for one more shot 
Before you let it slip away 
Hold on for one more shot 
I did not believe, I did not mean to hurt you no more 
I never meant to let you down, down 
Though the silver lining wears through 
I still do not mean to hurt you, no

Beginning to question whether I should be around</field>

You've gotta tie me up 
Eventually you will [?] I'll make you see 
I am enough 
Obviously you're taking me for what suits you 
When I don't 
With slow ease I'll show you disgraced 
you were on my knees 
You know I won 
Foolishly you're taking me for a sleeper

But it took you to show me 
I could hand over the keys, oh 
I'll let you lead the way now 
'cause I want you to take the wheel 
I've never been a passenger though 
I never knew how good it would feel 
The road will twist and turn but 
I know that I am in good hands 
I've never been a passenger though 
But we'll see more without a map 
Without a map, without a map, without a map 
So let's take a walk and get lost 
Let's take a chance on finding us 
I wanna see the world with you 
Every step feels so brand new 
It's hard to jump with no net 
But I've jumped and got no regret 
Like a pilot yeah that's right

This is living

Am I just insecure? 
I want to believe 
It's just you and me 
Sometimes it feels like there's three 
Of us in here, baby 
So I, wait for you to call 
And I try to act natural 
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me? 
And while I wait 
I put on my perfume 
Yeah I want it all over you 
I'm gonna mark my territory 
I'll never tell, tell on myself 
but I hope she smells my perfume 
I'll never tell, tell on myself

I hide it well, hope you can't tell

I hide it well, hope you can't tell

Please don't forget me 
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments 
I know you got history 
But I'm your girlfriend 
Now I'm your girlfriend 
Trying to be cool 
I hope I'm paranoid

Let yourself fall 
You can keep her frozen 
Dorment at your core 
You can try to move on 
Tripped by stitches come undone 
You lost your big heart 
You lost your big heart 
You lost your big heart 
Beating bare 
She gave you a new start 
She gave you a new start 
But you knew you'd lost her to despair 
Your skin burns and prickles 
Your skin burns and prickles 
Your skin burns and prickles 
When she's near 
You try to play it cool 
You try to play it cool 
You try to play it cool 
But you're filled with fear 
Take her down from the wall 
Let her go 
Make her yours 
You can keep her frozen 
Dorment at your core 
You can try to move on 
Tripped by stitches come undone 
You can try to move on

Ready, set, go, I'll race you to the wall 
I will win I am the fastest 
I don't wanna grow old 
Bring me all the toys you can find 
You don't wanna grow up 
You can be my partner in crime 
I'll be sure to write you from the war 
Put your guns away, it's tea time 
Water bombs and tea towel tired mums 
Looking for a little me time 
Close your eyes and count to 35 
You may never ever find me 
Close my eyes and then I realise 
You are never far behind me 
I don't wanna grow old 
Bring me all the toys you can find 
You don't wanna grow up 
You can be my partner in crime 
Let's have fun, let's play out under the sun 
Will you take me by the hand 
Let's see how far we can run, yeah 
Let's play chase, let's put make up on our face 
You can catch me if you can 
We can make a secret place 
Meet me at the playground 
Come with me, fool around</field>

The image of me that you see 
Is distorted, twisted, broken, fractured 
Isolated miles out to sea 
I don't want a separate place 
I need to feel safe not thrown away, away, away 
And I will push (push) 
To tear down the walls 
(Push, push) 
Of this box you put me in 
(Push, push) 
Because you don't understand 
Push, ow, hot, push, ow, hot 
And though you push 
(Push, push) 
To find a label that fits me 
I'm feeling good on a Wednesday 
With the sparkling thoughts 
Help me unload the car, ya, ya, ya 
And so I push to close the door 
Of the stall you've made for me 
To keep me away 
And now we push, push 
To stand together 
Because I am Lorde 
Ya, ya, ya 
Ya, ya, ya, I am Lorde 
I am Lorde, ya, ya, ya 
Ya, ya, ya, I am Lorde

Through the storms, through the clouds, the rain

And your heart's a song with a brand new sound 
And your head, goes spinnin' round, round, round 
'Cause you found what you've been dreamin' of! 
In the night you see the lights and moon 
Goin' round and round in tune 
And the ball of snow in the day 
Makes them all wanna say 
Find a song, (find a song) and sing it round, round, round 
And with ties so strong the two hearts are bound 
Hold them near the one you found, found, found 
For you kno' that this is really love! (this is really love)

Goin' round and round in tune (going round and round!) 
And the ball of sun in the day 
Makes a girl and boy wanna say: (wanna say, wanna say) 
Find the ring, (find the ring) and put it round, round, round 
And with ties so strong your two hearts are bound 
Put it on, the one you found, found, found

            <field name="lyrics">[Intro: Sia] 
A toast to the groom! 
(to the groom, to the groom, to the groom) 
To the bride! 
(to the bride, to the bride, to the bride) 
From your sister 
(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica) 
Who is always by your side 
(by your side, by your side) 
To your union and the hope that you provide 
(you provide, you provide) 
May you always (always) 
Be satisfied (Rewind) 
Rewind! 
Rewind! 
I remember that night, I just might 
I remember that night, I just might 
I remember that night, I remember that- 
I remember that night, I just might 
Regret that night for the rest of my days 
I remember those soldier boys 
Tripping over themselves to win our praise 
I remember that dreamlike candlelight 
Like a dream that you can't quite place 
But Alexander, I'll never forget the first 
Time I saw your face 
I have never been the same 
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame 
And when you said "Hi," 
I forgot my dang name 
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame 
This is not a game... 
[Interlude: Miguel and Sia] 
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied 
I'm sure I don't know what you mean, you forget yourself 
You're like me, I've never been satisfied 
Is that right? 
I have never been satisfied 
My name's Angelica Schuyler 
Alexander Hamilton 
Where's your fam'ly from? 
Unimportant, there's a million things I haven't done 
Just you wait, just you wait... 
[Queen Latifah] 
So so so- 
So this is what it feels like to match wits 
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's 
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light 
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right? 
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes 
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's 
A dream and it's a bit of a dance 
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance 
He's a bit of a flirt, but I'm 'a give him a chance 
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer? 
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance 
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants 
[Bridge: Queen Latifah] 
Handsome, boy, does he know it! 
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it! 
I wanna take him far away from this place 
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is 
[Sia] 
Helpless 
And I know she is 
Helpless 
And her eyes are just 
Helpless 
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time 
I'm a girl in a world in which 
My only job is to marry rich 
My father has no sons so I'm the one 
Who has to social climb for one 
Cause I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in 
New York City is insidious 
And Alexander is penniless 
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less 
(doesn't mean I want him any less) 
(doesn't mean I want him any less) 
(doesn't mean I want him any less) 
He's after me 'cause I'm a Schuyler sister 
That elevates his status, I'd 
Have to be naïve to set that aside 
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza 
Now that's his bride 
Nice going, Angelica, he was right 
You will never be satisfied 
(I will never be satisfied) 
(I will never be satisfied) 
I know my sister like I know my own mind 
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind 
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned 
He'd be mine 
She would say, "I'm fine" 
But she'd be lying 
But when I fantasize at night 
It's Alexander's eyes 
As I romanticize what might have been 
If I hadn't sized him up so quickly 
At least my dear Eliza's his wife 
At least I keep his eyes in my life... 
[Outro: Sia] 
To the groom! 
(to the groom, to the groom, to the groom) 
To the bride! 
(to the bride, to the bride, to the bride) 
From your sister 
(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica) 
Who is always by your side 
(by your side, by your side) 
To your union and the hope that you provide 
(you provide, you provide) 
May you always 
Be satisfied 
And I know (yeah) 
She'll be happy as his bride 
And I know 
He will never be satisfied 
I will never be satisfied</field>

All in letters bound in string 
Time is slowly unraveling 
She sells 
Empty sea shells 
Lost in the ocean 
Through the window 
We can see 
Sand and biscuits 
Cups of tea 
All in letters bound in string

It was meant to sit close to the bone anyway 
You can make it a big issue 
Make it a battle of your own and that's ok 
You can feign a distant familiarity 
Say you understand the similarity 
Think you see me with great clarity 
But you're actually not necessarily 
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know 
Yes, you can call that a start 
It was meant to begin kind of slow anyway 
Yes, your deceit is an art 
I knew you would sink kind of low anyway 
You say you have the best intentions 
You fill me with fickle suggestions 
Logic is fired by inventions 
But your concern is much more than you mention 
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know 
You say you're in my situation 
You say you've been confused by my complication 
You think my soul makes negotiation 
But you don't see my hesitation 
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know</field>

Hungry for that flesh of mine

Who has brought me to my knees 
What do you see in those yellow eyes 
Cause I'm falling to pieces 
I'm falling to pieces 
Falling to pieces 
I'm falling to pieces 
Falling to pieces 
Did she lie in wait 
Was I bait to pull you in 
The thrill of the kill 
You feel, is a sin 
I lay with the wolves 
Alone, it seems 
I thought I was part of you

We lay hollow in the emptiness 
I'm too tired to push you from the bed 
No more fighting 
(no more fighting) 
No more fighting for us 
Feel the void in our bed 
The space between is deafening 
Oh, we don't bend or break it 
The space between is deafening 
The space between is deafening 
No one's moving, we lack the courage to 
We lay in stalemate, wishing the other would 
But we're too tired, we let the ambers cool 
No more fighting, there's no more fighting 
There's no more fighting for us 
Feel the void in our bed 
The space between is deafening 
Oh, we don't bend or break it 
The space between is deafening 
No more fighting, we've given up now 
Silence says more than words 
Imagination cures loneliness 
When you become a prisoner 
Feel the void in our bed 
The space between is deafening 
Oh, we don't bend or break it 
The space between is deafening</field>

The way that you're climbing inside me 
How could I ever deny you 
The way that you never deny me 
How can I climb inside you 
Touching the parts that people really see 
How can I open and find you 
And feel you the way that you want me to feel 
I want you to know what I'm thinking of 
I want you to read my mind before I write it 
I want you to know that I have stories to tell 
I wanna tell you a little bit more 
How do I get to align with you 
[?] times I will see 
If we can piece together something 
Or something else that will be 
Can't believe that you're less 
I'm still not against your will 
A change that you really want too 
If I pour it all out 
Will you still have no doubt 
There's a reason or two that you are too</field>

I put a little make up on 
Put a bow in my hair 
Wore pretty underwear 
Hoping you might take it off 
Don't know your etiquette but 
I'm strapped to my chair, and it ain't cuz your pretty 
You were charming, until 
You saw your chance to kill, your chance to make history 
You went straight for the knife, and I prepared to die 
Your blade it shines 
Looked me straight in the eye, you turned the gas on high 
Held the flame alight, you wonder why 
I'm scared of fire 
You wonder why you make girls cry 
My mascara a mess, harsh words for your princess 
Boy you and your promises 
If your goal was to love, you scored an epic miss 
Now you'll just have memories 
You went straight for the knife, and I prepared to die 
Your blade it shines 
Looked me straight in the eye, you turned the gas on high 
Held the flame alight, you wonder why 
I'm scared of fire 
You wonder why you make girls cry 
Boy you draw me back in 
I'm hungry for your bad loving 
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters 
From hanging on your every word 
You went straight for the knife, and I prepared to die 
Your blade it shines 
Looked me straight in the eye, you turned the gas on high 
Held the flame alight, you wonder why 
I'm scared of fire 
You wonder why you make girls cry</field>

            <field name="lyrics">My summer rain 
I prepared for the worst in a storm 
It doesn't take long before I'm shaking 
I watch the news end, wait for the forecast 
I fill a tall glass, try to be patient 
It's been a long time, I fell my temperature rise 
You might be moving too fast, oh 
Wait for the sirens, sit in the silence 
I sit on my hands 
I feel the breeze, feel the sea swelling and drowning me 
I feel the night, feel the sunlight, I feel everything 
I feel your love, and I'm done and I surrender now 
I want my level, you've got to bring him, bring him down 
I though you were a game 
Turns out you were the summer rain 
You came 
To wash away the love I made 
I needed you in every way 
My summer rain 
My summer rain 
My summer rain 
My summer rain 
I was mistaken, but I feel safe here 
So now we're making some kind of rainbow 
The storm has broken, two words are spoken 
And I am soaking, and now you're love 
So, love me for all time, and feel my temperature rise 
Thought you were moving too fast, oh 
But I was just scared to let you into my head 
And let you see my past 
I feel the breeze, feel the sea swelling and drowning me 
I feel the night, feel the sunlight, I feel everything 
I feel your love, and I'm done and I surrender now 
I want my level, you've got to bring him, bring him down 
I though you were a game 
Turns out you were the summer rain 
You came 
To wash away the love I made 
I needed you in every way 
My summer rain 
My summer rain 
My summer rain 
My summer rain 
When you live in fear 
You miss everything 
I was struggling 
When you stop fighting 
The war within 
Everybody wins 
I though you were a game 
Turns out you were the summer rain 
You came 
To wash away the love I made 
I needed you in every way 
My summer rain 
My summer rain 
My summer rain

            <field name="lyrics">She cooks you sweet potato 
You don't like aubergine 
She knows to boil the kettle 
When you hum bars from Grease 
She senses you are lonely 
But still she can't be sure 
And so she stands and waits, 
Stands anticipating your thoughts 
How can she become the psychic 
That she longs to be to understand you 
How can she become the psychic 
That she longs to be to understand you 
He brushes thoroughly 
He know she likes fresh breath 
He rushes to the station 
He waits atop the steps 
He's brought with him a Mars bar 
She will not buy Nestle 
And later he'll perform 
A love lorn serenade, a trade 
How can he become the psychic 
That he longs to be to understand you 
How can he become the psychic 
That he longs to be to understand you 
So give her information 
To help her fill the holes 
Give an ounce of power 
So he does not feel controlled 
Help her to acknowledge 
The pain that you are in 
Give to him a glimpse 
Of that beneath your skin 
Now my inner dialog is heaving with detest 
I am a martyr and a victim 
And I need to be caressed 
I hate that you negate me, 
I'm a ghost at beck and call 
I'm failing and placating, 
I berate myself for staying 
I'm a fool 
I'm a fool 
He greets the stranger meekly, 
A thing that she accepts 
She sees him waiting often 
With chocolate on the steps 
He senses she is lonely, 
She's glad they finally met 
They take each other's hands 
Walk into the sunset 
Do you like sweet potatoes?</field>

Waiting for you 
You said you'd be a minute 
But you've been twenty two 
See you've got to do your hair 
And get it just right 
Sometimes you're in the bathroom 
For half of the night 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Yes I'm waiting for you 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Tell me what can I do 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Yes I'm waiting for you 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Tell me what can I do 
Now I'm sitting by the phone again 
Waiting for your call 
You'd said you'd phone at two 
And it's a quarter past four 
Now I'm standing out the front 
Again 
It's late at night 
And I'm truly sick to death of 
Sleazy men 
Undressing me with their eyes 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Yes I'm waiting for you 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Tell me what can I do 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Yes I'm waiting for you 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Tell me what can I do 
Now I'm back back from 
The theater 
I watched the show alone 
I waited for you and 
I missed half act one 
Have you never heard 
Of the phone? 
I don't like being 
Taken for granted 
I'm too nice for my own good 
See I do what I say 
And I say what I do 
Is it too much to expect 
That you could 
I wish you would 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't waiting for you 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
Go find another fool 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't waiting for you 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
It's the usual coup 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't waiting for you 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
May I show you the door 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't waiting for you 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't missing nothing for you</field>

From the top bunks further to fall down 
You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me 
What you been doing 
Still making the world a better place 
Never stopped rueing 
Making those tears fall down your face 
Making you suffer 
Wondering how you got your scars 
Lonely in hindsight 
I wish I had taken you in my arms 
Taken you in my arms 
Taken you in my arms

A risk through my head 
I'm pushing on the bank 
And I made the traffic stop 
It's hard to be distracted 
When you know the time you've got 
I barely bed at night 
That I was a watch the cross 
You like 
It's to be affected when you dead inside 
You and I 
You and I 
What can I do? I cannot move 
You will take over on you 
You always stay, struck in the places 
Trying to get over you 
What can I do? I cannot move 
You will take over on you

I leave on the corner 
I am seeking in the films 
It's the pure evil, my choises 
That I cannot be proud them 
I'm over on the corner 
All the pieces of my parts 
Stading mending the pieces 
Of my broken heart

            <field name="lyrics">We are born 
Without a care 
As we grow old 
Become aware 
As we grow tall, begin to falter 
We want to know ourselves, give love to all 
And we falter 
Yes we are human 
Yes we anger 
We feed the hunger 
Yes we push through 
Just me and you 
We made it through the darkness to the light 
Oh how we fought yet still we won the fight 
Oh yes we stand together 
A fantasy 
For you and me 
Though beauty lies 
In reality 
No need to fear, the truth sets us free 
We're all looking for love and harmony 
But we falter, and yes we are flawed 
We play victim 
With such conviction 
And we play bully 
Both you and me 
We made it through the darkness to the light 
Oh how we fought yet still we won the fight 
Oh yes we stand together 
Took it day by day,worried we would fail,how we flailed and we wailed and we screamed in Pain 
Take it step by step we could not forget the wounds 
We felt how we screamed for help 
And the dark dark nights when you held me tight 
And we'd wait for light to rescue us 
Oh we were distressed 
Now we're nothing less 
We are strong we are blessed 
We are united. 
We made it through the darkness to the light 
Oh how we fought yet still we won the fight 
Oh yes we stand together 
We made it through the darkness to the light 
Oh how we fought yet still we won the fight 
Oh yes we stand together</field>

You cannot deny, I've always been in 
But I've watched you stand, still as a snowman 
But I don't see you change, you're always at meltdown 
Yeah I've been your crutch, your smell, sight and touch 
Yeah I took you home when you've drunk too much 
But I can't survive, with you by my side 
See I'll never get laid, while I'm running your life 
No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away 
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay 
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away 
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate 
So just cut me loose, learn to tie your shoes 
There's somebody here, I'd like to introduce 
So look in the mirror, look for the glass 
'Cause you're not my problem, you are my last 
No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away 
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay 
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away 
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate 
No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away 
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay 
No I'm not your mama, so I'm walking away 
See I'm just the girl that you lost to cocaine</field>

And after all the tears 
There will be laughter too 
I promise 
You're stronger than it

Although it may not feel like it 
You are okay 
And you will love again 
And you are loved right now 
Forgive yourself 
And you'll help you 
You'll do enough 
You'll help enough 
You are enough

You didn't need it

With time, it works out 
To be human is to love 
Even when it gets too much 
I'm not ready to give up 
To be human is to love 
Even when it gets too much 
I'm not ready to give up 
All the tigers have been out 
I don't care, I hear them howl 
I let them tear right through me 
Can you help me not to care? 
Every breath becomes a prayer 
Take this pain from me 
And oh you're so far now 
So far from my arms now 
To be human is to love

Just 'cause I predicted this 
Doesn't make it any easier to live with

            <field name="lyrics">Two hearts, one past 
I was your lover 
Cruel words broke us 
You became another 
I'm with the enemy in my bed 
When the voice in my head 
Tells me I should treat myself better 
I know you don't mean to be mean 
When you're hurting you'll see 
You can see just how dark it is getting 
So one hand is holding yours while 
The other is waving goodbye 
I love you, but it's your turn to fight 
But one hand is holding yours while 
The other is waving goodbye 
I love you, but it's your turn to fight 
It's your turn to fight 
Poor you, so sad 
Well I think it's time now 
You're too crying feel so bad 
But can I lie down 
I'm with the enemy in my bed 
When the voice in my head 
Tells me I should treat myself better 
I know you don't mean to be mean 
When you're hurting you'll see 
You can see just how dark it is getting 
So one hand is holding yours while 
The other is waving goodbye 
I love you, but it's your turn to fight 
But one hand is holding yours while 
The other is waving goodbye 
I love you, but it's your turn to fight 
It's your turn to fight 
Feel my heart break 
Feel my heart break 
Feel my heart break 
As I walk away (As I walk away) 
Feel my heart break 
Feel my heart break 
Feel my heart break 
As I walk away (As I walk away) 
So one hand is holding yours while 
The other is waving goodbye 
I love you, but it's your turn to fight 
But one hand is holding yours while 
The other is waving goodbye 
I love you, but it's your turn to fight 
It's your turn to fight</field>

We lose 
Yet we want to spare the feelings of those we love 
Don't cry 
We've all lied 
But there is always room for forgiveness my friend 
So don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong 
I know where I belong 
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete 
There's a place here for you with me 
Shine 
You're fine 
See I will always have a smile for you my love 
And still 
We will 
Be ok and along the way we'll learn a thing or two 
So don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong

Oooh 
If I took you home, it'd be a home run 
Show me how you do 
I wanna shut down the club 
With you 
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones 
Oooh 
I like crazy, foolish, stupid 
Party going wild, fist pumping music 
I might lose it 
Glass to the roof 
That's how we does it 
I don't care tonight 
She don't care we like 
Almost dared the right five 
Ready to get live 
Ain't no surprise 
Take me so high 
Jump and nose dive 
Surfing the crowd 
Said I gotta be the man 
I'm the head of my band 
Mic check one two-oooh 
Shut 'em down in the club while the playboy does 
And they all get loose, loose 
After bottle, we all get bent then again tomorrow 
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto 
Club shut down: a hundred super models 
Hey I heard you are a wild one 
Oooh 
If I took you home it'd be a home run 
Show me how you do 
I wanna shut down the club 
With you 
Hey I heard you like the wild ones 
Oooh 
Party rocker, fa' sho' stopper 
More Chambull, number one club popper 
Got a hangover like too much vodka 
Can't see me with ten binoculars 
So cool 
No doubt by the end of the night 
Got the clothes coming off 
Then I make that move 
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof 
All black shades when the sun come through 
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes 
Wild out baby, 'til the freak, it shows 
What happens to that body, it's a private show 
Stays right here, pri-private show 
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me high pain 
Tolerance, bottoms up when the champagne 
My life, coming harder than we hit play 
Do you busy with the bail, were you insane 
Hey I heard you are a wild one 
Oooh 
If I took you home it'd be a home run 
Show me how you do 
I wanna shut down the club 
With you 
Hey I heard you like the wild ones 
Oooh 
I am a wild one 
Break me in 
Saddle me up and lets begin 
I am a wild one 
Tame me now 
Running with wolves 
And I'm on the prowl 
Show you another side of me 
A side you would never thought you would see 
Tear up that body 
Dominate you 'til you've had enough 
I can't lie 
The wilds don't lie</field>

We set it on fire

Caught in a craze, it's just a phase 
Or will this be around forever 
Don't you know it's going too fast 
Racing so hard you know it won't last 
Don't you know, what can't you see 
Slow it down, read the sign 
So you know just where you're going 
Stop right now, thank you very much 
I need somebody with the human touch 
Hey you always on the run 
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun 
Do do.. 
always be together 
Ba da.. 
stay that way forever 
And we know that you could go and find some other 
Take or leave it 'cause we've always got each other 
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown 
You're crossed the line 
So you're gonna have to turn around

Gotta keep it down honey 
Lay your back on the line

You need less speed, get off my case 
You gotta slow it down baby 
Just get out of my face 
Stop right now, thank you very much

Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun 
Stop right now, thank you very much

Feeling together, believe in whatever 
My love has said to me, 
Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun, 
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave you, 
We'd only just begun 
Hasta mañana, always be mine 
Viva forever, I'll be waiting, 
Everlasting like the sun, 
Live forever, for the moment, 
Ever searching for the one. 
Yes I still remember every whispered word, 
The touch of your skin giving life from within 
Like a love song never heard 
Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time, 
Promises made, every memory saved 
As reflections in my mind 
Hasta mañana, always be mine 
Viva forever, I'll be waiting, 
Everlasting like the sun, 
Live forever, for the moment, 
Ever searching for the one 
Back where I belong now, was it just a dream, 
Feelings untold, they will never be sold, 
And the secret's safe with me 
Hasta mañana, always be mine 
Viva forever (viva forever), 
I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting), 
Everlasting (everlasting) 
Like the sun (like the sun), 
Live forever (live forever), 
For the moment (for the moment), 
Ever searching (ever searching) 
For the one (for the one), 
Viva forever, I'll be waiting, 
Everlasting like the sun, 
Live forever (live forever), for the moment,

Last time that we had this conversation I 
Decided we should be friends, yeah 
But now we're going round in circles 
Tell me will this deja vu never end? 
Now you tell me that you've fallen in love 
Well I never ever thought that would be 
This time you gotta take it easy throwing far 
Too much emotions at me 
But any fool can see they're falling 
I gotta make you understand 
I'm giving you everything all that joy can bring 
This I swear 
And all that I want from you is a promise 
You'll be there 
Say you will be there 
Won't you sing it with me 
If you put two and two together you 
Will see what our friendship is for 
If you can't work this equation then 
I guess I'll have to show you the door 
There is no need to say you love me 
It would be better left unsaid 
I'm giving you everything 
All that joy can bring, this I swear 
And all that I want from you 
Is a promise you'll be there 
Yeah I want you 
Any fool can see they're falling 
Gotta make you understand 
I'll give you everything on this I swear 
Just promise you'll always be there 
I'm giving you everything 
All that joy can bring, this I swear

Fly like an angel, heaven sent to me 
Goodbye my friend

It's not the end

So glad we made it, 
time will never change it - no no no 
No no no no 
Just a little girl, big imagination 
Never letting no-one take it away 
Went into the world (into the world), what a revelation 
She found there's a better way for you and me to be 
Look for a rainbow in every storm 
Find out for certain, love's gonna be there for you 
You'll always be someone's baby

No no no no 
You know it's time to say goodbye 
No no no no 
The times when we would play about 
The way we used to scream and shout 
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way 
Look for a rainbow in every storm 
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you 
You'll always be someone's baby

So glad we made it time will never never change it 
No no no no 
you know it's time to say goodbye 
No no no no 
and don't forget you can rely 
No no no no 
you know it's time to say goodbye 
No no no no 
and don't forget on me you can rely 
No no no no 
I will help, help you on your way 
No no no no 
I will be with you every day</field>

We will take you where you gotta go 
Smiling, dancing, everything is free 
All you need is positivity 
Colours of the world (spice up your life!) 
Every boy and every girl (spice up your life!) 
People of the world (spice up your life!) 
Aah... 
Slam it to the left (if you’re having a good time) 
Shake it to the right (if you know that you feel fine) 
Chicas to the front (huh huh) and go round 
Slam it to the left (if you’re having a good time) 
Shake it to the right (if you know that you feel fine)

Hi, see ya, hold tight!

Kung-fu fighting, dancin’ queen 
Tribal spaceman and all that’s in between

Shake it shake it shake it, haka!

            <field name="lyrics">Love is blind, as far as the eye can see, 
deep and meaningless, words to me. 
Easy lover, I need a friend, 
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end. 
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me,(Pleases me) 
But short term solution ain't no resolution, That ain't no release for me. 
Too much of something is bad enough, 
But something coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too much of nothing is just as tough, 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
Unwrap yourself from around my finger, 
Hold me too tight or left to linger. 
Something fine built to last, 
Slipped up there I guess we're running out of time too fast. 
Yes my dear you know he soothes me ,(Moves me) 
There's no complication was no explanation, It's just a groove in me. 
Too much of something is bad enought,(Bad enough) 
But something coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too much of nothing is just as tough,(Just as tough) 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
What part of no don't you understand, (Understand, Understand) 
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can, boy who thinks he can. 
Too much of something is bad enough, 
But something coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too much of nothing is just as tough, 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
Too Much of nothing so why don't we give it a try, 
Too much of something we're gonna be living a life. 
Too Much of nothing so why don't we give it a try, 
Too much of something we're gonna be living a life.</field>

To take this on together, you make me feel complete 
We fall into the future and through the looking glass 
The light shines over our heads and so it comes to pass 
To go beyond the surface 
To reach into your soul 
This love is not demanding 
My heart has told me so 
I hold onto my hero with faith enough to fly 
The power to imagine will keep this love alive 
Let's make the headlines loud and true 
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you 
Let's make the headlines loud and clear 
The best things suddenly happen when you are here 
If I lost my way you'd carry me home 
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave it alone (everyday) 
And it's just like everything matters when you are here 
(matters when you're here) 
And it feels so good every care's gone away 
Your love is alive and it's making me sing 
I could fly, wanna cry, want the whole world to know 
We are together, c'mon baby let's go 
Our words yet to be spoken will fall upon the page 
Spelling out true devotion, is all we need to say 
Let's make the headlines loud and true 
(say you love me and i'll say I love you too) 
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you 
(just remember what's in your heart) 
Let's make the headlines loud and clear 
(all the love I have i'll give to you my dear) 
The best things suddenly happen when you are here 
(just remember, friendship never ends) 
If I lost my way you'd carry me home 
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave it alone (everyday) 
And it's just like everything matters when you are here

You'd 
Take 
Me 
All the way to heaven)

Matters, it really matters)

The early years were a lesson 
Now we know what's goin' on this time we're strong in our feets 
And now we're INDUSTRY PLAYERS 
We're wearing G-strings, taking meetings, feelin' music to beats 
Truly, madly, deeply 
Louder baby, louder baby

Mama I love you, Mama I care, 
Mama I love you, Mama my friend, 
You´re my friend. 
I didn't want to hear it then but 
I'm not ashamed to say it now, 
Every little thing you 
said and did was right for me, 
I had a lot of time to think about,

Never had a sense of my responsibility.

Naivety and childhood left behind deprived of the goodness of mankind, 
Past encounters have made her strong, strong enough to carry on and on. 
[Emma and Mel B] 
Undress you with her eyes, uncover the truth from the lies 
Strip you down don't need to care, lights are low exposed and bare. 
[Emma,Mel C e Victoria] 
Naked 
Nothing but a smile upon her face 
Naked 
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind 
Naked 
This child has fallen from grace 
Naked 
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked. 
Naked 
[Geri] 
She knows exactly what to do with men like you, 
Inside out in her mind there's 
no doubt where you're coming from, 
mystery will turn you on.

Strip you down don't need to care, lights are low exposed and bare.

Hello...it's me 
I thought you'd understand 
Well maybe I should have kept my mouth shut 
I keep seeing such a pretty picture 
I'd rather be hated than pitied 
Maybe I should have left it to your imagination 
I just want to be me 
[Mel C] 
This angel's dirty face is sore, holding onto what she had before. 
Not sharing secrets with any old fool, now she's gonna keep her cool. 
She wants to get naked 
She wants to get naked.

Do what your mama said 
I will not be told, Keep your mouth shut,

Blameless, shameless, damsel in disgrace 
Who cares what they say because rules are for breaking (I said a),

You gotta get it right this time, Come on freak and lose control 
Remember things like this should be seen and never heard 
Give a little respect to me and it will be returned 
Keep your head down, keep your nose clean, Go back against the wall 
Girl there's no way out for you, You are sure to fall 
Who cares what they do because it's yours for the taking, 
So it's not for you anyway, Make your own rules to live by,

Originally performed by Whitney Houston.) 
I believe that children are our future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
Everybody searching for a hero 
People need someone to look up to 
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs 
A lonely place to be 
So I learned to depend on me 
I decided long ago 
Never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I will live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
(Chorus) 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all 
Inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
I believe the children are our future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
And I decided long ago 
Never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I will live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
(Chorus) 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all 
Inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
And if by chance, that special place 
That you've been dreaming of 
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love.</field>

That behind every great man 
There had to be a great woman 
But in these times of change 
You know that it's no longer true 
So we're comin' out of the kitchen 
Cos there's somethin' we forgot to say to you 
We say 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Standin' on their own two feet 
And ringin' on their own bells 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Now this is a song to celebrate 
The conscious liberation of the female state 
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too 
Woman to woman 
We're singin' with you 
The "inferior sex" has got a new exterior 
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too 
Everybody take a look around 
Can you see, can you see, can you see 
There's a woman right next to you 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Standin' on their own two feet 
And ringin' on their own bells 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Oh we ain't makin' stories 
No, we ain't makin' plans 
Don't ya know that a man still loves a woman 
And a woman still loves a man 
Now there was a time (there was a time) 
When we used to say (when we used to say) 
That behind every great man 
There has to be a great woman 
Well in these times of change 
You know that it is no longer true 
So we're comin' out of the kitchen

Will the answer let her down 
She is so sweet and young 
And her life has just begun 
What does her future hold 
Thats a story left unknown

Why is there pain 
Why is there sunshine and the rain 
One day you're here 
Next you are gone 
No matter what we must go on 
Just Keep the faith and 
Let Love Lead the Way 
Everything will work out fine 
if you let love 
Let Love lead the way 
Sitting there all alone 
in the window of her room 
Watching the world go by 
brings tears to her eyes 
All she sees is hurt and pain 
She wants to break the chain 
She'll keep pressing every day 
and she'll find her own sweet way hey

told me she needed a friend. 
Is she going crazy, baby's on the way, 
Seems like the day never ends. 
Everybody needs some affection (Ah, ah, ah), 
Never shy (Never shy), 
Gotta try (Gotta try), Wherever you're going. 
Never give up on the good times, 
gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no, never give it up no), 
Never give up on the good times, 
living it up is a state of mind (Never give it up no, never give it up no) 
Bossanova baby, heart is never soul, 
Shouting but he's never heard 
Eyes all wide and open, streets are paved with gold, 
Someone's come back on their word 
Everybody needs some affection (Ah, ah, ah), 
Never shy (Never shy), 
Gotta try (Gotta try), Wherever you're going. 
Never give up on the good times, 
gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no, never give it up no), 
Never give up on the good times, 
living it up is a state of mind (Never give it up no, never give it up no) 
Down and dirty city, feeling out of place, 
Maybe you'd ran out of time, 
He treats her like a lady, smile upon her face, 
Make up the last of the lies 
Everybody needs some attention (Ah, ah, ah), 
Never shy (Never shy), 
Gotta try (Gotta try), Wherever you're going. 
Never give up on the good times,

Makes me feel good, like you should. 
Listen up I gotta tell ya 
About the ins and outs and goings on, 
I wouldn't tell just anyone about the fox that I've been chasing, 
He's resistant, not persistant, it didn't stop me from homing in, 
'Cause I'm choosy not a floozy, Iget my hit and then I run with it. 
Last time lover, 
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy, and I know 
you want to get with me, 
Last time lover 
Do you wanna be my last time baby, 
could it be your first time maybe? 
We got up and down to it, like the dirty bass in the music, 
I got my major chords strummin', 
took some time and then we're really buzzin', 
First bite whet my appitite, second helping's always better, 
Started getting burning hot, I found my pride not easy, 
slowed it down I said stop. 
Last time lover, 
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy, and I know 
you want to get with me, 
Last time lover 
Do you wanna be my last time baby, 
could it be your first time maybe? 
Last time lover, treat me right, 
lovin' under cover, all night, 
Last time lover, makes me feel good, 
lovin' under cover like you should, 
Last time lover 
Last time lover, treat me right, lovin' 
under cover, all night. 
Cool sexy, ever ready, someone fine, always steady, gentle hands, dirty mind, 
use your head and don't be blind, 
Words of love they don't wash with me, what's the rush no urgency you see, 
Crazy boy, potential lover, first and last lover brother there ain't no other, 
Crazy, sweety, cool but racy, steady ready go, yes! 
Last time lover, 
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy, and I know

a dream of you and me together, 
Say you believe it, say you believe it, 
Free your mind of doubt and danger, 
be for real don't be a stranger, 
We can achieve it, we can achieve it 
Come a little bit closer baby, get it on, get it on, 
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one 
I need some love like I never needed love before 
(wanna make love to ya baby) 
I had a little love, now I'm back for more 
(wanna make love to ya baby) 
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be 
Silly games that you were playing, 
empty words we both were saying, 
Let's work it out boy, let's work it out boy, 
Once again that if we endeavour, 
Love will bring us back together, 
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it 
Are you as good as I remember baby, 
get it on, get it on, 
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one 
I need some love like I never needed love before 
(wanna make love to ya baby) 
I had a little love, now I'm back for more

            <field name="lyrics">"Bah! Humbug" - no, that's too strong 
Cos it's my favorite holiday 
But all this year's been a busy blur 
Don't think I have the energy 
To add to my already mad rush 
Just because it is the season 
The perfect gift for me would be 
Completions and connections left from 
Last year, world tour 
Aeroplanes and babies 
Met some guys but never the time 
Most of '98 passed along those lines 
So deck the halls and trim those trees 
Raise up the cups of Christmas cheer 
I just need to catch my breath 
Christmas with my mates this year 
Calendar picture, frozen landscape 
Chilled this room for twenty-four days 
Evergreens, sparkling snow 
Get this winter over with! 
Flashback to springtime, saw him again 
Would've been good to go for lunch 
Couldn't agree we were both free 
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch 
We didn't, of course, 'till the summertime 
Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him? 
No, this time it was me 
Sunburn in the third degree 
Now the calendar's just one page 
And, of course, I am excited 
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind 
Not to do too much about it 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Hardly dashing through the snow 
Cos I bundled up too tight 
Last minute have-to-do's 
A few cards, a few calls 
Because it's R-S-V-P 
No thanks, no party lights 
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax 
Turned down all of my invites 
Last fall I had a night to myself 
Same guy called, halloween party 
Waited all night for him to show 
This time his car wouldn't go 
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late 
Trudge on home to celebrate 
In a quiet way, unwind 
Doing Christmas right this time 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Tesco has provided me 
With the world's smallest turkey 
Already in the oven, nice and hot 
Oh damn, guess what I forgot? 
So it's on with the boots, back out in the snow 
To the only all-night garage 
But when to my wondering eyes should appear 
In the line that guy I've been chasing all year 
"Spending this one alone," he said 
"Need a break; this year's been crazy." 
I said, "Me too, but why are you? 
You mean you forgot the papers too?" 
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
Caught on to what was happening 
Christmas magic's brought this tale 
To a very happy e-ending 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Do you, do you think about me? 
I see the setting sun, of another passing day 
There's some questions on my mind, since you been away 
Friend's say that you're doing well, you finally got it made 
Outside I share my joy for you, but inside my heart still aches 
It's like a melody, playing endlessly 
You're always on my mind 
And I wonder all the time 
(Chorus) 
Do you think about me? like I think about you 
Do you sometimes stay awake at night? 
Till the morning light? cos you don't know what to do 
Do you think about me? like I think about you 
Do you toss and turn does your heart still burn? 
For the passion we once knew 
Do you think about me? 
Do you think about me? 
I see your face at night, in every dream I drift 
Could this be a message, please tell me what it means 
If I had your number, I'd call you on the phone 
But your voice wouldn't be enough, I'd be better left alone 
It's like I press rewind, it's like the hands of time 
That starts all over again 
Maybe this time, it won't end 
(Repeat Chorus) 
I wanna know-whoa, do you think about me? 
Is there a chance? that we could work it on out 
It's been so long a centure and it's plain to see 
That I got what you want, and I sure got what you need 
(Repeat Chorus) 
Do you think about me (do you think about me) 
Like I think about you (like I think about you) 
(Like I think about you baby, all through the night) 
Do you think about me like I think about you? 
(Do you, (do you), think about me) 
(Whoa, oh now baby, eh hey, eh hey) 
Do you think about me? 
(Tossing and turning, my heart is burning) 
Don't you need me like I need you, shared the passion we once knew

Those battle where we are 
Something's changed our love 
Along the way 
(I hope our love is here to stay) 
Every night I'm on my kness and pray 
That you never go away 
Don't you break my heart 
It's so plain to see 
(That our love like this was meant to be) 
Don't you break (my heart) 
If this love should end 
I will never fall in love again 
I should have known 
For the first time 
I heard the rumors 
That you've been running around (running around) 
But like a fool, I forgave you 
I let you in my heart 
With a benefit of a doubt 
Why do you insist on hurting me so? 
(All I do is here to you) 
All my friends say 
I should let you go 
But I still love you so 
Don't break my heart 
It's so plain to see 
(That our love like this was meant to be) 
Don't you break (my heart) 
If this love should end 
I will never fall in love again 
When I close my eyes 
I see a vision of your smile 
They say that love is blind 
But all I see is you and I 
Together till the end of time 
I need you wanna esqueeze you 
Boy I wanna be with you 
I'm hopping, I'm pray 
That I hear you say 
You wanna play the game 
My love you wanna tame 
You better do it right 
Cause I wanna come together tonight 
Don't you break (my heart) 
If this love should end 
I will never fall in love again 
Don't you break my heart 
Don't you break my heart 
Don't break it 
Don't break it 
Don't break my heart 
Don't you break (my heart) 
No oh! no oh! 
Baby don't you break it</field>

Listen little child, there will come a day 
When you will be able, able to say 
Never mind the pain, or the aggravation 
You know there's a better way, for you and me to be 
Look for a rainbow in every storm 
Fly like an angel, heaven sent to me 
Goodbye my friend

but I can still feel you here) 
It's not the end 
(gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear) 
So glad we made it, 
time will never change it - no no no 
No no no no 
Just a little girl, big imagination 
Never letting no-one take it away 
Went into the world (into the world), what a revelation 
She found there's a better way for you and me to be 
Look for a rainbow in every storm 
Find out for certain, love's gonna be there for you 
You'll always be someone's baby 
Goodbye my friend

No no no no 
You know it's time to say goodbye 
No no no no 
The times when we would play about 
The way we used to scream and shout 
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way 
Look for a rainbow in every storm 
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you 
You'll always be someone's baby 
Goodbye my friend

            <field name="lyrics">(The song that Melanie B sang to audition for the Spice Girls 
Originally performed by Whitney Houston.) 
I believe that children are our future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
Everybody searching for a hero 
People need someone to look up to 
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs 
A lonely place to be 
So I learned to depend on me 
I decided long ago 
Never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I will live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
(Chorus) 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all 
Inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
I believe the children are our future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
And I decided long ago 
Never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I will live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
(Chorus) 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all 
Inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
And if by chance, that special place 
That you've been dreaming of 
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love.</field>

To take this on together, you make me feel complete 
We fall into the future and through the looking glass 
The light shines over our heads and so it comes to pass 
To go beyond the surface 
To reach into your soul 
This love is not demanding 
My heart has told me so 
I hold onto my hero with faith enough to fly 
The power to imagine will keep this love alive 
Let's make the headlines loud and true 
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you 
Let's make the headlines loud and clear 
The best things suddenly happen when you are here 
If I lost my way you'd carry me home 
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave it alone (everyday) 
And it's just like everything matters when you are here 
(matters when you're here) 
And it feels so good every care's gone away 
Your love is alive and it's making me sing 
I could fly, wanna cry, want the whole world to know 
We are together, c'mon baby let's go 
Our words yet to be spoken will fall upon the page 
Spelling out true devotion, is all we need to say 
Let's make the headlines loud and true 
(say you love me and i'll say I love you too) 
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you 
(just remember what's in your heart) 
Let's make the headlines loud and clear 
(all the love I have i'll give to you my dear) 
The best things suddenly happen when you are here

If I lost my way you'd carry me home 
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave it alone (everyday) 
And it's just like everything matters when you are here

Take 
Me

You know that sweet Santa Claus is on his way 
Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
When the kids start singin' and the band begins to 
play 
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
Let the bells ring out for Christmas 
When we're skating in the park 
If the storm cloud paints it dark 
Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light my merry way 
Now the frosticals appeared 
And they've frozen up my beard 
And so we'll lie by the fire 
'Till the sleep simply melts them all away

There never is a Keanu but a dweeb lookin'at me 
But then even if I did score, he’s a loser in the dance floor 
Take a deep breath count 1 2 3

Venga, venga, marcha salida, toma esa música 
Me cantas deprisa, cuidado, cuidado, hey chico,

Well if I could stick my pen in my heart 
I would spill it all over the stage 
Would it satisfy, would it slide on by 
Would you think the boy is strange? 
Ain't he strange? 
If I could win ya, If I could sing ya 
A love song so divine 
Would it be enough for your cheating heart 
If I broke down and cried? 
If I cried? 
(Spice Girls...) 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, 
But I like it, I like it, yes I do 
Oh well I like it 
I like it 
Said I like it 
I like it 
But you know I like it 
Can't you see 
This this old boy has been lonely 
If I could stick a knife in my heart 
Suicide right on the stage 
Would it be enough for your teenage lust 
Would it help to ease the pain? 
Ease your brain? 
If I could dig down deep in my heart 
Well the feelings would flood on the page 
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya, 
Would you think the boy's insane? 
He's insane 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, 
But I like it 
I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it 
Baby I like It 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, 
But I like it, like it, yes I do 
I like it 
I like it, yeah thats right 
I like it (it's only rock n roll) 
Can't you see 
This this old boy has been lonely 
Do you think that your the only girl around 
I guess you think that your the only girl in town 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, 
But I like it, I like it, yes I do 
But I like it,

I like it, like it, and thats a fact

Makes me feel good, like you should. 
Listen up I gotta tell ya 
About the ins and outs and goings on, 
I wouldn't tell just anyone about the fox that I've been chasing, 
He's resistant, not persistant, it didn't stop me from homing in, 
'Cause I'm choosy not a floozy, Iget my hit and then I run with it. 
Last time lover, 
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy, and I know 
you want to get with me, 
Last time lover 
Do you wanna be my last time baby, 
could it be your first time maybe? 
We got up and down to it, like the dirty bass in the music, 
I got my major chords strummin', 
took some time and then we're really buzzin', 
First bite whet my appitite, second helping's always better, 
Started getting burning hot, I found my pride not easy, 
slowed it down I said stop. 
Last time lover, 
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy, and I know 
you want to get with me, 
Last time lover 
Do you wanna be my last time baby,

Last time lover, treat me right, 
lovin' under cover, all night, 
Last time lover, makes me feel good, 
lovin' under cover like you should, 
Last time lover 
Last time lover, treat me right, lovin' 
under cover, all night. 
Cool sexy, ever ready, someone fine, always steady, gentle hands, dirty mind, 
use your head and don't be blind, 
Words of love they don't wash with me, what's the rush no urgency you see, 
Crazy boy, potential lover, first and last lover brother there ain't no other, 
Crazy, sweety, cool but racy, steady ready go, yes!

Everything will work out fine 
if you let love 
Let Love lead the way 
Sitting there all alone 
in the window of her room 
Watching the world go by 
brings tears to her eyes 
All she sees is hurt and pain 
She wants to break the chain 
She'll keep pressing every day 
and she'll find her own sweet way hey

become the friend I never had.

Mama I love you, Mama I care, 
Mama I love you, Mama my friend, 
You´re my friend. 
I didn't want to hear it then but 
I'm not ashamed to say it now, 
Every little thing you 
said and did was right for me, 
I had a lot of time to think about, 
about the way I used to be, 
Never had a sense of my responsibility.

Are you waiting for the family to arrive 
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside 
Does your granny always tell ya 
That the old songs are the best 
And she's up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest 
So here it is Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun (it's Christmas!) 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun 
What will your daddy do 
When he sees your mommy kissing Santa Claus 
Aah-ah aah-aah 
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall 
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall 
Do you ride around the hillside 
In a party you have made 
When you land upon your head 
And you've been "sleighed" 
So here it is Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun (it's Christmas!)

Never compromise, accept no substitute 
I would rather wear a barrel 
Than conservative apparel 
Because a dress has always been my strongest suit 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere (oh-oh) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Stayin' in or hitting townwards 
From the top and working downwards 
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time 
Whether wig or hat or turban 
Whether clog, boudoir or urban 
Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime 
And the few who are invited 
To my wardrobe are delighted 
As they wander through my things to find a route 
That in negligee or formal 
I am anything but normal 
Because a dress has always been my strongest suit 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere (oh-oh) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere (oh-oh) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Now you don't need a recital 
Of the reasons why its vital 
That tonight my drapings will not be subdued 
That from coronet to sandal 
No one else is worth a candle 
That I couldn't make more impact in the nude 
So bring me all my finest 
Most audacious, my divinest 
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot 
Most arresting, most heart-stopping 
Most free-flowing, most eye-popping 
Because a dress has always been my strongest suit 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere (oh-oh) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere (oh-oh) 
(My dress has always been, my dress has always been) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
(My dress has always been my strongest suit) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere (oh-oh) 
(My strongest suit) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere (oh-oh) 
(Strongest suit, strongest suit) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
(My Dress has always been my strongest suit) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere (oh-oh) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
(Dress has always been my strongest suit) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere (oh-oh) 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere.</field>

Naivety and childhood left behind deprived of the goodness of mankind, 
Past encounters have made her strong, strong enough to carry on and on. 
[Emma and Mel B] 
Undress you with her eyes, uncover the truth from the lies 
Strip you down don't need to care, lights are low exposed and bare. 
[Emma,Mel C e Victoria] 
Naked 
Nothing but a smile upon her face 
Naked 
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind 
Naked 
This child has fallen from grace 
Naked 
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked. 
Naked 
[Geri] 
She knows exactly what to do with men like you, 
Inside out in her mind there's 
no doubt where you're coming from, 
mystery will turn you on. 
[Emma] 
Undress you with her eyes, uncover the truth from the lies 
Strip you down don't need to care, lights are low exposed and bare.

Nothing but a smile upon her face 
Naked 
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind 
Naked 
This child has fallen from grace 
Naked 
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked. 
[Emma - whispering] 
Hello...it's me 
I thought you'd understand 
Well maybe I should have kept my mouth shut 
I keep seeing such a pretty picture 
I'd rather be hated than pitied 
Maybe I should have left it to your imagination 
I just want to be me 
[Mel C] 
This angel's dirty face is sore, holding onto what she had before. 
Not sharing secrets with any old fool, now she's gonna keep her cool. 
She wants to get naked 
She wants to get naked. 
[All] 
Naked 
Nothing but a smile upon her face 
Naked 
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind 
Naked 
This child has fallen from grace 
Naked 
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked.

told me she needed a friend. 
Is she going crazy, baby's on the way, 
Seems like the day never ends.

Never shy (Never shy), 
Gotta try (Gotta try), Wherever you're going. 
Never give up on the good times, 
gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no, never give it up no), 
Never give up on the good times, 
living it up is a state of mind (Never give it up no, never give it up no) 
Bossanova baby, heart is never soul, 
Shouting but he's never heard 
Eyes all wide and open, streets are paved with gold, 
Someone's come back on their word 
Everybody needs some affection (Ah, ah, ah), 
Never shy (Never shy), 
Gotta try (Gotta try), Wherever you're going.

gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no, never give it up no), 
Never give up on the good times,

Down and dirty city, feeling out of place, 
Maybe you'd ran out of time, 
He treats her like a lady, smile upon her face, 
Make up the last of the lies 
Everybody needs some attention (Ah, ah, ah),

I know I'm gonna need 
Someone I can trust, someone who'll fight for me 
That's the way I love 
This is my time to work things out 
What I want from this life 
There will be someone out there for me 
That's the way I love 
It doesn't really matter whoever you are 
Don't matter where you go 
Just make sure you're there to answer when 
love comes around 
Don't be surprised 
When love knocks at your door 
You're the breath that I take 
You're the smile on my face 
Every time I breath in 
Brings me warmth from within 
When you touch me I start believing 
Loving is like Oxygen 
Even when we're so far apart 
I still feel you in my heart 
'Cos you've given me the greatest gift of all 
That's the way I love 
The way our love made easy 
But it could never be for me 
The situation seems so insane 
It's all about feeling without insecurities 
That's the way I love 
It doesn't really matter whoever you are 
Don't matter where you go 
Just make sure you're there to answer when 
love comes around 
Don't be surprised 
When love knocks at your door 
You're the breath that I take 
You're the smile on my face 
Everytime I breathe in 
Brings me warmth from within 
When you touch me I start believing 
Loving is like oxygen 
You're in every breath I take 
Imagine a life without love 
I'd be so afraid 
Cos the ove that we share would be 
hard to replace 
Baby hold me and never leave me 
This love is my oxygen 
This love is my oxygen 
Open your heart 
Take a deep breath 
Stop searching start believing 
Be sure you there to answer when love 
comes around 
Don't be surprised 
When true love knocks at your door 
You're the breath that I take 
You're the smile on my face 
Everytime I breathe in 
Brings me warmth from within 
When you touch me I start believing 
Loving is like oxygen 
You're in every breath that I take 
Imagine a world without love 
I'd be so afraid 
cos the love that we share would 
be hard to replace 
Baby hold me and never leave me

And all that I want from you is a promise 
You'll be there 
Say you will be there 
Won't you sing it with me 
If you put two and two together you 
Will see what our friendship is for 
If you can't work this equation then 
I guess I'll have to show you the door 
There is no need to say you love me 
It would be better left unsaid

Mothers, daughters and their daughters too 
Woman to woman 
We're singin' with you 
The "inferior sex" has got a new exterior 
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too 
Everybody take a look around 
Can you see, can you see, can you see 
There's a woman right next to you 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Standin' on their own two feet 
And ringin' on their own bells 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Oh we ain't makin' stories 
No, we ain't makin' plans 
Don't ya know that a man still loves a woman 
And a woman still loves a man 
Now there was a time (there was a time) 
When we used to say (when we used to say) 
That behind every great man 
There has to be a great woman 
Well in these times of change 
You know that it is no longer true 
So we're comin' out of the kitchen 
Cos there's somethin' we forgot to say to you 
And that's 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Standin' on their own two feet 
And ringin' on their own bells 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
(Doin it, doin it, do-doin' it, doin' it) 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
(All of my sisters, all of my sisters) 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves</field>

            <field name="lyrics">This is definitely my most favourite time of the year, 
Oh yeah mine too, yes, I think it is 
It is mine yeah, 
I reckon Christmas is all right, cause like the 
football season is still on. 
And you can watch football on Boxing Day when everyone 
is being really 
boring and, you're fed up of your presents. 
Listen right you can do whatever you want at Christmas 
as long as it's good, man 
Well what I say this Christmas is just do what you 
want, 
But make sure you do it like a lady! 
If you can't be good, be careful 
And make sure you get all your pressies off Santa! 
 
Just hear those sleigh bells 
jing-a-ling-ring-ting-a-ding-a-ling-ding, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together 
with you, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling 
you, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together

Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding

Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, and cozy are 
we, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Let's snuggle up together like birds of a feather 
would be, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or 
two, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together 
with you, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Remember to go to sleep on Christmas Eve otherwise 
Santa... 
Or stay up the whole night, 
No! You can't do that 'cause Father Christmas won't 
come then, 
You've gotta go to sleep 
Father Christmas doesn't exist now! 
Sssssshhhhhh! 
He does Vicki what are you talking about, Vicki that's 
terrible to say. 
We know cause we went to Lapland and we saw him, 
I know you might not get what you want but you're 
gonna get a hit in the 
face if you don't shut up! 
If not you'll get a bag of soot 
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, and cozy are 
we, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Let's snuggle up together like birds of a feather 
would be, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Lets take the road before us and sing a chorus or two,

Wherever you're going, high or low, 
Remember to sure enjoy the show, 
So climb aboard my journey deep inside, 
Better late than dead on time, 
Ooh, it's you I know that you have got to feed, 
Ooh, don't take from me more than you really need, 
More than you really need. 
We've got something kinda funny goin' on, 
We've got something kinda funny goin' on. 
Happiness is just a state of your mind, 
Keep searching who knows what you may find, 
Rules are for fools, and fool's paradise is hard to find, 
Play my game or get left behind, 
It's you that I know you have got to feed, 
Take from me what you feel that you need, 
You feel that you need. 
We've got something kinda funny goin' on, 
We've got something kinda funny goin' on. 
Repeat 
You've got it... 
Feelin' kind of funny when I'm with you honey, 
Feelin' kinda queezy I ain't that easy.

Would this work with only two? 
We need more for what we do 
Would this work with only three? 
Three's a crowd, bad company 
Would this work with only four? 
No way girl, we need one more 
Listen up, take my advice 
We need five for the power of Spice 
Give it up! 
Give it out! 
Take a stand!

(Mel B and Emma) relax your mind. 
The spicy girls are here on the planet earth. 
Are you too spicy? 
YES! 
(whistling) Aye-yoo! 
This song is full of valid information 
Information 
like 
(ring) never wee with your knickers on. 
Hold, hold (ring) a minute, that's my phone! (ring) 
Hello? 
Hello, um, about.. 
I can't believe my.. 
aaahhh 
It's um, it's a mad woman 
Get lost! 
Melanie's always on the phone. 
I'm not always on the phone! I used to be always on 
the phone 
but now I'm not cause I've got ear rot. 
And she's always late. 
No I'm not, it's my driver, he drives slow 
I like 
this bit. 
(whistling) 
(whistling) I've never been any good at whistling. 
You can hum then, not whistle. 
(whistling) 
Uh, hum? eh ha 
(humming) (Emma and Victoria) 
Where's Geri and Mel at this point? 
I think they're asleep. 
I thought it was a bit quiet. 
No, Geri's writin' a poem under a tree somewhere. 
No she's hugging that tree 
Hug that tree, Geri! 
You'd never guess what, you'd never believe this. 
Alright listen to this. 
Oh.. 
what is it, Geri? 
Oooh.. 
what is it? Listen, listen listen 
What is it? 
What is it? 
Friendship often survives the relationship from which 
it was neglected. 
What? 
Ignoring your conscience allows you to justify 
everything! 
Don't you agree? 
Geri, is you readin' that out of a book? 
Yeah 
Ha ha 
(humming) (Emma and Victoria) 
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri and Mel C) 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la AHHHH!!!!! 
That's what you got to do when you get really 
stressed, you just 
go AHHHH!!!!! 
(clapping) (laughing) 
I should be over there eatin' my sweets, I think. 
You're so cute 
Ginger! You're just so cute. 
Alright Ginge, how's your.. 
beep! 
No, it's Ginger like Ginger Rogers 
It's not like 
"ginge". 
Well, there's nothing wrong with being ginger. 
There is nothing wrong 
I'm out of a bottle anyway. 
ha ha ha (Mel C and Geri) 
(humming) Baby, Posh and Ginger and we've got Scary 
and Sporty! Yeah! 
(humming) (Emma and Victoria) 
Mixed together in a cooking pot, you have the Spice 
Girls! (Mel B and Geri) 
(humming) (Emma, Victoria and Mel B) 
Ba, ba, blah 
(humming) (Emma and Victoria) 
I want that Indian bit to come again 
Where is it? 
Ahh.. 
we are the chosen ones... 
(humming) (Emma and Victoria) 
it didn't last very long, did it? 
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri and Mel C) 
(scatting) Lift your knee up, tap it to the left. 
Gonna lift 
your knee up, tap it to the left. 
That could be a new dance. 
(humming) (Emma and Victoria) 
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri and Mel C) 
Ha, ha 
We don't wanna get in trouble now do we? No... 
I don't 
know what you mean by that, though 
I.. 
you know... 
we're not trying to be offensive... 
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri and Mel C) 
(humming) (Emma and Victoria) 
Exactly... 
Exactly, exactly. 
I quite like that. 
Yeah, I do too</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Why don't you step to me 
Take you for a ride 
Step to me 
I can tell you don't know what to do 
I can't believe what I heard yesterday 
About your boasting and your lying 
Whispering words you had no right to say 
And now there's no use denying (yeah) 
Big words and small promises 
You're living in your dreams (well) 
Smell the coffee cos it's time to wake up 
Sometimes the truth can be mean 
Now it's time, to prove your words to me 
If you think you've got what it takes 
There's no time for your insecurities 
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face 
Chorus 
Why don't you step to me 
Let me take you for a ride 
I'll take you where you can run, but you can't hide 
Come on and step to me 
Shame the devil, tell the truth 
I can tell you don't know what to do 
I'm tired of hearing from your cheap talking friends 
Just how you run me around 
I know you boys ain't got nothing better to do 
Than try to keep your girl down 
Small town big attitude 
Is more than just a state of your mind 
But you and me belong to me and you 
Cos honesty's so hard to find 
 
Now it's time 
Come prove your words to me 
If you think you've got what it takes 
There's no time for your insecurities 
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face 
Why don't you step to me 
Let me take you for a ride 
I'll take you where you can run, but you can't hide 
Come on and step to me 
Shame the devil, tell the truth 
Fooling yourself makes a fool out of you 
Why don't you step to me 
If you think you've got what it takes 
I heard the rumour 
About your loving well it's fake 
Ch-ch-ch-check yourself 
If you think I'm gonna suffer that 
What do you think I'm some kind of pussycat ? 
Chit chat to the girls and the boys you call your friends 
Tell them you've never been to the place where loving ends 
You never graduated 
from the school of love you see 
So come on boy why don't you step to me ? 
Now it's time 
Come prove your words to me 
If you think you've got what it takes 
There's no time for your insecurities 
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face 
Why don't you step to me 
Let me take you for a ride 
I'll take you where you can run, but you can't hide 
Come on and step to me 
Shame the devil, tell the truth 
I can tell you don't know what to do 
Why don't you step to me 
Let me take you for a ride 
I'll take you where you can run, but you can't hide 
Come on and step to me 
Shame the devil, tell the truth 
Fooling yourself makes a fool out of you

Take or leave it or just don't even bother 
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase 
Or will this be around forever 
Don't you know it's going too fast 
Racing so hard you know it won't last 
Don't you know, what can't you see 
Slow it down, read the sign 
So you know just where you're going 
Stop right now, thank you very much 
I need somebody with the human touch 
Hey you always on the run 
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun 
Do do.. 
always be together

Gotta keep it down honey 
Lay your back on the line

Don't be wasting my time 
You need less speed, get off my case 
You gotta slow it down baby 
Just get out of my face

Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun 
Stop right now, thank you very much

Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun 
Stop right now, (stop right now) thank you very much

Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere. 
Now that I believe in looking. 
Like my time on earth is cooking. 
With polka-dotted stripes or even checked. 
With some glamour guaranteeing. 
Every fiber of my being. 
Is displayed to quite remarkable effects. 
From your craddle via trousseau. 
To your death bed you're on view so. 
Never compromise accept no substitute. 
I would rather wear a barrel than conservativa apparel. 
Because a dress has always been my strongest suit. 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere. 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere. 
Staying in or hitting townwards. 
From the top and working downwards. 
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time. 
Whether wig or hat or turban. 
Whether clog, bourdoir or urban. 
Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime. 
And the few who are invited. 
To my wardrobe are delighted. 
As the wander through my things to find a route. 
That in negligee or formal, I am anything but normal. 
Because a dress has always been my strongest suit. 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere. 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere.

Of the reasons why it's vital. 
That tonight my droppings will not be subdued. 
That from coronet to sandal. 
No one else is worth a candle. 
That I couldn't make more impact in the nude. 
So bring me out my finest. 
Most audacious, my divinest. 
Most revealing, most expensive and too boot. 
Most arresting, most heart-stopping, most free-flowing, most eye-popping. 
Because a dress has always been my strongest suit. 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere. 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Ooh. 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere. 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Ooh. 
A dress has always been. 
A dress has always been. 
A dress has always been my strongest suit. 
My strongest suit.</field>

Take me away ohhh... 
I couldn't say how it happened 
I couldn't say how the story began 
But just like the music you came in time 
I couldn't hold you forever 
I couldn't change what I feel inside 
But why did you come to my life anyway? 
You bring me joy, and ever pain 
Like sunshine colored by the rain 
Just take my hand, 
Baby you can lift me away 
Take me away, 
I could stay here forever, (ohhh...) 
Take me away, 
And there's nothing I can do, (ohhh...) 
So take me away 
Take me away with you... 
I (I...) couldn't wait for tomorrow, 
I (I...) couldn't stand how our love should be, 
There's somethings in life 
You could never change, 
You took my love 
Knowing you again 
Me sad and bust 
I can never leave without you, love 
Could only mean nothing to me 
Take me away 
I could stay here forever 
Take me away 
And there's nothing i can do, (ohh...) 
So take me away 
Take me away with you 
Forever, forever, forever, sweet baby 
Forever, baby, forever (ever), forever, 
Take me away 
I could stay here forever 
Take me away, 
And there's nothing I can do, (ohh...) 
So take me away, take me away, 
Take me away, (with you) 
Forever, I could stay here forever 
Forever and ever 
And there's nothing I can do, (take me away) 
Ohh baby, forever, so take me away, 
Forever, take me away (ahh....), 
Take me away, take me away, with you 
Forever, ahh, forever, and ever, 
Take me away, please take me 
Forever (forever) forever, and ever, and ever 
Take me away.</field>

So do your searching, until you're down (ahh-aahh) 
Then realise, you're on you're home ground(ahh-aahh) 
Sittin' in a white room dreaming of a life 
You have got me thinking, what is paradise? 
Should I take an ocean drive, coolin' from the sun 
Silver screen got me thinking this is how it should be done 
Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 
Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 
Stand together alone, not knowing who you are 
Friendly strangely, strangely friendly 
Would you keep me warm? 
Would you keep me warm? 
You know, you can be your paradise 
A heart can keep me warm 
You can have your own dream life 
Step into your comfort zone (Emma and Victoria) 
Comfort zone 
Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 
Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 
Ain't nobody to take me home 
Cos I'm here, yes where I belong 
I may leave cos I'm on my way 
But my home it will always stay [spoken] 
Ain't nobody to take me home 
Cos I'm here, yes where I belong 
I may leave cos I'm on my way 
But my home it will always stay [spoken] 
Ain't nobody to take me home 
Cos I'm here, yes where I belong 
I may leave cos I'm on my way 
But my home it will always stay 
[Repeat] 
[Spoken in Counterpart] 
So it's all just free falling falls 
Huh, out of time 
You've got yours, I've got mine 
Should all this be so precious? 
Maybe I should be a little humble? 
Slate to fear, cause I could stumble 
So do your searching until you're down 
Cos you're on home ground 
Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 
Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)

We could have had it all 
But you turned your back 
It started with dreams 
It started a team 
But you weren't as true as you aways seemed 
You promised to love 
No matter what 
Yet you turned your back and walked out on me 
What made you think 
That without me 
Your life woud be so much better but now you see 
That without me 
Your hopes and dreams 
Will never be as good as what you had with me 
Chorus 
So tell me why - oh why 
Did we end up this way 
When we tried - we tried 
To make everything ok 
Tell me why - oh why 
Did you feel you coudn't stay 
When we coud have stayed together 
But you wanted it this way 
You never thought 
That I would find out 
All of the things you said about us 
When you're the one who 
Decides to 
Erase all our plans and say you are through 
What made you think 
That without me 
Your life woud be so much better but now you see 
That without me 
Your hopes and dreams 
Will never be as good as what you had with me 
Chorus (repeat) 
Now tell me was it 
Your plan all along 
To try and use me 
And then let go 
Now where is the trust 
We had between us 
I guess that you never played by the rules 
Can you tell me?

Like I have with you, 
Can't explain the things you do 
But boy when you 
tell me softly you love me too 
It's like I know we were meant to be 
So for eternity, 
You will have a part of me, 
And all I need is for you to stay right here with me 
Time goes by, but we stand still 
I know it does, I know it does 
Love you for eternity I will 
I know that we were meant to be 
You were meant to be, my love 
That's how I feel when your with me 
You are the reason that my heart beats 
I know I never thought I would ever fall so deep, 
but know I see that the love 
that we share is oh, so sweet 
What if I told you that I believe 
that you are my soul, my destiny, 
what if I was to say in every way 
deep in my heart is where you’ll be 
Timeeee 
Time goes by, but we stand still 
I'm still right here 
Love you for eternity I will 
I'll never go 
I know that we were meant to be 
we were meant to be 
That’s how I feel when your with me 
Time goes by, but we stand still 
Love you for eternity I will 
I know that we were meant to be 
That’s how I feel when your with me 
As you hold me close so tenderly, 
and I watch you fall to sleep, 
I see in you the one who now 
completes the half of me I used to be 
Time goes by but we stand still 
Love you forever. 
yes, I will

Stay away from my window 
Stay away from my back door too 
Disconnect the telephone line 
Relax baby and draw that blind 
Kick off your shoes and sit right down 
Loosen off that pretty French gown 
Let me pour you a good long drink 
Ooh baby don't you hesitate, ah 
Tonight's the night 
It's gonna be alright 
Cause I love you girl/boy 
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now, nobody 
Come on angel my heart's on fire 
Don't deny your man's desire 
You'd be a fool to stop this tide 
Spread your wings 
And let me come inside, cause 
Tonight's the night 
It's gonna be alright 
Cause I love you girl/boy 
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now, nobody, nobody 
Don't say a word my virgin child 
Just let your inhibitions run wild 
The secret is about to unfold 
Upstairs before the night's too old, yeah 
Tonight's the night 
It's gonna be alright (it's gonna be alright) 
Cause I love you girl/boy 
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now 
Nobody, nobody Rod, nobody.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Love is blind, as far as the eye can see, 
deep and meaningless, words to me. 
Easy lover, I need a friend, 
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end. 
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me,(Pleases me) 
But short term solution ain't no resolution, That ain't no release for me. 
Too much of something is bad enough, 
But something coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too much of nothing is just as tough, 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
Unwrap yourself from around my finger, 
Hold me too tight or left to linger. 
Something fine built to last, 
Slipped up there I guess we're running out of time too fast. 
Yes my dear you know he soothes me ,(Moves me) 
There's no complication was no explanation, It's just a groove in me. 
Too much of something is bad enought,(Bad enough) 
But something coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too much of nothing is just as tough,(Just as tough) 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
What part of no don't you understand, (Understand, Understand) 
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can, boy who thinks he can. 
Too much of something is bad enough, 
But something coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too much of nothing is just as tough, 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
Too Much of nothing so why don't we give it a try, 
Too much of something we're gonna be living a life. 
Too Much of nothing so why don't we give it a try, 
Too much of something we're gonna be living a life.</field>

Like a love song never heard 
Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time, 
Promises made, every memory saved 
As reflections in my mind

Back where I belong now, was it just a dream,

Now the scene has just been set 
Boy, you ain't seen nothing yet

Got me walking on air 
(Why not take a walk with me, down the road of ecstasy) 
(You've got me walking on) 
Every time I feel tonight 
You made me feel like a butterfly 
All I wanna do is love you baby 
You're holding me, squeezing me 
You're rocking me eternally 
All I wanna do is love you baby 
You got me walking 
Boy you got me walking 
You got me walking on air 
You got me walking 
Boy you got me walking 
You got me walking on air 
Every time I feel your arms around me 
I feel the pressure disappear 
No words can measure the only kind of pleasure 
That I feel when you are near 
X-rated baby, is what I wanna be 
You know me, eternal ecstasy 
This won't be a casual affair 
You got me walking on air 
(You've got me walking on air) 
Got me walking on air (got me walking on air) 
You've got me walking on air (walking, walking) 
(You got me walking, boy you got me walking) 
Got me walking on air (you've got me walking on air) 
(You got me walking on air) 
You've got me walking on air 
(You got me walking, boy you got me walking) 
Got me walking on air 
(You got me walking on air) 
You've got me walking on air 
(I know what I need tonight) 
Got me walking on air 
(Round and round let me go, always let me need you know) 
You've got me walking on air 
(Baby, don’t let go hold me tight) 
Got me walking on air 
(Why not take a walk with me, down the road of ecstasy) 
You've got me walking on</field>

That you felt that you 
Had to do to me what she had done to you 
Now you prove everything that my friend had 
To read about you was true, now it's over and we're through 
You thought that you'd play me 
And have things your way 
So can you blame me 
For walking away 
What did I do to 
Be treated so bad - treated so bad 
Now you have lost me 
And I was the best thing you'd ever had 
CHORUS 
Now you think that I don't know what's going on 
But I know with you I just keep wasting my time 
I can't keep holding on 
'Cos I know with you I just keep wasting my time 
Can't you see 
That the things you said and did 
Never happened, made believe 
That you saw something special inside of me 
Now you seem to think 
That you can't live your live without me 
Sorry baby you can't do this to me 
You thoght that you'd play me 
And have things your way 
So can you blame me 
For walking away 
What did I do to 
Be treated so bad 
Now you have lost me 
And I was the best thing you'd ever had 
CHORUS (repeat) 
And you think that I don't know what's going on 
But I know with you I just keep wasting my time 
I can't keep holding on 
But I know I just keep wasting my time 
Now you know that 
I can't live without you 
You should see that it's not all about you 
This time you played too many games 
Now it's time to see 
That I won't waste my life no not me

You thought that this was love 
But my plan, wasn't that for us 
I thought that you would understand 
I didn't want you for my full time man 
I like the way you made me feel that night 
It's something that I can't deny 
But I've been hurt before 
I can't take it no more 
That's why, that's why 
A weekend love is all it was (all it was) 
Nothing serious because 
We're playing games, we're only young (ooh) 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (just a weekend love) 
You thought you'd break the rules 
You thought that I would be a fool 
But now that the tables have turned 
This is a lesson you didn't want to learn, learn 
I loved the way you make me feel inside 
It's something I just had to try 
But I've been hurt before 
I can't take it no more 
That's why, that's why 
A weekend love is all it was (that's all it was for me) 
Nothing serious because (serious, just because) 
We're playing games, we're only young (games we're only young) 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (just a weekend love) 
A weekend love is all it was (just a weekend love, that's all, it was) 
Nothing serious because (nothing serious because) 
We're playing games we're only young (we're only, oooh, na-na na na) 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (a weekend love) 
Don't try to make me believe that you'd never hurt someone 
Now that pain has come back to you 
Thought the love you had was true 
And now you don't know what to do, oh 
Everytime I turn around you're standing right there 
I really don't want you and I really don't care 
I can't think about you no not forever 
What we had was good but theres much more better 
You try to blame me, I'll put the blame on you 
You play the game baby, I can play the game too 
You say you want me back it's a simple fact 
Darkchild and all my girls got my back like that, yeah 
A weekend love is all it was (love) 
Nothing serious because (serious because) 
We're playing games, we're only young (ooh-yeah, games cos we're only young) 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (ooh-whoa, ah-ah, ah-ah) 
A weekend love is all it was (love is it all it was) 
Nothing serious because (serious because) 
We're playing games, we're only young (games we're only young) 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (just a weekend)

Yearning feelin' inside me 
Ooh, deep inside me 
And it hurts so bad 
You came into my heart

With a burning love 
That stings like a bee 
Now that I surrender 
So helplessly 
You now wanna leave me

The top is high so your roots are forgotten 
Giving is good as long as you're getting, 
What's driving you it's ambition and betting,

Some kind of superstar, 
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it,

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it,

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it,

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, 
show me how good you are. 
You're swelling out in the wrong direction, 
you've got the bug, superstar you've been bitten, 
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long, 
playing the snake of the ladder, but you're wrong.

When I'm racing with destiny 
Then in that one moment of time 
I will be, I will be free 
I will be free</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I believe the children are our future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
Everybody's searching for a hero 
People need someone to look up to 
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs 
A lonely place to be 
And so I learned to depend on me 
I decided long ago 
Never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I failed, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believed 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
I believe the children are our future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
I decided long ago 
Never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I failed, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believed 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
And if by chance that special place 
That you've been dreaming of 
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love</field>

            <field name="lyrics">(Verse 1) 
As I lay me down 
Heaven hear me now 
I'm lost without a cause 
After giving it my all 
Winter storms have come 
And darkened my sun 
After all that I've been through 
Who on earth can I turn to? 
(Chorus) 
I look to you 
I look to you 
After all my strength is gone 
In you I can be strong 
I look to you 
I look to you 
And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 
I look to you 
(Verse 2) 
About to lose my breath 
There's no more fighting left 
Sinking to rise no more 
Searching for that open door 
And every road that I've taken 
Led to my regret 
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it 
Nothing to do but lift my head 
(Chorus) 
I look to you 
I look to you 
After all my strength is gone 
In you I can be strong 
I look to you 
I look to you 
And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 
I look to you 
(Bridge) 
My love is all broken (oh Lord) 
My walls have come (coming down on me) 
tumbling down on me (All the rain is falling) 
The rain is falling 
Defeat is calling (set me free) 
I need you to set me free 
Take me far away from the battle 
I need you to shine on me 
(Chorus) 
I look to you 
I look to you 
After all my strength is gone 
In you I can be strong 
I look to you 
I look to you 
And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 
I look to you 
I look to you 
I look to you...</field>

Clock strikes upon the hour 
And the sun begins to fade 
Still enough time to figure out 
How to chase my blues away 
I've done alright up to now 
It's the light of day that shows me how 
And when the night falls, loneliness calls 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
I've been in love and lost my senses 
Spinning through the town 
Sooner or later the fever ends 
And I wind up feeling down 
I need a man who'll take a chance 
On a love that burns hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart calls 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Somebody oo Somebody oo 
Somebody who loves me yeah 
Somebody oo Somebody oo 
To hold me in his arms oh 
I need a man who'll take a chance 
On a love that burns hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart calls 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody

Can't you see the hurt in me 
I feel so all alone 
I wanna run to you 
I wanna run to you 
Won't ya hold me in your arms

I wanna run to you

Tell me will you stay 
Or will you run away 
Each day, each day I play the role 
Of someone always in control 
But at night I come home and turn the key 
There's nobody there, no one cares for me 
Oh woah what's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams 
Without someone to share them with 
Tell me what does it mean 
I wanna run to you

Run away, no

I need you here to wipe away my tears 
To kiss away my fears 
No if you only knew how much I wanna run to you 
Ya know I wanna run to you

And I'm standin' on the front line 
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life 
I will say I spent it with you 
If I wake up in World War 3 
I see destruction and poverty 
And I feel like I want to go home 
It's okay if you're coming with me 
Cause your love is my love 
and my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 
Cause your love is my love 
and my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 
If I lose my fame and fortune 
And I'm homeless on the street 
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station 
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me 
As the years they pass us by 
we stay young through each other's eyes 
And no matter how old we get 
It's okay as long as I got you babe 
Cause your love is my love

Cause your love is my love

It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 
If I should die this very day 
Don't cry, cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay 
And no matter what people say 
I'll be waiting for you after judgement day

            <field name="lyrics">Many nights we prayed 
With no proof anyone could hear 
In our hearts a hopeful song 
We barely understood 
Now we are not afraid 
Although we know there's much to fear 
We were moving mountains 
Long before we knew we could 
(Oh yes) 
There can be miracles when you believe 
Though hope is frail its hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles you can achieve 
When you believe, somehow you will 
You will when you believe 
(oh yeah) 
In this time of fear 
When prayers so often proved in vain 
Hope seems like the summer birds 
Too swiftly flown away 
Yet now I'm standing here 
My heart so full I can't explain 
Seeking faith and speaking words 
I never thought I'd say 
There can be miracles when you believe 
(when you believe) 
Though hope is frail its hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles you can achieve 
(you can achieve) 
When you believe, somehow you will 
You will when you believe 
They don't always happen when you ask 
And it's easy to give in to your fears (oh) 
But when your blinded by your pain 
Can't see your way straight though the rain 
a small but still, resilient voice 
Says love is very near (yeah yeah) 
There can be miracles 
(miracles) 
When you believe 
(lord when you believe oh ho) 
Though hope is frail 
(though hope is frail) 
It's hard to kill 
(it's haaaard to kill oh oh) 
Who knows what miracles you can achieve 
When you believe, somehow you will 
somehow you will 
You will when you believe 
You will when you believe 
Just believe (2x)..

You will when you believe</field>

You've got your family, and they need you there 
Though I try to resist, being last on your list 
But no other man's gonna do 
So I'm saving all my love for you 
It's not very easy, living all alone 
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own 
But each time I try, I just break down and cry 
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue 
Cause I'm saying all my love for you 
You use to tell me, we'd run away together 
Love gives you the right to be free 
You said be patient, just wait a little longer 
But that's just an old fantasy 
I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more 
Gonna get an old feeling, when you walk 
through that door. 
Cause tonight, is the night 
When I'm feeling allright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yes I'm saving all my loving 
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 
No other woman, is gonna love you more 
Cause tonight is the night, that I'm feeling alright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yeah I'm saving all my love 
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

While riding I think of us, dear

At work I just take time 
And all through my coffee break time 
I say a little prayer for you

For me there is no one but you 
Please love me too

Say you love me too

An in the evening when the moon is high, 
He holds me close

Lost touch with my soul 
I had nowhere to turn 
I had nowhere to go 
Lost sight of my dream 
Thought it would be the end of me, uh 
I thought I'd never make it through 
I had no hope to hold on to, I 
I thought I would break 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down and I tumbled 
But I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain 
I didn't know my own strength 
Survived my darkest hour 
My faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up 
Hold my head up high 
I was not built to break 
I didn't know my strength, oh 
 
Found hope in my heart 
I found the light to life 
My way out of the dark 
Found all that I need 
Here Inside of me 
Oh, I thought I'd never find my way 
I thought I'd never lift that weight 
I thought I would break 
 
I didn't know my own strength

Survived my darkest hour 
My faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up 
Hold my head up high 
I was not built to break 
I didn't know my strength 
 
There were so many times, I 
Wondered how I'd get through the night, I 
Thought I took all that I could take 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down and I tumbled 
But I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain, oh oh

I didn't know my strength 
 
Mmmmmm

            <field name="lyrics">Friday night you and your boys went out to eat 
Then they hung out 
But you came home around three 
If six of y'all went out 
Then four of you were really cheap 
Cause only two of you had dinner 
I found your credit card receipt 
It's not right, but it's okay 
I'm gonna make it anyway 
Pack your bags up and leave 
Don't you dare come running back to me 
It's not right, but it's okay 
I'm gonna make it anyway 
Close the door behind you 
Leave your key 
I'd rather be alone 
Than unhappy 
I'll pack your bags 
So you can leave town for a week (yes I am) 
The phone rings 
And then you look at me 
You said it was one of your friends 
Down on 54th St. 
So why did 213 
Show up on your Caller I.D. 
It's not right, but it's okay 
I'm gonna make it anyway 
Pack your bags up and leave 
Don't you dare come running back to me 
It's not right, but it's okay 
I'm gonna make it anyway 
Close the door behind you 
Leave your key 
I'd rather be alone 
Than unhappy 
I have been through all of this before 
(I've been through all this before) 
So how would you think 
(Don't think, don't think about it) 
That I could stand around and take some more? 
Things are gonna change 
(Things are got to change baby) 
'Cos I don't wanna be a fool anymore 
(You stay, not chance boy) 
That's why you have to leave 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhh) 
So don't turn around to see my face 
(So you don't turn around) 
There's no more fears and tears left 
For you to see 
Was it really worth you going out like that? 
Tell me.. 
oh yeah 
Was it really worth (5x) 
Was it really worth you going out like that? 
Tell me.. 
ohhh. 
See I'm moving on 
And I refuse to turn back 
See all of this time 
I thought I had somebody down for me 
It turns out (2x) 
Out! 
It turns out (3x) 
Out! 
It turns out 
You were making a fool of me 
[Chorus (5x until fade)] 
Get up and leave! 
I'd rather be alone than unhappy 
It's not right.. 
it's ok baby 
I got pay my own rent 
Pay my light bills, take care my babies 
I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be all right (6x)</field>

I've had something on my mind 
You see I haven't been the same 
Since that cold november day 
We said we needed space 
But all we found was a empty place 
And the only things I've learned 
Is that I need you desperately 
So here I am, and can you please tell me.... 
Where do broken hearts go 
Can they find their way home? 
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there 
And if somebody loves you 
Won't they always love you 
I look in your eyes 
And I know that you still care for me 
Oooooooooooh....... 
I've been around enough to know 
That dreams don't turn to gold 
And that there is no easy way 
No you just can't run away 
And what we had was so much more 
Than we ever had before 
And no matter how I try 
You're always on my mind 
So here I am, and can you please tell me 
Where do broken hearts go 
Can they find their way home? 
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there 
And if somebody loves you 
Won't they always love you 
I look in your eyes 
And I know that you still care for me 
Oooooooooooh....... 
Now that I am here with you 
I'll never let you go 
I look in your eyes

Though I'm not afraid to let it show 
I'll tell the world I want everyone to know 
There's nobody who does me like you do 
All of my love is yours tonight

All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it hurts me more than you know 
So much more than it shows

In someone else's arms, 
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once 
All at once

else's day 
She took your smile away 
And left me with just memories, all at once

I look to you 
You... 
About to lose my breath 
There's no more fighting left 
Thinking to rise no more 
Searching for that open door (door) 
And every road that I've taken 
(Every road that I've taken) 
Led to my regret 
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it 
Nothing to do but lift my head

I've sung a lot of songs and made some bad rhymes 
I've acted out my life on stages 
With ten thousand people watching, Well 
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you 
I know your image of me is what I hope to be 
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see 
There's no one more important to me 
Baby, can't you please see through me 
We're alone now and I'm singing this song to you 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing 
You came out in front when I was hiding 
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together 
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding 
I love you in place where there's no space or time 
I love you for my life you are a friend of mine 
And when my life is over, Remember when we were together 
We were alone and I was singing this song for you 
this song is for you x3 
this song is for you, you... 
This song is for you 
 
I love you in place where there's no space or time 
I love you for my life you are a friend of mine 
And when my life is over Remember when we were together 
We were alone and I was singing this song to you 
We were alone and I was singing this song to you 
I was singing this song for you

I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go

There's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by 
All that heaven and earth will allow 
All that matters is right here and now 
Now the world is filled with wonder 
You've turned my life around in just one day 
I love the spell you've put me under 
With just one kiss you take my breath away 
After we make love 
Feels so good to be lost in the afterglow 
You're all I'm dreaming of 
I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go

There's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by

Were well worth going through 
I'm so glad I never gave my heart away 
It's like I've waited all my life 
So I can give it all to you 
I've been waiting such a long time 
For a love that's real to come my way

But he's all the man that I need. 
And in the morning when I kiss his eyes, 
He takes me down and rocks me slow. 
An in the evening when the moon is high, 
He holds me close 
And won't let go, 
He won't let go!

If you believed in me, you wouldn't mess around 
It's not like I don't know you been with every girl in town 
You got a lot of nerve to think, I just close my eyes 
While you walk around so full of it, I give you my surprise 
I don't need your kinda love 
I don't need your kinda trust 
I don't want you, anymore 
I don't need your kinda kisses 
I don't want to be your Mrs. 
I don't want you, anymore 
I believe that angels watch everything we do 
And all the wrong your doin', just might come back on you 
I believe in phone calls, when your not by my side 
Especially when it's lonely, in the middle of the night 
If you believe that true love is only made in bed 
Lord have mercy on you, chivalry is dead 
You got a lot of nerve to think, to think that I'm still down 
While you've taken me for granted, boy I'm thru, I'm outta town 
(Chorus) 
So baby,(so baby) 
You can kiss this girl goodbye 
I'm through with ya 
Movin'on with my life 
No more pain, no more fears 
I'm movin' on 
I'm keepin' on 
I'm through with all the fears 
Your kinda love 
Your kinda trust 
I don't want you, don't need you, 
can't have you 
Your kinda kisses 
To be your Mrs. 
I don't want you

I believe this has to have a meaning 
Lightening had to strike to tonight 
´Cause the two of us are finally meeting 
In this place at this time 
I feel safe when I look in your eyes 
I feel like I know you from another life 
And it makes me wish I wasn´t so pressed for time 
I can´t catch my breath ´cause you take it away 
The best writer in town could not find words to stay 
Now there´s so many things I wanna get to know 
I wish that I could stay but I got to go 
So I´m gonna call you tonight 
I will baby, just as soon as I get time alone 
I´m gonna call you tonight, I will baby 
Just as soon as I get home 
That´s the way it goes in life 
You get busy when you just don't wanna 
There's never enough time day or night 
You have to make it so baby, 
I'm gonna make a way to connect 
´Cause your face is one I can't forget 
I feel like I know you from another life 
And it makes me wish I wasn´t so pressed for time 
I can't catch my breath 'cause you take it away 
The best writer in town could not find words to stay 
Now there´s so many things I wanna get to know 
I wish that I could stay but I got to go 
I can´t catch my breath ´cause you take it away 
The best writer in town not find words to stay 
Now there´s so many things I wanna get to know 
I wish that I could stay but I got to go 
Destiny, I believe in it 
Meant to be, don´t you see it´s possible 
That with this kind of magic anything can happen 
And if you wanna know then you stay by the phone 
You stay by the phone 
I can´t catch my breath ´cause you take it away 
The best writer in town could not find words to stay 
Now there´s so many things I wanna get to know 
I wish that I could stay but I got to go 
So I'm gone call you tonight, I will baby 
I will baby, just as soon as I get time alone 
I´m gonna call you tonight, I will baby

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth 
(Oh yes it is now.) 
Long lay the world 
In sin and error pining 
'Til He appeared 
And the soul felt its worth. 
A thrill of hope 
The weary world rejoices 
For yonder breaks 
A new and glorious morn. 
Fall on your knees 
O hear the angels' voices 
O night divine 
O o night when Christ was born 
O night 
O holy, holy night 
O night divine 
Fall on your knees 
O hear the angels' voices 
O night divine 
O o night when Christ was born

So much hate going round and I've had enough 
I've invited you for the love 
Though we been going through changes 
Just trying to make it from day to day 
Tonight don't you worry about a thing 
Just cast your cares away

Why you should clap your hands and jump for joy 
There's something we can believe in

Over and over 
I look in your eyes 
You are all I desire 
You have captured me 
I want to hold you 
I want to be close to you 
I never want to let go

I wish that this night would never end 
I need to know

Could I hold you for a lifetime 
Could I look into your eyes 
Could I have this night to share 
This night together 
Could I hold you close beside me 
Could I hold you for all time

Now you're here by my side 
Your are next to me 
I want to hold you and touch you and taste you 
And make you want no one but me

I wish that this kiss could never end 
No No 
Oh baby please Could I

The way you take your sweet time 
All around me like your work of art 
Who said you know me so good 
You're a dangerous angel 
Should have seen right from the start 
Still I'd never change you 
Anyway? 
You've got me dancin on the smooth edge 
You've got me dancin on the smooth edge 
Hearts on fire 
Filled with desire 
And I'm waiting for the words you say 
On the smooth edge 
On the smooth edge 
So funny how the night just slips on by 
In a long slow dance with you 
Crazy how you keep on leading me boy 
To a place beyond taboo 
You're a cool persuader 
Hey don't you have no shame 
Still I'm gonna take you 
Anyway? 
You've got me dancin on the smooth edge 
You've got me dancin on the smooth edge 
Hearts on fire 
Filled with desire 
And I'm reaching for your every move 
Dancin on the smooth edge

            <field name="lyrics">I'm sitting here, 
In my own head thinking 
how you could be staring in 
got my number too 
and I'm writing you 
contemplating on the paper what I should do 
On the fireplace with the mail man 
should I tell you or should I hold it in 
If my heart wasn't in it 
baby you could just forget it 
I'd be gone in a New York minute 
 
You never give me attention 
I know you never had bad intentions for us 
so I'm writing you but I always fail to mention 
cause you know I really don't like to fuss 
so I'm gonna hold it in 
 
Chorus: 
(I'm writing you a) Dear John letter 
I tried to stay but it never got better 
I couldn't tell you face to face but I, 
I had to let you know 
Sometimes I wanna hit the door 
(I'm writing you Dear John) 
Sometimes I think that I've had enough 
my hands freeze and I can't write fast enough, 
I wanna get away but I can't obey when my heart speaks, 
you know I'm listening 
some days I'm really touchy and 
some days I'm willing to forget and 
some days I'm still in love with you 
some days I'm sad and blue 
 
When I don't check myself 
I get frustrated with you 
And I don't know what I'm gonna do 
I know that it's not just you 
It's some of my negligence too 
And I can't go through with mailing this to you 
 
Chorus (2x) 
When I don't check myself 
I get frustrated with you 
And I don't know what I'm gonna do 
I know that it's not just you 
It's some of my negligence too 
And I can't go through with mailing this to you

            <field name="lyrics">Oooh Yeah 
Nothing's better than family, 
For the ones who love you so 
Be a shoulder to cry on when you are in need 
They will never leave you alone 
when your friends bring you down 
And they drag you through the dirt 
And nobody is around 
They will carry you through the hurt 
Just remember that family comes first 
where you gonna run to? when no one is around 
Do you think how dare they will love you. 
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground), 
When you feel your strength is almost gone 
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak) 
And you don't think you can keep holding on 
And they stand for your feet (just remember) 
Family comes first 
 
I can see you crying - someone broke your heart, 
Instead of being with those who love you, 
you spend time apart, It's because you think 
they won't understand 
The pain you're going through, So you don't reach out your 
hand for them, 'til they'll pull and reach for you. 
 
Just remember that family comes first 
where you gonna run to? when no one is around 
Do you think how dare they will love you. 
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground), 
When you feel your strength is almost gone 
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak) 
And you don't think you can keep holding on 
And they stand for your feet (just remember) 
Family comes first 
 
Don't you be ashamed of your family, put you into this earth, 
and thats what its worth unconditionally, sometimes you may 
disagree and wont see eye to eye 
Don't you run away they will be right by your side 
ooooh ohhh 
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around 
Do you think how dare they will love you. 
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground), 
When you feel your strength is almost gone 
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak) 
And you don't think you can keep holding on 
And they stand for your feet (just remember) 
Family comes first 
yeahyeah (yeah yeah yeah) 
Comes first</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Had a dream last night 
And the world stopped turning 
But your madness it kept on 
Guess I wasn't too bright 
And I really wasn't learning 
Should have seen it all along 
All those sweet, sweet kisses 
And those sweet red roses 
They convinced me it was you 
I made you exclusive 
Now it's so conclusive 
That you wasn't doing it too 
(Chorus) 
If you told me from the start that you'd played around 
I would have been fine 
Then I woulda played too and I guess 
I woulda had a good time 
Something didn't feel right 
And I wish I knew it 
I just could not see your games 
I was there for you 
And you put me through it 
Why would you bring me so much pain 
I was still there for you 
Cause I did adore you 
While my dogs would chew you out 
Tried to be so nice 
On those lonely, lonely night 
But I should have figured you out 
(Chorus) 
Baby you're so fine (You are the one that I love) 
You are so (Your love was sent from above) 
You're fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine</field>

Ain't no place I'd rather be than with you 
Loving you 
Day will make the way for night 
All we need is candlelight 
And a song, soft and long 
Well, you'd like to think 
We're alone with a love unlike no other 
Sad to see, a new horizon slowly coming into view 
(Chorus:) 
I want to be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 
Lovely as a ray of sun 
That touches me when the morning comes 
Feels good to me 
My loving me, yeah 
Smoother then a gentle breeze 
Flowing from my mind with ease 
Soft as can be 
Well, when you're loving me, ooh baby 
Love to be 
Riding the waves of love enchanted with your touch 
It seems to me 
We can sail together in and out of mystery 
(Chorus) 
Paradise, I hafta think, can't feel as secure again 
You're the key 
And this I see 
Now and then I lose my way 
Confusing words to try and say what I feel 
Yeah, your love is real 
I might as well, sign my name on a card that's been saying better 
See, time will tell 
Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do</field>

This song is for you 
To all the haters in the place 
Here's something at you 
It's been a long crazy week, all I want is a little time 
Rest my hands, cross my feet, let it go tonight 
Leave the stress at home, tell the driver go 
You ain't gonna kill my vibe, oh no 
I look at you, you look at me, you are ready now 
What I want, what I need is you and me on the floor 
I can feel your love when our bodies touch 
If anyone is feeling like me tonight 
Now throw your hands up for the next three minutes it's about the lovers 
(you know it, you know it) 
Baby stand up if you're single but you're looking for another 
(you know it, you know it) 
Ladies tell your men you love them (yeah…) 
Fellows tell your girl you love her (yeah…) 
So throw your hands up for the next three minutes it's about the lovers 
Thinking about the ones that are looking down on you and me 
Lovers in together now, now I'm completely free 
Life is way too short, you might as well get yours 
Lord knows I'm doing it 
If your lover ain't around 
that don't mean you can't get down 
(you know it, you know it) 
And if you came her all alone 
Find someone and hold them close 
(you know it, you know it) 
So throw your hands up 
Baby let me see you stand up 
And if you're single it don´t matter 
'cause this song is for everyone who believes in love</field>

Remember when 
It all began 
We were all in love 
Then came the friends 
Telling you when 
Your time for me was good enough 
I constantly 
Had to compete 
With your crew and their schemes 
Remembering 
Back in the day 
I used to mean everything 
(If we could just get it back) 
To the way it used to be 
(My only wish would be that) 
Nothing would change for you and me 
(I remember how it was) 
And I know that for a fact 
(We were oh so deep in love) 
If we could just get it back 
Now tell me why 
So many nights 
You had so much to do 
When you said bye 
Sometimes I tried 
I tried to make you choose 
Now tell me how 
You can allow 
You boys to control 
The time we shared 
It was unfair 
But now you need to know 
(Now if I told you) 
That I'm moving on 
(Boy what would you do) 
Things just ain't the same 
(We were supposed to) 
Conquer everything yeah 
(Boy let me tell you) 
You've got to make a change 
(If we could just get it back) 
To the way it used to be 
(My only wish would be that) 
Nothing would change for you and me 
(I remember how it was) 
And I know that for a fact 
(We were oh so deep in love) 
If we could just get it back 
(If we could just get it back) 
To the way it used to be

Nothing would change for you and me

Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
Everybody's searching for a hero 
People need someone to look up to 
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs 
A lonely place to be 
And so I learned to depend on me 
I decided long ago 
Never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I failed, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believed 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
I believe the children are our future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I found the greatest love of all inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
And if by chance that special place 
That you've been dreaming of 
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love</field>

He calms the angry sea 
He alone decides who writes a symphony

He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night 
He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer 
Saint or sinner call and always find Him there 
And though it makes Him sad to see the way we live 
He'll always say, "I forgive". 
That’s why I believe above a storm the smallest prayer 
can still be heard 
I believe that someone in the great somewhere 
hears every word 
And every time I hear a new born baby cry, 
Or touch a leaf or see the sky 
Then I know why, I believe</field>

This is the heartbreak hotel 
You said that you'd be here by nine 
Instead you took your time 
You didn't think to call me boy 
Here I sit trying not to cry 
Asking myself why you do this to me 
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say: 
All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What did you do to me 
Look what you did to me 
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
instead you played with my emotions and you made me cry 
What did you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me 
Now I see that you've been doing wrong 
Played me all along. 
And made a fool of me, baby 
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out 
That you were cheating on me. 
How could you do it to me? 
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say:

place 
where ther's love overflowing 
I wish was home..

And suddenly rain drops the fall, they have a meaning sprinkling 
the scene.. 
makes it all soul.. 
clean 
And maybe there is, a chance.. 
for me to go back 
Now that I, I have some direction 
And it, it would be nice.. 
to be back 
Home 
Where there's love, love and affection 
And just, maybe I can.. 
convince time 
to slow up.. 
and giving me 
Enough time in my life 
To grow.. 
up 
Time 
Please be my friend 
and let me start 
Again 
Suddenly my world, gonna a chance, it's face 
But I.. 
know, I.. 
know 
where I going 
I have my mind spun around, then around in space 
Yet, I've watched 
It growing 
Oh..

So won't please.. 
try not, to make hard 
to know I shouldn't believe inevrything 
Ervything then I see

This love is strong why do I feel weak

Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love

All alone 
How many good friends 
Have I already lost 
How many dark nights 
Have I known 
Walking down 
That wrong road 
There was nothing 
I could find 
All those years 
Of darkness 
Can make 
A person blind 
But now I can see 
I am changing

Every way I can 
I am changing 
I'll be better 
Than I am 
But I need 
A friend 
To help me start 
All over again 
Oh 
That would be just fine 
I know 
It's gonna work out 
This time 
'Cause this time I am 
This time I am 
I am changing 
Gonna get my life 
Together now 
I am changing 
Yes, I know how 
I'm gonna start again 
I'm leaving 
My past behind 
I'll change my life 
I'll make a vow 
And nothing's gonna 
Stop me now

And like the river finds the sea

Cos' I believe in you and me 
I will never leave your side 
I will never hurt your pride 
When all the chips are down 
See I will always be around 
Just to be right where you are 
My love, you know I love you 
I will never leave you out 
I will always let you in 
To places no one's ever been 
Deep inside, can't you see 
That I believe in you and me 
Maybe I'm a fool 
To feel the way I do 
But I will play the fool forever 
Just to be with you forever 
I believe in miracles 
And love's a miracle 
Baby you're my dream come true 
I was lost, now I'm free 
I believe in you and me 
See I was lost, now I'm free 
'Cause I believe in you and me 
Believe in you and me.</field>

You've got me baby, I've got you 
You're the one that makes me feel brand new 
 
Sometimes love can wear you out 
Chill your soul baby, make you doubt 
That's you'll never find the one that's true 
All my life I've longed for this 
Someone who makes me happy 
Let's seal this moment with a kiss 
I wanna know 
And nothin's gonna stop me cuz' 
(Chorus) 
I've been to the bottom 
But I'm back on top 
And I'm feelin' the rhythm 
As we start to rock 
When ya get down to it 
I belong to you 
 
Though I'm not afraid to let it show 
I'll tell the world I want everyone to know 
There's nobody who does me like you do 
All of my love is yours tonight 
I live to make you happy 
Nothin' has ever felt so right 
I want it all 
And nothin's gonna stop me cuz' 
(Chorus) 
When you touch me tender 
And you reach my soul 
When I start to weaken 
And I lose control 
When you get down to it 
I belong to you

And I won’t play it no more 
And I won’t take it no more 
Through with being your fool 
And I won’t do it no more 
And I won’t, I won’t keep up this act 
Not for one minute 
I’m gonna pull, 
I’m gonna pull this curtain down 
This time I won’t play this game 
I made a bow to make a change and 
I Bow Out (I won’t be hanging around baby) 
I decline to take the pain 
I resign the masquerade 
I Bow Out (I won’t be staying around baby) 
I Bow Out 
Can’t go on with the show 
You’re just a stage I went through 
Now you’re just fading from view 
Yeah! 
Time for a change of scene 
Guess I’ll be taking my leaveI guess 
I won’t, I won’t stay in this play 
Not for one minute 
I gonna make, I wanna make my exit now 
This time I won’t play this game 
I made a bow to make a change and 
I Bow Out (I won’t be hanging around baby) 
I decline to take the pain 
I resign the masquerade and 
I Bow Out (I won’t be staying around baby) 
I Bow Out 
When your left standing on that stage all alone 
Maybe you’ll realize 
You should have learned to treat me right 
And when this final act is finally through 
Maybe you’ll wish you’d been 
The kind of man you should have been 
Now watch me say goodbye and walk right out of your life.</field>

Lost touch with my soul 
I had nowhere to turn 
I had nowhere to go 
Lost sight of my dream 
Thought it would be the end of me, uh 
I thought I'd never make it through 
I had no hope to hold on to, I 
I thought I would break 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down and I tumbled 
But I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain 
I didn't know my own strength 
Survived my darkest hour 
My faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up 
Hold my head up high 
I was not built to break 
I didn't know my strength, oh 
 
Found hope in my heart 
I found the light to life 
My way out of the dark 
Found all that I need 
Here Inside of me 
Oh, I thought I'd never find my way 
I thought I'd never lift that weight 
I thought I would break 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down and I tumbled 
but I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain 
I didn't know my own strength 
Survived my darkest hour 
My faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up 
Hold my head up high 
I was not built to break 
I didn't know my strength 
 
There were so many times, I 
Wondered how I'd get through the night, I 
Thought I took all that I could take 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down and I tumbled 
But I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain, oh oh 
I didn't know my own strength 
Survived my darkest hour 
My faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up 
I hold my head up high

Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrow blow? 
And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation?

Ain't no man strong enough, ain't no time long enough to tear it apart 
And that's what we had believe it or not 
So on the final day I thought all the hurt and pain will end up on top 
So I won't cry 'cause you're going away 
'Cause the chemistry we've got it don't fade 
I won't be wishing for better days 
'Cause deep inside I know our love stays the same 
You gotta know 
No matter where you are, you got me 
Baby, near or far, you got me 
Our love will never fade, you got me 
So let me hear you say 
Baby, I got you 
I'll be there, I'll be there, no matter what 
Baby, I got you 
I'll be there, I'll be there, no matter what 
'Cause I got you, baby 
I never lie 
'Cause you are the reason that my heart is beating and I am alive 
Before you go look in my eyes 
You can't be replaced, no, I'm down to wait for the rest of my life 
You gotta know 
No matter where you are, you got me 
Baby, near or far, you got me 
Our love will never fade, you got me 
So let me hear you say 
Baby, I got you 
I'll be there, I'll be there, no matter what

I'll be there, I'll be there, no matter what 
'Cause I got you, baby 
I'll hold you up when you just can't stand 
I'll make you fly when you think that you can't 
By my side forever, baby that's the plan 
I'll be your everything, I'll be your everything 
I got you 
No matter where you are, you got me

Nothing, if I don't have you (you-oo, you-oo, you)

Right to the heart of me

Love like I known it with you 
Will our memories survive?

Perfect situations must go wrong 
But this has never yet prevented me 
From wanting far too much for far too long 
Looking back I could have done it differently 
One or few more moments who can tell 
But it took time to understand the man 
Now at least I know I know him well 
(Chorus) 
Wasn't it good? (Oh so good) 
Wasn't it fine? (so fine) 
Isn't it madness 
That he can't be mine 
But in the end he needs a little bit more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 
Noone in your life 
Is with you constantly 
No one is completely on your side 
And though I moved my world to be with him 
Still the gap between us is too wide. 
Looking back I could have done it differently 
Learn about the man before I fell 
But I was ever so much younger then 
Now at least I know I know him well" 
(Chorus) 
Wasn't it good 
wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness He can't be mine 
Didn't I know how it would go 
If I knew from the start 
Why am I falling apart?

Too late 
And so you know the way it feels to cry 
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two

I learned from the best 
I learned from you 
Oh baby now 
I learned from you 
I remember cold nights 
Tears I thought would never dry 
How you shattered my world,with your goodbye 
Your goodbye baby 
Would've sold my soul then 
Just to have you back again 
Now you're the last thing on my mind 
Now you say you're sorry,and you've changed your ways 
Sorry but you changed your ways too late 
And so you know the way it feels to cry

Baby I learned the way to break a heart 
I learned from the best 
I learned from you 
Oh baby now 
I learned from you 
So when all you've got are sleepless nights 
When those tears are clouding up your eyes 
Just remember it was you who said goodbye 
Who said goodbye 
And so you know the way it feels to cry 
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two 
Baby I learned the way to break a heart 
I learned from the best 
I learned from you 
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two 
Baby I learned the way to break a heart

As I lay me down 
Heaven hear me now 
I'm lost without a cause 
After giving it my all 
Winter storms have come 
And darkened my sun 
After all that I've been through 
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to you

After all my strength is gone 
In you I can be strong 
I look to you 
I look to you 
And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 
I look to you

About to lose my breath 
There's no more fighting left 
Sinking to rise no more 
Searching for that open door 
And every road that I've taken 
Led to my regret 
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it 
Nothing to do but lift my head 
(Chorus) 
I look to you

In you I can be strong 
I look to you 
I look to you 
And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 
I look to you 
(Bridge) 
My love is all broken (oh Lord) 
My walls have come (coming down on me) 
tumbling down on me (All the rain is falling) 
The rain is falling 
Defeat is calling (set me free) 
I need you to set me free 
Take me far away from the battle 
I need you to shine on me 
(Chorus) 
I look to you 
I look to you 
After all my strength is gone 
In you I can be strong 
I look to you

Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
I've been in love and lost my senses 
Spinning through the town 
Sooner or later the fever ends 
And I wind up feeling down 
I need a man who'll take a chance 
On a love that burns hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart calls 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Somebody oo Somebody oo 
Somebody who loves me yeah 
Somebody oo Somebody oo 
To hold me in his arms oh 
I need a man who'll take a chance 
On a love that burns hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart calls 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody

I was born in Newark 
Had a childhood sweetheart 
We were always hand in hand 
He wore hightop shoes and shirt tails 
Nip was in pig tails 
I know I loved him even then 
You know some disapproved it 
They even boohooed it 
But I told them time and time again 
You know I was made to love him 
Build my world around him 
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey. 
He's been my inspiration, 
Showed appreciation 
For the love I gave him through the years 
Like a sweet magnolia tree 
My love blossomed tenderly 
My life grew sweeter through the years 
I know that my baby loves me 
My baby needs me 
That's why we made it through the years 
I was made to love him 
Worship and adore him 
Yes say! Hey, hey, hey. 
All through thick and thin 
Our love just won't end, 
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby 
Ah! 
My baby loves me 
My baby needs me 
I know I ain't going nowhere 
I was just a little thang 
When that love bug bit me, 
I had the fever with each passing year 
If oceans tumble 
And the whole world crumbles 
By his side I'll still be standing there 
'Cause I was made to love him 
I was made to live for him say yeah! 
Ah, I was made to love him 
Build my world all around him 
Say hey, hey, hey. 
I love my baby 
Nip ain’t goin’ nowhere, 
Say Hey, hey, hey. 
Say Hey, hey, hey. 
Hey, hey, hey 
Oooh hey I love him uhahh 
You don't know 
Built my world all around him say 
Hey, hey, hey 
(Lauren: Naa Naa!) 
Ooooh! 
Can’t cha’ tell y’all 
Hey, hey, hey 
Been my inspiration, 
Showed me appreciation

Come open up the door 
My heart's been right here waiting

My heart's been right here waiting

And it's told to me to do or die 
And every word he speaks makes me certain 
Beyond the door's life's reason why

Won't you come inside for more 
You give love so sweetly now, 
Take my love, 
Take me completely now

Miss Elyott) 
Baby why I get so many people telling me 
They seen you up in the mall 
Are they mistaking 
All up on some chick 
As though I don't exist 
What is this 
Why they all in my business 
It's just too ridiculous 
I can't get no sleep 
They just keep warning me 
Should I believe it 
They say I don't need it 
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind 
Honey too many people say you're faking me 
They ask what have you done lately 
They say we won't last 
They're predicting that it's over, it's over 
Chorus 
(Missy Elliot) 
Too many girls they dislike me 
Since I got you 
They wanna fight me 
'Cause I'm the chick walking around 
With the ring 
Tell me why these hoes they don't even like me 
Why they all in my business 
It's just too ridiculous 
I can't get no sleep 
They just keep warning me 
Should I believe it 
They say I don't need it 
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind 
Oh boy it's all the love that you're giving 
They mind 'cause love is what they're missing

For you to see 
Was it really worth you going out like that? 
Tell me..

Was it really worth (5x) 
Was it really worth you going out like that? 
Tell me..

I'd rather be alone than unhappy 
I'm packing bags so you can leave town for a week 
The phone rings then you look at me (why'd you turn and look at me) 
You said it was one of your friends from over 54th street 
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID. 
I've been through all this before 
So how could you think. 
That I would stand around 
And take some more 
Things are gonna change. 
Cause I won't be a fool anymore 
That's why you have to leave. 
So don't turn around to see my face 
Cause there's no more tears 
Left here for you to see. 
Now is it really worth you going out like that 
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back 
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for me 
It turns out,you were making a fool of me. 
It's not right ,but it's okay 
I'm gonna make it anyway. 
Pack your bags up and leave. 
And don't you dare come 
Running back to me.</field>

It's the second time around 
For you and I boy 
And believe me it's confusing me 
I'm afraid to say "let's make up" and "All's forgiven" 
But somethin' tells me it's heading for heartbreak 
So darling please I'm praying that 
This time yeah this time will be different 
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize 
Tell me are you really ready for love boy 
Or is it just the lonely talking again 
Are you really ready for love boy 
Or is it the lonely talking again 
Now the time before 
When we got together 
You promised you'd be forever true to me 
But all I got from you 
Was lots and lots of talking 
Lonely nights filled with misery 
So baby please please tell me now 
That when I fulfill your needs 
You won't up and leave me 
Even though you know 
I'll let you come back 
Tell me are you really ready for love boy 
Or is it just the lonely talking again 
Are you really ready for love boy 
Or is it the lonely talking again 
Really need to know 
Tell me are you really ready for love boy 
Or is it just the lonely talking again 
Are you really ready for love boy 
Or is it the lonely talking again 
Tell me now

Did you ever wish you could take back 
Something that you did in your past 
If it wasn't for me I know what 
We had was definitely gonna last 
I admit that we say some things 
We don't mean when we're mad 
But I realized that I've been foolish 
I never should have turned my back 
Cuz it's a cold world 
When you're out there all alone 
So many times that 
I wanted to just pick up the phone 
And tell you ooh baby 
Baby I missed your lovin' so 
I ain't holding back no more 
Your girl is coming home 
(And I want you to love me) 
Like I never left 
(And I want you to hold me) 
Like I never left 
(And I want you to touch me) 
Like I never left 
(Come give me what I'm missing, yeah) 
Like I never left, yeah 
Do you think we can pick up 
Where we left before the day 
That I told you it was over 
Packed my things and moved away 
Cuz I see that without you 
My world is just an empty place 
Taking one step away from you 
Feels like a million miles away 
Cuz it's a cold world 
When you're out there all alone 
So many times that 
I wanted to just pick up the phone 
And tell you ooh baby

You've been avoiding me 
Like a cat tryin' to dodge a dog 
I never see ya shine 
You're as cold as the London fog 
You claim you want my love 
Well I wouldn't know by the way you behave 
If you want to feel the thrill of my touch 
You better come outa' yo' cave 
It's so perplexing 
Why you fight it, won't you try it 
Love's electric 
Turn me on and see 
Chorus: 
Love is a contact sport 
You gotta move in tight 
If you wanna do it right, here I am 
Love is a contact sport 
You gotta act untamed 
If you wanna play the game 
So grab my hand and... 
slam!... 
I hate to sound aggressive 
But I'm tired of waitin' for your move 
Cut the formalities 
'Cause you've got a few things to prove 
If you really want my love 
I need to feel it down deep from within 
Don't make me wait to long 
I'm ready now, come and stroke my skin 
Well all this talkin' 
Worthless chatter, just don't matter 
Time for stalkin' 
Come get next to me

Things just ain't the way that they used to be 
Back in the day when a man meant security 
He'd be working hard all week 
Baby kick back and throw up your feet 
Let me fix you a treat 
So it might be love and sweet 
But he's worth it 
He deserves it 
May not be perfect 
But he's all the man I need 
He's ready and willing 
Gives me the feeling, ah 
And whenever we're together 
I know where I belong 
chorus: 
It's just the way he looks into your eyes 
Love that man 
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize 
Love that man 
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares 
And he's always there (He's always always there) 
Don't you love that man (I know) 
Things they ain't the way they used to be 
When a woman and a man work hard to be 
Happy in love and stand together ooh 
(Let's stay that way forever) 
Never give in to a fight 
Just trying work it out 
Never give up on him 
That's not what love's about 
Stay true to your feelings 
And remember 
All the things he's done for you 
Repeat Chorus 
You'd better know I'm talking about that old-school love 
That everlasting feeling can never be too much 
Somebody loves you heart and soul 
Hold on, don't stop 
And never let him go

            <field name="lyrics">03 - LOVE WILL SAVE THE DAY 
Sometimes life can make you crazy 
It can really put your body to the test 
You try so hard to make sure everything goes right 
And you find you've only wound up with a mess 
It's a common situation 
Even though you feel abandoned and alone 
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt 
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone 
Chorus: 
What you need's a little change of heart 
Forget this fear and frustration 
Love will always play the greater part 
When your battles wear you down 
Here's my advice - 
When you're feeling down and out 
And you've got troubles on you mind 
Love will save the day 
When you're feeling full of doubt 
And fear has got you in a bind 
Love will save the day 
When your worlds falling apart 
All you have to do is say a prayer 
And love will save the day 
There's an answer in your heart 
So let your light shine on my dear 
And love will save the day 
Love will save the day (X4) 
Many things in this world bring you down 
It's a wonder you can make it through the day 
Well, you can't sleep cause your problems are to deep 
And there's always something getting in the way 
And when you turn on the evening news 
Mass confusion is the only thing you see 
Well there's no question that we need a new direction 
Cause we all could use some peace and harmony 
Chorus 
Love is gonna save the day 
You've gotta believe it</field>

You'll be my lover, lover for life 
Capture, there's no getaway 
You're my lover, my lover for life 
Under your spell or under my own power 
It really doesn't matter to me 
See I fell in love the first time I saw you 
And have been falling in love ever since 
You heard my testimony 
You've seen my evidence 
Hey, it's a crime of passion 
In every sense 
And justice would decide 
If you stay here in my world 
Take me, I'm your prisoner

Hey, I could find out where you've gone today 
I feel so unhappy 
Streets seem so empty now

Maybe I'll find someone to get you of my mind

That I might feel like this 
Some kind of wonderful 
There's nothing quite comparable 
The thing about it is 
It's oh so innocent 
I wasn't looking for 
It came knockin' at my door 
I'm trying to do things right 
But I'm about to lose this fight 
'Cause spending time with you 
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth 
And every day with you 
I swear it brings me closer 
to my only reservationis you 
My sweet temptation, baby. 
Oh, my heart is calling 
I'm falling for you 
Oh, my heart is calling 
I'm falling for you 
Who could imagine it 
I found my happiness 
In someone I barely know 
And I like to take it slow 
But you're so diferent, boy 
You're breaking all my rules 
What is it in your smile 
that makes me feel the way I do 
I'm trying to live my life 
And I'm trying to live it right 
If I desire you 
It ain't because I'm trying to 
Boy, everyday with you 
I swear it brings me closer to 
My only reservation is you, 
My sweet temptation, baby 
chorus 
I've given it consideration (uh huh) 
And it all adds up to you 
I won't deny this heart is calling for you, baby 
I've given it alot of thought (uh huh) 
And it all ends up on you 
My sweet temptation 
God knows I'm falling for you 
chorus 
Is is in your smile, boy 
Is it touch, baby 
I don't know why [...].</field>

            <field name="lyrics">My love 
Some girl just wanna spend guys money 
Live their lives chasing the milk and honey 
Silver lines their every fantasy 
But you're lucky cause that ain't me 
Most girls think guys are all the same 
Not true so I can't take the blame 
I love you through the joy and pain 
Even the coldest Georgia rain 
[Chorus:] 
See my love is like a open sky 
See my heart is like the river wide 
No my well would never ever run dry 
It runs over for you and I 
See my love is deeper than the sea 
And sweeter than a pretty melody 
So tell everybody that you're glad you got me 
You can trust in my love 
My L-O-V-E 
(My love, My love, My) 
Some think that love is just a word 
Because of all the things they've heard 
They think they're gotta close their hearts 
Can't see the light, the soul in the dark 
But I know I got a real good man 
Who loves me the best he can 
That's why I'm here faithfully 
Cause you'll do the same for me 
[Chorus] 
You gotta go through 
The fire (the pain) 
The rain (the joy) 
Take the joy and endure the pain 
(Never give in) 
Give in 
Don't give up 
(Don't give up) 
We can try but it will never never break my love 
Sweet, sweet love 
Sweet, sweet love 
See my love

And I'm standin' on the front line 
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life 
I will say I spent it with you 
If I wake up in World War 3 
I see destruction and poverty 
And I feel like I want to go home 
It's okay if you're coming with me 
Cause your love is my love 
and my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 
Cause your love is my love

It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

And I'm homeless on the street 
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station 
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me 
As the years they pass us by 
we stay young through each other's eyes 
And no matter how old we get 
It's okay as long as I got you babe 
Cause your love is my love 
and my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 
Cause your love is my love 
and my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 
If I should die this very day 
Don't cry, cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay 
And no matter what people say 
I'll be waiting for you after judgement day 
Cause your love is my love 
and my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

It would take an eternity to break us

I fell for you 
too easy to let go 
she was one from your past 
one of the few 
you said it didn`t last 
now Romeo you know I can`t believe 
your tongue would slip so easily 
I know you think I oughta let it be 
but get it right 
next time 
that`s the end of me 
CHORUS: 
My name is not Susan 
so watch what you say 
if you still need her 
then be on your way 
don`t wanna hear about Susan 
she`s got nothin` on me 
so show some respect 
for the love you recieve 
my name is not Susan 
(no, no, no, no, no) (get it right) 
Last night you were asleep 
deep in a dream 
I heard you call her name 
then you turned to embrace 
I froze in place 
never to be the same 
now Romeo you know I never knew 
my heart would bust so easily 
I know you think I oughta let it go 
but get it right 
next time 
say good-bye to me boy 
CHORUS 
I never want to be the girly 
that you "call" one and only 
you know the kind of girly 
that you would call when you get lonely 
I never should have let you in 
a damn shame 
forgot my name 
well, anyway 
CHORUS 
don`t want to hear about Susan

Single mother, two jobs 
Workin' her fingers to the bone 
Putting her daughters' mouth before her own 
She's gotta do it, but she's still feeling 
Like there's something deep inside 
That she can't leave behind 
She won't let go of it 
No matter how many times 
She hears it's over with 
It's all fixed in her mind 
That it's gonna get better 
And she won't ever 
Hang her head again, break a sweat again 
Never again 
Never, never give up 
Never, never give up 
No matter how many times 
Somebody tells you it ain't working 
Never, never give up 
Never, never give up 
Hold your head to the sky 
Look them right in the eyes 
Tell you will never quit until the day you get it right

Shake it off and know that everything will be alright

College student, paying her own way 
Working the club at night 
Look what she go through 
To stay in law school 
So maybe one day 
She can make her way in a man's world 
And never be called just another girl 
It ain't nothing like a dream you can't see 
Even when the people round you don't believe 
But in the twelfth round 
When you're against the ropes 
Here comes your last minute miracle 
You've got to know to 
Never, never give up 
Never, never give up 
No matter how many times 
Somebody tells you it ain't working 
Never, never give up 
Never, never give up 
Hold your head to the sky 
Look them right in the eyes 
Tell you will never quit until the day you get it right 
Never, never give up 
Never, never give up 
Even though some days you'll have to cry 
Shake it off and know that everything will be alright 
As long as you never, never give up 
Never, never give up 
The sky is the limit 
For whatever you want to do 
Don't let anyone tell you 
It ain't possible 
No matter how low you feel 
Keep going higher, higher 
See, I've been holding on to my dreams too long 
To watch it get away from me 
This hand is mine to win 
And I promise you that I'll never, never give up 
Never, never give up 
Never, never give up 
No matter how many times 
Somebody tells you it ain't working

A flame to light our way

I could find no place to land 
I dreamed the hours away 
And wondered everyday 
Do dreams come true 
Nobody loves me like you do 
What if I'd never met you 
Where would I be right now 
Funny how life just falls in place somehow 
You've touched my heart in places 
That I never even knew 
Nobody loves me like you do 
I was words without a tune 
I was a song still unsung 
A poem with no rhyme 
A dancer out of time 
But now there's you 
And nobody loves me like you do 
What if I'd never met you 
Where would I be right now 
Funny how life just falls in place somehow 
You've touched my heart in places

There were times when I never thought I would get 
where I got to 
Had some angels to guide me, someone to spy on, lay on all my love 
Now this is my chance to say ain´t go nothin but love 
For my family that raised me (shout out, shout out) 
And my teacher that done praised me (shout out, shout out) 
To anyone who tried to hate on me (shout out, shout out) 
Even the one´s who tried to break me, even the ones who tried to take me down 
There´s been haters since this world been going ´round (nothin but love, nothin but love) 
Why they take a thing and trying to crush them down (nothin but love, nothin but love) 
I ain´t even trying to hold on to that now (nothin but love, nothin but love) 
Ain´t got nothin but love for you (nothin but love, nothin but love) 
I could hold on to pain but that ain´t what my life´s about 
I ain´t blaming nobody if I ain´t got my stuff worked out 
I got love for my self, ain´t gonna regret anything I´ve done 
I just wanna sing my song, ain´t got nothin but love 
For all the players on the street (shout out, shout out) 
To all my gheto doing their own thing (keep on, keep strong) 
To all my exes that done wrong me, stepped on me, 
can´t hold me down 
To all the givers and the takers 
To my crew from way back when 
To the cold wars and the stares 
And the ones that I ain´t met 
For my self for sticking with me 
For the one´s I miss from up above 
Anyone who´s ever been a part of me 
Ain´t got nothin but love</field>

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

Kick off my shoes and relax my feet 
Hit the kitchen grab my bite to eat 
Now it's been one of those crazy weeks 
And I gotta do something special for me 
See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi 
Have a massage, have a sip and then I'm ready 
Gotta take time out (time out) 
And my real ladies know what I'm talking about.. 
sing 
Oooooooh, baby baby 
You dont know what I've been going through 
Sing it again now 
Oooooooh, baby baby 
It's obvious to see exactly what I need 
One of those days 
When the sun is shining bright 
And my life is going right 
And the simple things are not wasted 
One of those days 
When you're cruising in your car 
And you like to see the stars 
And it's warm outside and beautiful, yeah 
Tonight, it's all about me 
Just wanna set my body free (body free) 
Nevermind the TV 
Tonight I'll just let a little TV watch me 
Light the candles, aroma therapy 
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me 
Mr 
Big is in the background 
The Isley Brothers gonna hold it down.. 
sing

Hello (7x)

If Rudolph and his reindeer 
Ran into delays 
I'd still hope for joy this season 
And if somehow Santa got lost on his way 
I would try to find a way to smile 
Smile on Christmas day 
If I had one wish for Christmas

You've got a problem 
With the way that I am 
They say I'm trouble 
And I don't give a damn 
But when I'm bad I know I'm better 
I just wanna get loose 
And turn it up for you baby 
I've got the stuff that you want 
I've got that thang that you need 
I've got more than enough 
To make you drop to your knees 
I've got the stuff that you want 
I've got that thang that you need 
I've got more than enough 
To make you drop to your knees</field>

There's so much that you just don't see 
But if you would only take the time 
I know in my heart you'd find 
Oh a girl that's scared sometimes 
Who isn't always strong 
Can't you see the hurt in me 
I feel so all alone 
I wanna run to you 
I wanna run to you 
Won't ya hold me in your arms 
and keep me safe from harm 
I wanna run to you 
But if I come to you 
Tell me will you stay 
Or will you run away 
Each day, each day I play the role 
Of someone always in control 
But at night I come home and turn the key 
There's nobody there, no one cares for me 
Oh woah what's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams 
Without someone to share them with 
Tell me what does it mean 
I wanna run to you 
I wanna run to you 
Won't ya hold me in your arms 
and keep me safe from harm 
I wanna run to you 
But if I come to you 
Tell me will you stay 
Or will you run away 
Run away, no 
I need you here 
I need you here to wipe away my tears 
To kiss away my fears 
No if you only knew how much I wanna run to you 
Ya know I wanna run to you 
Won't ya hold me in your arms 
and keep me safe from harm 
I wanna run to you 
But if I come to you 
Tell me will you stay 
Or will you run away</field>

Say you wanna walk away 
You ain't got nothing to say 
I salute you 
Go on out the door now you take care 
No more tears to shed 
What you expecting me to beg 
Girl I'm not, I'm done 
So when you leave just close the door behind you 
Cause, I'm feeling kind of hotter than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of better than you 
And I know just what to do 
I feel like doing my hair 
I feel like calling some of my friends 
I feel like going to a club 
And partying 
Cause I'm a soldier girl, in this world 
Stand alone, I can be strong 
I walk the miles, I made it home 
It's good to know without you I made it 
Soldier girl, in my world 
Took the fall now I stand tall 
From the pain and all, I made it through 
And now all I gotta say to you 
Salute, ay, ay 
Salute, ay, ay 
You think you know everything 
And you think that your shit don't stink, well it do 
And when it comes to me you don't have a clue 
It took me all these years 
To realise that you don't belong here 
I can do better 
You say I'll never do better 
Yeah right whatever 
I'm feeling kind of hotter than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of better than you 
And I know just what to do 
I feel like doing my hair 
I feel like calling some of my friends 
I feel like going to a club 
Do some partying 
Cause I'm a soldier girl, in this world 
Stand alone, I can be strong 
I walk the miles, I made it home 
It's good to know without you I made it 
Soldier girl, in my world 
Took the fall now I stand tall 
From the pain and all, I made it through 
And now all I gotta say to you 
Salute, ay, ay 
Salute, ay, ay 
So don't call or come back 
I've been here for years 
Through all of the drama and the pain 
And all of the tears 
It's time to stop this rollercoaster 
So that I can get off 
Let me start moving mountains, swimming seas 
And climbing over walls 
I'm a soldier girl, in this world 
Stand alone, I can be strong 
I walk the miles, I made it home 
It's good to know without you I made it 
Soldier girl, in my world 
Took the fall now I stand tall 
From the pain and all, I made it through 
And now all I gotta say to you 
Salute, ay, ay 
Salute, ay, ay</field>

You've got your family, and they need you there 
Though I try to resist, being last on your list 
But no other man's gonna do 
So I'm saving all my love for you 
It's not very easy, living all alone 
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own 
But each time I try, I just break down and cry 
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue 
Cause I'm saying all my love for you 
You use to tell me, we'd run away together 
Love gives you the right to be free 
You said be patient, just wait a little longer 
But that's just an old fantasy 
I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more 
Gonna get an old feeling, when you walk 
through that door. 
Cause tonight, is the night 
When I'm feeling allright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yes I'm saving all my loving 
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 
No other woman, is gonna love you more 
Cause tonight is the night, that I'm feeling alright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love

Keeps you company; 
With love to guide you, 
He walks beside you. 
Just like He walks with me.

Who gives me courage to go on from there, 
And who gives me faith that will never die?

(Someone for me) 
(Someone for me) 
I'm here alone on a Friday night 
Waiting here beside the phone 
The TV, radio, and me 
Really ain't been getting along 
I wish that I could find a way 
To party to the break of day 
And there I'd be sure to meet 
The guy that would be special to me 
Then momma comes and asks me 
Why I am dreaming, sitting alone 
Why not go out and have some fun 
It's the only way I'll ever 
Find someone for me 
While I am young and seventeen 
Chorus: 
Someone for me (someone for me) 
I've got to find someone 
Someone (someone for me) 
I've got to find someone 
Now there's a party down at Angie's house 
With people packed against the walls 
I'm sitting in a corner here 
Trying to make sense of it all 
And when I least expect it 
Meeting a guy I see in my dreams 
Here he is walking up to me 
And asking if I'd like to come and dance with him 
I think I found someone for me 
Chorus 
I need somebody for me 
I need somebody for me, someone 
And so I'm finding out that 
Dreams you believe in, can come to be 
And now I'm looking up to find that joy 
And happiness can come to you and me 
I actually found someone for me

And there's a road I have to follow 
A place I have to go 
But no one told me just how to get there 
But when I get there I'll know 
'Cause I'm taking it... 
Step by step 
Bit by bit 
Stone by stone 
Brick by brick 
Step by step 
Day by day 
Mile by mile 
Go your own way 
And this old road is rough and ruined 
So many dangers along the way 
So many burdens might fall upon me 
So many troubles that I have to face 
But I won't let my spirit fail me 
But I won't let my spirit go 
Until I get to my destination 
I'm gonna take it slow 
Because I'm taking it

You've got to hold on to what you've got

I know you're blue 
I know you're hurting

Time can pass so slowly, when you feel so all alone 
Love can strike like lightning, when you find your heart a home 
I've seen it in the movies, read about it in a book 
I've never feel it, but your touch was all it took 
Chorus: 
Take good care of my heart 
Take good care of my heart 
Baby you're the first to take it 
You're the only one who can break it 
I love you more than I should 
But it keeps me feeling so good 
I've waited for your love for ever 
You're the one to take good care of my heart 
Come and make you're magic, til you have me hypnotised 
If we get any closer, I'll be drowning in your eyes 
You're the one I needed most, when my love was on the line 
I'm so glad you gave me yours, when I gave you mine

What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming? 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, 
thro' the perilous fight, 
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming? 
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, 
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there. 
O! say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</field>

Such a pleasure loving you, 
It's all mine 
I smile each day away 
I feel better knowing you 
Ooh you've got me thinking 
it's better to give than take 
I don't have to beg you to 
You're so good to me 
Carries me from day to day 
I appreciate the things you do 
ooh but there's one thing 
I have to tell you boy 
I take your actions 
but I love the things you say 
 
Chorus 
I listen to the things you say 
ooh you're calling me oh wow 
I listen to the things you say to me baby 
In a poem or a card 
Serenade my heart 
I listen to the things you say 
ooh you're calling me oh wow 
I listen to the things you say to me baby 
In a poem or a song 
Serenade me 
Lovely letters come from you 
at times, I know I don't deserve you 
Any weather, you'll come through 
You've got me gleaming 
I feel more than I'm not worth it 
You're my treasure, 
I'll take you over anything 
as pleasing on this earth 
I appreciate the things you do 
but there's one thing 
I have to tell you 
I take your actions 
but I love your words 
Chorus 
Every word that you say 
makes the day much brighter 
(sweet to my heart) 
Melody that you play 
I hear right away 
and my heart is lighter 
(sweet to my heart)

No matter what I do 
I'm wishing you were here, with me 
It makes no difference 
I only think of you 
And I living out my fantasy 
(Chorus:) 
Late at night, a rendezvous 
Being such a love sick fool 
It might be pouring rain 
But still the same, nothings changed 
All and all I feel no shame 
I'm just your fool the same 
(I'm just your fool) 
(I keep thinking about you baby) 
So tell me what you're gonna do 
(I keep thinking about you) 
All I wanna do is 
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind 
I'm thinking about you) 
That's what I wanna do 
(Pick me up, let's go down 
I'm thinking about it too) 
(I'm thinking about you) 
Ya got me thinking about you 
(I'm thinking about it too) 
Maybe weeping is a game 
That's hard for me to face 
(But you need me) 
Just like I need you 
There's no reason 
Just my heart that makes me feel this way 
And I hope you feel the same way too 
(Chorus) 
(Spoken) 
It might be pouring rain 
But like a fool, insane 
I run to you 
I'm just a love sick fool 
I've got this thing for you 
(I'm just a love-sick fool)

See the way to truth and faith 
So they can be free 
Be free like me

I'm not the foolish girl you used to know 
So long ago 
I'm stronger now 
I've learned from my mistakes which way to go 
And I should know 
I put myself aside to do it your way 
But now I need to do it all alone 
And I am not afraid to try it on my own 
I don't care if I'm right or wrong 
I'll live my life the way I feel 
No matter what I'll gonna keep it real 
You know 
Its time for me to do it on my own, 
yeah, yeah 
Mmm... 
Yeah, yeah 
It's over now 
I can't go back to living through your eyes 
Too many lies 
And if you don't know by now 
I can't go back to being someone else 
Not any more 
I never had the chance to do things my way 
So now it's time for me to take control

I'm runnin' things in my way 
Can't stop me now, I've just begun 
Don't even think about it, there ain't no way about it 
I'm takin' names, the world is mine 
Yes, I'm gonna take my time 
It's time for me to finally to stand alone 
Stand alone 
I'm not afraid to try it on my own

            <field name="lyrics">Since I don't know when 
We've been only friends 
No more but no less 
Our friendship we had at best 
A voice to console 
An ear to confide 
That someone you tell 
Your deepest of feelings inside 
But we didn't know 
When we held each other it would feel so right 
We didn't know 
On that night we'd be falling in love 
I looked at you 
You looked at me 
In ways we never thought we would be 
But like tomorrow's today's mystery 
We didn't know 
Be it big, be it small 
On you I could call 
Nothing but to ask 
You'd be right there in a flash 
A hand I could hold 
That friend I could trust 
But the love that we shared 
Was just platonic between us 
That's what happens when innocent friends 
Turn serious lovers 
And we're so happy that we've fallen in love 
And still can be best of friends 
When they'd break your heart 
And when they'd make you cry 
We both would confer 
You should give love one more try 
We searched everywhere 
For true love to find 
Yet who'd think it ws us 
That we were longing for all the time 
Cause we didn't know 
When we held each other it would feel so right 
We didn't know 
On that night we'd be falling in love 
I looked at you 
And you looked at me 
In ways we never thought we would be 
But just like the future no one can see 
We didn't know</field>

With no proof anyone could hear 
In our hearts a hopeful song 
We barely understood 
Now we are not afraid 
Although we know there's much to fear 
We were moving mountains 
Long before we knew we could 
(Oh yes) 
There can be miracles when you believe 
Though hope is frail its hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles you can achieve 
When you believe, somehow you will 
You will when you believe 
(oh yeah) 
In this time of fear 
When prayers so often proved in vain 
Hope seems like the summer birds 
Too swiftly flown away 
Yet now I'm standing here 
My heart so full I can't explain 
Seeking faith and speaking words 
I never thought I'd say 
There can be miracles when you believe 
(when you believe) 
Though hope is frail its hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles you can achieve 
(you can achieve) 
When you believe, somehow you will 
You will when you believe 
They don't always happen when you ask 
And it's easy to give in to your fears (oh) 
But when your blinded by your pain 
Can't see your way straight though the rain 
a small but still, resilient voice 
Says love is very near (yeah yeah) 
There can be miracles 
(miracles) 
When you believe 
(lord when you believe oh ho) 
Though hope is frail 
(though hope is frail) 
It's hard to kill 
(it's haaaard to kill oh oh) 
Who knows what miracles you can achieve 
When you believe, somehow you will 
somehow you will 
You will when you believe 
You will when you believe 
Just believe (2x)..

Can they find their way home? 
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there 
And if somebody loves you 
Won't they always love you 
I look in your eyes 
And I know that you still care for me 
Oooooooooooh....... 
I've been around enough to know 
That dreams don't turn to gold 
And that there is no easy way 
No you just can't run away 
And what we had was so much more 
Than we ever had before 
And no matter how I try 
You're always on my mind

Oh these lonely times, they never seem to end - 
You're too far 
I know I should be there where you are 
Today I did some shopping 
Just had to clear my mind again

I hopped into a taxi, seemed... 
In a moment I was home.. 
home again

Tossing and turning in my sleep 
I can't make it without you, now 
I'm gonna take the next plane out 
I got to get to where you are

I know I should be there where you are

Why can't I stay 
 
I keep pushing so you'll be mine 
We'll be loving baby over time 
My sensitivity gets so high 
It keeps me dreaming that you're my guy 
 
Then I have to stop and check myself

I can't give in to jealousy 
So touch me now if you love me

So, why does it hurt me so 
I gotta get you outta my head 
It hurts so bad

            <field name="lyrics">This is for the lovers holding hands in the car 
This is for the lovers, no matter where you are 
This is for you (it's for you) 
This is for you (it's for you) 
This is for the lovers just getting on their feet 
This is for the lovers about 20 years deep 
This is for you (it's for you) 
This is for you (it's for you) 
It's a beautiful thing when it's shared between two 
The most beautiful thing about it is that it is so 
much more than you 
There ain't nothing in the world like being with your lover 
Nothing in the world like seeing one another 
Happy with the one you need the most 
I know somebody's gonna make love to this song 
tonight 
I know somebody's out of town and they're calling home tonight 
Let me tell you what they are saying right now 
They are saying 
It ain't hard to tell when it's something real 
you can have the world, all you want is them 
Even when you're in the crowd and you spot them from a mile 
That's when you know love is worth it 
When it's going on you never give up 
When you're on the phone you never hang up 
Even when you're feeling down they can always make you smile 
That's when you know love is worth it 
This is for the lovers holding hands in the car 
This is for the lovers, no matter where you are 
This is for you (it's for you) 
This is for you (it's for you) 
Some people feel it, they let it show 
Some people miss it, they let it go 
Some people doubt it, I'm gonna tell you know 
They don't a thing about it, that's why they doubt it 
Some people give it, some people take it 
Some people try to but they can't make it 
That's why when it's official you just can't walk 
away 
And you can trust me when I say 
I know somebody's gonna make love to this song 
tonight 
I know somebody's out of town and they're calling home tonight 
Let me tell you what they are saying right now 
They are saying 
It ain't hard to tell when it's something real 
you can have the world, all you want is them 
Even when you're in the crowd and you spot them from a mile

Waiting for someone to sing me his song

You've come along 
And you light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
and fill my nights with song 
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water 
Could it be finally I'm turning for home? 
Finally, a chance to say hey, 
I love you 
Never again to be all alone 
Cause you 
You light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
And fill my nights with song 
And you 
You light up my life 
You give me hope

With song 
You give me hope

And fill my nights with song 
It can't be wrong 
When it feels so right 
'Cause you

We all want to make a place in this world 
We all want our voices to be heard 
Everyone wants a chance to be someone 
We all have dreams we need to dream 
Sweeter than any star you can reach 
Is when you reach and find you found someone 
You'll hold this world's most priceless thing 
The greatest gift this life can bring 
Is when you look back and know 
You were loved 
Chorus1: 
You were loved by someone 
Touched by someone 
Held by someone 
Meant something to someone 
Loved somebody 
Touched somebody's heart along the way 
You can look back and say 
You were loved 
Yes you were, now 
verse2: 
You can have diamonds in the hands 
Have all the riches in the land 
But without love you don't really have a thing 
When somebody cares that you're alive 
When somebody trusts you with their life 
That's when you know 
That you have all you need 
You hold this world's most priceless gift 
The finest treasure that there is 
You can look back and know 
You were loved 
chorus2: 
oh You were loved by someone 
Touched by someone 
Held by someone 
Meant something to someone 
Loved somebody 
Touched somebody's heart along the way 
You can look back and say 
Mmm 
Yes you were, now 
Bridge 
So many roads that you can take 
Whatever way you go 
Don't take that road alone 
It's better you should know... 
chorus3: 
You were loved by someone 
Touched by someone 
Held by someone 
Meant something to someone 
Loved somebody 
Touched somebody's heart along the way 
You can look back and say

So remember to tell that special one 
You are loved...are loved...you are loved.</field>

If there's a time when the tears should fill your eyes

Chorus: 
Because you, you'll never stand alone 
I'll be standing by 
I'll keep you from the cold 
I'll hold you when you cry 
I'll be there to be strong 
When you can't find the strength inside 
And you, you'll always have a home 
In these arms of mine 
You'll never stand alone 
Love is standing by

If there's a day when rain should find your heart 
And you're cold and tired and lonely 
And this world has you in the dark 
Don't be scared, you can just reach for me and I'll be there 
Don't lose hope, love will see you through you know

Standing by to lift you above all the hurt and pain 
Standing by to carry you through all the tears and rain

I only think of you  
And I'm living out my fantasy  
 
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain (it will be pouring)

Nothing's changed  
All in all I feel no shame  
I'm just your fool insane (I'm just a fool)

Oh so tell me what ya gonna do  
Got me thinking about you

Intoxicate my mind  
I'm thinking about you  
That's what I want to do 
Pick me up, let's go down  
I'm thinking about it too (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
I'm thinking about you  
Got me thinking about you  
I'm thinking about it too  
 
Make believing is a game  
That's not for me to play  
Don't you need me just like I need you  
There's no reason  
Just my heart that makes me feel this way  
And I hope you feel the same way too  
 
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain (it will be pouring)

Lord have mercy on you  
Chivalry is dead

yeah oh baby  
I hope you realize baby  
Just what you mean to me (uh)  
Hey you where I run for cover  
Your love is shelter for me  
And when I find myself needing  
Some lifting up  
One night with you and  
That always is enough  
How you make being in love  
A true rare affair  
So take me I'm your prisoner  
 
[Chorus]  
Will you sentence me  
To be your lover for life  
Your lover for life  
Will you sentence me  
I want to be your lover for life  
Your lover for life  
Your lover yeah yeah yeah  
I just want to hear you say  
You'll be my lover, lover for life  
Capture, there's no getaway  
You're my lover, my lover for life  
 
Under your spell or  
Under my own power  
It really doesn't matter to me  
No boy  
See I fell in love  
The first time I saw you  
And have been falling in love  
Ever since mm boy  
 
You heard my testimony  
You've seen my evidence  
Hey, it's a crime of passion  
In every sense  
And justice would be served  
If you stay here in my world  
So take me I'm your prisoner  
 
[Chorus]  
 
I'm your prisoner  
Take me  
I'm your prisoner  
And sentence me to be  
Your lover for life  
want to be  
Take me baby  
Your lover, your baby</field>

            <field name="lyrics">How could I throw away a miracle  
How could I face another day  
It's all of my doing  
I made a choice  
And today I pay  
My heart is full of pain  
How could you understand  
The way I feel  
How could you relate to so much pain  
Seems as though nothing can comfort me  
So today I pray  
That someone should listen for  
 
[Chorus]  
Nothing should matter  
Not when love grows inside you  
The choice is yours  
There's a miracle in store  
Nothing should matter  
Not when love grows inside you  
A voice of love is crying out  
Don't throw love away  
There's a miracle in store  
 
How could I let go of a miracle  
Nothing could ever take its place  
Thought I was looking  
Out for myself  
Now it seems the pain  
Is all that I have gained  
I wonder if I could be your miracle  
I wonder if I could spare you pain  
Seems as though nothing will comfort me  
Less today I pray  
That you should come listen  
 
[Chorus]  
 
Don't ever throw away your miracle  
Don't let it slip away  
Nothing should matter

            <field name="lyrics">One night not long ago 
I fell for you  
Too easy to let go 
She was one from your past  
One of the few 
You said it didn't last  
 
Now Romeo you know I can't believe  
Your tongue would slip so easily  
I know you think I oughta let it be  
But get it right, next time 
That's the end of me  
 
[Chorus]  
My name is not Susan 
So watch what you say  
If you still need her 
Then be on your way  
Don't want to hear about Susan 
She's got nothin' on me  
So show some respect for the love you receive  
My name is not Susan  
(No, no, no, no, no, get it right)  
 
Last night you were asleep 
Deep in a dream  
I heard you call her name 
Then you turned to embrace  
I froze in place 
Never to be the same  
 
Now Romeo you know I never knew 
My heart would bust so easily  
I know you think I oughta let it go 
But get it right next time  
Say good-bye to me boy  
 
[Chorus]  
 
I never want to be the girly that you "call" one and only  
You know the kind of girly that you would call when you get lonely  
I never should have let you in,  
A damn shame, forgot my name!  
Well, anyway  
 
[Chorus]  
 
Don't want to hear about Susan  
My name ain't Susan 
My name ain't Susan 
My name ain't Susan 
Ya better get it right!</field>

I got a feeling you're the boy for me  
I bet your love can set me free

Strong enough to rock the world  
Straight up I want to be your girl  
So I keep praying to the stars above

Could it be me  
Won't you tell me so  
Who do you love  
You've got to say  
Don't want to go  
Why can't I stay  
 
I keep pushing so you'll be mine  
We'll be loving baby over time (heh)  
My sensitivity gets so high  
It keeps me dreaming that you're my guy  
 
Then I have to stop and check myself  
Could it be that you love someone else  
I can't give in to jealousy  
So touch me now if you love me Am I the one (ha ha ha come on now)  
Is she the one (make up your mind)  
Who do you love  
Am I the one (who do you love huh)  
Is she the one (ow)  
Who do you love  
Am I the one (am I the one)  
Is she the one (Is she the one)  
Who do you love  
Am I the one (I'm waiting)  
Is she the one (I'm waiting ha ha ha)

            <field name="lyrics">Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light 
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, 
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? 
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, 
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. 
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
 
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, 
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, 
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, 
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? 
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, 
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 
'Tis the star-spangled banner!  Oh long may it wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! 
 
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore 
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, 
A home and a country should leave us no more! 
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. 
No refuge could save the hireling and slave 
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: 
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! 
 
Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand 
Between their loved home and the war's desolation! 
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land 
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. 
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, 
And this be our motto:  "In God is our trust." 
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</field>

I picked up a magazine

But as I turned the page

There you were again (there you were)  
Oh these lonely times  
They never seem to end  
You're too far  
I know I should be there where you are  
 
Today I did some shopping  
Just had to clear my mind again  
I can't stop thinkin' bout you  
I hopped into a taxi  
In a moment I was home  
Home again  
 
[Chorus]  
 
Tossing and turning in my sleep  
I can't take being without you  
I'm gonna catch the next plane out

I got to get there where you are  
I know

Still I'd never change you 
Anyway?

You've got me dancin on the smooth edge (2x) 
Hearts on fire 
Filled with desire 
And I'm waiting for the words you say 
On the smooth edge (2x) 
 
So funny how the night just slips on by 
In a long slow dance with you 
Crazy how you keep on leading me boy 
To a place beyond taboo 
You're a cool persuader 
Hey don't you have no shame 
Still I'm gonna take you 
Anyway? 
 
 
[Chorus 2:] 
You've got me dancin on the smooth edge (2x)

Smooth edge, smooth edge 
Oh, oh you're an angel, yes you are

Perfect situations must go wrong  
But this has never yet prevented me  
From wanting far too much for far too long  
Looking back, I could have done it differently  
Won a few more moments, who can tell?  
But it took time to understand the man  
Now at least I know, I know him well  
 
Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine  
But in the end, he needs a little more than before  
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well  
 
No one in your life is with you constantly  
No one is completely on your side  
And though I move my world to be with him  
Still the gap between us is too wide  
Looking back, I could have played it differently  
Learned about the man before I fell  
But I was ever so much younger then  
 
Wasn't it good (oh so good), Wasn't it fine (so fine)  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine  
 
Didn't I know how it would go  
If I knew from the start  
Why am I falling apart  
 
Wasn't it fine  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine  
But in the end, he needs a little more than before  
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well  
It took some to understand him  
Hoo ooh I know him so well</field>

I go to the rock 
 
I go to the rock 
I go to the rock 
I go to the rock 
I go to the rock 
 
You can go to the rock 
You can go to the rock 
You can go to the rock

I go to the rock 
I go to the rock 
I go to the rock 
I go to the rock 
 
I go to the rock 
I go to the rock 
I go to the rock 
I go to the rock 
 
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand 
On Christ, the solid rock I stand 
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend 
I go to the rock</field>

That I might feel like this 
Some kind of wonderful  
There's nothing quite comparable 
 
The thing about it is 
It's oh so innocent 
I wasn't looking for  
It came knockin' at my door 
 
I'm trying to do things right  
But I'm about to lose this fight 
'Cause spending time with you 
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth 
 
And every day with you 
I swear it brings me closer  
To my only reservation is you  
My sweet temptation, baby. 
 
[Chorus] 
Oh, my heart is calling  
I'm falling for you 
Oh, my heart is calling  
I'm falling for you 
 
Who could imagine it 
I found my happiness 
In someone I barely know 
And I like to take it slow 
 
But you're so different, boy 
You're breaking all my rules 
What is it in your smile 
That makes me feel the way I do  
 
I'm trying to live my life  
And I'm trying to live it right 
If I desire you 
It ain't because I'm trying to  
 
Boy, everyday with you 
I swear it brings me closer to  
My only reservation is you,  
My sweet temptation, baby 
 
[Chorus] 
 
I've given it consideration (uh huh) 
And it all adds up to you 
I won't deny this heart is calling for you, baby 
I've given it a lot of thought (uh huh) 
And it all ends up on you 
My sweet temptation 
God knows I'm falling for you

Is is in your smile, boy 
Is it touch, baby

Who gives me courage to go on and on and on from there 
And who gives me faith

Bigger than the Shaq attack

And you could grow up to be anything 
But who would imagine a king 
 
A shepherd or teacher is what you could be 
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea 
Or maybe a carpenter building things 
But who would imagine a king 
 
It was so clear when the wise men arrived 
And the angels were singing your name 
That the world would be different 'cause you were alive 
That's what heaven stood still to proclaim 
 
One day an angel said quietly 
That soon he would bring something special to me 
And of all those wonderful gifts he could bring 
 
Who would imagine, who could imagine 
Who would imagine a king

You were loved by someone  
Touched by someone  
Held by someone  
Meant something to someone  
Loved somebody  
Touched somebody's heart  
Along the way  
You can look back and say (mm)  
You were loved (yes you were)  
 
You can have diamonds in your hands  
Have all the riches in the land  
But, without love,  
You don't really have a thing, no no  
When somebody cares that you're alive  
When somebody trusts you with their life  
That's when you'll know (huh)

The finest treasure that there is  
You can look back and know

Back in the day 
I used to mean everything

To the way it used to be 
(My only wish would be that) 
Nothing would change for you and me

And I know that for a fact

If we could just get it back 
 
Now tell me why  
So many nights  
You had so much to do  
When you said bye  
Sometimes I tried 
I tried to make you choose  
Now tell me how 
You can allow 
You boys to control 
The time we shared  
It was unfair  
But now you need to know 
 
(Now if I told you)  
That I'm moving on  
(Boy what would you do)  
Things just ain't the same  
(We were supposed to)  
Conquer everything yeah  
(Boy let me tell you) 
You've got to make a change

Asking myself why

Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face

All I really wanted was some of your time  
Instead you told me lies  
When someone else was on your mind  
What you do to me  
Look what you did to me 
I thought that you were someone who would do me right  
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry  
What you do to me  
Can't take what you did to me 
 
Now I see that you've been doing wrong  
You played me all along 
And made a fool of me, baby  
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out  
That you were cheating on me  
How could you do it to me

I thought that you were someone who would do me right  
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry  
What you do to me  
Can't take what you did to me 
 
All I really wanted was some of your time  
Instead you told me lies  
When someone else was on your mind  
What you do to me  
Look what you did to me 
I thought that you were someone who would do me right  
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry  
What you do to me  
Can't take what you did to me 
 
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna take it no more  
I ain't gonna take it no more  
I ain't gonna take it no more  
 
Everything that you said was a lie 
Don't lie to me 
Tell me what it is and I will be alright</field>

You said you'd be here by nine 
Instead you took your time 
You didn't think to call me, boy 
Here I sit trying not to cry 
Asking myself why 
You do this to me, mm oh baby 
 
Since you're not around 
For me to tell ya baby, face to face 
I'm writing you this letter 
And this is what I have to say

Now I see that you've been doin' wrong 
Played me all along 
And made a fool of me, baby 
You got it all wrong 
To think that I wouldn't find out 
That you were cheating on me, baby 
How could you do it to me 
 
Since you're not around 
For me to tell ya baby, face to face 
I'm writing you this letter

And I won't play it no more  
And I won't take it no more

Not for one minute  
I'm gonna pull, I'm gonna pull this curtain down  
 
[Chorus] 
This time I won't play this game  
I made a vow to make a change  
And I bow out  
I won't be hanging around, baby  
I decline to take the pain  
And I resign the masquerade  
And I bow out  
I won't be staying around, baby  
I bow out  
 
Can't go on with the show  
You're just a stage I went through  
Now you're just fading from view, yeah baby  
It's time for a change of scene  
Guess I'll be taking my leave  
I guess I won't, I won't stay in this play  
Not for one minute  
I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make my exit now  
Oh baby

When you're left standing on that stage all alone  
Maybe you will realize  
You should of learned to treat me right  
And when this final act is finally through  
Maybe you'll wish you'd been  
The kind of man you should have been  
Now watch me say goodbye  
And walk right out of your life  
Oh baby, all right babe

I would really take you back 
Let you back in my heart 
One more time, oh, no no 
 
Did you think I'd still care 
That there'd be more feeling there 
Did you think you could walk back 
In my life, oh 
 
So you found you missed the love you threw away 
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late 
 
And so you know the way it feels to cry 
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two 
And baby I learned the way to break a heart 
I learned from the best, I learned from you 
Oh baby, now, I learned from you 
 
I remember cold nights 
Tears I thought would never dry 
How you shattered my world 
With your goodbye, your goodbye 
 
Would a sold my soul then 
Just to have you back again 
Now you are the last thing on my mind 
 
Now you say you're sorry and you've 
Changed your ways 
Sorry but you changed your ways too late 
 
And so you know the way it feels to cry 
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two 
And baby I learned the way to break a heart 
I learned from the best, I learned from you 
Oh baby, now, I learned from you 
 
So when all you've got are sleepless night 
When those tears are clouding up your eyes 
Just remember it was you 
Who said goodbye, who said goodbye 
 
And so you know the way it feels to cry 
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two 
And baby I learned the way to break a heart 
I learned from the best, I learned from you 
Oh baby, now, I learned from you 
 
I learned from the best 
I learned from you</field>

See I was born in Newark (sure was)  
 
We were always hand in hand  
He wore high top shoes and shirt tales  
Nip wore her pigtails  
I knew I loved him even then  
You know some disapproved it  
They even boo-hooed it  
But I told them time and time and time again  
 
You know I was made to love him  
Build my world around him and  
Hey, hey, hey  
He's been my inspiration  
Sho' nuff appreciation  
For the love I gave him through the years  
 
Like a sweet magnolia tree  
My love blossomed tenderly  
My love grew sweeter through the years  
 
I know my baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
That's why we made it through the years  
 
I was made to love him  
Worship and adore him, yes say  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, oh Lord  
 
All through thick and thin  
Our love just won't end  
But I love my baby, love my baby, oh  
 
My baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
I know I ain't going nowhere  
I was just a little thing  
The love bug hit me  
I had the fever with each passing year  
 
If all should tumble  
And the whole world crumble  
By his side I'll still be standing, yeah  
 
'Cause I was made to love him  
Made meant for him, say  
Hey, hey, hey  
I was made to love him  
Build my world all around him say  
Hey, hey, hey  
 
I love my baby  
Nip ain't' going nowhere  
Say hey, hey, hey</field>

If I told you that I  
Have feelings for you  
And would it be so wrong to say  
What's on my mind  
I'm sorry I have to 
We were friends but with time  
What I feel inside for you has changed  
But I'd give up on love 
If I thought that it was untrue for you 
 
If I told you that 
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that 
I'd beg to please you  
If I told you that 
I'll always keep you  
What would you say 
If I told you that 
 
I know that we're just friends  
But what if I decide to bring something in  
I hope it won't offend the trust  
We have cause I don't want this to end 
If you think that we'll lose what we have  
Then I'd just rather stay (rather stay) the same  
(I'd rather stay the same)  
'Cause I don't want to choose  
Between two of the most precious things to me  
(Tell me) 
 
If I told you that

The right thing for you and me

I'd beg to please you

Would you be there for me  
Could you dare to hold me  
Will my feelings leave me  
Lonely if I told you 
 
If I told you that 
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that 
I'd beg to please you  
If I told you that 
I'll always keep you

They seen you up in the mall  
Are they mistaking  
All up on some chick  
As though I don't exist

Why they all in my business  
It's just too ridiculous  
I can't get no sleep  
They just keep warning me  
Should I believe it  
They say I don't need it  
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind 
 
Honey too many people say you're faking me  
They ask what have you done lately  
They say we won't last 
They're predicting that it's over, it's over 
 
Why they all in my business  
It's just too ridiculous  
I can't get no sleep

Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind 
 
Too many girls they dislike me  
Since I got you  
They wanna fight me  
'Cause I'm the chick walking around  
With the ring  
Tell me why these hoes they don't even like me 
 
Why they all in my business  
It's just too ridiculous  
I can't get no sleep  
They just keep warning me  
Should I believe it

They mind 'cause love is what they're missing

Then they hung out, but you came home around three 
If six of y'all went out 
Then four of you were really cheap 
'Cause only two of you had dinner

It's not right but it's okay

Close the door behind you leave your key 
I'd rather be alone than unhappy 
 
I pack your bags so you can leave town for a week (yes I am) 
The phone rings and then you look at me (Why'd you turn and look at me) 
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street (boy) 
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID 
 
I've been through all this before 
So how could you think 
That I would stand around and take some more 
Things are gonna change 
'Cause I won't be your fool anymore 
That's why you have to leave 
So don't turn around to see my face 
There's no more tears left here for you to see 
 
Was it really worth you going out like that 
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back 
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney 
It turns out, you were making a fool of me 
 
It's not right, but it's okay

And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 
 
If I should die this very day (very very very day) 
Don't cry (don't cry), 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay 
And no matter what the people say (really don't matter) 
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day 
 
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us</field>

I still smell the scent of you 
On my dress unbelievable 
You were so masculine 
The way I felt your chest up next to mine 
I felt you in my heart 
And now I breathe love 
 
You are so amazing 
Unbelievable baby 
It's you that makes me smile 
When everything is crazy 
You're the one I love 
No other man can faze me 
'Cause you're in my heart 
I'm your heart 
Every minute daily 
 
Yes 
 
The time you looked into my eyes 
I felt like falling in love 
And I was mesmerized 
'Cause it's something that you do 
That makes me feel this way 
And I can't explain 
You're my joy, my peace, my happiness 
And you 
 
You are so amazing 
Unbelievable baby 
It's you that makes me smile 
When everything is crazy 
You're the one I love 
No other man can faze me 
'Cause you're in my heart 
I'm in your heart 
Every minute daily</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I lost my heart a long time ago  
You made me feel like no one had before  
Boy, you made me love you  
Then you walked out the door  
See, I will not rest until you say I'm forever yours  
 
[Chorus] 
And boy I won't stop at nothing  
I won't give you up  
And you've gotta feel something  
I know I will not love again  
Until you come back  
Come back to my arms  
Till you come back to me baby  
Until you come back  
 
I don't care how long baby  
It's not important to me  
Don't care how far  
Love's never too far for me, oh no it ain't  
I just might be crazy, yes I am  
When it comes to my heart  
But I can not rest until  
The day we're no longer apart  
 
[Chorus] 
 
To me  
Nobody plays with my heart  
You can walk away from it all, baby  
You can run but your heart can not hide  
'Cause it knows you belong in my arms  
 
[Chorus] 
 
To me  
Oh yeah  
Till you come back to me baby  
Come on home, come home  
To me</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Many nights we prayed 
With no proof anyone could hear 
In our hearts a hope for a song 
We barely understood 
 
Now we are not afraid 
Although we know there's much to fear 
We were moving mountains 
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes 
 
There can be miracles 
When you believe 
Though hope is frail 
Its hard to kill 
 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve 
When you believe somehow you will 
You will when you believe 
 
(Mmmmmmmmmyeah) 
Mmmyeah 
In this time of fear 
When prayer so often proves in vain 
 
Hope seems like the summer bird 
Too swiftly flown away 
Yet now I'm standing here 
My hearts so full, I can't explain 
 
Seeking faith and speakin' words 
I never thought I'd say 
There can be miracles 
When you believe (When you believe) 
 
Though hope is frail 
Its hard to kill (Mmm) 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve (You can achieve) 
 
When you believe somehow you will 
You will when you believe 
(Hey) 
(Ooh) 
 
They don't always happen when you ask 
And its easy to give in to your fears 
But when you're blinded by your pain 
Can't see the way, get through the rain 
 
A small but still, resilient voice 
Says hope is very near, oh (Oh) 
There can be miracles (Miracles) 
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah) (Though hope is frail) 
 
Though hope is frail (Its hard) 
Its hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah) 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh) 
 
When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow) 
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know) 
You will when you believe (When you) 
(Oh oh) 
 
(You will when you) 
(You will when you believe) 
(Ohoohooh) 
(Oh, oh) 
 
(When you believe)

Then they hung out, but you came home around three  
If six of y'all went out  
Then four of you were really cheap  
'Cause only two of you had dinner  
I found your credit card receipt 
 
It's not right but it's okay  
I'm gonna make it anyway  
Pack your bags up and leave  
And don't you dare come running back to me   
 
It's not right but it's okay  
I'm gonna make it anyway  
Close the door behind you leave your key  
I'd rather be alone than unhappy 
 
I pack your bags so you can leave town for a week (yes I am) 
The phone rings and then you look at me (Why'd you turn and look at me)  
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street (boy) 
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID 
 
I've been through all this before  
So how could you think  
That I would stand around and take some more  
Things are gonna change  
'Cause I won't be your fool anymore  
That's why you have to leave  
So don't turn around to see my face  
There's no more tears left here for you to see 
 
Was it really worth you going out like that  
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back  
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney 
It turns out, you were making a fool of me 
 
It's not right, but it's okay  
I'm gonna make it anyway  
Pack your bags up and leave

            <field name="lyrics">Friday night you and your boys went out to eat  
Then they hung out, but you came home around three  
If six of y'all went out  
Then four of you were really cheap  
'Cause only two of you had dinner  
I found your credit card receipt 
 
It's not right but it's okay  
I'm gonna make it anyway  
Pack your bags up and leave  
And don't you dare come running back to me   
 
It's not right but it's okay  
I'm gonna make it anyway  
Close the door behind you leave your key  
I'd rather be alone than unhappy 
 
I pack your bags so you can leave town for a week (yes I am) 
The phone rings and then you look at me (Why'd you turn and look at me)  
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street (boy) 
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID 
 
I've been through all this before  
So how could you think  
That I would stand around and take some more  
Things are gonna change  
'Cause I won't be your fool anymore  
That's why you have to leave  
So don't turn around to see my face  
There's no more tears left here for you to see 
 
Was it really worth you going out like that  
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back  
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney 
It turns out, you were making a fool of me 
 
It's not right, but it's okay  
I'm gonna make it anyway  
Pack your bags up and leave  
And don't you dare come running back to me 
 
It's not right, but it's okay  
I'm gonna make it anyway  
Close the door behind you leave your key

I finally took a moment  
And I'm realizing that  
You're not coming back  
And it's finally hit me all at once  
All at once I've started counting teardrops  
And at least a million fell  
My eyes began to swell  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
 
Ever since I met you  
You're the only love I've known  
And I can't forget you  
Though I must face it all alone  
 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Wishing you'd come back to me  
And that's all that matters now  
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Holding on to memories  
And it's hurt me more than you know  
So much more than it shows  
All at once  
 
All at once I looked around and found that you were  
With another love  
In someone else's arms  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
All at once the smile that used to greet me  
Brightened someone else's day  
She took your smile away  
And left me with just memories all at once  
 
Ever since I met you  
You're the only love I've known  
And I can't forget you  
Though I must face it all alone  
 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Wishing you'd come back to me  
And that's all that matters now  
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Holding on to memories  
And it's hurt me more than you know  
So much more than it shows  
All at once  
 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Wishing you'd come back to me  
And it's hurt me more than you know  
So much more than it shows

Over and over I've dreamed of this night 
Now you're here by my side 
You are next to me 
I want to hold you 
And touch you and taste you 
And make you want no one but me 
I wish that this kiss could never end, no no 
Oh, baby please 
 
Could I hold you for a lifetime? 
Could I look into your eyes?

Could I (could I), could I have this kiss forever? (forever) and ever 
 
I don't want any night to go by 
Without you by my side 
I just want all my days 
Spent being next to you 
Lived for just loving you 
And baby, oh by the way 
 
Could I hold you for a lifetime? 
Could I look into your eyes?

All those sweet (sweet) sweet kisses (yeah) 
And those sweet (sweet) red roses (yeah) 
They convinced me it was you 
I made you (you) exclusive (yeah) 
Now it's so (now it's conclusive that) conclusive 
That you wasn't doin' it too 
 
[Chorus] 
If ya told me from the start 
That you played around, I woulda been fine 
Then I woulda played too 
And I guess I woulda had a good time 
If ya told me from the start 
That you played around, I woulda been fine 
Then I woulda played too 
And I guess I woulda had a good time 
 
Something didn't feel right 
And I wish I knew it 
I just could not see your games 
I got respect for you 
And you put me through it 
Why would you bring me so much pain 
 
I would stick up for you 
'Cause I did (I did adore you) adore you 
While my dogs would chew you out 
Tried to be so nice 
On those lonely  
(On those lonely lonely lonely nights) nights 
But I should have figured you out 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Baby you're so fine 
(You are the one that I love) 
You are so fine 
(Your love was sent from above) 
You are so, you're fine, fine, fine, fine 
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine (so doggone fine) 
You are so fine 
Fine (your love was sent from above) 
Oh you're all of mine 
You're fine, fine, fine, fine,  
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine (so doggone fine) 
Fine (you are the one that I love) 
Fine (your love was sent from above) 
You're fine, fine, fine, fine 
Fine, five, fine, fine, fine (so doggone fine)

Teach them well and let them lead the way. 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside. 
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier; 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be. 
  
Everybody's searching for a hero; 
People need someone to look up to. 
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need. 
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me. 
  
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow. 
If I fail, if I succeed.  
At least I lived as I believe.  
No matter what they take from me, 
They can't take away my dignity. 
  
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me. 
I found the greatest love of all inside of me. 
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve. 
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

            <field name="lyrics">Sometimes life can make you crazy 
It can really put a body to the test 
You try so hard to make sure everything is right 
And you find you've only wound up with a mess 
 
It's a common situation 
Even though you feel abandoned and alone 
Child, you ain't the first to experience a hurt so 
Don't panic when you bit the danger zone 
 
What you need's a little change of heart 
Forget this fear and frustration 
Love will always play the greater part 
When you battles wear you down 
Here's my advice 
 
When you're feeling down and out 
And you're got troubles on your mind 
Love will save the day 
When you're feeling full of doubt 
And fear has got you in a bind 
Love will save the day 
 
When your world's falling apart 
All you got to do is say a prayer 
And love will save the day 
There's answer in your heart 
So let your light shines, my dear 
And love will save the day 
Love will save the day 
Love will save the day 
Love will save the day 
Love will save the day 
Love will save the day 
 
Many things in this world bring you down 
It's a wonder you can make it through the day 
Well you can't sleep cause your problems are too deep 
And there's always something getting the way 
 
And when you turn on the evening news 
Mass confusion is the only thing you'll see 
Well there's no question 
That we need a new direction cause 
We all could use dome peace and harmony 
 
What you need's a little change of heart 
Forget this fear and frustration 
Love will always play the greater part 
When you battles wear you down 
Here's my advice 
 
When you're feeling down and out 
And you're got troubles on your mind 
Love will save the day 
When you're feeling full of doubt 
And fear has got you in a bind

Uh-huh 
(How did you know? How did you know?) 
Because I played the scene before 
 
[Whitney] 
This is a retake of my life 
I was his star for many nights 
Now the roles have changed  
And you're the leading lady in his life 
Lights, camera, now you're on 
Just remember you've been warned 
Enjoy it now cause it won't last 
Same script, different cast 
 
[Deborah](Whitney) 
What you're saying could be true 
But how can I take advice from you?  
(I'm not hating) 
(But I wish the one before me would have warned me too babe) 
Don't say no more, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
(Uncover your ears, girl) 
I'm not listening, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
(But I know you hear me) 
(Maybe my reasons are wrong) 
(But I know that you believe me) 
 
[Whitney] 
This is a retake of my life

And you're the leading lady in his life 
Lights, camera, now you're on 
Just remember you've been warned 
Enjoy it now cause it won't last 
Same script, different cast 
 
[Deborah](Whitney) 
It's your fault you didn't love him enough 
(That's the problem, I loved him too much) 
(And when you love him he becomes unattracted to you) 
Oh no, he's changed and I'll prove you wrong 
(No, you won't) 
So go away leave us the hell alone 
See, he loves me 
(He'll hurt you) 
He'll stay with me 
(He'll leave you) 
For sure, for sure, oh 
 
[Whitney] 
This is a retake of my life

Enjoy it now, because it won't last  
No, same script, different cast

I'm looking for you  
Drifting on a memory  
Ain't no place I'd rather be  
Than with you, loving you  
Day will make a way for night  
All we'll need is candlelight  
And a song soft and long, well  
 
Glad to be here alone  
With a lover unlike no other  
Safe to see a new horizon  
Slowly coming into view  
 
[Chorus]  
I want to be living for the love of you  
All that I'm giving is for the love of you  
 
Lovely as a ray of sun  
That touches me when the morning comes  
Feels good to me, my love and me  
Smoother than a gentle breeze  
Flowing through my mind with ease  
Soft as can be well when you're loving me  
 
Love to be  
Riding the waves of your love  
Enchanted with your touch  
It seems to me  
We can sail together in and out of mystery  
 
[Chorus]  
 
Paradise I have within  
Can't feel insecure again  
You're the key and this I see  
Now and then I lose my way  
Using words to try and say  
What I feel yeah love is real ooh  
I might as well  
Sign my name on a card  
Which could say it better  
Time will tell  
Cause it seems that I've done  
Just about all that I can do do do

It's the second time around  
For you and I boy  
And believe me it's confusing me  
I'm afraid to say "let's make up" and "All's forgiven"  
But somethin' tells me it's heading for heartbreak  
So darling please I'm praying that  
This time yeah this time will be different  
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize  
 
[Chorus] 
Tell me are you really ready for love boy  
Or is it just the lonely talking again  
Are you really ready for love boy  
Or is it the lonely talking again 
 
Now the time before  
When we got together  
You promised you'd be forever true to me  
But all I got from you  
Was lots and lots of talking  
Lonely nights filled with misery  
 
So baby please please tell me now  
That when I fulfill your needs  
You won't up and leave me  
Even though you know  
I'll let you come back

Really need to know

Are we gonna talk?

In my own head thinking 
How you could be staring in 
Got my number too 
And I'm writing you 
Contemplating on the paper what I should do 
On the fireplace with the mail man 
Should I tell you or should I hold it in 
If my heart wasn't in it 
Baby you could just forget it 
I'd be gone in a New York minute 
 
You never give me attention 
I know you never had bad intentions for us 
So I'm writing you but I always fail to mention 
Cause you know I really don't like to fuss 
So I'm gonna hold it in  
 
[Chorus] 
(I'm writing you a) Dear John letter 
I tried to stay but it never got better 
I couldn't tell you face to face but I, 
I had to let you know 
Sometimes I want to hit the door 
(I'm writing you Dear John)  
Sometimes I think that I've had enough 
My hands freeze and I can't write fast enough, 
I want to get away but I can't obey when my heart speaks, 
You know I'm listening 
Some days I'm really touchy and 
Some days I'm willing to forget and 
Some days I'm still in love with you 
Some days I'm sad and blue 
 
When I don't check myself 
I get frustrated with you 
And I don't know what I'm gonna do 
I know that it's not just you 
It's some of my negligence too 
And I can't go through with mailing this to you  
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
When I don't check myself

            <field name="lyrics">Ah, ah, ah 
Things just ain't the way that they used to be 
Back in the day when a man meant security 
He'd be working hard all week 
Baby kick back and throw up your feet 
Let me fix you a treat 
So it might be love and sweet 
 
But he's worth it 
He deserves it 
May not be perfect 
But he's all the man I need 
He's ready and willing 
Gives me the feeling, ah 
And whenever we're together 
I know where I belong 
 
[Chorus] 
It's just the way he looks into your eyes 
Love that man 
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize 
Love that man 
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares 
And he's always there (He's always always there) 
Don't you love that man (I know) 
 
Things they ain't the way they used to be 
When a woman and a man work hard to be 
Happy in love and stand together ooh 
(Let's stay that way forever) 
 
Never give in to a fight 
Just trying work it out 
Never give up on him 
That's not what love's about 
Stay true to your feelings 
And remember 
All the things he's done for you 
 
[Chorus] 
 
You'd better know I'm talking about that old-school love 
That everlasting feeling can never be too much 
Somebody loves you heart and soul 
Hold on, don't stop 
And never let him go

Some girl just want to spend guys money 
Live their lives chasing the milk or honey 
Silver lives are their fantasy 
But you're lucky cause that ain't me 
 
Most girls think guys are all the same 
Not you so I can take the blame 
I love you through the joy and pain 
Even the coldest Georgia rain 
 
[Chorus] 
See my love is like a open sky 
See my heart is like the river wide 
No my world would never ever run dry 
It runs over for you and I 
See my love is deeper than the sea 
And sweeter than a pretty melody 
So tell everybody that you're glad you got me 
You can trust in my love 
My L-O-V-E 
(My love, my love, my) 
 
Some think that love is just a word 
Because of all the things they've heard 
They think they're gotta close their hearts 
Can't see the light, the soul in the dark 
But I know I got a real good man 
Who loves me the best as he can 
That's why I'm here faithfully 
'Cause you'll do the same for me 
 
[Chorus] 
 
You gotta go through 
The fire (the pain) 
The rain (the joy) 
Take the joy and do it in pain 
(Never give in) 
Give in 
Don't give up 
(Don't give up) 
We can try but it will never never break my love 
 
Sweet, sweet love 
Sweet, sweet love 
See my love

Kick off my shoes and relax my feet 
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat 
It's been one of those crazy weeks 
And I gotta do something special for me 
 
See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi 
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready 
Gotta take time out 
And my real ladies know what I'm talking about 
 
Sing. Oooooooh, baby baby 
You don't know what I've been going through 
Sing it again now. Oooooooh, baby baby 
It's obvious to see exactly what I need 
 
One of those days 
When the sun is shining bright 
And my life is going right 
And the simple things are not wasted 
 
One of those days 
When you're cruising in your car 
And you're out to see the stars 
And it's warm outside and beautiful 
 
Tonight, it's all about me 
Just wanna set my body free 
Never mind the TV 
Tonight I'll just let a little TV watch me 
Light the candles, aroma therapy 
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me 
Mr. Big is in the background 
The Isley Brothers gonna hold it down sing 
 
One of those days 
When the sun is shining bright 
And my life is going right 
And the simple things are not wasted 
 
One of those days 
When you're cruising in your car 
And you're out to see the stars 
And it's warm outside and beautiful 
 
Singing hello hello  
I need one of those days 
You don't know what 
Warm and beautiful</field>

Every word just gives me fuel 
So come on, come on, come on 
Come on, come on, come on!

Tell me no 
I'll show you I can 
Tell me no 
I'll dig my feet right in

Come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong 
Come on and go! 
Tell me no!  
 
For every step I take you're right there 
Trying to block my next move. 
And if you're making me feel bad, 
Then tell me then do you feel good? 
I'm just human and all I'm doing 
Is what my heart tells me I should 
So come on, come on, come on 
Come on, come on, come on!

No no no no no no 
It motivates me more and more 
And I think it's time you know 
You're giving me something to look forward 
And I can't wait for the day

I ain't gon stop til I'm done 
I've reached the top, I'm Number One 
But every time you try and tell me no 
Oh it makes me keep on keeping on

Why lie? See for yourself when I slide through 
Drive by, your bitch say don't look, you do

You wish boo boo could ride with you tonight 
Ain't nothing in the world that Brat can't do

Wow, know how to all night long 
All night long, tell me 
 
Whassup? The setting, a hot-ass club 
And you still be sweating me 
I don't see nothing wrong with giving a little love 
But nigga just let me breathe 
Damn, you cute as hell so let's switch the digits 
Then I got to leave 
And you can buy me a couple of drinks 
But I'mma go socialize and smoke my weed 
And I like it when you keep your eyes on me 
And I like it when you touch my privacy 
And I like it sex and ecstasy 
When the belt buckle loosen up, undress me 
Already juiced up, that come naturally 
Wax on and off so romantically 
No woman can slow dance or throw down like I can 
Ask if you curious to know what I like, man 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Let me tell you something 
Well I start at the top of the list 
With my pretty eyes, a cute nose and these fat ass lips 
My medallion sit in the middle of my tits 
It's hit after hit, shit sweet every sip  
Down to the last drip drop, watch the hips rock 
Color Me Bad, tick tock you don't stop

Waiting for someone to sing me his song 
So many dreams I kept deep inside me 
Alone in the dark but now 
You've come along 
 
And you light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
And fill my nights with song 
 
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water 
Could it be finally I'm turning for home? 
Finally, a chance to say hey, 
I love you 
Never again to be all alone 
 
'Cause you 
You light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
And fill my nights with song 
 
And you 
You light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
And fill my nights with song 
With song 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
And fill my nights with song 
 
It can't be wrong 
When it feels so right 
'Cause you 
You light up my life, my life, my life, my life oooh</field>

I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme 
I've acted out my love in stages 
With ten thousand people watching 
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you 
 
I know your image of me is what I hope to be 
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see 
There's no one more important to me 
Daring can't you please see through me 
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you 
 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing 
You came out in front and I was hiding 
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together 
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding 
 
I love you in place where there's no space or time 
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine 
And when my life is over remember when we were together 
We were alone and I was singing this song for you 
We were alone and I was singing this song for you</field>

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (well) 
Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir 
And folks dressed up like Eskimos 
 
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe (well) 
Help to make the season bright 
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight 
 
You now that, you know that, you know that Santa's on his way 
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
Everybody's mother's child is going to spy 
To see if reindeer's really know how to fly 
 
And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
From kids from one to ninety-two 
Although it's been said many times, many ways 
Merry Christmas 
Happy Hanukkah 
Happy Kwanzaa 
Merry Christmas to 
To all of you 
Merry Christmas to everyone</field>

Heaven from hell 
Blue skies from pain 
Can you tell a green field 
From a cold steel rail? 
A smile from a veil? 
Do you think you can tell? 
 
Did they get you to trade 
Your heroes for ghosts? 
Hot ashes for trees? 
Hot air for a cool breeze? 
Cold comfort for change? 
And did you exchange 
A walk on part in the war 
For a lead role in a cage? 
 
How I wish, how I wish you were here 
We're just two lost souls 
Swimming in a fish bowl 
Year after year 
Running over the same old ground 
And how we found 
The same old fears 
Wish you were here</field>

If there were no presents 
Waiting on Santa's sleigh 
What would I wish for Christmas 
And if Frosty the snowman 
Were melting away 
I would pray for hope and unity 
On Christmas day 
 
If I had one wish for Christmas 
There would be joy 
And peace here on earth 
If I had one wish for Christmas this year 
We would all come together as one 
 
If Rudolph and his reindeer 
Ran into delays 
I'd still hope for joy this season 
And if somehow Santa got lost on his way 
I would try to find a way to smile 
Smile on Christmas day 
 
Oh, if I had one wish for Christmas

Waiting here beside the phone 
The TV, radio and me 
Really ain't been getting along 
 
I wish that I could fly away 
And party till the break of day 
And there I'd be sure to meet 
The guy that would be special to me 
 
Then mama comes and asks me 
Why am I dreaming sitting alone? 
Why not go out and have some fun 
It's the only way I'll ever find 
Someone for me 
While I am young and seventeen 
 
Someone for me 
Someone for me 
I've got to go find someone, someone 
Someone for me 
I've got to find someone, yeah! 
 
Now here's a party down at Angie's house 
With people packed against the wall 
I'm sitting in the corner here 
Trying to make some sense of it all 
 
And when I least expect it 
Meeting the guy I see in my dreams 
Here he is walking up to me and asking 
If I'd like to come and dance with him 
I think I've found someone for me 
 
Someone for me 
Someone for me 
I've got to go find someone, someone 
Someone for me 
I've got to find someone, yeah! 
 
And so I'm finding out that dreams you believe in 
Can come to be 
And now I'm looking up to find the joy and happiness 
Can come to you and me 
At last I've found someone for me 
 
Someone for me 
Someone for me 
I've got to go find someone, someone 
Someone for me 
I've got to find someone, yeah!</field>

I got through all the pain 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
Survived my darkest hour 
My faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up 
 
Hold my head up high 
I was not built to break 
I didn't know my own strength 
 
Found hope in my heart, 
I found the light to life 
My way out the dark 
Found all that I need 
Here inside of me 
 
I thought I'd never find my way 
I thought I'd never lift that weight 
I thought I would break 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down, and I tumbled 
But I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
Survived my darkest hour 
My faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up 
 
Hold my head up high 
I was not built to break 
I didn't know my own strength 
 
There were so many times I 
Wondered how I'd get through the night I 
Thought took all I could take 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down, and I tumbled 
But I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
Survived my darkest hour 
My faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up 
 
Hold my head up high 
I was not built to break 
I didn't know my own strength 
 
I was not built to break 
I got to know my own strength</field>

            <field name="lyrics">When your love is strong and it comes from the heart 
Ain't no man strong enough ain't no time long enough to tear it apart 
And that's what we had believe it or not 
So on the final day I thought all the hurting pain will end up on top 
 
So I won't cry 'cause you're going away 
'Cause the chemistry we've got it don't fade 
I won't be wishing for better days 
'Cause deep inside I know our love stays the same 
 
You got to know 
 
[Chorus] 
No matter where you are (you got me) 
Baby near or far (you got me) 
Our love will never fade (you got me) 
So let me hear you say it 
Baby I got you... I'll be there I'll be there (no matter what) 
Baby I got you... I'll be there I'll be there (no matter what) 
'Cause I got you baby 
 
I never lie 
'Cause you are the reason that my heart is beating that I am alive 
Before you go... look in my eyes 
You can't be replaced (no) 
I'm down to wait... The rest of my life 
 
You got to know 
 
[Chorus] 
 
I'll hold you up... when you just can't stand 
I'll make you fly... when you think that you can't 
By my side forever... baby that's the plan 
I'll be your everything... I'll be your everything 
 
I got you... 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Say you want me I want you baby 
Say you love me I need you baby 
I got you baby you got me 
I'll be there for you 
I love you baby I love you darling 
 
Say you will be there...</field>

Heaven hear me now 
I'm lost without a cause 
After giving it my all 
 
Winter storms have come 
And darkened my sun 
After all that I've been through 
Who on earth can I turn to 
 
I look to you 
I look to you 
 
After all my strength is gone 
In you I can be strong 
 
I look to you 
I look to you 
 
Yeah 
 
And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 
 
I look to you 
 
After losing my breath 
There's no more fighting left 
Sinking to rise no more 
Searching for that open door 
 
And every road that I've taken 
Led to my regret 
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it 
Nothing to do but lift my head 
 
I look to you 
I look to you 
 
Yeah 
 
And when all my strength is gone 
In you I can be strong 
 
I look to you 
I look to you 
 
Oh yeah 
 
And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 
 
I look to you 
 
(my levies have broken, my walls have come) 
 
Coming down on me 
 
(crumbling down on me) 
 
All the rain is falling 
 
(the rain is falling, defeat is calling) 
 
Set me free 
 
(I need you to set me free) 
 
Take me far away from the battle 
I need you 
Shine on me 
 
I look to you 
I look to you 
 
After all my strength has gone 
In you I can be strong 
 
I look to you 
I look to you 
 
And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 
 
I look to you 
 
Yeah 
 
I look to you

Came in the door 
Checked in my coat 
And who I'm looking for 
Is staring in my face 
 
They played our song 
We hit the floor 
He held me strong 
And we danced the night away 
 
I can see the way that he is making feel 
This way about his love 
I've been looking for something like this 
I'm saying ooh oh oh oh ooh oh oh! 
 
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill 
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh! 
If you go left right up down 
Make you spinning round and round 
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh! 
 
It's been a long long time 
Since I fell, fell 
Love has found my way oh oh oh 
I've been looking (looking) 
I've been searching (searching) 
For the man to touch this place, oh ooh oh yeah 
 
Can't deny the way that he is making feel 
This way about his love

I'm saying oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

If you feel good 
If you're feeling good 
Put one hand in the air, say yeah 
If you feel good 
If you're feeling good 
It's 'cause love is in the air 
Love is in the air 
 
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill 
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh! 
Makes you go left right up down 
Makes you spinning round and round 
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

There were times where I never thought I get to where I got to 
Had some angels to guide me someone who just violate my love 
Now this is my chance to say ain't go nothin' but love 
 
For my family that raised me (shout out shout out) 
And my teacher that done praised me (shout out shout out) 
To anyone who tried to hate on me (shout out shout out) 
Even the one's who tried to break me even the one's who tried to take me down 
 
[Chorus] 
There've been haters since this world been going 'round 
(nothin' but love nothin' but love) 
Why they take a thing and trying to crush them down 
(nothin' but love nothin' but love) 
I ain't even trying to hold on to that now 
(nothin' but love nothin' but love) 
Ain't got nothin' but love for you 
(nothin' but love nothin' but love) 
 
I could hold on to pain but that ain't what my life's about 
I ain't blaming nobody if I ain't got my stuff worked out 
I got love for my self ain't goin' regret anything I've done 
I just want to sing my song ain't got nothin' but love 
 
For all the players on the street (shout out shout out) 
To all my ghetto doing their own thing (keep on keep strong) 
To all my exes that done wrong me stepped on me can't hold me down 
 
[Chorus] 
 
To all the givers and the takers 
To my crew from way back when 
To the cold wars and the stares 
And the ones that I ain't met 
 
For my self for sticking with me 
For the one's I miss from up above 
Anyone who's ever been a part of me 
Ain't got nothin' but love 
(Ain't got nothin' but love) 
 
[Chorus]

Ain't got nothin' but love for you

I feel like going to a club 
And partying 
 
'Cause am I soldier girl in this world 
I stand alone, I can be strong 
I walk for miles and made it home 
It's good to know without you I made it

You say, "I'll never do better" 
Yeah right whatever

"So don't call it a comeback, no... I've been here for years" 
Through all of the drama and the pain and all of the tears 
It's time to stop this roller coaster, say I want to get off 
And start moving mountains, swimming seas, and climbing over 
 
I'm a soldier girl in this world 
I stand alone, I can be strong 
I walk for miles and made it home 
It's good to know without you I made it 
 
Soldier girl in my world, took the fall now I stand tall 
For the pain and all I made it through and now I'm vow to say to you

It's a beautiful thing when it`s shared between two 
The most beautiful thing about it is 
That it is so much more than you 
There ain't nothing in the world like (being with your lover) 
Nothing in the world like (seeing one another) 
Happy with the one you need the most 
I know somebody's gonna make love to this song tonight

I know somebody's out of town and they're calling home tonight 
Let me tell you what they are saying right now

It ain't hard to tell when it's something real 
You can have the world, all you want is them 
Even when you're in the crowd and you spot them from a mile 
That's when you know love is worth it

Some people feel it, they let it show 
Some people miss it, they let it go 
Some people doubt it, I'm gonna tell you know 
They don't a thing about it, that?s why they doubt it 
 
Some people give it, some people take it 
Some people try to but they can't make it 
That's why when it's official you just can't walk away 
And you can trust me when I say :

I had nowhere to turn, I had nowhere to go 
Lost sight of my dream 
Thought it would be the end of me 
 
I thought I'd never make it through 
I had no hope to hold on to 
I, I thought I would break 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain 
I didn't know my own strength 
 
Survived my darkest hour, my faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up, hold my head up high 
I was not built to break 
I didn't know my own strength 
 
Found hope in my heart 
I found the light to life my way out of the dark 
Found all that I need here inside of me 
 
I thought I'd never find my way 
I thought I'd never lift that weight 
I thought I would break 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain 
I didn't know my own strength 
 
Survived my darkest hour, my faith kept me alive 
I picked myself back up, hold my head up high 
I was not built to break 
I didn't know my own strength 
 
There were so many times I wondered 
How I'd get through the night 
I thought I took all that I could take 
 
I didn't know my own strength 
And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble 
I got through all the pain 
I didn't know my own strength

Huh huh huh huh hoo huh yeah 
You've been avoiding me 
Like a cat trying to dodge a dog 
I never see ya shine 
You're as cold as the London fog 
You claim you want my love 
Well I wouldn't know by the way you behave 
If you want to feel the thrill of my touch 
You better come out of your cave 
 
It's so perplexing 
Why you fight it won't you try it 
Love's electric 
Turn me on and see 
 
Love is a contact sport 
You gotta move in time 
If you want to do it right 
Here I am 
Love is a contact sport 
You gotta act untamed 
If you want to play the game 
So grab my hand, SLAM! 
 
I hate to sound aggressive 
But I'm tired of waiting for your move 
Cut the formalities 
Cause you've got a few things to prove 
If you really want my love 
I need to feel it down deep from within 
Don't make me wait too long 
I'm ready now come and stroke my skin 
 
Well all this talking 
Worthless chatter just don't matter 
Time for stalkin' 
Come get next to me 
 
Love is a contact sport 
You gotta move in time 
If you want to do it right 
Here I am 
Love is a contact sport 
You gotta act untamed 
If you want to play the game 
So grab my hand, SLAM! 
 
Hey boy, 
Why dontcha come on over 
So we can make that contact 
Contact you dare 
 
It's so perplexing 
Why you fight it won't you try it 
Love's electric 
Turn me on and see 
 
Love is a contact sport 
You gotta move in time 
If you want to do it right 
Here I am 
Love is a contact sport 
You gotta act untamed 
If you want to play the game 
So grab my hand, SLAM!</field>

I keep your photo right beside my bed 
Livin' in a world of fantasies 
I can't get you out of my head 
 
I've been waiting for  the phone to ring all night 
Why you want to make me feel so good 
I got a love of my own 
Shouldn't get so hung up on you 
 
I remember the way that we touched I wish I didn't like it so much 
I get so emotional, baby 
Every time I think of you 
I get so emotional, baby 
 
Ain't it shocking what love can do 
Ain't it shocking what love can do 
 
I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby 
I gotta watch you walk out 
I like the animal way you move 
And when you talk I just watch your mouth 
 
I remember the way that we touched I wish I didn't like it so much 
I get so emotional, baby 
Every time I think of you 
I get so emotional, baby</field>

I was lost, now I'm free

I will never leave your side 
I will never hurt your pride 
When all the chips are down, baby 
Then I will always be around 
Just to be right where you are 
My love, you know I love you, boy 
 
I will never leave you out 
I will always let you in, boy (mmm, my baby) 
To places no-one's ever been, 
Deep inside, can't you see? 
That I believe in you and me 
 
Maybe I'm a fool 
To feel the way I do 
I will play the fool forever 
Just to be with you forever 
 
I believe in miracles 
And love is a miracle 
And yes, baby you're my dream come true 
I was lost, now I'm free, 
Oh, baby 'cause I believe, I do believe, in you and me 
See, I was lost, now I'm free

Single mother, two jobs, workin' her fingers to the bone 
Putting her daughters mouth before her own 
She's gotta do it, but she's still feeling 
Like there's something deep inside that she can't leave behind 
 
She won't let go of it, no matter how many times 
She hears it over with, it's all fixed in her mind 
That it's gonna get better and she won't ever 
Hang her head again, break a sweat again, never again 
 
[Chorus] 
Never, never give up, never, never give up,  
No matter how many times, somebody tells you it ain't working 
Never, never give up, never, never give up,  
Hold your head tot he sky, look them right in the eyes 
Tell you will never quit until the day you get it right 
Never, never give up, never, never give up,  
Even though some days you'll have to cry,  
Shake it off and know that everything will be alright 
As long as you never, never give up, never, never give up. 
 
College student, paying her own way,  
Working the club at night 
Look what she go through, to stay in law school 
So maybe one day, she can make her way in a man's world 
And never be called just another girl 
 
It ain't nothing like a dream you can't see 
Even when the people round you don't believe 
But in the twelfth round, when you're against the ropes,  
Here comes your last minute miracle,  
You've got to know to 
 
[Chorus] 
 
The sky is the limit, for whatever you want to do 
Don't let anyone tell you, it ain't possible 
No matter how low you feel, keep going higher, higher 
See I've been holding on, to my dreams too long 
To watch it get away from me,  
This hand is mine to win, and I promise you that 
I'll never, never give up

            <field name="lyrics">Usin' the phone booth, 
Makin' a few calls, 
Doodlin' weird things, 
Usin' the booth walls. 
 
Got me a big date, 
Waitin' for my chick, 
Puttin' my face on, 
So she could look slick, 
 
I enjoy procrastinating 
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin away 
 
Sittin' and dinin' (dining) 
Dinner beginnin', 
Started designin' 
Usin' the linen, 
 
Talkin' to my date, 
Doodlin' my bit, 
Waiter got salty, 
Told me to please quit 
Told the waiter, "Don't be dizzy, 
"Can't you see I'm very busy, 
"Doodlin' away, doodlin' away." 
 
"Do you doodle all day?" 
Asked the waiter in his way, 
"Do you doodle all night?" 
Told the waiter he was right, 
"In your doodlin' way-" 
"That's the way I'm gonna stay," 
"Are you thinkin' things right?" 
"Doodlin' sheds a lot of light," 
"Don't know what I can do," 
"Ain't nothing you can do," 
"With old doodlin' you," 
"Doodin's all I want to do," 
 
That's for true! 
 
Why does every single thing I see 
Look exactly like a doodle to me? 
If I ever have a doubt 
What life is all about 
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin'  
And I find it real relaxing 
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing! 
 
'Cause weird designs 
They only show what's going on  
In weirder minds 
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind 
Every little thing that you write 
Just conceivably might 
Be a thought that you capture 
While coppin' a wink 
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see 
When you write what you think. 
 
I'd feel so lost without my doodlin', 
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind, 
I'd be tempest-tossed 
Without my doodlin', 
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find, 
 
Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out 
What my doodlin's all about. 
 
Later the waiter 
Had me arrested, 
Took me to Bellevue, 
Where I was tested. 
 
Had me a doctor 
Probin' my noodle, 
'Fore he was half-done, 
Taught him to doodle, 
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger  
Find an outlet through your finger, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away. 
 
Doctor was real nice, 
Told me to be cool, 
Looked at the waiter,  
Called him the real fool,  
 
Looked at my baby 
Told me he dug her, 
Got me to doodlin', 
So he could bug her, 
 
When he put his arms around her, 
Quite to his surprise he found her,  
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away 
 
We just doodle all day!</field>

Kept my lips from saying 
Things I was thinking of. 
But now my pride you've humbled, 
I've cast it to the winds, 
Broken, beaten, sick at heart 
My confession begins. 
  
We've played the game of stay away 
But it cost more that I can pay. 
Without you I can't make my way, 
I surrender, dear. 
 
I may seem proud, I may act gay, 
It's just a pose, I'm not that way, 
'Cause deep down in my heart I say 
I surrender, dear. 
 
Little mean things we were doing 
Must have been part of the game, 
Lending a spice to the wooing, 
But I don't care who's to blame. 
When stars appear and shadows fall, 
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call, 
To you my love, my life, my all 
I surrender, dear.

Ain't these tears 
In my eyes tellin'g you? 
Am I blue? You'll be too, 
 
If each plan with you man 
Done fell through. 
Was a time I was his only one, 
But now I'm the sad 
 
And lonely one, 
"Lawdy," Was I gay? 'til today, 
Now he's gone and we're through, 
Am I blue?</field>

But don't you ever bet me 
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me 
 
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me 
Come rain or come shine 
We'll be happy together, unhappy together 
Now won't that be just fine 
 
The days may be cloudy or sunny 
We're in or out of the money 
But I'm with you always 
I'm with you rain or shine</field>

Some others I've seen, might never be mean. 
Might never be cross.  
Or, try to be boss. 
But, they wouldn't do. 
For nobody else gave me a thrill. 
With all your faults I love you still. 
It had to be you.  
Wonderful you. 
It had to be you

With all yo' faults 
I love you still now. 
And it had to be you.  
It just had to be you.

Keep them a glow(?) 
Someday we'll make them so

Let me tell ya, I had a real, real fine woman, fine as she could be 
But the syndicators, back-biters stole that little girl away from me 
 
Two years of being without her, seven hundred and thirty days 
And I still remember her little brown body and the sweet love, baby way 
 
Two years of torture and I'm still in misery 
Oh, but I'm doomed as a lover unless she come back to me</field>

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies 
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise 
When your lover has gone 
 
What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring 
What lonely hours, with memories lingering 
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

Shine on as we begin, 
A dream or two that may come true, 
When the tide comes in. 
 
Hark to the song of the smiling troubadours, 
Hark to the throbbing guitars, 
Hear how the waves offer thunderous applause, 
After each song to the stars. 
 
Moon over Miami, 
You know we're waiting for, 
A little love, 
A little kiss 
 
On Miami shore.</field>

I met a woman, we started talking 
I took her home, to get a few nips 
But all I had was a mint julep 
 
I don't remember just how I started 
I only know that we should have parted 
I stole a kiss, and then another 
I didn't mean to take it further 
 
One mint julep was the cause of it all 
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor 
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father 
He said "I saw you when you kissed my daughter 
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!" 
 
I didn't know just what I was doing 
I had to marry of face ruin 
 
A mint julep, a mint julep 
A mint julep, a mint julep 
One mint julep was the cause of it all 
 
Now, I don't want to bore you with my troubles 
But from now on I?ll be thinking double 
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey 
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky

Wonder does she grieve 
Every lovely evening 
  
In a little Spanish town

Stars were peek-a-booing down 
'Twas on a night like this 
I whispered "Be true to me" 
And she sighed: "Si, Si" 
Many skies have turned to gray 
Because we're far apart 
Many moons had passed away 
And still she's in my heart 
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss 
In a little Spanish town 
'Twas on a night like this 
  
Somehow I keep on remembering 
Tears that said goodbye 
Shining in her eye 
Wonder does she keep remembering 
Promises of mine 
When the moon is shining

Just about the break of day 
Reach over and rub the pillow 
Where your baby used to lay

Hey Now! 
Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, Hey now 
Well, you know they make you feel so bad 
That you lay right down and die 
 
Then you put on your crying 
Like you've never cried before 
You even cry so loud 
You give the blues to your neighbor next door 
 
And you say, Hey Now! 
Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, Hey now 
Well, you know they make you feel so bad 
That you lay right down and die 
 
Well, I got the blues so bad now 
I'm tellin' ya it just hurt my feet to walk now 
I got the blues so bad now people 
It justa hurt my tongue to talk now 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Then you cry Lord, Lord 
Won't you hear my plea? 
I know you can have mercy on everybody 
So won't you please send a little bit down to me?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You have loved lots of girls in the sweet long-ago 
And each has meant heaven to you 
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn 
And have sworn to them all you'd be true 
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune, 
Then you've left her to hunt a new game. 
Does it ever occur to you later my boy, that she's probably doing the same? 
 
If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue, 
Just imagine the girl you love best 
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss 
From the lips that you once fondly pressed 
But the world moves apace and the loves of today 
Flit away with a smile and a tear, 
So you can never tell who's kissing her now 
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year. 
 
I wonder who's kissing her now, I wonder who's teaching her how, 
I wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies. 
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine. 
I wonder if she ever tells him of me, I wonder who's kissing her now.</field>

I heard the people say 
Son you were born to stray 
Someday you'll settle down 
I guess there'll come a time 
Maybe I'll tow the line 
Right now I'm doing fine 
Rolling from town to town 
 
I don't care where I ride 
I'll let my feet decide 
Do anything but don't ask that I 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
 
Guitars and ringing tones 
In my blood and in my bones 
Show me a bus 
And I'll call it home 
'Cause I don't wanna change 
On a lonely day 
When they put me in my grave 
Ain't a worry you need to save 
Just hang up my rock and roll shoes 
 
I don't care where I ride 
I'll let my feet decide 
Do anything but don't ask that I 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
 
So let that motor run 
Headed out towards the sun 
I'm in the mood for moving on 
But I'll be back someday 
 
I don't care where I ride 
I'll let my feet decide 
Do anything but don't ask that I 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
 
I don't care where I ride 
I'll let my feet decide 
Do anything but don't ask that I 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
Ray 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
Yeah  
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
I'm gonna  
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
Let me

Loddle doddle chuck chuck chaa 
If they ever cook your goose, turn me loose. 
And if they ever put a bullet through your brain, I'll complain. 
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship. 
When other friendships are soon forgit, ours will still be it. 
Ah loddle doddle hip hap hap. 
If you ever loose your mind, I'll be kind. 
And if you ever loose your shirt, I'll be hurt. 
If you're ever in a mill and get sawed in half, I won't laugh. 
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship. 
When other friendships are are up the crick, ours will still be slick.

This old heart, this old heart

It's the true love that waits down the line 
I know that heartbreak is one more behind me 
And true love is getting closer all the time

Come over baby (I had a dream) let me tell you about my dream last night (I had a dream)

Doing all the things (I had a dream) that I used to do (I had a dream) 
Please don't let this dream come true (I had a dream)  
Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream) 
Baby, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream) 
 
Well, well you know I came home (I had a dream) and found you gone (I had a dream) 
I never felt so (I had a dream) so all alone (I had a dream) 
Oh with your voice (I had a dream) ringing in my ear (I had a dream) 
I just could not hold (I had a dream) hold back my tear (I had a dream) 
Please don't let it come true (I had a dream) 
Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream) 
Oh, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream) 
 
Well, well, well it seems (I had a dream) that you love me no more (I had a dream) 
I never felt (I had a dream) felt this way before (I had a dream) 
You were so cold (I had a dream) I wonder why (I had a dream) 
You didn't care (I had a dream) how much I cried (I had a dream) 
Baby please don't let it come true (I had a dream)  
Won't you say that I'm not losing you (I had a dream). 
Oh, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream) 
 
Well, well, you know I begged you (I had a dream) to come back fast (I had a dream) 
You know without you baby (I had a dream) I know I couldn't last (I had a dream) 
Oh, but you would not listen (I had a dream) listen to my plea (I had a dream) 
You turned around (I had a dream) and walked away from me (I had a dream) 
Now you know you can't let it come true now (I had a dream).  
Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream).  
Won't you say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)</field>

Oh beautiful, for spacious skies, 
For amber waves of grain, 
For purple mountain majesties, 
Above the fruited plain, 
 
But now wait a minute, I'm talking about 
America, sweet America 
You know, God done shed his grace on thee, 
He crowned thy good, yes he did, in brotherhood, 
From sea to shining sea. 
 
You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this 
(America, America, God shed his grace on thee) 
America, I love you America, you see, 
My God he done shed his grace on thee, 
And you oughta love him for it, 
Cause he, he, he ,he crowned thy good,

Remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky 
So let your hair down now, and baby go on and cry

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues 
Forget about the past and find somebody new 
I thought of everything from A to Z, oh lonesome me 
 
I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free 
Flirting with the boys with all her charms 
But I still love her so and people don't you know 
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms 
 
Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues 
Forget about the past and find somebody new 
I thought of everything from A to Z, oh lonesome me 
Aha, lonesome me, oh ooh oh, lonesome me 
Yeah, lonesome me, aha

I know things will come my way 
Some day people 
I know things will come my way 
 
But as of now it seems 
To live it just don't pay 
 
My body is made of heartaches 
Blues is my middle name 
My heart is made of heartaches 
Blues is my middle name 
 
Makes no difference how hard I try 
I'm mistreated just the same 
 
Everyone?s against me 
I don't care where I go 
Yes, everyone forgets poor me 
I don't care where I go 
 
But I feel that someday, somehow 
Hard luck will leave me I know</field>

And no one else could ever come between 
But not you've left me and you love another 
And you have shattered all my dreams

Into an empty glass 
As they slither to him like snakes 
Through the grass 
 
His stance is quiet with grace 
Before they throw him into the rat race 
And he turns to me to say I'm a lonely boy 
Even with the life I asked for 
 
Lonely boy, why don't you see 
You're exactly the same as me? 
You could be the most beautiful thing 
That I ever did see with your head pointing down 
And your friend's leaving town 
 
He sung like an angel 
That had stepped deep inside 
While I payed my guitar 
And scribed and cried 
 
And the nails that we jam into our hearts 
Are essential and needed for the part 
And he turns to me to say, I'm a lot like you 
Does that mean, boy, I'll be lonely too 
 
Lonely boy, why don't you see 
You're exactly the same as me? 
You could be the most beautiful thing 
That I ever did see with your head pointing down 
And your friend's leaving town 
 
Days are passing like November rain 
Constantly falling but nothing here remains 
And he turns to me to say I'm a lot like you 
Does that mean, boy, I'll be lonely too 
 
Lonely boy, why don't you see 
You're exactly the same as me? 
You could be the most beautiful thing 
That I ever did see with your head pointing down 
And your friend's leaving town 
 
Your home getting high everyday 
Don't you think it's strange?

Oh beautiful, for spacious skies, 
For amber waves of grain, 
For purple maountain majesties, 
Above the fruited plain, 
 
But now wait a minute, I'm talking about 
America, sweet America 
You know, God done shed his grace on thee, 
He crowned thy good, yes he did, in brotherhood, 
From sea to shining sea. 
 
You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this 
(America, America, God shed his grace on thee) 
America, I love you America, you see, 
My God he done shed his grace on thee,

The way we danced till three 
The way you changed my life

And each has meant heaven to you 
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn 
And have sworn to them all you'd be true 
 
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune 
Then you've left her to hunt a new game 
Does it ever occur to you later, my boy 
That she's probably doing the same? 
 
If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue 
Just imagine the girl you love best 
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss 
From the lips that you once fondly pressed 
 
But the world moves apace and the loves of today 
Flit away with a smile and a tear 
So you can never tell who's kissing her now 
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year 
 
I wonder who's kissing her now 
I wonder who's teaching her how 
I wonder who's looking into her eyes 
Breathing sighs, telling lies 
 
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips 
That I used to call mine 
I wonder if she ever tells him of me 
I wonder who's kissing her now</field>

Last night around about ten 
She said, "Home sweet, Papa" 
Squeeze me every now and then 
 
I'll keep rolling with my baby 
I'll keep rolling with my baby 
I'll keep rolling with my baby 
'Cause she's sweet that way 
 
We went out to a movie 
Stop in the very last row 
We hadn't been there a good five minutes 
Before she's ready to go 
 
I had to roll with my baby 
I had to roll with my baby 
I had to roll with my baby 
'Cause she's sweet that way 
 
I've got a quarter, a nickel and a dime 
Can't buy me no whiskey 
I guess I'll have to settle for wine 
And then I can 
 
Roll with my baby 
I know I can roll with my baby 
I'm sure I can roll with my baby 
'Cause she's sweet that way 
 
She's such a sweet woman 
I'll never let her go 
'Cause deep down inside of me 
Lord knows I love her so

'Cause if you do you can hear 
There are voices still calling across the years 
 
And they're all crying across the ocean 
And they're crying across the land 
And they will till we all come to understand 
 
None of us are free 
None of us are free 
None of us are free, one of us are chained 
None of us are free 
 
And there are people still in darkness 
And they just can't see the light 
If you don't say it's wrong then that says it right 
 
We got try to feel for each other 
Let our brothers know that we care 
Got to get the message, send it out loud and clear 
 
None of us are free 
None of us are free 
None of us are free, one of us are chained 
None of us are free 
 
It's a simple truth we all need, just to hear and to see 
None of us are free, one of us is chained 
None of us are free, now I swear your salvation isn't too hard too find 
 
None of us can find it on our own 
We've got to join together in spirit, heart and mind 
So that every soul who's suffering will know they're not alone 
 
None of us are free 
None of us are free 
None of us are free, one of us are chained 
None of us are free 
 
If you just look around you 
You're gonna see what I say 
'Cause the world is getting smaller each passing day 
 
Now it's time to start making changes 
And it's time for us all to realize 
That the truth is shining real bright right before our eyes 
 
None of us are free 
None of us are free 
None of us are free, one of us are chained 
None of us are free 
 
None of us are free 
None of us are free 
None of us are free, one of us are chained 
None of us are free 
 
None of us are free 
None of us are free

            <field name="lyrics">Bombarded by philosophies that satisfy the surface 
I flee to something deeper at the risk of seeking purpose 
How can I hang in this environmental state of being 
When everything I'm striving for it's nothing that I'm seeing 
 
Won't you take my heart, won't you take my soul 
Won't you come and make me whole again 
You, you've got what I need and you never retreat 
Unto you I will concede 
 
So help me God 
To put my faith in you 
So help me God 
Before I come unglued 
Call it my addiction 
I can't get enough of you 
So help me God 
To put my faith in you 
 
Infected by the skin I'm in that's starving with desire 
And Jesus ain't the latest thing to come across the wire 
I throw myself in mercy for I am the chief of sinners 
But daily taking up my cross 
Has brought it's share of splinters 
 
You're there when I call 
And you're there when I fall 
Even though I don't deserve it all 
You, you light my way 
Through the night and the day 
And from you I will not stray 
 
God so help me 
This is my soul's plea 
I'm desperately devoted 
I can't get enough of you 
 
Cause you are the one I love 
Cause you are the one I need 
Cause you are the one I'm seeking 
Cause you are the one for me</field>

I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme 
I've acted out my life in stages 
With ten thousand people watching 
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you 
 
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby 
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see 
There's no one more important to me 
So darling can't you please see through me 
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you 
 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin' 
You came out in front and I was hiding 
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together 
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding 
 
I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine 
And when my life is over, remember when we were together 
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you 
 
I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
I've loved you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine 
And when my life is over, remember when we were together 
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you, yes 
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you, baby 
We were alone and I was singin' my song,

I met a woman, we started talking 
I took her home, to get a few nips 
But all I had was a mint julep 
 
I don't remember just how I started 
I only know that we should have parted 
I stole a kiss, and then another 
I didn't mean to take it further 
 
One mint julep was the cause of it all 
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor 
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father 
He said "I saw you when you kissed my daughter 
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!" 
 
I didn't know just what I was doing 
I had to marry of face ruin 
 
A mint julep, a mint julep 
A mint julep, a mint julep 
One mint julep was the cause of it all 
 
Now, I don't want to bore you with my troubles 
But from now on I?ll be thinking double 
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey 
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky 
 
A mint julep, a mint julep 
A mint julep, a mint julep 
One mint julep was the cause of it all</field>

About this blackjack game 
It's caused me nothing but trouble 
And I've only myself to blame 
 
Hey-hey, hey, yeah 
How unlucky can one man be? 
Well, every quarter I get, now 
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me 
 
My friends don't come around me 
Because I've been so blind 
I can't even borrow a nickel 
Now I've almost lost my mind 
 
Hey-hey hey, yeah 
How unlucky can one man be? 
Well, every quarter I get 
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me 
 
I sat there with two tens 
I thought I'd have some fun 
The dealer hit sixteen with a five 
Just enough to make twenty-one 
 
Hey-hey hey, yeah, yeah 
How unlucky can one man be? 
Well, every quarter I get 
Yeah, blackjack takes it away from me</field>

            <field name="lyrics">As I passed by 
A real fine hotel 
A chick walked out 
She sure looked swell 
I gave her the eye 
And started to carry on 
When a Cadillac cruised up, and swish 
She was gone 
 
It should've been me 
(With that real fine chick) 
It should've been me 
(With that real fine chick) 
It should have been me 
Driving that Cadillac 
 
A little later on 
A theater I passed 
I spotted another chick 
And did she have class 
I was all set 
To write her name in my book 
When her husband came up and gave me a 
Real dirty look 
 
It should've been me 
(With that real fine chick) 
It should've been me 
(With that real fine chick) 
It should've been me 
To have been her chaperone 
 
I walked to the corner 
Then saw a sharp cat 
With a three-hundred-dollar suit on, and a 
Hundred-dollar hat 
He was standing on the sidewalk 
By a DynaFlow 
When a voice within said 
"C'mon daddy, let's go" 
 
It should've been me 
(With that real fine chick) 
It should've been me 
(With that real fine chick) 
It should've been me 
Driving that DynaFlow 
 
I ate a bowl of chili 
And I felt okay 
At least until I passed 
This fine cafe 
I saw a guy eatin' 
A great big steak 
While a waitress stood by feedin' him 
Ice cream and cake 
 
It should've been me 
(With that real fine chick) 
It should've been me 
(With that real fine chick) 
It should've been me 
Eatin' ice, cream and cake 
 
It should've been me 
(Gettin' my natural kicks) 
It should've been me 
(Gettin' my natural kicks) 
It should have been me 
Lovin' those crazy chicks</field>

Dear Bluesette, don't despair 
Some blue boy is waiting just like you 
To find a someone to be true to 
Two loving arms you can nestle in to stay 
 
Get set, Bluesette 
True love is coming 
Your lonely heart soon will be humming 
 
Pretty little Blusette 
Musn't be a mourner 
Have you heard the news yet? 
Love's 'round the corner 
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons 
To make your next springtime 
Your gold wedding ring time</field>

Now that we have really parted I can't believe it's true 
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you 
There was something had to happen and it did somehow 
I just don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now 
 
After all is said and done I'll forget you 
Although I know it will be hard to do 
Let things happen as they will and I'll get alone somehow 
I don't worry it makes no difference now 
 
It makes no difference now</field>

It's leaving me alone and so blue 
But I'll always dream, still I'll never own you 
Making believe, it's all I can do 
 
Can't hold you close when you're not with me 
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine 
Making believe, I'll spend my lifetime 
Loving you, making believe 
 
Making believe hat I never lost you 
But my happy hours I find are so few 
My plans for the future will never come true 
Making believe, what else can I do 
 
Can't hold you close when you're not with me 
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine 
Making believe, I'll spend my lifetime 
Loving you, making believe

Women come knock on my door 
I've lived to the limit 
Maybe a little bit more 
There are so many stories 
About how I got out of control 
Some say its a woman 
Some say its my troubled soul 
 
I'm like a crazy old soldier 
Fighting a war on my own 
Just me and the wiskey 
And the bottles are ten thousand strong 
You'd think I'd give up as many times I've been hit 
But like a crazy old soldier 
I just don't know when to quit 
 
Barrooms and bedrooms 
Are just faces and places and names 
Once for the pleasure 
And Lord knows once for the pain 
I've tried to forget her 
And all the things that we've done 
But as long as there are memories 
I'll never hang up my gun

Son you were born to stray 
Someday you'll settle down

Rolling from town to town 
 
I don't care where I ride 
I'll let my feet decide 
Do anything but don't ask that I 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
Hang up my rock and roll shoes 
 
Guitars and ringing tones 
In my blood and in my bones 
Show me a bus 
And I'll call it home 
'Cause I don't wanna change 
On a lonely day 
When they put me in my grave 
Ain't a worry you need to save 
Just hang up my rock and roll shoes 
 
I don't care where I ride

Do anything but don't ask that I

When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear 
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight 
Fever in the the morning, fever all through the night. 
 
Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night 
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right 
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight 
Fever in the the morning, oh fever all through the night. 
 
Everybody's got the fever, that is something that you should know 
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago. 
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh 
Tell 'em about it 
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same 
When he put his arms around her, he said "Julie baby you're my flame" 
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth 
Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth. 
 
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair 
But when her Daddy tried to kill him, she said "Daddy,Daddy don't you dare" 
He gives me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight 
Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right. 
 
Now you've heard our story, (oh, it's your story) 
Here's the point we have made (I'm listening) 
Chicks were born to give you fever (that's right) 
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade 
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn 
 
Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn. 
Aha, what a lovely way to burn. 
I tell you, what a lovely way to burn. 
All right now, what a lovely way to burn. 
I like that, what a lovely way to burn.</field>

When I was twenty-one 
It was a very good year 
It was a very good year for city girls 
Who lived up the stair 
With all that perfumed hair 
And it came undone 
When I was twenty-one 
 
When I was thirty-five 
It was a very good year 
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls 
Of independent means 
We'd ride in limousines 
And their chauffeurs would drive 
When I was thirty-five 
 
But now the days grow short 
I'm in the autumn of my years 
And I think of my life as vintage wine 
From fine old kegs 
From the brim to the dregs 
And it poured sweet and clear

I'm walking on cloud nine today. 
I'm over that line today,  
Happiness is finally mine today. 
I guess I'm just a lucky guy  
And I'm prepared to tell you why. 
It's strictly on account  
Of my sweet potato pie. 
 
I'm the fellow that she loves the most,  
The main reason why she left the coast. 
She's my little girlzina,  
That much hotter that a jalapeno. 
Tender like a night in June,  
Sweeter than a honeymoon, 
Brighter than a silver spoon,  
Just as crazy as a loon. 
 
Softer than a lullaby,  
Deeper than the midnight sky,  
Soulful as a baby's cry,  
My sweet potato pie. 
 
I used to see her around the neighborhood,  
I wonder how she grew up so good. 
She belonged to Freddy and he was bad  
And I never was ready to make him mad. 
I'm glad I had to wait awhile,  
A little bit too juvenile. 
I needed to refine my style, a silk suit  
And a crocodile smile. 
 
So let the whole damn world go by  
'Cause I just want to testify 
From now on it's me  
And my sweet potato pie.</field>

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
 
She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down 
And when I come to her when the sun goes down 
Take away my trouble, take away my grief 
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Yes I need her in the daytime 
Yes I need her in the night 
Yes I want to throw my arms around her 
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight 
 
And when I'm returning from so far away 
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day 
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole 
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul</field>

Still in peaceful dreams I see

Ooh Georgia, no peace I find

It's caused me nothing but trouble 
And I've only myself to blame 
 
Hey hey hey yeah 
How unlucky can one man be 
Well every quarter I get 
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me 
 
My friends don't come around me 
Because I've been so blind 
I can't even borrow a nickle 
Now I've almost lost my mind 
 
Hey hey hey yeah 
How unlucky can one man be 
Well every quarter I get 
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me 
 
I sat there with two tens 
I thought I'd have some fun 
The dealer hit sixteen with a five 
Just enough to make twenty one

Like a mountain jack 
I'd climb the highest mountain 
To call my baby back 
Oh, how long? Yes, how long, how long?

But I see no train 
My heart is aching and breaking and I want it bad

A real fine hotel 
A chick walked out 
She sure looked swell 
I gave her the eye 
And started to carry on 
When a Cadillac cruised up 
And 'swish' she was gone 
 
It should've been me 
With that real fine chick 
It should've been me 
With that real fine chick 
Hey hey hey, hey, driving that, Cadillac 
 
A little later on 
A theater I passed 
I spotted another chick 
And did she have class 
I was all set 
To write her name in my book 
When her husband came up and gave me a 
Real dirty look 
 
It should've been me 
With that real fine chick 
It should've been me 
With that real fine chick 
It should've been me 
To have been her chaperone 
 
When I got to the corner 
I saw a sharp cat 
With a 300 dollar suit on 
And a 100 dollar hat 
He was standing on the sidewalk 
By a DynaFlow 
When a voice within said, 
"C'mon daddy, let's go." 
 
It should've been me 
With that real fine chick 
It should've been me 
With that real fine chick 
It should've been me 
Hey hey hey, hey, driving that, DynaFlow 
 
I ate a bowl of chili 
And I felt OK 
At least until I passed 
This fine Cafe 
I saw a guy eatin' 
A great big steak 
While a waitress stood by feedin' him 
Ice cream and cake 
 
It should've been me 
With that real fine chick 
It should've been me 
With that real fine chick 
You know, it should've been me 
Eatin' ice, cream and cake 
 
It should've been me 
Gettin' my natural kicks 
It should've been me 
Gettin' my natural kicks 
Hey hey hey, hey, lovin' those, crazy chicks</field>

Like a daisy, I'm awake 
With no bromo-seltzer handy 
I don't even shake 
 
Men are not a new sensation 
I've done pretty well I think 
But this half-pint imitation 
Put me on the blink 
 
I'm wild again, beguiled again 
A simpering, whimpering child again 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I 
 
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep 
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I 
 
Lost my heart, but what of it 
He is cold I agree 
He can laugh, but I love it 
Although the laugh's on me 
 
I'll sing to him, each spring to him 
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I 
 
He's a fool and don't I know it 
But a fool can have his charms 
I'm in love and don't I show it 
Like a babe in arms 
 
Love's the same old sad sensation 
Lately I've not slept a wink 
Since this half-pint imitation 
Put me on the blink 
 
I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot 
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I 
 
I'll sing to him, each spring to him 
And worship the trousers that cling to him 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I 
 
When he talks, he is seeking 
Words to get, off his chest 
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best 
 
Vexed again, perplexed again 
Thank god, I can be oversexed again 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I 
 
Wise at last, my eyes at last, 
Are cutting you down to your size at last 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more 
 
Burned a lot, but learned a lot 
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more 
 
Couldn't eat, was dispeptic 
Life was so hard to bear 
Now my heart's antiseptic 
Since you moved out of there 
 
Romance, finis. your chance, finis. 
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis. 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more</field>

You know it's always dark and dreary

I live on a lonely avenue

Well, I feel so sad and blue 
And it's all because of you 
 
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry (ooh)

Because I live on a lonely avenue

Now you know my covers they feel like lead 
And my pillow it feels like stone 
Well, I've tossed and turned so every night 
I'm not used to being alone

Since you've left this town 
You know if I could beg or borrow the money

And each has meant heaven to you 
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn 
And have sworn to them all you'd be true 
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune, 
Then you've left her to hunt a new game. 
Does it ever occur to you later my boy, that she's prob'ly doing the same? 
If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue, 
Just imagine the girl you love best 
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss 
From the lips that you once fondly pressed 
But the world moves apace and the loves of today 
Flit away with a smile and a tear, 
So you can never tell who's kissing her now 
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year. 
I wonder who's kissing her now, I wonder who's teaching her how, 
I wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies. 
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine. 
I wonder if she ever tells him of me, I wonder who's kissing her now.</field>

I got a dollar and a quarter and I'm just ringing the clock 
But don't let no female, play me cheap 
I got fifty cents more than I'm gonna keep

I tell y'all I'm gonna let the good times roll now

No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me 
What did I do wrong? What was I supposed to be? 
When it's said and done, will you remember me?</field>

They'll put me down in a hole before I let you succeed 
I've never been complacent, I can't afford to be

Can you read between the lines? 
Or are you stuck in black and white? 
Hope I'm on the list of people that you hate 
It's time you met the monster that you have helped create 
Boo! 
 
You've pushed me one too many times 
I'm sick of all of the fiction, we're gonna settle it 
You've pushed me one too many times 
I'm sick of all of the shit, I'm gonna settle it! 
 
It's not that complicated and you ain't gotta believe 
They'll put me down in a hole before I let you succeed 
I've never been complacent, I can't afford to be 
I know you think you're special but you ain't nothin' 
 
Well there's nothing you can say to me now 
And there's nothing you can do to stop me 
It's hard not to be a menace to society 
When half the population is happy on their knees 
 
You've pushed me one too many times 
I'm sick of all of the fiction, we're gonna settle it 
You've pushed me one too many times 
I'm sick of all of the shit, I'm here settle it! 
 
'Cause I can't take it anymore 
I refuse to live this way 
It's not that I don't care enough, it's not that I can't see 
It's everything inside of me that won't let me be you 
It won't let me be you! 
 
It's not that complicated and you ain't gotta believe 
They'll put me down in a hole before I let you succeed 
I've never been complacent, I can't afford to be 
I know you think you're special but you ain't nothin' 
No, you ain't nothin' 
And you'll never succeed 
I know you think you're special,  
But you ain't nothin' 
 
But you ain't nothin'!</field>

It's times like these that make it so difficult to be 
The light at the end, the crack in the sky 
There's no promise for release 
No way for me to get away 
And all I'm trying to do is breath 
 
Searching, for something more 
Searching, for something right 
Searching, for a sense of clarity 
Searching, for a place to die! 
 
Days like this I really wish, I really wish I wasn't me 
It's times like this that make it hard, makes it hard to fuckin' see 
No light at the end, no crack in the sky 
Everyone ends up deceased 
A life like mine makes a man, turns a grown man to a flea 
 
Searching, for something more 
Searching, for something right 
Searching, for a sense of clarity 
Searching, for a place to die! 
 
Piece by piece, I slowly fade away, 
I slowly drift apart 
I see a different world, closing in on the future 
Sorry to be so cynical but it's all I know 
Piece by piece, I slowly start to change 
I slowly start to change!

You have no right to live 
To know you is to hate you

I can't believe in something that doesn't believe in me 
I'm not blood of your blood, I'm no son of your god

Still I find salvation 
 
You think you have the answers to every last detail 
In your eyes, you're the victor 
In mine you've all but failed

No mercy, it's the way of the fist 
 
Strapped with rage, got no patience for victims 
Sick and tired of the whole fuckin' world 
 
I don't remember asking you about your imperfections 
You might win one battle 
But know this, I'll win the fucking war! 
 
End of the goddamn road! (Right!) 
 
Step to me, step to me motherfucker 
Zip your lip, you've run out of time 
Step to me, step to me motherfucker 
Talk the talk, now walk the damn line 
 
Deserve it, you earned it, got yourself a fuckin' war 
Believe it, you need it, face down on the fuckin' floor 
I hate it, can't take it 
Wanna break your fuckin' bones 
No mercy, you fagot 
Should've left it all alone 
 
Strapped with rage, got no patience for victims 
Sick and tired of the whole fuckin' world 
 
I don't remember asking you about your imperfections

One, two fuck you! (Right!)

Zip your lip, you've run out of time

Verbal grenades 
You throw in vain 
I can't believe you'd stoop so low 
Of all the things you took away 
I miss my mind the most

Ain't a single fucker left to fear 
See their lips moving' but I don't wanna hear 
Show down (I ain't backing down from anybody) 
Throw down (If I don't get some space) 
Lay down (not in this life or another) 
It's a nightmare (and it's not going away)

Something more than me (more than me) 
Death can take me if I can't be free 
I am not like you, I'm a dying breed 
 
Round 2! 
Something you just don't wanna do 
Go dancin' with the devil, unless your wearing my shoes 
You got nerve, and I'll give ya that 
Watch the world crumble while you sit on your ass! 
Wake up (get your head together motherfucker) 
Straight up (before it's too late) 
Stand up (nothing ever lasts forever) 
Corrupt (and that's how it's gonna stay)

Can't explain, why it's so hard for me, 
So hard to see your side. 
 
I won't see your side.

Inside I'm a prisoner of my own hell 
My own hell 
 
Losing the battle I've waged on myself 
Lock me up and toss the key 
Toys in the attic its all getting worse 
Why wont they let me be oh god make it stop 
 
Inside I'm a danger to myself 
I'm a danger to myself 
Inside I'm a prisoner of my own hell 
My own hell 
 
Fit me for a straitjacket 
Put me in a padded cell 
I'm a danger to you all 
And I'm a danger to myself 
 
Inside I'm a danger to myself 
I'm a danger to myself 
Inside I'm a prisoner of my own hell

No one gets left behind, I know you made it up 
No one gets left behind, it's more for money 
No one gets left behind, drink from the golden cup 
No one gets left behind, your turn is coming 
 
Play your war games with other people's lives 
It should be you on the front line 
 
Have you no honor, have you no soul

This ain't a test, fuck the rest 
Time to set the record straight 
Talk your shit, behind my back 
Let's hear you say it to my face 
I've heard the words fall out your lips 
You little trendy fucking bitch 
The time has come to get you some 
Cause I just do not give a shit 
 
Do you take me for a fool? 
How's it feel to be a tool? 
See to me your just a cancer 
Motherfucker war is the answer 
 
As of now the end begins 
I want to laugh but there's no joke 
To eat with beasts 
And run with the wolves 
On the ashes you must choke 
I know it's got to chap your ass 
To think I just won't go away 
Effects me not, I'm writing you off 
I've got nothing more to say 
 
Do you take me for a fool? 
How's it feel to be a tool? 
See to me your just a cancer 
Motherfucker war is the answer 
 
Get some 
 
You want to disrespect me 
you little fucking punk? 
Everything I've done 
To be who I am 
As far as I've fucking come 
I'll slap you so fucking hard 
It'll feel like you kissed a freight train 
Fuck you 
 
Do you take me for a fool? 
How's it feel to be a tool? 
Talk your shit behind my back 
See to me your just a cancer

Hate your nails, hate your hair, hate the fact I even care 
Hate the way you said you loved me but you fucking weren't there 
Hate your friends, hate your folks, hate your stupid fucking hopes 
Hate the way I tried to change when the whole thing was a joke 
 
I hate you

Hate your face, hate your lies and the blank look in your eyes 
Hate your needs, hate your wants, hate the way you look and talk 
Hate your voice, makes me cringe every time I hear you speak 
It's uncomfortable to know you share the same air as me 
Hate your lack of common sense and I'm tired of compromising 
Take a good look in the end, 'cause it's just on the horizon

Rise! 
I've got no time for the weak 
 
It's time to rise up, man up, get back up, 
Never bend and won't be broken 
Dust off and then come back for more 
You've gotta reach down, dig deep, and break ground, 
Show them all you won't be beaten 
Brush it off and then come back for more! 
Come back for more 
 
It's do or die! 
Time to settle the score, 
Gotta give it all you got and then you give it some more 
There will be blood 
You've gotta fight 'til you break, 
Talk a lot of trash and step up to the plate 
 
Rise! 
Refuse to give in 
Rise! 
Ashes to dust 
Rise! 
Make 'em remember your name 
Rise! 
'cause in yourself you can trust

Was there ever any question 
On how much I could take? 
You kept feeding me your bullshit 
Hoping I would break 
Is there anybody out there? 
Is there anyone who cares? 
Is there anybody listening? 
Will they hear my final prayers?

I'll burn it all to the ground before I let you run 
Please forgive me, I can't forgive you now 
I remember everything 
 
If I could hold back the rain, would you numb the pain 
'Cause I remember everything 
If I could help you forget, would you take my regrets 
'Cause I remember everything 
 
It all went by so fast 
I still can't change the past 
I always will remember everything 
If we could start again 
Would that change the end 
We remember everything 
Everything</field>

Did you hear the one about me being a punk? 
Did you hear the one about me, being a drunk? 
So did you hear the one about me losing my nerve? 
Or how I'm just another fucking sheep in the herd? 
Did you hear about the money, how it made me change? 
So funny to me, all the time that they waste! 
Did you hear the one about me, giving a shit? 
Cause if I ever did, I don't remember it! 
 
You can be me, and I will be you. 
You can live just like a star. 
I'll take my sin, 
And you take the fame! 
I'm under and over it all 
I'm under and over it! 
 
Did you hear the one about me playing the game? 
Selling my soul and changing my name. 
Did you hear the one about me being a prick? 
Did you know I don't care? You can suck my 
D-Did you hear the one about me trying to die? 
Fist in the air and a finger to the sky. 
Do I care if you hate me? Do you wanna know the truth? 
C'est la vie, adios, good riddance, fuck you! 
 
You can be me and I will be you. 
You can live just like a star. 
I'll take my sanity, you take the fame. 
I'm under and over it all. 
(I'm under and over it.) 
I'm, I'm, I'm under and over it. 
I'm, I'm, I'm under and over it.

I should've never let you get that deep inside 
You're an actress 
I can't believe a word 
You'd say anything to get anywhere in life 
 
Stumble back to where you came from 
Wide awake and falling on your faith 
You've got an evil wicked way 
Of saying I love you, I'd love to 
Tear away from everything you are 
You've got an evil wicked way about you, I hate you! 
 
Like a virus 
That spread throughout my veins 
You're incurable and such a waste of time 
You're an angel 
But only in your head, 
You'd hurt anyone 
To get anything in life 
Slither back to where you came from 
 
Wide awake and falling on your faith 
You've got an evil wicked way 
Of saying I love you, I'd love to 
Tear away from everything you are

Running from a man I swore I'd never be. 
No one ever has to face tomorrow. 
But I'm the one that has to face me. 
 
It's the demons I've created for myself. 
The tragic truth. 
It's hard for me to understand myself. 
So it has to be hard as hell for you! (For you! You!) 
 
Are we born to be broken, sinners, and thieves? 
Someone tell the heavens I'm ready to escape! (You!) 
This is not what I wanted not what I need! 
Take it all, tear it all, rip it all away! 
 
I can't say the Devil made me do it. 
I chose to be the one I am, the way I am today. 
I wish there was but there's no way around it. 
In the end I made the choice and will not die ashamed. 
 
It's the voices screaming in my head. 
The tragic truth. 
It's hard for me to understand myself. 
So it has to be hard as hell for you! (You! You!) 
 
Are we born to be broken, sinners, and thieves? 
Someone tell the heavens I'm ready to escape! (You!)

Someone tell the heavens I'm ready to escape! (You!) 
This is not what I wanted not what I need! 
Take it all, tear it all, rip it all away! (Away!)

Long before the world I know tore it all apart 
Once upon a time there was a part of me I shared 
Years before they took away the part of me that cared 
 
I've been a thousand places 
And shook a million hands 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I know just where I've been 
 
I've flown a million miles 
And I've rode so many more 
Every day, a castaway 
A vagabond, battle born 
I'm battle born 
 
Once upon a time I had an open point of view 
That was just so long ago before I had a clue 
Was there such a time where I didn't stand alone? 
Was there ever a time, and how would I have known? 
 
I've been a thousand places 
And shook a million hands 
I don't know where I'm going

So many things unanswered

What could I do? 
Was there ever a moment you cared? 
 
Or was I always ugly and abandoned 
Remember all the times you wished me harm 
You wished me dead 
How could I have changed to make it better? 
And would I? 
Would I? 
Why? 
 
I still feel so much hate inside of me 
Seems like you were just waiting for me to fail 
I'm sorry I can't forgive you 
Do you blame me? 
You never forgave me 
 
I've tried to grow from this 
Every day's a new challenge 
Because with you, there is just no winning 
Like it or not, I'm still a part of you 
And you're still a part of me 
 
Like it or not 
You're still a part of me 
Yeah! 
 
So this is how it ends 
All the tears, all the blood 
It's all been for nothing 
As the candle dwindles, then flickers out

My life is prefect, so you believe 
Are you that stupid? Cuz I strongly disagree 
 
I'm not a liar, more like a thief 
Your rules are twisted and they don't affect me 
You saw me coming, so why you running? 
What's the matter, it's just little old me 
I know your kind, you're fucking blind 
I give a shit, don't give a shit about anything

There's not a man, not a man I believe 
Give a rats ass what you think about me 
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth

You're just a trip, it's got to end 
I stand in place while you mother fuckers bend 
You own a clock, your time is up 
You bottom feeders, it's just time to give up 
Ready to throw down, this is a show down 
You get the memo, 'cause it's all about to go down 
I know I'm twisted, I can't resist it 
I give a shit, don't give a shit about anything 
There ain't nothing in this world for free 
There's not a man, not a man I believe 
Give a rat???s ass what you think about me 
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth

There's nothing in this world for me 
I gave away, gave away fucking everything 
This is the man that I'm choosing to be 
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth 
Pressure's building breaking down 
Suffocating till I drown! 
You know how the saying goes? 
It's not the size of the dog in the fight 
It's the size of the fight in the dog 
YEAH, Bring it! 
 
There ain't nothing in this world for free 
There's not a man, not a man I believe

Everybody bleeds 
Everybody bends to fill a need 
Everybody's born with their own curse 
And I'm not alone 
 
Everybody cries 
Everybody breathes 
Everybody wants to feel they're free 
Deep inside I know what I am worth 
A life of my own 
 
It could have been much worse 
But it should have been better 
 
I know I'd hurt you, deserted you 
And now I see it clear 
I pulled you closer, tighter 
'Cause I knew you'd disappear 
 
I just can't compromise, apologize 
There's nothing you can say 
We both knew 
It would always end this way 
 
Everybody pains 
Everybody grieves 
Everybody's making off like thieves 
Every soul's aching for release 
You're not alone 
 
Everybody lives 
Everybody leaves 
Everybody begs best on their knees 
Everybody's got the same disease 
No one's alone 
 
It could have been much worse 
But it should have been better 
 
I know I'd hurt you, deserted you 
And now I see it clear 
I pulled you closer, tighter 
'Cause I knew you'd disappear 
 
I just can't compromise, apologize 
There's nothing you can say 
We both knew 
It would always end this way

            <field name="lyrics">I'm gazing upward, a world I can't embrace 
There's only thorns and splinters, venom in my veins 
It's okay to cry out, when it's driving you insane 
But somehow someday, I'll have to face the pain 
 
It's all gone cold 
But no one wants the blame 
It's all so wrong 
But who am I, who am I to say? 
 
I'm begging for forgiveness, everything I've done 
If God is listening, He knows I'm not the only one 
It's okay to lash out from the rules that I'm enslaved 
But somehow someday, I'll have to turn the page 
 
It's all gone cold 
And no one wants to change 
It's all so wrong 
But no one wants the blame 
 
It's all gone cold 
There's nothing left to gain 
It's all so wrong 
But who am I, who am I to say? 
 
My heart's an endless winter filled with rage 
I'm looking forward to forgetting yesterday 
 
It's all gone cold 
And no one wants to change 
It's all so wrong 
But no one wants the blame 
 
It's all gone cold 
There's nothing left to gain 
It's all so wrong 
But who am I, who am I to say? 
To say 
 
It's all gone cold 
But who am I to say? 
It's all gone cold

Love me or hate me (I walk alone)

I walk alone, I always have, I'm not ashamed (not ashamed) 
A living nightmare from the cradle to the grave 
 
The soul that lives within my chest (the soul that lives within my chest) 
Just won't allow me to turn out like the rest(turn out like the rest) 
This heart that's driving me on and on and on (on and on and on) 
Has the same vision and it keeps me fucking strong

I live and die by the knife 
I swear there's nothing inside 
Sometimes I wish it would end 
How many hands could I shake 
How many smiles must I fake 
How many miles till I break 
To start all over again 
That's not what I was promised 
That's not me 
 
Feels like I'm falling away 
Getting deeper and deeper everyday 
And like nothing has changed or ever will 
It seems like I'm going insane 
Getting farther and farther everyday 
I just swallow the pain 
And always will 
Welcome to a day in my life 
Welcome to a day in my fucking life! 
 
Unleashed the beast from its cage 
Feel like a puppet on stage 
It only adds to the rage 
I'm sick of trying to pretend 
They think I'm something I'm not 
I give them all that I got 
Feels like I'm soul to be bought 
It starts all over again 
That's not what I was promised 
That's not me 
 
Feels like I'm falling away 
Getting deeper and deeper everyday 
And like nothing has changed or ever will

Welcome to a day in my life

I looked away just one too many times 
I'm tired of pretending, that I'm not here, not here to die. 
 
You want my best, you get the worst 
You're not the last and you ain't the fucking first 
You gotta live, I live to die. 
Still that motherfucker finger to the sky.

I've been hated by better 
I've been beaten by the best 
It's not a gift,

My father was a gamblin' man 
Down in Sin City 
 
Now the only thing a gambler needs 
Is a suitcase and a trunk 
And the only time he's satisfied 
Is when he's on a drunk 
 
Well, I've got one foot on the platform 
The other's on the train 
I'm goin' back to Sin City 
To wear that ball and chain 
 
Well, mother, tell your children 
Never do what I have done 
Spend your lives in sin and misery 
In the house of the rising sun

I got your six 
 
In the pit 
Blood on the bricks 
Don't look back 'cause I got your six 
Won't go down, never gonna quit 
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six 
 
In the pit 
Blood on the bricks 
Don't look back 'cause I got your six 
Won't go down, never gonna quit 
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six</field>

A past I can't erase 
I'm breaking, breaking apart 
(I know they're after me) 
It's like I'm fading each day 
They took it all away 
Left nothing, nothing but scars 
(They make it hard to breathe) 
 
Don't know where it went wrong 
But my love for this is gone 
 
I tried to numb the pain 
But I can't get away 
Hiding behind this disguise 
The games I had to play 
The hell I had to pay 
Everything comes with a price 
 
You're waiting for me to fail 
That ship will never sail 
Keep pulling and pushing me down 
(But I just won't let go) 
I know you wish I was dead 
I'm stuck inside your head 
I'm taking and breaking your crown 
(I'm better left alone) 
 
Don't know where it went wrong 
But my love for this is gone 
 
I tried to numb the pain 
But I can't get away 
Hiding behind this disguise 
The games I had to play 
The hell I had to pay 
Everything comes with a price 
 
I tried to numb the pain 
But I can't get away 
Hiding behind this disguise 
The games I had to play 
The hell I had to pay

See it from my side 
 
Letting go of everything 
Looks better down on paper 
Letting go of anything 
Not until I meet my maker 
 
Never really saw it my way 
Never really knew what's right 
Always gotta hide from the pain 
(Saw it from the inside) 
Never had to save it from face 
Never had to run and hide 
Tell me I've fallen from grace 
See you on the dark side

Feeds my hysteria 
Sick of living down on my knees

On morality 
Feeds my brutality

All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life

There's just so much goddamned weight on my shoulders

Oh, yo, yo, there's a demon inside 
Oh, yo, yo, just like Jekyll and Hyde 
Oh, yo, yo, all this anger inside 
Oh, yo, yo, I feel like Jekyll and Hyde 
 
There's just so much goddamned weight on your shoulders 
That you can't just live your motherfucking life 
The story's getting old and my heart is getting colder 
I just wanna be Jekyll, but I'm always fighting Hyde 
You've got rocks in your head, I can hear them rolling 'round 
You can say that you're above it, but you're always falling down 
Is there a method to your madness, is it all about pride? 
Everyone I know, they've got a demon inside 
 
Oh, yo, yo, there's a demon inside 
Oh, yo, yo, just like Jekyll and Hyde 
Oh, yo, yo, all this anger inside 
Oh, yo, yo, I feel like Jekyll and Hyde 
 
If I wasn't so deranged, could I ever face the pain? 
If I ever want to change, would this all remain the same? 
Oh, yo, yo 
All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life 
Oh, yo, yo 
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside 
Oh, yo, yo 
All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life 
Oh, yo, yo 
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

Hustlin' girls, handy phone, acting like your 
Busy baby let me tell you, you're the worst I ever had

Highbrow attitude, really don't impress me 
I know where you're coming from 
See right through your game 
Luxury overdose won't make you possess me 
Baby let me tell you, in the end it's all the same 
Don't think I'm crying and trying to get  
You out of my heart 
No need denying that you have been lying  
Right from the start 
I thought this love would take us to the  
Heights of sensuality 
But now I know that you're not even half  
The man you said you'd be 
 
Don't think I'm crying and trying to get

Shake your ass dance with me 
 
Saw you in the disco  
Last night in San Francisco 
The way you used your joystick 
It really makes my mouse click 
 
Come sit down on my laptop 
Lets do a little hip hop 
Let's go into a chat room 
And do a little boom boom 
 
I saw you in the disco  
Last week in San Francisco 
The way you used your joystick 
Has really made me feel sick 
 
The doctor checked my hard drive 
A virus in my archive 
My disc was not protected 
And now I am infected</field>

I wish I'd never have to see that look in your eyes

So here I am  
All alone  
Don't understand where did we go wrong  
I can't stop crying  
Can't take the pain  
Knowing you won't ever be back again  
 
And it cuts like a knife  
I'm going insane  
Wishing you would show me love  
Once again  
I'm losing my mind  
But I have to carry on  
We were meant to be together  
Forever as one  
 
So this is where the story ends  
Gonna take some to dry the tears in my eyes  
You told me we could still be friends  
Now I know your promises were nothing but lies  
 
So here I am  
All alone  
Don't understand where did we go wrong  
I can't stop crying  
Can't take the pain

Been working all week now baby 
Yes, it's my day  
 
I take a trip downtown 
To my favorite club now, baby 
That's when I see you  
 
With loving arms to fall into 
But I'm not lookin' for full-time love  
 
There's still so much I want to do 
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine  
 
Oh whoa, oh whoa 
You want to kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine 
Oh whoa, oh whoa  
 
Can live without it 
I don't want a full-time love  
 
'cause it's not on my mind now, baby 
You know my freedomIs what I'm thinking of  
 
And I ain't got the time now, baby 
Straight out of the blue  
 
You came and asked me to 
Be your date in the daytime babe  
 
But I am sorry, no can do 
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine  
 
Oh whoa, oh whoa 
You want to kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine 
Oh whoa, oh whoa  
 
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine 
Oh whoa, oh whoa  
 
You want to kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine

Another day of stress and sorrow

And I will do my hair tomorrow  
 
I can't take it no more  
Oh no no no  
Is this what I'm living for?  
 
But my Uncle John from Jamaica  
Keeps on calling every day  
Just buy a ticket and take a  
Summer Holi-Holiday  
 
6 o'clock my job is still not done  
The life I'm living ain't no fun  
Too many days of stress and sorrow  
My boss just won't give me a break  
And this is more than I can take  
 
Think I will quit this job tomorrow

You know, you really piss me off sometimes 
I spent all night waiting for you to come home 
And I've woken up without you 
I don't know where you are or why you are not answering your phone 
But I'm starting to get worried 
I really hope you're not pissing away the last of our money at the stupid casino again 
Because you know my next check won't be here till  
The third and we literally have nothing right now 
If you did go to the casino and you have more money then 
I guess 
 
Get the fuck off of my dick, hoe 
'Fuck you mean? 
I don't think you notice what you done to me (yeah) 
Yeah I think you should know that you were under me 
If anybody got a problem tell 'em they can come to me 
What the fuck you mean? This is not allowed 
Better calm it down 
'Cause all you new niggas just watered down 
I can see through you like a muthafuckin' ultrasound ooh 
Okay be ready to hold up then 
I'm ready to roll up on them, ready to mow them, make your motor spin 
I'll blow the boat up then be gone and wonderin' what you noticing 
A couple of hoes that I've been boning since a nigga was only ten 
I'm tryina' to get all up in that pussy harder than my youngin' (wo) 
You fallin' and you love it (yeah) 
Can't stand the heat but you all up in the oven (sha) 
I remember when I used to ball on a budget 
 
(Hol' up) Now wait a minute 
You finally got some paper couldn't wait to get it (ya) 
And it don't really matter 'cause you're still lame 
No matter how much cake you got, it wouldn't make a difference (don't matter) 
I'm tired of all you rappers wantin' free verses 
The fuck up outta here this how I make a livin' 
(That's how I make a livin') 
I dive up in that pussy like Jamaican niggas 
I spend all of my dollars on some Laker tickets (yup) 
I think if I die young they gon' miss me too 
I think I'ma buy guns maybe empty two (bla bla bla) 
I think I'ma sell drugs to the kids at school 
I think I'ma get buzzed if it gets me through 
I think I'ma need to hide if they know where I live (yeah) 
I think I'ma drink and drive til' I total the whip (whoa) 
I think I'ma get high give her all of the dick 
Even if she ain't mine so she knows what it is, wait 
(She know what it is) 
 
Hold up though 
I'm ready to roll up on them, ready to mow them, make your motor boat 
I blow the boat up, then be gone, I'm wonderin' what you notice though 
A couple of hoes that I've been boning since a nigga was on it though 
My nigga what's your worst fear? I been running from the start 
Scared to be a man, tryna hustle in the dark 
Running down the stairs, gotta hustle every March 
Eating supper, getting filled, watch it rumble in the Bronx 
I slip inside into the puddle of your heart 
Nigga I don't trust you plus you never play the part 
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, nigga 
I said 
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, hold up 
I been living in the 
Yeah 
Look 
Get the fuck off of my dick 
Wait a minute (wait a minute) 
I'm a fuck your bitch to let my neighbor hit it (neighbor hit it) 
She told me "maybe we could go on a date" 
I told her "no way, but we could say we did it" 
I'm such a lost soul, even my mom knows 
That's why she hate a nigga (hate a nigga) 
I'm such an asshole, even Superman, couldn't save a nigga 
(Joyner) 
Get the fuck off 
Of my cock

But I feel you beside me.  
 
I know the secrets,  
You keep locked away inside,  
Don't understand, why you are fighting.  
 
I know, she must be special,  
This new girl by your side,  
I seek for answers, when I look into your eyes,  
 
[Chorus] 
 
And he turns, so I can't, but I will be strong. 
For once in your life, be a man,  
Just tell me the words, 'cause I know  
That you can,  
Don't leave me with scars,  
That no one can heal.  
For once in your life, be a man.  
 
You made me love you,  
Love you right from the start.  
You're controlling my heart, babe.  
 
Don't pack your bags yet.  
Give me time to say goodbye.  
(Say goodbye)  
Just don't leave me wounded.  
 
No, I just hope you will regret the things you do  
Come back to me,  
'Cause our love is the real thing.  
 
[Chorus] 
 
I knew that I,  
 
I fought to keep our love strong.  
If you leave me now,  
You come running back for more, babe.  
And I hope for, and I wish for,  
 
And I pray, that the words from your mouth can,  
Eventually make you a man.  
For once in your life,  
Be a man.  
 
When everything stops. 
For a minute in your life,  
I'll hope that,  
For once in your life, be a man  
 
Be a man.  
Just tell me the words, 'cause I know that you can,  
Don't leave me with scars,  
That no one can heal.  
 
For once in your life, be a man.  
Be a man.  
Tell me the words.  
Once in your life.  
 
Be a man.  
Tell me the words.</field>

On a clear blue sky,  
You will act like a lover.  
 
When the sky is gray,  
And the rain comes down,  
You will run for cover.  
 
Feel the heat, come out of cold,  
And your arm is touching me.

Good morning sunshine,  
You are my only light,  
Lying with me by my side,  
You keep me warm all day.  
Just stay with me.  
Good morning sunshine,  
Be with me all day,  
Just don't let the rain pass you by,  
When it's cloudy or windy, 
And the snowflakes arrive,  
You somehow just make me,  
Make me feel I'm alive.  
 
When you leave my field  
Then you light the stars  
Fading away in horizon  
 
There's a million streets  
Leading off the night,  
Waiting for sun to be risen  
 
Feel the heat, come out of cold,  
And your arm is touching me.  
 
[Chorus] 
 
Hold it right there,  
Let me take a minute of your time,  
To explain how I feel through these rhymes.  
I do the best I can, and believe me if I could  
I'll build you a paradise with these two hands.  
The top of your skin, makes my body go numb,  
I'm thinking to myself, if my dream come true,  
Or is it 'cause you never give me a chance to tell you  
How I feel, the moments we had were too precious to kill.  
 
When it is cloudy or windy,  
Please turn your face at me

Welcome to the cliches  
welcome to the part  
Where we want to finish  
What we can't start  
Come and get me  
 
Just don't miss the water  
Until the well is dry  
You got to learn walking  
After you can fly  
Come and get me  
 
What goes in, will get out  
What goes up, comes right down  
We go up, we go up, we go up  
 
[Chorus] 
You know an apple a day  
(You know an apple a day) 
Won't keep the doctor away  
(Won't keep the doctor away) 
Were never taught what we teach  
And won't practice what we preach  
You know an apple a day  
(You know an apple a day) 
Won't keep my troubles away  
(Won't keep my troubles away) 
Once bitten bye, bye  
All the cliches is here to die  
 
Just eat all the people  
On your way up  
'Cause they will eat your heart out  
On your way down  
Come and get me  
 
Start what you can't finish  
Stick to what you can't  
Life is here to help us  
Get things out of hand  
Come and get us  
 
What goes in, will get out  
What goes up, comes right down  
We go up, we go up, we go up

The shining stars, needed brighter shining light 
Aquarius, was my savior 
It came along, like a blast from out of sight 
 
When I was weak, you came along 
Enlightened me, covered the sun 
You seduced me, I can never ever run 
 
'Cause I, can only lose 
When I'm, Aquarius 
You're the power that I need 
To make it all succeed, can you hear me call? 
 
Aquarius, is the stardust 
It kills the faith, and the only one I trust 
It calls your name, and you listen 
It steals your soul, and your hunger and your lust 
 
For life, and being free (it's killing me, it's killing me) 
It's dragging you, it's killing me (it's killing me, it's killing me) 
You seduced me, I can never ever run 
 
'Cause I, can only lose 
When I'm, Aquarius 
You're the power that I need 
To make it all succeed, can you hear me call? Can you hear me call? 
 
I wish the stars would turn you in, and leave me standing in the wind 
I wish the devil gave you up, and all the snow would melt and stop 
 
This is it, I can't run away 
You're controlling my life, and I can hear me say 
 
'Cause I, can only lose 
When I'm, Aquarius 
Your the power that I need 
To make it all succeed 
 
I wish the stars would turn you in, and leave me standing in the wind 
I wish the devil gave you up, and all the snow would melt and stop</field>

See me, I'm the bomb, drinking champagne down at Pierre's  
 
All the people that I'm meeting, are so friendly and perceiving  
When they smile  
Some are talking 'bout their feelings, and the stocks that they are dealing  
So they cry, don't want to say bye  
 
[Chorus] 
I am coming back from Mars, where they drive in fancy cars  
And the King he is ok, he is coming home today  
I am coming back from Mars, where there are no cheap cigars  
And Elvis has said, that I could be just like they are  
Meet the stars, they're from Mars  
 
Baby, it's glamour, throwing bills up in the air  
Back off, I'm too hot, eat the oysters if you dare  
 
Saying hi to Mister Shoe Shine, passes by a Missus Diva  
Stop and stare  
This is oh so just fantastic, I will live my life in plastic  
Check the hair, and see what I wear

We are porno stars, sucking big cigars  
We are the pop stars, we cannot play guitars</field>

Welcome to the toon town party

Here's a little story about an old friend of mine  
And to all you great folks out there  
This is hardcore 10-4  
 
Freaky Friday, things ain't going my way  
Everything is gone, my life is a country song  
Oh oh,  
 
I jumped out of my bed this morning  
Then I heard this crunchy sound  
From my left leg that was broken  
And a note was laying on the ground  
 
Baby, I'm leaving you this minute  
Took the car and the cats and dogs  
Got the boots and the rhinestone stetson  
Nothing's left but the note you got, ah you suck  
 
[Chorus] 
Freaky Friday, things ain't going my way  
Everything is gone, my life is a country song  
Freaky Friday, go play on the highway  
Everything is wrong, what the heck is going on  
 
On my way through crosstown traffic  
I was hit by a giant truck  
I came late to work and got fired  
Then suddenly the thunder struck  
Oh oh  
 
Baby, I am leaving you this minute  
Took the car and the cats and dogs  
Got the boots and the rhinestone stetson  
Nothing's left but the note you got, ah you suck  
 
[Chorus] 
 
Life's a country song, hardcore 10-4  
What the heck is wrong, yi-ha  
Life's a country song, hardcore 10-4  
What the heck is going on  
 
Life's a country song, hardcore 10-4  
What the heck is wrong, yi-ha  
Life's a country song, hardcore 10-4  
What the heck is going on  
 
Everything is gone, my life is a country song  
Hardcore 10-4  
 
[Chorus] 
 
Well folks, that's all for now  
Life is just a long long country song  
And that's a big 10-4</field>

Zombies passing deadly  
My Candyman, from Bountyland

I move silent in the night, ha ha ha ha ha  
Could be the boy from next door  
You'll never guess my disguise  
Ha ha ha ha ha!  
 
Kids and children fight  
Pumpkin and candlelight  
You might be the fearsome one at Junior High

Living in the ocean so blue

We'll all be a drop 
Coming down on your wide open sea 
 
Can you wash me away 
Will you dry me one day 
Take me to the place where I came from 
If I had an open heart 
Would you tear that apart 
Why do I feel that you're lonesome 
 
Come on into my waves 
You can sleep in my caves 
Let me know that you will hold me 
'Till the tides take my soul

And as soon as it stops 
We'll all be a drop

Doctor, what can I do?  
Why does it have to be like that?  
 
Baby, I am missing you  
I want you by my side  
And I hope you'll miss me too  
Come back and stay  
I think about you every day  
I really want you too  
You swept my feet right off the ground, you're the love I found

Ah yippie yi yu

Give me time to reason,  
give me time to think it through  
Passing through the season,  
where I cheated you  
I will always have a cross to wear,  
but the bolt reminds me I was there  
So give me strength,  
to face this test tonight  
If only I could turn back time,  
If only I had said what I still hide  
If only I could turn back time,  
I would stay for the night... for the night  
Claim your right to science,  
Claim your right to see the truth  
Though my pangs of conscience,  
Will drill a hole in you  
I've seen it coming like a thief in the night,  
I've seen it coming from the flesh of your light  
So give me strength,  
to face this test tonight  
If only I could turn back time,  
if only I had said what I still hide  
if only I could turn back time,  
I would stay.  
The bolt reminds me I was there  
the bolt reminds me I was there

To tear down years of work 
And we won't get these days 
Back again (back again) 
 
I can't understand why I've been put here 
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy 
With nobody watching over me 
 
And the words roll over and over 
Yet our hearts will never be lifted 
 
Someone, tell me how I've ended up here 
With nobody watching over me? 
 
We need to bring back the days we used to love 
Before all the color drains away 
 
I can't understand why I've been put here 
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy 
With nobody watching over me 
I can't understand why I've been put here 
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy 
With nobody watching over me

To all those not living in the here and now 
To all those not living in the here and now

Where did they go? 
The days we used to know 
Where did they go? 
Have I forgotten what it feels like? 
Where did they go, where did they go 
The days we used to know 
Where did they go, where did they go 
 
Have I forgotten what it feels like?

Don't believe everything that you're told 
Deception hides in all you see 
Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe 
And in the land of the free 
You know nothing comes for free 
Fourth drive in paradise 
Vapid souls check the market price 
Life time slave 
Living in a suburban grave 
If there was a God, was a God, 
You would be the death of him 
 
These colours don't run, 
Like colours from the face, 
Eyes roll back chemical despair, 
It's true what they say life isn't fair 
 
So repeat this line, everything, everything is fine 
So repeat this line, everything, everything is fine 
 
These colours don't run, 
Like colours from the face, 
Eyes roll back chemical despair, 
It's true what they say life isn't fair 
 
And in the land of the free 
You know nothing comes for free 
I'm struggling to find any poetry in this 
Someone beat me to the line ignorance is bliss 
So I guess I'll just say it how it is 
You had it all, you fucking pigs!

A bullet in the neck doesn't feel much like love 
A message of rejection sent from above 
No flags, no holy books 
I'll be in hell with the misunderstood

A desperate picture of god's regret 
Are we perfect mistakes? Or almighty fuck ups? 
One thing's for sure, he doesn't fucking love us

Hate must weigh on you like a broken cross 
Hate; the dividing line we'll never step across 
 
Outcast and reject, outcast and reject 
 
Father, father, how I've let you down 
A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown

She's bleeding out. 
 
Their innocence is heaven sent. 
Their malevolence, it will not relent. 
A graveyard sits upon the shore. 
They won't swim together anymore. 
 
The tide will rush with waves of fear. 
Selling souls, the devil is near. 
The tide will rush in waves of fear. 
Selling souls, the devil is near.

Respect the rights of all those species to survive.

There is a voice, though they cannot speak. 
Not yet ready to admit defeat.

We were disaster built from flesh and bone. 
 
Their bodies made a mountain, a ladder to the stars. 
When they reached up to the sun, it only left them with scars. 
All the saints and the sinners will reap what they sow. 
So they stood back and watched their bitterness grow. 
 
They couldn't tell the cure from disease. 
They no longer knew their want from their need. 
They fucked the future, forgot the past. 
Nothing built was built to last. 
 
A common ground, now we see, 
That connected us like the land and the sea. 
 
That distant blue, that's me and you. 
It was from there that we all grew.

All those beating hearts that were made of stone.

At least we're all lost together.

I'll show you my hurt and I'll show you my heart. 
A life lost in the dark.

So there's no worth in waiting for death to arrive.

Because I can't forget 
The saddest story, of all that ever was, or will be 
Laid out before me 
A living heart attack 
Play it back, play it back 
 
Take my eyes, I cannot see sense 
Past and future tense  
Every moment is dead to me 
Safe and sound, anywhere but here 
I see it crystal clear, but it means nothing to me 
It means nothing to me 
It means nothing to me 
 
Have you seen a future, filled with regret? 
Breathe and count to ten 
Start over again 
You want to run away 
Just let yourself decay 
A living heart attack 
Play it back, play it back

Safe and sound, anywhere but here 
I see it crystal clear, but it means nothing to me 
It means nothing to me 
It means nothing to me 
 
Play it back, play it back 
Over and over again 
Over and over again 
 
The empty hourglass 
We're going nowhere fast 
There's no more time to kill 
If time is standing still</field>

Just put us out of our misery 
This defeat is a victory 
We're burning out, we're fading away 
A failed evolution  
Is the problem the solution that they've been searching for? 
 
We're waiting for the world to save itself 
'Cause nothing is built to last 
We're writing our epitaph  
So reset and start again 
'Cause we all know how this ends 
Before long we'll be dead and gone 
 
A thorn in the side of the earth 
Where do you draw the line? 
A flaw in the design 
The rest is history 
This defeat is a victory 
We're burning out, we're fading away 
 
We're all guilty as sin 
I feel it, I feel it under my skin 
Always up in arms, without lifting a finger 
Lifting a finger 
 
We may be infinite, but this world is not  
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot

No rise without the fall 
Facing the great divide 
You can run but you can't hide 
You can run but you can't hide 
 
I met the devil and God and couldn't tell them apart 
I thought I found the end 
But it was only the start 
 
I've heard it all before 
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you? 
Just let go 
Gravity, hold on to me 
 
So come and wash us away 
Just thank fuck that we don't last forever 
It's now or never 
Is this the catalyst? 
Just let me burn the bridge 
That leads me nowhere 
Because it's gone and it's never coming back 
 
But make no mistake 
It's just a matter of time before the wave breaks 
So stand your ground 
The earth will shake 
So twist the knife, 'cause I am finally awake 
 
So come and wash us away 
Just thank fuck that we don't last forever 
It's now or never

Just let go 
Well, what are you waiting for? 
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?

Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease 
As within, so without 
The seasons bring relief 
Let me live and die in peace 
 
I will be consumed, returned into the earth 
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to 
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow 
Cut the chord and cast me out 
Cast me out 
 
It's a promise that you cannot break 
Was your life worth dying for?

Decay is the only law

As within, so without

Just let me live and die in peace 
 
It'll wear you down, through skin and bone 
It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own 
 
It'll wear you down, through skin and bone 
It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own 
 
When my heart skips two beats 
(I am hidden deep. Fast asleep) 
The sea will part, where oceans meet 
Finally complete 
 
It's a promise that you cannot break 
Was your life worth dying for? 
The universe survives on give and take 
Death is an open door 
 
It's a promise that you cannot break 
Was your life worth dying for? 
The universe survives on give and take 
Decay is the only law 
 
Swan song 
A declaration of endlessness 
I swear I will not look back, as I return into the black 
When the veil lifts, how will I know? 
How will I know? 
Will I see God? 
 
As above, so below 
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease 
As within, so without 
The seasons bring relief 
Just let me live and die in peace</field>

All hail the corporatocracy

All hail our apostasy 
The dying notes in an unholy symphony

Well fuck them all, we won't play their game 
We won't play their game

This is a failed state 
So read between the lines 
This is a failed state 
 
No love no empathy 
Our fellow man is now our enemy 
No love no unity 
Erase our souls, distort reality

Lost in black and white

They will sow the seeds of blind contempt

Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white

(Traditional; arranged by Seven Nations) 
 
Come on Irishmen both young and old 
With adventure in your soul 
There are better ways to spend your days 
Then by working down a hole 
 
I was tall and true all of 6 foot 2 
Til they broke me across my back 
By a name I'm known that is not my own 
For they call me crooked Jack 
 
And I curse the day I went away 
To work on those hydro dams 
All our sweat and tears our hopes and fears 
Bound up with shuttering jams 
 
For I've seen men old before their time 
Their faces worn and gray 
But I never thought that I myself 
Would soon be the self same way 
 
And they say that honest toil is good 
For the body and the soul 
But I'll tell you boys it's for sweat and blood 
That they want you down the hole

He's floating 'round the day  
Won't come down no way  
No reason  
And I found out today  
That maybe it's okay  
To carry on this way  
If you think it's good for you  
And I believe, in a goodbye  
Where no one will cry

All you people 
Won't you come into the right 
There's no need to fight anymore today 
All you people 
All you people 
It seems too strange to me 
That when we can talk so clear 
We leave so much in doubt 
When we can talk so clear 
We leave so much in doubt 
 
All you people 
While my song is in the air 
You're all welcome to share 
My smoke, my wine 
All you people 
All you people 
 
And it seems so strange to me 
When we can talk so clear 
We leave so much in doubt 
When we can talk so clear 
We leave so much in doubt 
And I still wonder that the fussing 
And the fighting and the shouting's all about 
 
Na na na na na, all you people 
Na na na na na, all you people 
I'm already gone 
So don't wake me because I'm already gone 
Don't wake me 
I'm already gone

It seems my eyes are growing tired of staring in the light  
The more I see, the more I feel, the less I want to know  
Because if you think to much you'll blow your mind  
 
You might just lose control and scream  
I walk the line ahead of me my eyes fixed to the ground  
I hear a voice that calls to me I don't dare make a sound  
You can see the hate you can taste the anger  
You can hold it in your hands  
I could take a knife and split it open but still I wouldn't understand  
 
And I scream from the earth  
I scream at the sky  
And I scream for all I'm worth  
I hope you're coming soon  
I hope you're coming soon  
 
So many people  
Believe in life  
I hope you're coming soon  
 
Something just occurred to me that I think I knew before  
It comes to me like a creeping shadow  
Like a light from a half closed door  
Do I think too much or not enough  
Do I even have a clue  
Because here I stand a single person  
Is there anything I can do  
 
And I scream from the earth  
I scream at the sky  
And I scream for all I'm worth  
I hope you're coming soon  
And I scream from the earth  
I scream at the sky  
And I scream for all I'm worth

Let's stay out, the trains will run until morning 
Because I don't want to go 
Please don't make me go 
I don't want to go home to bed now

Let's stay up the trains will run until morning

Please don't make me go 
I don't want to go home to bed now 
 
Because when I close my eyes 
There's too much time between 
When I close them and the time I fall to sleep

But that's not unusual 
It's just that the moon is full 
And you decided to call 
 
And here I sit, hand on the telephone 
Hearing the voice I'd known 
A couple of light years ago 
Headed straight for a fall 
 
But we both know what memories can bring 
They bring diamonds and rust 
Yes we both know what memories can bring 
They bring diamonds and rust 
 
Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair 
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square 
Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air 
Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there 
 
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic 
Then give me another word for it 
You were so good with words 
And at keeping things vague 
 
Cause I need some of that vagueness now  
It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly 
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid 
 
But we both know what memories can bring 
They bring diamonds and rust 
Yes we both know what memories can bring 
They bring diamonds and rust 
 
Diamonds, diamonds and rust 
Diamonds, diamonds and rust 
Diamonds, diamonds and rust 
Diamonds, diamonds and rust</field>

            <field name="lyrics">The old man's sitting there, his head bowed down 
Every now and then he'll take a look around 
And his eyes reflect the memory-pain of years gone by 
He can't regain nostalgic dreams he'll never see again 
 
With trembling hands, he wipes a tear 
Many fall like rain, there's one for every year 
And his life laid out so clearly now, life that's brought death 
So nearly now life once he clung to dearly now lets go  
 
But spare a thought as you pass him by 
Take a closer look and you'll say 
He's our tomorrow, just as much as we are his yesterday 
 
A lonely grave, and soon forgot 
Only wind and leaves lament his mournful song 
Yet they shout his epitaph out clear 
For anyone who's passing near 
It names the person lying here as you 
And you, and you, and you</field>

Looks like it'll always be the same

Here come the tears 
 
All alone, no one cares. 
So much to give to you all out there. 
 
Take me now, in your arms. 
Let me rest, safe from harm. 
 
Ohh I want to be loved 
I need to be loved 
Won't somebody love me

            <field name="lyrics">Throughout the soft and timeless days of August 
'Til now the shadows begin to grow much longer 
The sunset's fire has deepened blood red 
I give you this, the last rose of summer 
 
A token of my unyielding love 
So when the winter's mantle stills the earth 
And all around seems dead and cold 
This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living 
 
Do not despair, mother nature simply rests 
In sleep she has well earned 
'Til one day not so very far from now 
With the opening of the first rose buds I shall return 
 
A token of my unyielding love 
So that when winter's mettle steals the earth 
And all around seems dead and cold 
This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living 
 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
 In your long shadows 
The last rose of summer 
 In the sunset 
The last rose of summer 
 Take this rose that I give you 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
 Don't worry about the winter 
The last rose of summer 
 I shall return 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer 
The last rose of summer

All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar 
The spikey leather guys were foolin' with the denim dudes 
A couple cards played rough stuff, New York, fire island 
 
I cased the joint, straining at the seams 
 
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin' 
I snapped the smile off his face and snarled give me a bourbon 
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting 
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action 
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact 
Then there he was, saw me and knew that 
 
I'd had too much, foolin' around 
Statues alive, seconds are hours 
 
Sex is like a hurricane it grabs and then it shatters 
I was barely holding on to this fine body symphony  
I guess I dream in pictures, not colors 
The true free expression I demand is human rights right? 
 
I came the light, I am immortal 
 
I'm going, no loss 
I'm going, no loss 
I'm going, no loss 
I'm going, no loss 
 
Nightmare, just a bunch of goddamn, rotten, steaming, raw

Staring into space 
No sign of life

Are they still 
Who to us all 
Seem to have lost the will 
They lie in thousands 
Lank and lost

I heard a proud lady singing loud 
Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn 
But soon she found she was underground and wasted 
 
I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage 
Her body shook oh, she did her stuff 
She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much 
If you take the smooth you gotta take the rough 
 
Why do you have to die to be a hero 
It's a shame a legend begins at its end 
Why do you have to die if you're a hero 
When there's still so many things to say unsaid 
 
I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd 
I felt the sound shower 'round 
And he would take you with him where no music's been before 
As you merged the power surge together 
 
His music knew no limits if you were in it's wake 
You had no choice, no, but hear its voice 
And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream 
But once so strong survive or become weak 
 
Why do you have to die to be a hero 
It's a shame a legend begins at its end 
Why do you have to die if you're a hero 
When there's still so many things to say unsaid 
 
If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there 
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care 
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds 
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds 
 
I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame 
But fast car user lose 
That legend's born from death and that is such a shame 
'Cause every year new ones appear 
 
Why do you have to die to be a hero 
It's a shame a legend begins at its end 
Why do you have to die if you're a hero

Guess I'll learn to fight and kill 
Tell her not to wait until 
They'll find my blood upon her windowsill?

Everybody 
Everybody knows 
Everybody 
Everybody knows 
Better by you better than me 
 
You can say what I only can see 
You can tell what I want it to be 
 
It's better by you better than me

You can tell what I want it to be 
You can say way all they can see 
 
Better by you better than me

Don't know what to say 
But that look in your eyes 
Give it all away 
 
You say you've got these feelings 
You can't put into words 
But you don't have to say a thing 
'Cause I've already heard 
 
Give me one good reason 
Why this has to be 
That's all I'm asking for 
 
Don't say that it's over 
When you and I both know 
You can't put out this love 
The fire burns below 
 
We've been through so much together 
We've laughed and we've sometimes cried 
To say our love ain't working, well we 
Haven't really tried 
 
But why let's talk things over 
Love can't be bought and sold 
One more night together's what the future holds 
What the future holds 
 
Well, give me one good reason 
Why this has to be 
I said that's all I'm asking for 
Can't you see I said 
 
You can't put out the fire down below</field>

I stand contemplating, reacting alone 
Impaled with betrayal 
The tourniquet turns 
Society's creation 
Pole-axed out and burnt 
 
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class 
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king 
 
Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is 
Faithless continuum, into the abyss 
Fierce is my conviction, absolute my belief 
I spit at you apathy, and seducer deceit 
 
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class 
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king 
 
Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered 
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world 
But by doing so smashed all his hopes and Utopian dreams 
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off, relentless and senseless 
His lust snapped like vipers whose fangs sank in deep to infest and decay from the core 
 
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns 
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt 
 
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class

Quite open minded but still quite aware 
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning 
Picking out landmarks that said I was there 
Led to positions by stern faced leaders 
Who never let one smile depart from their face 
 
Then with an arm raise the slaughter is started 
One or two crack up and start to cry 
Selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow 
Every few moments I see I friend die 
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight 
As into the battle we are all led 
 
Killer, killer, keep your thoughts at bay 
Maiming, destroying, every single day 
Is this the way that you get your fun 
Slaying, waylaying, in the heat of the midday sun 
 
Get out, get out, go and do your job 
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob 
You make me sick, getting paid for murder 
You wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh no 
You never ever dream to hurt her 
 
Hero, hero, you have done so well 
So sit back and lick your wounds, cause you won't go to hell 
Take your medal, wear it now with pride 
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside</field>

I smile when I'm sneaking 
Through shadows by the wall 
I laugh when I'm creeping 
But you won't hear me at all 
 
All hear my warning 
Never turn your back 
On the ripper 
 
You'll soon shake with fear 
Never knowing if I'm near 
I'm sly and I'm shameless 
Nocturnal and nameless 
Except for "The Ripper" 
Or if you like "Jack The Knife" 
 
Any back alley street 
Is where we'll probably meet 
Underneath a gas lamp 
Where the air's cold and damp 
I'm a nasty surprise 
I'm a devil in disguise 
I'm a footstep at night 
I'm a scream of the fright 
 
All hear my warning 
Never turn your back

Oh shootin' further, giving more than you're ever gonna take

I couldn't see straight 
I faltered through my younger days 
Never knowing where I was going 
Then something helped me penetrate the haze 
 
Evening star I can see the light

Now I am stronger 
The haze no longer 
Ruins my future destiny 
Such inspirations and new sensations 
Pull up these string ties chasing me 
 
Evening star I can see the light 
Evening star guiding me so bright 
 
I'm home once more, much better for 
The things that I have found 
Much wiser now, so simple how

My feet don't touch the ground 
I move amongst the night life 
And they just step aside 
'Cause when they see me coming 
They know I'm running wild 
 
Dead or alive there's nothing 
That bothers me at all 
I take on all comers 
They back off or they fall 
They raise their hands to stop me 
I laugh and I defy 
'Cause what's the point in living 
Unless you're living wild 
 
No chains can hold me down 
I always break away 
I never hear society 
Tell me what to do or say 
I taste the life that pleases me 
And raise a storm for all the world to see  
I never stumble, never fall 
Never stop for rest 
I rebel but I walk tall 
And I demand respect 
 
I move amongst the nightlife 
And they just step aside 
'Cause when they see me coming 
They know I'm running wild 
 
I'm running wild 
I'm running wild 
Get outta my way 
I'm running wild 
I'm running wild 
You better believe it</field>

I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there 
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep 
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep 
 
She was a cheater 
 
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door 
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44 
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do 
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you 
 
You are a cheater 
 
They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way 
When you do this upon me, you have no say 
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do 
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through 
 
You are a cheater 
 
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one 
There's no neater, come on here and meet her 
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her</field>

Or I'll go out of my mind

Yes we both know what memories can bring

Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair 
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square 
Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air 
Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there 
 
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic 
Then give me another word for it 
You were so good with words 
And at keeping things vague 
 
'Cause I need some of that vagueness now 
It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly 
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid

Lost in cold perplexion 
Waiting for the sign

Helpless situation 
To end the perfect race

Black sun rising, time is running out

His steed of fury, 
Eyes of fire and mane ablaze 
Demonic vultures stalking 
Drawn by the smell of war and pain 
He roams the star ways 
Searching for the carcasses of war 
But if it's hungry then its very presence 
Disrupts the calm into the storm 
 
Curse and damn you all you'll fall by the hand of the

Won't you help them pray 
God of the Devils, God of the Devils

Can't you hear their souls calling out in their plight 
Can't you see their blood is boiling setting them alight 
 
Thirty years now sleeping, so sound 
War raises its head, and looks slowly around 
The Sinner is near, sensing the fear 
And the beast will start movin' around 
 
Can't you see their souls calling out in their brain 
Can't you hear their blood is boiling setting them alight

And I can't get through 
Wherever I roam 
Keeps bringing me back to you 
 
Holding on to hope 
There's no need to fear 
Wherever I roam 
This piece of home 
Keeps telling you that I'm near 
 
So lift up your heart 
Cause the brave will always come through 
While we're apart 
We will raise the red, white and blue 
 
When I stand alone 
Without you by my side 
I think of all 
That you stand for 
It fills me up with pride 
 
Reaching out to you 
Across mountains, sea and sky 
I think of all 
That you stand for 
And hope will never die 
 
Now I'm coming home again 
I'm coming home to you 
And as I roam 
This piece of home 
Has brought me back to you</field>

It's the way you stand 
You're always attracting attention 
 
Now with your hands on your hips, and a 
Snarl on your lips 
Your eyes wore the look of danger 
There's a lion in your heart, 
 
That's set to quick start, 
 
To a glance from any stranger 
You give as good as you get 
No one's beat you yet 
You take the lead 
You never need 
You know all the moves you've got to make 
 
You take it all, you take it all the way 
 
Ya never do things by half 
You're a man with a reputation 
You never shy when the problems fly 
You can cope with any situation 
You take the wheel and crack the whip 
You never slip 
You rule the roost 
You always boast 
Yeah you're lookin' after number one 
 
You take it all, you take it all the way

Wild mountain thunder 
Echoes my quest 
My body aches but I'll not rest 
Quartz light to guide me 
Till sunrise leads 
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds 
 
From desert plains I bring you love 
From desert plains I bring you love 
 
Then in the distance 
I see you stand 
On the horizon you raise your hand 
In burning rubber 
I end my quest 
You fall into my arms at last 
 
From desert plains I bring you love 
From desert plains I bring you love

Well I've said it before, and I'll say it again 
You get nothing for nothing:  expect it when 
You're backseat driving, and your hands ain't on the wheel 
It's easy to go along with the crowd, 
And find later on that your say ain't allowed 
Oh that's the way to find what you've been missing 
So I'm heading out to the highway 
I got nothing to lose at all 
I'm gonna do it my way 
Take a chance before I fall 
A chance before I fall! 
You can hang in a left or hang in a right 
The choice it is yours to do as you might 
The road is open wide to place your bidding 
Now, wherever you turn, wherever you go 
If you get it wrong, at least you can know 
There's miles and miles to put it back together! 
And I'm heading out to the highway 
I got nothing to lose at all 
I'm gonna do it my way 
Take a chance before I fall 
A chance before I fall! 
On the highway! 
On the highway! 
Making a curve or taking the strain 
On the decline, or out on the wain 
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later 
We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend 
Back on your feet to take the next bend! 
You weather every storm that's coming atcha! 
And I'm heading out to the highway 
I got nothin' to lose at all 
I'm gonna do it my way 
Take a chance before I fall 
Yes, I'm heading out to the highway 
I got nothing to lose at all. I got nothing to lose at all!</field>

Don't let it stop, don't let it end 
Please let it carry on and on and on again

Out again upon the thunder road 
Driving back to you where I belong 
I've had enough 
Dreams can wait

Spotlights, wild nights 
I know it wrong from right 
Places, the faces 
All look the same 
 
Hot wired, so tired 
Living from song to song 
The madness, the badness 
It's just a game 
 
Watch the sunrise 
From coast to coast

Oh! That's when I need it most 
Can't explain, it's something in the blood 
Wouldn't change it even if I could</field>

You know there are times 
When I let myself wonder

You Pulled me back to earth 
 
Don't you hear me crying 
Take me in your arms again 
Tell me that you're trying 
Or is our love a lie 
 
Love is blind 
And love deceives you 
You came along and captured me 
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes 
Trapped in time 
I cannot leave you 
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes 
As each day goes by 
I've given up completely 
I've locked myself inside your heart 
And thrown away the key 
 
Only time will tell 
If I can live without you 
Can you live without you 
Can you see into the future 
Will you ever set me free 
 
Don't you hear me crying 
Take me into your arms again 
Tell me that you're trying 
Or is our love a lie 
 
Love is blind 
And love decieves you 
You came along and captured me 
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes 
Trapped in time 
I cannot leave you 
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes

We can try and start again 
Stop the heartbreak 
A little time will help to kill the pain.</field>

Where in deep sleep 
There you lie still 
To you I creep

Close to your lips 
Across you I bend 
You smile as I sip 
 
Now you are mine 
In my control 
One taste of your life 
And I own your soul 
 
Softly you stir 
Gently you moan 
Lust's in the air 
Wake as I groan 
 
In the dead of night love bites 
 
Love bites you 
Invites you 
To feast in the night 
Excites you 
Delights you 
It drains you to white 
Love bites 
 
You knew at first sight 
You'd enjoy my attack 
That with my first bite 
There'd be no turning back

So defiant they'll never put us down 
 
Rock hard ride free 
All day, all night 
Rock hard ride free 
All your life 
 
Tough as steel 
Stop at nothin' 
Look at fate in the face 
Don't take no for an answer 
Grab the lead in the race 
 
Rock with a purpose 
Got a mind that won't bend 
Die hard resolution 
That is true to the end</field>

Steam begins to rise 
The figures primed and ready 
Prepared for quick surprise 
He's watchin' for a sign 
His life is on the line 
Dogs whine in the alleys 
Smoke is on the wind 
From deep inside its empty shell 
A cathedral bell begins to toll 
A storm begins to grow 
 
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars 
The challengers await 
And in their fists clutch iron bars 
With which to seal his fate 
Across his chest is scabbards rest 
The rows of throwing knives 
Whose razor points in challenged tests 
Have finished many lives 
 
Now facing one another 
The stand-off eats at time 
Then all at once a silence falls 
As the bell ceases its chime 
Upon this sign the challengers 
With shrieks and cries rush forth 
The knives fly out like bullets 
Upon their deadly course 
Screams of pain and agony 
Rent the silent air 
Amidst the dying bodies 
Blood runs everywhere 
The figure stands expressionless 
Impassive and alone 
Unmoved by this victory 
And the seeds of death he's sown 
 
Sworn to avenge 
Condemn to Hell 
Tempt not the blade 
All fear the Sentinel</field>

But you will live in danger tonight 
When the enemy comes he will 
Never be heard 
He'll blow your mind and not say a word

Sleepless nights

Can't keep it under control 
 
Some heads are gonna roll 
Some heads are gonna roll 
Some heads are gonna roll 
Some heads are gonna roll 
 
The power-mad freaks who are 
Ruling the earth 
Will show how little they think you're worth 
With animal lust they'll 
Devour your life 
And slice your word to bits like a knife 
One last day burning hell fire 
You're blown away 
If the man with the power 
Can't keep it under control 
 
Some heads are gonna roll 
Some heads are gonna roll 
Some heads are gonna roll

Hot breath on my neck.

We don't need, no, no no no parental guidance here 
 
Every day you scream at me to turn the music low 
Well if you keep on screaming, you'll make me deaf you know 
You always chew me out, because I stay out late 
Until your three-piece suit comes back in date, get one thing straight 
 
There's no communication 
I'm tired of explanation 
Is this message getting through 
You went through the same thing too 
Don't you remember what it's like to lose control 
Put on my jacket - for you get too old

But there's always someone tryin' to put it down 
So we crank the music louder 
And our voices turn to power 
With a wall of sound we'll blow 'em all away 
 
Rock you all around the world 
We're gonna rock 
We're gonna roll 
We're gonna shake you down 
We're gonna lose control 
 
No one can hold us down, just look around and see 
This generation's getting up, and breakin' free 
 
Rock you all around the world 
We're gonna rock, we're gonna rock you

Without warning, somethings dawning, listen. 
Then within your senses, 
You'll know you're defenseless 
How your heart beats, when you run for cover 
Your cant retreat I spy like no other. 
 
Then we race together. 
We can ride forever 
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury 
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me 
 
I'm your turbo lover 
Tell me there's no other 
I'm your turbo lover 
Better run for cover 
 
We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive 
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive 
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky 
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry. 
 
I'm your turbo lover 
Tell me there's no other 
I'm your turbo lover 
Better run for cover 
 
On and on we're charging to the place so many seek 
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak 
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load 
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode. 
 
I'm your turbo lover 
Tell me there's no other

If that's my destiny, it'll have to be

Running out of time 
I'm on the line

Felt the hand of justice 
Telling wrong from right 
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night 
 
Cybernetic heartbeat 
Digital precise 
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice 
 
Not begging you 
I'm telling you 
 
You won't break me 
You won't make me 
You won't take me 
Under blood red skies 
 
You won't break me 
You won't take me 
I'll fight you under 
Blood red skies 
 
Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes 
Overhead the night squad glides 
The decaying paradise 
 
Automatic sniper 
With computer sights 
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night 
 
They're closing in 
They'll never win 
 
You won't break me 
You won't make me 
You won't take me 
Under blood red skies 
 
You won't break me 
You won't take me 
I'll fight you under 
Blood red skies 
 
As the end is drawing near 
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear 
As I die a legend will be born 
I will stand. I will fight 
You'll never take me alive 
 
I'll stand my ground 
I won't go down 
 
You won't break me 
You won't make me 
You won't take me, 
Under blood red skies 
 
You won't break me 
You won't take me 
I'll fight you under

You'll never take me alive

Hands of justice 
I will stand, I will fight

Do you love it mean 
Do you want it dirty 
We don't play it clean 
 
Standing in the spotlight 
Ceiling the the floor 
I can see you rockin' 
Let me hear you roar 
 
Turn it up 
Tear it down 
Hammering through 
Can you feel the sound 
 
Any day.  Any night 
Midnight madness 
Dynamite 
 
If you want it 
Come and get it 
Do you want it 
Come and get it 
 
Can you feel the power 
Blinded by the light 
Keep on goin' crazy 
Burnin' up the night 
 
Shouting out together 
Boiling like the sun 
Metal lives forever 
Blazing on and on 
 
Turn it up 
Tear it down 
Hammering through 
Can you feel the sound 
 
Any day.  Any night 
Midnight madness 
Dynamite

Don't mess with me I'm danger 
The meanest one alive 
 
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale 
The more that you resist 
The more pain you'll feel

There's thunder in my veins 
And nothing stands before me 
Forever I'll remain 
 
Hard as iron 
Sharp as steel 
Stop for no man 
You better beg and kneel 
 
Untouched, cold as ice 
I'll turn your blood to water 
Strangle in my vice 
 
Shock waves, bones to dust 
You're messin' with a mine field 
So expect the worst 
 
I'm blazing on to glory 
There's thunder in my veins 
And nothing stands before me 
Forever I'll remain 
 
Hard as iron 
Sharp as steel 
Stop for no man

As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry 
Is victory, is victory

Go tearing through my senses

And blasts us through the ceiling

Your inner feelings 
 
Hot shock waves charge the air 
All heads are banging 
Fists pumping everywhere 
Guitars are cranking 
 
Heavy metal, heavy metal 
What do you want 
Heavy metal, heavy metal 
What do you want 
 
Ten thousands lights come blazing down 
With razor sharp precision 
The speakers pour out molten steel 
The beat gives double vision 
 
An armor plated raging beast 
That's born of steel and leather 
It will survive against all odds 
Stampeding on forever 
 
Between the eyes

Drivin' in the fast lane at night 
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light

From the concrete jungle 
The smoke, the dirt, the grime 
Could not contain the hunger 
It grew and grew in time, into a 
 
Monster.  Monster of rock 
They could never bind it 
It vowed to reach the top 
Monster.  Monster of rock 
They could never bind it 
Impossible to stop 
 
Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in awe 
At last the sound had come to them 
That they'd been waiting for 
 
And millions roared, and millions cheered 
This spectacle on stage 
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage 
 
From the concrete jungle

On a bloodstone 
I don't want that bloodstone

All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town 
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die 
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life 
 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 
So much for the golden future I can't even start 
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart 
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue 
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too 
 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 
You don't know what it's like

Feel my willpower slip 
Light my fire 
With cold desire 
Losing all my grip 
 
Eat my diamonds 
Drinking all my gin 
Feast your eyes on 
A whole lotta sin 
 
Oh no you're so damned wicked 
You got me by the throat 
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me 
You never let me go 
I believe you're the devil 
I believe you're the devil's child 
 
Took my dreams 
And now it's seems you're nothing but a liar 
Smash and grab at all I had 
Build my funeral pyre 
Stop pretendin' 
Got me growin' old 
Your tormentin's 
Fit to snap my soul 
 
Oh no you're so damned wicked 
You got me by the throat 
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me 
You never let me go 
I believe you're the devil 
I believe you're the devil's child 
 
You took my heart 
And left it blown to smithereens 
I gave my body as a slave 
You cut my flesh 
And drank my blood that poured in streams 
I'm left here broken and ashamed 
 
Goin' under 
Hear the thunder 
Death defying grace 
Your condition breeds ammunition 
Shoots me in the face 
Vicious talkin' 
Stabs me like a knife 
Scratched and bruised, so abused 
I'm a human sacrifice 
 
Oh no you're so damned wicked 
You got me by the throat 
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me 
You never let me go

I believe you're the devil's child</field>

Well I've said it before, and I'll say it again 
You get nothing for nothing:  expect it when 
You're backseat driving, and your hands ain't on the wheel 
It's easy to go along with the crowd, 
And find later on that your say ain't allowed 
Oh that's the way to find what you've been missing 
So I'm heading out to the highway 
I got nothing to lose at all 
I'm gonna do it my way 
Take a chance before I fall 
A chance before I fall! 
You can hang in a left or hang in a right 
The choice it is yours to do as you might 
The road is open wide to place your bidding 
Now, wherever you turn, wherever you go 
If you get it wrong, at least you can know 
There's miles and miles to put it back together! 
And I'm heading out to the highway 
I got nothing to lose at all 
I'm gonna do it my way 
Take a chance before I fall 
A chance before I fall! 
On the highway!   
On the highway! 
Making a curve or taking the strain 
On the decline, or out on the wain 
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later 
We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend. 
Back on your feet to take the next bend! 
You weather every storm that's coming atcha! 
And I'm heading out to the highway 
I got nothin' to lose at all 
I'm gonna do it my way 
Take a chance before I fall 
Yes, I'm heading out to the highway, 
I got nothing to lose at all.I got nothing to lose at all!</field>

Laser beaming hearts 
Ripping men apart 
From off I've seen my perfection 
Where we could do as we please

Was spreading like a disease 
Hiding underground 
Knowing we'd be found 
Fearing for our lives 
Reaped by robot's scythes

Beware the beast in black

Whispered prayers a last resort 
Homing in its' cry distorts 
Terror struck they know they're caught

As night is falling 
The end is drawing near 
They'll hear 
Their last rites echo on the wind 
 
Huddled in the cellar 
Fear caught in their eyes 
Daring not to move or breathe 
As the creature cries 
Fingernails start scratching 
On the outside wall 
Clawing at the windows 
"Come to me" it calls 
Atmosphere's electric 
As it now descend the stairs 
 
Hiding in the darkness 
Is so futile from its glare 
Death comes in an instant 
As they hoped it would 
Souls ascend to heaven 
While it feasts on flesh and blood</field>

Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree 
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know 
Took us by the hands and up we go 
 
We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds 
He could control our sense of time 
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried 
Everyone was in peace of mind 
 
We felt the sensations drift inside our frames 
Finding complete contentment there 
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past 
Just seemed to vanish in thin air 
 
He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound 
That is vibrating constantly 
And if we could grip and hold on to the note 
We would see our minds were free...oh they're free 
 
We are lost above 
Floating way up high 
If you think you can find a way 
You can surely try</field>

Darkness filled my soul 
Losing all control 
 
Down on the streets below 
Bright city lights would glow 
The energy would rise 
And through the heat I'd gaze 
Still counting empty days 
With fire in my eyes 
Living through this hell 
Can I break this spell 
 
Fever. You set my soul on fire 
Fever. You fill me with desire 
Fever. You always get it right 
Fever. All day and all night 
 
Then one night as I walked 
I heard your body talk 
I saw a shooting star 
In some magnetic trance 
Our beating hearts would dance 
And crash down from afar 
Oh how strange fate is 
Never dreamed of this 
 
Fever. You set my soul on fire 
Fever. You fill me with desire 
Fever. You always get it right 
Fever. All day and all night 
 
So destiny has bought us 
Oh so close together 
We were like angels in the night 
Living the dream 
At last I'll be with you forever 
And all at once it feels so right

            <field name="lyrics">There I was completely wasted, out of work and down 
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town 
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die 
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life 
 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 
So much for the golden future I can't even start 
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart 
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue 
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too 
 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 
You don't know what it's like 
 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law 
Breaking the law, breaking the law</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again 
But that's not unusual 
It's just that the moon is full 
And you decided to call 
 
And here I sit, hand on the telephone 
Hearing the voice I'd known 
A couple of light years ago 
Headed straight for a fall 
 
But we both know what memories can bring 
They bring Diamonds and Rust 
Yes we both know what memories can bring 
They bring Diamonds and Rust 
 
Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair 
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square 
Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air 
Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there 
 
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic 
Then give me another word for it 
You were so good with words 
And at keeping things vague 
 
Cause I need some of that vagueness now 
It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly 
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid 
 
But we both know what memories can bring 
They bring Diamonds and Rust 
Yes we both know what memories can bring 
They bring Diamonds and Rust 
 
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust 
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust 
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust 
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust

He couldn't take anymore 
He found a place in his mind 
And slammed the door 
No matter how they tried 
They couldn't understand 
They washed and dressed him 
Fed him by hand 
 
Yeah! I've left the world behind 
I'm safe here in my mind 
I'm free to speak with my own kind 
This is my life, this is my life 
I'll decide not you 
 
Withdrawn he sat there 
Staring into space 
No sign of life 
Would flicker on his face 
Until one day he smiled 
It seemed as though with pride 
The wind kissed him goodbye 
And then he died 
 
Yeah I've left the world behind 
I'm safe here in my mind 
I'm free to speak with my own kind 
This is my life, this is my life 
I'll decide not you 
 
Keep the world with all its sin 
It's not fit for livin' in 
Yeah I will start again 
It can take forever, and ever whatever, whenever, but I'll still win 
 
How many like him 
Are they still 
Who to us all 
Seem to have lost the will 
They lie in thousands 
Lank and lost 
Is knowledge worth this bitter cost 
 
Yeah I've left the world behind 
I'm safe here in my mind 
I'm free to speak with my own kind 
This is my life, this is my life 
I'll decide not you 
 
Keep the world with all its sin 
It's not fit for living in

And the night is so black that the darkness cooks, 
And you come creeping around, making me do things I don't want to do. 
Can't believe that she needs my love so bad. 
Come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad. 
Busting in all my dreams, making me see things I don't want to see. 
 
'Cause you're the Green Manalishi with the two-pronged crown 
All night dragging us up, or you're bringing us down 
Just taking my love, and slip away 
Leaving me here, trying to keep from following you</field>

Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded 
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded 
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take

I'm aiming for yaI'm gonna floor ya 
My body's coming 
All night long 
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded 
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded 
I set my sights and then home in 
The joint starts flying when I begin

Justice wrong or right 
You dig up the dirt ignore the hurt 
And spit out all your lies 
 
Conscience free as we bleed 
Hypocrisy born from greed 
Don't preach to me of integrity 
Or your legal highs 
 
The judge's thrilled 
He's dressed to kill 
On TV every night 
 
Subliminal so absurd 
It's criminal yet can't be heard 
 
Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night 
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites 
 
You will be on the stand today 
They cannot harm you it's okay 
But they will destroy your family 
And drag you through hell and tragedy 
 
A circus heading into town 
Complete with cameras and the clowns 
The First Amendment shot to bits 
The world is watching just for kicks 
 
As the day drew close to hand 
For all to view the faceless man 
He put out the lights it's sad 
Now who's to blame for that? 
 
Intimidate twist what you say 
With their fine points of law 
They lose the case but pontificate 
And then appeal some more 
 
Subliminal it's so absurd 
It's criminal but can't be heard 
 
Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night 
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites 
 
Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night 
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites 
 
Promise to tell the truth 
The whole truth 
And nothing but the truth 
So help me God! 
 
You will be on the stand today 
They cannot harm you it's okay 
They will destroy your family 
And drag you through hell and tragedy

So many things we've done 
The memories alive 
But most of me has died 
 
As I struggle with events 
I'm offered words of strength 
They do not comprehend 
The passion we possessed 
 
People tell me what to do 
Tell me how I should get through 
But they haven't got a clue 
No one else comes close to you 
 
I see your eyes before they closed 
They looked right inside my soul 
And they asked me not to grieve 
I tried but still I bleed 
 
I wake up, I break up 
Try hard to shake off 
The desolation as it grows 
As nothing else comes close 
 
And as I stand here by the grave 
And the wind calls out your name 
I know that time could never heal 
The emptiness I feel 
 
People try to give me hope 
Tell me how I should let go 
But they'll never really know 
'Cause there's nothing else comes close 
 
People tell me what to do 
Tell me how I should get through

Detects the man 
Or the deadly tasks he plans 
 
Drooling lips 
His circuits lit 
He crouches for attack 
 
Spider like on the web 
Alive and well 
But you are dead 
Iniquitous in every way 
Now he's come out to play 
 
Cyberface 
Iron will 
Programmed to corrupt and kill 
Cyberface 
No escape 
He is interfaced to Hell 
 
Once he's summoned and installed Cyberface

Now he's got a grip 
He will strip away your flesh 
Alive yet dead 
A fiend obsessed 
He'll crash your system down 
Once in place 
He'll simulate 
Your life it's worthless now 
 
God forsaken 
Grotesque mind 
An entity

Boot your screen

Approaching fast and mean

Inevitably far outweighs the gain

And you feel your inner strength has drained feed on me

Okay for your kind

For all the bullshit

Oh look down your noses at me 
Hating my identity 
Oh but that don't mean a damn thing you see 
'Cause down here in Hell everybody loves me 
 
Hey I know I'm anti-social 
'Cause you act like I'm infected 
With some atrocity 
 
And though I know I'm 
Every bit the same inside 
My face don't fit 
It's like I've got some disease 
 
Oh you keep your face turned away 
To strip me of identity 
Oh still got my fortune and fame 
'Cause down here in Hell everyone knows my name 
 
Hell is home to me 
Might as well be 
I like it here and nowhere else invited me 
Hell is home to me 
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ) 
Nobody else invited me 
 
Now I belong 
I found my home 
'Cause even though I know things won't 
Get any better, they can certainly never get much worse 
 
Hell is home to me

I like it here and nowhere else invited me 
Hell is home to me 
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ) 
Nobody else invited me 
 
Say my whole life I've always been disliked 
Ignored unless you're spitting insults at me 
And I don't know why you felt so justified 
In all the degradation that you dished on me 
 
Oh! Now my status has changed 
And you've got yourself to blame 
Oh! I'll grab all the attention I crave 
Now I'm running Hell, Heaven won't be the same

I had run aground 
I was lost but now I'm found 
 
Focused on my altered state 
I would just disorientate 
Suffering alone amongst the crowd 
 
Drifting on a sea of doubt 
And no one ever heard me shout

Having no plan 
Stumbled through a barren land

Shedding the load

Recruit all of you 
Do not live in sin 
Or taste the fear again 
Someone's coming back 
Fuck the almanacs 
 
Premonition say 
Better step away 
Skeptics preach a lot 
Watch in aftershock 
Heed the prophecies 
In your offices 
Someone out the blue 
Explodes into view 
 
The time is near 
The day has dawned 
Be prepared 
For what's to come 
 
He's the man 
Armageddon 
Walking through fire 
Metal messiah 
He's the one 
The father, the son 
Creator destroyer 
Metal messiah 
 
Heaven's in a state 
Someone's at the gate 
Crashing isn't cool 
He don't know the rules 
Stepping in he says 
Time to rock the place 
Like they've got a choice 
Then all hell breaks loose 
 
Hell ain't ready for 
What he's got in store 
Time you fuckers had 
Change of management 
Better fornicate 
Before it's too late 
Cranks the power up 
As he detonates 
 
Never too late 
To extricate 
In the event 
Die or repent 
 
He's the man 
Armageddon 
Walking through fire 
Metal messiah 
He's the one 
The father, the son 
Creator destroyer 
Metal messiah 
 
You can pray to him 
Auditorium 
Buy the merchandise 
Cheap at twice the price 
Rising up above 
With his decibels 
He's come down to earth 
Next the universe 
 
The time is near 
The day has dawned 
Be prepared 
For what's to come 
 
Never too late 
To extricate 
In the event 
Die or repent 
 
Metal messiah 
Thy kingdom come 
They will be done</field>

I am your fall from power 
I am the voice you dread and I'm 
Screaming out inside your head 
 
I am the final count 
I am your demons out 
I am the worst demise 
I'm gonna cut your big words down to size 
 
What is this? 
I hear you shout 
Face to face 
I'm gonna take you out 
 
One on one, bring it on 
One on one, take me on 
 
I am the awful truth 
I am the fearless youth 
I am the cross to bear 
And the one who dares to return your stare 
 
I am the fist of God 
I am the underdog 
I'll always stand my ground 
While the others scatter all around 
 
Against all odds 
Despite it all 
I'm at my best when I'm against the wall 
 
One on one, bring it on 
One on one, take me on 
 
I am the bloodstained past at last 
That's finally caught up with you like 
The glint of steel from out of the dark the last 
Thing you will feel - I'm outgunned, I'm out 
 
Run, I'm undead and then I found the skin 
You shed I am the questions asked 
That send the shivers down your back 
 
So I am holding out 
And I'm much stronger now 
So take me on 
 
One on one, bring it on 
One on one, take me on 
 
I am the darkest night 
I am the viper's strike 
I'll see you all consumed 
As you start to lick your mortal wounds 
 
Like the condemned man 
Who just won't die 
I'll show no remorse 
I'll never walk away 
 
One on one, bring it on 
One on one, take me on</field>

Preaching peace as you go to war 
Politicians making brave decisions 
Always got self interest at heart 
 
We are to you just a drop in the ocean 
Maybe that's true but it's only a notion 
You integrate with a friendly intrusion 
We won't get fooled we have come to conclusion 
 
Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me 
We're confused but still we choose to disagree 
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly 
We refuse to bow down to conformity 
 
Evil mothers hiding under covers 
Always near but just out of sight 
 
Hey big brother watch as we recover 
'Cause we'll never give up the fight 
And we say no! 
 
Give us a name and you give us the power 
Watch as we gather our strength by the hour 
You think we're blind and weak in decision 
But we see it all from peripheral vision 
 
Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me 
We're confused but still we choose to disagree 
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly 
We refuse to bow down to conformity 
 
Somebody wins, somebody lose 
Some call it subterfuge 
Somebody wins, somebody lose 
They fall to subterfuge 
 
Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me 
We're confused but still we choose to disagree 
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly 
We refuse to bow down to conformity

Some call it subterfuge 
Somebody wins, somebody lose 
They fall to subterfuge</field>

When you feel warm 
That's when I rise 
That's when I crawl 
 
Gliding on mist 
Hardly a sound 
Bring the kiss 
Evils abound 
 
In the dead of night love bites 
 
Into your room 
Where in deep sleep 
There you lie still 
To you I creep 
 
Then I descend 
Close to your lips 
Across you I bend 
You smile as I sip 
 
Now you are mine 
In my control 
One taste of your life 
And I own your soul 
 
Softly you stir 
Gently you moan 
Lust's in the air 
Wake as I groan 
 
In the dead of night love bites 
 
Love bites you 
Invites you 
To feast in the night 
Excites you 
Delights you 
It drains you to white 
Love bites 
 
You knew at first sight 
You'd enjoy my attack 
That with my first bite 
There'd be no turning back 
 
So come in my arms 
I strike any hour 
I will return 
To trap and devour 
 
In the dead of night love bites

We can find our way somehow 
Escaping from the world we're in

And I know we'll find 
A better place and piece of mind 
Just tell me that it's all you want 
For you and me 
 
Angel won't you set me free 
Angel 
Remember how we chased the sun 
Then reaching for the stars at night 
As our lives had just begun 
When I close my eyes 
I hear your velvet wings and cry 
I'm waiting here with open arms 
Oh can't you see 
Angel shine your light on me 
 
Angel we'll meet once more I'll pray 
When all my sins are washed away 
Hold me inside your wings and stay 
Angel take me far away 
 
Put your sad wings around me now 
Angel take me far away 
Put sad wings around me now

Under blood red skies 
We all had our dream to realize 
Driving in that transit 
Down to Holy Joe's 
Used to lose our head while metal flowed 
Nothing held us back or dared to try 
Something in our blood won't let us die 
We built our world of metal watched it grow 
Fueled the fury solid to the bone 
 
Gotta deal with the devil 
'Cause you know that's it's real 
Done a deal with the devil 
From a heart made of steel 
 
Rollin' down the M-Way 
Took it to the smoke 
Banging heads there 'til we all went broke 
When we don the leather 
And the whips and chains 
Nothing matters more, we can't be tamed 
Fighting through the din and accolades 
Turn the phase around with razor blades 
Watched the movement grow into one voice 
Took on the whole world it had no choice 
 
Late at night 
You're in our sight 
Where we can feel what we've been waiting for 
Let me hear you roar 
On this stage, let it rage 
For a time we leave the world behind 
To be with our own kind</field>

Out, demons out 
 
Blade of the wheel 
Cuts deep in the bone

To take Satan's throne

Exterminates all

A way to ease your mind 
That where I'd go you'd wind up in the dust 
 
I tried so hard to have you reach 
Another side of me 
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot 
 
So I wander on 
Asking where you might have gone 
From what I knew before 
Some things are worth fighting for 
 
Desert heat can wear you down 
But still I'm rollin' through 
Did I see your figure in the haze 
 
I am driven by a thirst 
To quench myself of love 
The sun beats on me for the price I've paid 
 
So I wander on 
Asking where you might have gone 
From what I knew before 
Some things are worth fighting for 
 
Night road leads me to a town of ghosts 
Beckoned by the glow of kerosene and tumbleweed 
They're calling out (They're calling out) 
Forevermore (Forevermore) 
Worth fighting for 
 
I'm leaning in the wind 
Head bowed down from what I saw 
My shadow for a friend 
Still some things are worth fighting for 
 
So I'm moving on 
Asking where you might have gone 
From what I knew before 
Some things are worth fighting for 
Yeah !

Took a sample of the good things in life

You don't have to be old to be wise 
 
No I don't care that the people stare 
Accuse me of going mad 
Just get a long hard look into the mirror 
Then, tell me now who's been had 
 
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em 
Go single all the time's up to me 
So it's off with the ties 
No compromise 
want to taste what it's like to be free

Go through the door 
Live and let live from now on 
At last a free hand, no longer pre-planned 
I got a will of my own 
 
I go as I please 
Fend for myself 
Pull all the stops, throw the dice 
Out on my own, gonna go it alone 
When I need it 
Then I'll ask for advice

When darkness falls 
On Judgment Day 
 
They say we are fools 
We say look at you 
Long ago we were just a few 
Still say, we don't need you 
 
Think we have lost our way 
Running form the blaze 
You were wrong 
We chose our course 
Counted up the days 
Enduring in a rage 
We got strong

No line of self defense

Our voice is heard no more 
His deed is merciless

Ignored we turn to face

Journey with the dawn 
As I take the winding road 
Bow my head forlorn 
Now I must go 
 
I'm banished in exile 
I wander this land 
No faith in the future 
I'm in their command 
 
Cross over the mountains 
And valleys so wide 
I walk as I wonder 
With hope by my side 
 
All my friends are far away 
How I miss my home 
Where do I find peace of mind 
Guide me as I roam 
I cry for you 
 
I'm banished in exile 
To meet their demand 
Rejected messiah 
They don't understand 
 
I'm searching for something 
That's lost in my heart 
God knows I'm a sinner 
I'm falling apart 
 
If this is my destiny 
I've got to believe 
The passion inside me 
Has left me to bleed

That we took from the start

I can remember 
The first time that we met 
The feelings you gave to me, I'll never forget 
I knew from that moment 
When our love first began 
We'd last till the end of time forever 
 
And though there were bad times 
We stood by each other 
And did what we had to get through 
 
You live in my heart, when you're far away 
I see you in dreams where I hear you say 
I'm with you forever, in true love 
By light of the day and stars above 
 
And when there were bad times 
We held on each other 
To face what we had to get through 
 
You live in my heart, when you're far away 
I see you in dreams, when I hear you say 
Look up to heaven, and I'll be there 
Still guiding my heart 
Still saying our prayer</field>

We're martyrs burned at their stake

They underestimate 
The willpower feeding my pride

Under the hand of persecution 
Defy the institution 
 
Their words just crucify 
Condemning truth that I seek

The pain, the havoc they wreak 
 
I never will conform 
My faith is deep to the core 
I stand against reform 
I'll never kneel down before

With raised fists of fire 
As they conspire 
I'll be defiant 
Against the alliance 
 
They will not eradicate me 
Break my will or suffocate me 
I will subjugate the hate 
That they breed 
 
As the church interrogates 
I cannot see they supplicate me 
Execute and ridicule 
We're all freed 
 
I never will conform 
My faith is deep to the core 
I stand against reform 
I'll never kneel down before

Trapped in the skies

Many years ago a boy was born 
A boy with a gift 
A gift that would be the envy of all mankind 
To see what no other could - great visions 
Of the future 
Or would a curse be bestowed on the boy 
The boy whose name was Nostradamus, 
Damus, damus, damus, damus, damus

Celestial comets 
Reign towards earth 
Alchemy's tempest 
Predicting your worth 
Pray for deliverance 
Escape if you can 
For I have borne witness 
To the purging of man</field>

Let tomorrow be the light you're made to herald in 
 
Like a master of the seven seas 
Your reputation's grown 
This eternal flame's been sown 
 
Praise for sacrifice that's done 
Well deserved you carried on 
Let your hearts be full 
For those heroes every one 
 
Restitution absolution with my battle cry 
Exoneration condemnation with my battle cry 
 
Battle cry 
Death defy 
Battle cry 
Battle cry</field>

And as I reach up to the sky 
The love will never die 
 
At last it's here 
The darkest sky begins to clear 
The final hour draws near 
 
But the voices are calling me 
Erasing the pain and the fear 
 
So lay me down 
Lay me to rest 
It's over now 'cause I know 
It's the beginning of the end 
 
And so we'll rise 
By the grace of God alone 
His words are carved in stone 
 
I'm never gone 
I'll always be within your heart 
Waiting's the worst part 
Now the voices are calling me 
Soothing me and easing the pain and the fear 
 
So lay me down 
Lay me to rest 
It's over now 'cause I know 
It's the beginning of the end 
 
And I see my life pass quickly by 
I am watching 
All these years we thought we were so wise 
They mean nothing 
 
Walk alone into the dying mist come alive for ever 
See the things we've never seen before 
Hand in hand together 
 
They galling rays are lighting up the open door 
We've all been waiting for 
All the voices are calling me 
Showing the path that is clear 
 
So lay me down 
Lay me to rest 
It's over now 'cause I know 
It's the beginning 
 
So lay me down 
Lay me to rest 
It's over now 'cause I know 
It's the beginning of the end</field>

Messes with your mind 
Pushing back the enemy 
Blind leads the blind 
 
World of smoking mirrors 
Leaves you in a daze 
Find your own solution 
Out of the maze 
 
Searing on the bible 
Hypocrites and fools 
Losing your religion 
Breaking all the rules

Surrounded by fools behind walls that are breached 
Beware of the jester that sings

If you live and die by the sword 
 
The whispers can't hide when the tongues are let loose 
Then hiding the truth is absurd 
A stab in the back or taste of the noose 
Is when action speaks louder than words

Always falling 
Tears of blood 
On holy ground 
Tears of blood 
Always falling 
 
We are weakened by your tears of blood 
 
Crying tears of blood 
Crying tears of blood

Man took his first moon ride 
Genius masterminds 
Conquered changing times 
And thought he'd done everything 
When he walked on the moon, they sang 
 
Here I am, down on earth 
And baby for all it's worth 
Meaning the world to me, lovin' you faithfully 
We got a better song to sing 
Let's make the love bells ring 
 
Wanna take you on a moonwalk baby 
Wanna take you on a magic carpet ride 
Forever my love, you'll be mine 
 
We can have a little moon talk baby 
About our future plans together 
In this life ole fashion love will make it right 
Computers on the rise 
Our feelings are synthesized 
Makes it hard to feel 
The touch of your love that's real 
 
We never take time to love 
We thing one love is not enough 
Million stars in the sky 
But one star that shines in my eyes, 
it's you 
 
Wanna take you on a moonwalk baby 
Wanna take you on a magic carpet ride 
Forever my love, you'll be mine 
 
We can have a little moon talk baby 
About our future plans together 
In this life ole fashion love will make it right 
 
We got a better song to sing 
Let's make the love bells ring 
Million stars in the sky 
But one star that shines in my eyes 
 
It's you, baby it's you 
Let's blast off up the moon.

I got shit to do right now, aight? 
This is for De La Soul, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Word up I got shit to do you test tube baby} 
 
Check one two, check one two 
De La Soul, is now back on the map 
Long Island, is now back on the map 
Good rap music, is now back on the map 
Yo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav 
And I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin' nowhere 
Old school is here to stay boy 
 
On the outskirts, of what works 
Live those who go for broke, and merk to get merked 
Live by the sword and die by the semi 
Not part of my ways, but stays right in my 
N Y mentality for me, to be the best 
The current, the ones who weren't 
Pressed, to confess lies over hot joints 
To sell to all who wanna hear some 
(Young Guns these days got fireproof eardrums) 
 
They don't give a shit who's hot 
Just long as you're not, pussy and be the would-be king 
But once crowned, the same wanna pull you down 
(And what makes the world go 'round) 
And I be the world renowned wonder why 
Wonderin' why you can't stand me? 
Is it because I'm the main Jackson? 
And y'all just Titos and Randys? Yes it is 
Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last 
 
At the same time, I want respect and cash 
And a few paragraphs in them books 
Tellin' you how us native tongues made hits with no hooks 
Rapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88 
No disrespect to Diddy, just settin' it straight 
Instead of zig-zaggin', got a degree in raggin' 
My daughter says I'm a teen, 'cause like a teen 
My pants always saggin' and I walk with a bop 
The sex part of my time, I walked from my pop 
No longer on timey and was never on loud 
But cooked rhymes that make the chefs of Wu proud 
I'm top cloud to rain on your show 
And still anything goes when it comes to hoes because

Had bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids 
Fix your playground player or 
Some kids'll come stomp in your sandbox 
Swollen hands cocked back 
No knives, no drama, no guns 
No disrespectin' your seed of Ma Dukes 
I puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff 
Of these fricaseed raps on Carribean riffs 
See last night's change was today's doe money 
No time for your freestyles so roll money 
No more whack albums with two joints 
No more ballplayin' rappers who shoot ya two points 
(No more G, 'cause I'm sick of your hip-hop!) 
 
Your flows bore like seashores with no bitches 
Switchhittin' niggaz will receive no pitches 
No diamonds on the field, just keep the game real 
Simple, see the God flows healthy 
Wealth in the mind is like money in the bank 
Exchange cash like thoughts in conversation 
Thank you for your purchases, we doe out 
And roll out the Kool-Aid, come and crop to see us pimp strut 
 
Ain't really pimpin', I'm tryin' to catch the bus 
The Krush Groove ain't got shit on Cold Crush 
We dolly dolly babies 'cause we shootin' cats 
'Back to the future' rap with Doc Brown shotgunnin' it 
And pantyhose your whole style and start runnin' it 
You dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello 
The mush in your room son, we stay portobello 
Can't settle for the same picket white fence 
I got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa 
Still push the truck with the factories pa 
I'm bound to wreck the whip and turn insurance out, make 'em shout

You know what I'm sayin' operation tech sensation in the nation 
Ready to take it to Penn station, you know what I'm sayin'

I mean it's simple, just be the best, you know what I'm sayin'? 
To be the best, the first, the only one in the game 
That's is gonna do it for years and years man 
It's like, you know, how you gonna say 
That I went out at the top of the game? 
The top of the game niggas, is the one that's producing 
Through out their career}

You the one girl, you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one 
 
See when we ride through, we let them see it from the side view 
Slow and even so you know no one denied you 
The parking lot look like these niggaz like to ride too 
They didn't win but I must admit they tried to 
Look like we talked up, when we walked up 
And when we walked in, money talk then 
The bar was bought then, we couldn't be caught then 
I see you looking lil' girl, let's go get lost then 
Every so often out on and off them (I wanna go shit and you know this) 
Well is there anyone else that you could go with 
Cool run it back OK, see if she'll play wit Pha 
 
You the one girl, you the one girl 
You the one girl, you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Put your finger in the air if you the one girl 
Raw, Raw, Raw, Raw-hide! 
 
'Bout ten mo minuets and I'm ready to ride 
I got ten mo bitches Imma fit up inside 
This suburban or Excursion or whatever I ride 
I bet it's chrome on the wire, vogue on the tire 
T.I.P. refer to me as your majesty or sire 
Higher then the rest, Italian drop dead fresh 
So much say what I feel with southern finesse 
So debonair if he dare bet he got best dressed 
Full length mink, gator belt gator vest including shoes 
A ten thousand dollar outfit bitch 
Yes, dude he dress to impress 
A bitch enough to make her want to give me her dress 
Blessed with the gift of gab to get gals 
Hot enough to hit they pals so get down 
You looking good enough to come give me a kiss now 
Get a room at the Swiss big as a beach house 
 
You the one girl, you the one girl 
You the one girl, you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one 
 
Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl 
You the one girl, you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one 
 
You're lookin nice. Hell, let's toast to the broken ice 
We've seen each other once and already we've spoken twice 
So stay or at the most a moment longer to hear me say 
I really did miss you the last time that you went away 
I'm serious, I must have you, I won't waste your time 
And have you wishin' that somehow you could replace the time 
I don't do any magic tricks to try and make the mind 
I just convinced that the reality is that you have to race the time 
She said "You a playa ain't you, could have what you want can't you" 
I replied that I'm also an artist baby I could paint you 
In the frame and I don't try hard to not be the same 
So she knew she was gon' come before she came 
 
You the one girl, you the one girl 
You the one girl, you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one 
 
Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl 
You the one girl, you the one girl 
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl 
Raw, Raw, Raw, Raw-hide!(Girl did you know that ahh...) 
 
It's our privilege, to have had this conversation 
It's our privilege, and to have had this relation 
It's our privilege, I been searching all evening 
For somebody who can and finally sent me the one 
It's our privilege, to have made you laugh 
It's our privilege, and to have crossed your path 
It's our privilege, your the star yes you are 
Can have your autograph cuz you lookin like the one 
It's our privilege, to have seen your face 
It's our privilege, and I bet you taste so good, let's get one thing understood 
I'll be good yes I would, especially for the one 
It's our privilege, let have a head-on collision 
It's our privilege, girl you made the right decision 
It's our privilege, (laughing)

A few short words, and whaddya know? 
Oh, whaddya know? He comes 
 
Down, like water, fresh out the clouds clown 
Drown you like terrible weather 
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon 
Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin' 
 
To all, rise and shine, give God the glory 
I already give a percent of mine to Bert and Cory 
And still got bills and employees to pay 
So excuse me Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days 
 
My ways of control is hard to swallow 
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind 
Sorry to disappoint, but dis joint's mine 
Display your indie but say no 
 
More or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo 
To the dirt and edit the clip and lost Kano 
My mens wear problems like Timbs 
See it all in they face, ask Mase, he got wars to win 
 
Scores to settle, crews to crush 
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile 
It's Long Isle y'all, longevity sustainin' my celebrity status 
From AM to PM, you see him on file y'all 
 
I was told to step righteous, so when it's done 
Everyone will say I stepped right 
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop 
shinin' his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light 
 
[Incomprehensible] 
A few short words, and whaddya know? 
Oh, whaddya know? He comes 
 
Aiyyo, I'm up against these walls, here's my back stiff straight up 
Dazzle and razzlin' broads like I'm little Juan Magic 
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop 
Top drama every time these commas don't drop 
 
Pop spots like lint on your shirt, the net worth 
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball 
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six 
I circumcise the track, you just a dick 
 
Overlapped and hooded 
Skin repeated like Stutterin' John 
I repeat like yesterday, it don't stop 
George of this poor life pop, put to Scarlet 
In a place she believes, much better than your lies 
 
She say she lookin' better in my eyes, bullshit 
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin' to fuck 
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby 
I tried to speak my piece in court but Judge Mills paused me 
 
Bifocusedly die hopeless sometimes 
Yo cry your poker face, you oughta try it one time 
When God is an non pos', you stand to download 
Demanded like slaves on trial, we want free 
 
Man cock aim ready, it's time you MC 
So you rappers bust bee-bee guns, graffiti runs 
Through my veins since cable with the wired remote 
Woodgrainin' like you wired his float 
 
C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul 
We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old 
Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow 
A group of kids so original, you heard? 
 
C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul 
We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old 
Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow 
A group of kids so original 
 
Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners who got 'em 
We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew, and his whack dancers 
Bitin' is forbidden pah, pay that tax 
And don't you ever look at us funny, boy, we'll bring rap back 
 
And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men 
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in 
For you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn 
Hula hoop all bitches crew full with brand new Keds 
 
Cutmaster kill 'em, make sure we cut classics 
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets 
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the PA 
And just lay whooptay, whooptay? 
 
Use the ruse, sport beads and snatch a dude's toupee 
Since tunin' into T-La Rock'n AJ 
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed like a glass of OJ 
Girls you can go cruising' in my OJ

Turns me all over  
Like a first time lover's woo  
 
My heart's, your heart,  
And every time you hit that door  
There's a chance in a million  
I won't see you anymore  
 
Though I never want to leave your side  
But we've got to realize we're  
 
Here today and gone tomorrow  
Nothing lasts forever and a day  
(Nothing ever lasts forever)  
Here today, and gone tomorrow  
This is too good to be real,  
And I never want to say good-bye  
 
I reminisce and savor  
Every kiss  
Every moment  
For in a moment we are gone  
 
Cherish you and when  
The night is through  
Starting all over,  
Spending it with you  
 
It's so precious in the time we spend  
'Cause when it all comes to an end we're  
 
Here today and gone tomorrow  
Nothing lasts forever and a day  
Here today, and gone tomorrow  
Your love is too good to be true  
And I never want to say good-bye  
 
And when I look into your eyes  
I thank God that I'm alive  
I can never say I've missed  
All of the reasons we're  
Here today and gone tomorrow  
 
Here today and gone tomorrow  
Nothing lasts forever and a day  
Here today, and gone tomorrow  
Your love is too good to be true  
And I never want to say good-bye</field>

The street in the dead of night  
She's been laid off  
And her kids must eat  
And his money's right  
 
A world away beneath the sun  
The earth goes dry  
A hungry starving people search  
For food as their babies die

When we meet them all at their need  
We can touch them where they are  
Help them to believe, touch the world  
 
He's on the pipe and he's got the shakes  
As he takes a puff  
Their badges shine and there's no escape  
As they lock him up  
 
Fourteen years old and without love  
The girl is livin' wild  
How can it be a four month pregnancy  
And she's the child

The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. 
 
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes, 
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes. 
I love you, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky, 
And stay by my side until morning is nigh. 
 
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask you to stay 
Close by me for ever, and love me, I pray.

Was to certain poor shepards in fields as they lay: 
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep 
On a cold winter's night that was so deep. 
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
Born is the King of Israel. 
 
They looked up and saw a star, 
Shining in the east, beyond them far: 
And to the earth it gave great light, 
And so it continued both day and night. 
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
Born is the King of Israel. 
 
And by the light of that same star 
Three wise men came from the country far; 
To seek for a King was their intent, 
And to follow the star wherever it went. 
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
Born is the King of Israel. 
 
This star drew nigh to the north-west; 
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest, 
And there it did both stop and stay, 
Right over the place where Jesus lay. 
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
Born is the King of Israel. 
 
Then entered in those wise men three, 
Fell reverently upon their knee, 
And offered there in his presence 
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. 
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
Born is the kind of Israel. 
 
Then let us all with one accord 
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord, 
That hath made heaven and earth of nought, 
And with his blood mankind has bought. 
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
Born is the King of Israel.</field>

Far as the curse is found.

And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two  
Birds of a feather would be  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you 
There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray  
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop  
Pop! Pop! Pop!  
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie

Haste, haste to bring him laud,

Good Christian, fear: for sinners here

We'll conspire 
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid 
The plans that we've made 
Walking in a winter wonderland 
 
In the meadow we can build a snowman 
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman 
Until the all the kids knock him down

Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play

The perfect breath where my mind lay beside me 
And all I knew is what had overtaken me 
With no explanation 
I am comforted by my inability to understand 
When I wake from this dream will you still be here? 
Will your smile still open my heart 
And leave me transparent?</field>

I still chase the wind

But how can I call it unfaithful 
Every promise was fulfilled 
As decay crawled from it's throat 
Like the dead rising from an open grave 
Lips of splendor and tongue of deceit 
All dying now as our fragile wrists hold only waste 
 
Like those gasping for their last breath 
We cannot hide there's nothing left 
 
If All my sorrow has led me here 
Then I would cry all of my tears 
To have this chance again 
And know there's more than this 
And know there's more than you 
 
Like those gasping for their last breath 
We cannot hide there's nothing left</field>

Hopeless wave crashed upon another 
While my thoughts ran to the hills 
My heart never, never reached the sea 
 
With only delusions 
Of an endless, endless journey 
I am left with an ocean 
Between you and me 
 
An ocean between

We speak of fighting to resist this world 
But what about the battle within us? 
If we have chosen to live against the grain 
Then why are we all facing the same way? 
 
There is no difference between us and them

We've focused so long on ideals of freedom  
That it is this very belief that oppresses us. 
We all want to be free, yet we find ways to forfeit liberty 
To our own impulses, to our own consumption. 
  
So I say it's worth it to build a new foundation, a new foundation, 
A new foundation, a new foundation, it's a past we cannot escape. 
  
This vacancy will take everything this world can offer. 
But what is control once we have let go of all we suffer?  
Once we've let go 
  
Yeah, when we've awakened to admit we are all enslaved, 
Then there is freedom in our choice to disobey, yeah 
Our creeds have become a justification (justification)  
To live the way that some see fit, 
(Justification) and no one is more hopeless  
Than those blinded by the scales of content.

Traditions started with useful intention 
Now Subjugate those too numb to question 
 
We are lost but keep moving forward

If you have done all that you can

To change the world around you 
Even if your voice is taken away 
Such actions will still inspire

            <field name="lyrics">I fought who I am inside 
Until I wanted, I wanted to die 
Instead of finding balance I found hatred 
Consumed by failures and ignoring my own strengths 
Pushed out to sea without learning to swim 
Or stranded in the desert with no lungs to breathe 
 
With no lungs to breathe 
I had almost lost everything 
 
How can I be expected to readily be content 
With a view of life that has rejected 
The basis of what has helped me to survive? 
And replaced them with precepts 
Rather than instruction 
Full rule is an illusion (illusion) 
All I can do is contain selfishness 
And unveil what little power we may have 
 
With no lungs to breathe 
I had almost lost everything (everything) 
 
Tearing away my flesh before taking 
The time to understand it 
A miracle may not be the answer 
(tearing away my flesh) 
When anchoring first on what I have 
(before taking the time to understand it) 
The ability to change 
 
Like being stranded in the desert 
With no lungs to breathe 
 
With no lungs to breathe 
I had almost lost everything (everything)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">All these moments of pain 
Must add up to something 
Our bodies have been trained to keep it all in 
But our hearts still hold on 
 
Some say to release it, forget about your past 
Instead we count the cost, it's part of us 
That doesn't mean that we cannot move on 
It's just a memory of what we once were 
 
No matter what it is we've faced 
It's now part of us (part of us) 
We can overcome 
 
Why rid of fuel that can make us stronger 
When properly put behind us? (put behind us) 
And in the same way that 
Everything good in life can be taken away 
So can all this pain 
 
No matter what it is we've faced 
It's now part of us (part of us) 
No matter what we've faced in this life 
We can overcome 
 
Trying to forget is a burden we can never bear 
When facing trials openly 
There's nothing left to hide 
New paths of strength come alive 
 
We can overcome 
 
No matter what it is we've faced 
It's now part of us (part of us) 
No matter what we've faced in this life 
We can overcome</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Your resilience inspires me 
Facing tragedies I will never face 
Your presence is humbling 
To think of all that you have overcome 
It took such little pain 
For our lives to coalesce 
Finding what I could've found in no one else 
 
You bring me through the darkness of myself 
And show me that frailty can be turned to strength 
 
Suffering 
Persistence 
Such sorrow 
Yet resilience 
 
From the outside I've deceived the world 
With false bravery 
Yet you have taught me so much more 
Much more than I can ever teach 
And someday you might 
Need someone to lean on 
 
I can only hope that I'll have gained the courage 
To be there for you in whatever you face 
You bring me trough (you bring me through) 
The darkness of myself 
And show me that frailty (can be turned) 
Can be turned to strength 
 
Suffering 
Persistence 
Such sorrow 
Yet resilience 
 
At times I'm carried on the shoulders of a child 
I find power in your firm fallibility 
My source of hope is seeing that weak prevail 
And I'm better able to live because you're alive 
I could not imagine a world without you 
Where I looked you in the eyes and left you to die

Persistence 
Such sorrow 
Yet resilience</field>

            <field name="lyrics">The storm is coming and I have a choice 
To accept nature or lose my voice 
Shall I scream and plead for nothing 
Or build a roof over my head? 
I mourn the days that I wasted 
Trying to change what has been set 
Fighting against myself 
 
Before I tear, tear out my eyes 
I'll just admit they're part of me 
 
I've labelled enemies who do not hate me 
And then claims friends who could care less 
All an unnecessary struggle 
So now I know what it means to repent 
Changing everything 
 
Before I tear, tear out my eyes 
I'll just admit they're part of me (they're part of me) 
 
Instead of fighting against myself 
I will open my eyes 
To find who needs me 
I am awakened 
I am awakened 
 
Before I tear, tear out my eyes 
I'll just admit they're part of me (they're part of me) 
I am awakened</field>

            <field name="lyrics">There are days when sorrow seems never-ending 
Like the countless roads upon which I've driven 
The price of attachment in pursuit of dreams 
That I so often can't seem to remember 
Yet there are days when beauty cannot be contained 
It even crawls out from under ordinary things 
 
A foreigner, no place to go 
Holding on, making the most 
Of what little time I have 
 
All the wasted words I said 
In all the cities that I left 
The last act of our precious play 
Must not close with regret 
 
I will not leave wishing I had done things differently 
 
The moments I treasure are seldom the ones 
That I planned for 
And if I knew where pain hid I might still let it go 
So when the audience has run toward the latest drift 
It will be my time to face the life that I have set 
 
A foreigner in my own home 
Holding on, no place to go 
 
All the wasted words I said 
In all the cities that I left 
The last act of our precious play 
Must not close with regret (regret) 
All the wasted words 
 
Some days the line between peace 
And pain seems more like a blur 
But I know with certainty 
I can't leave wishing, I cannot leave 
I can't leave wishing I'd done things differently 
 
All the wasted words I said 
In all the cities that I left 
The last act of our precious play 
Must not close with regret (regret)

The subtle contradiction 
Compromise creeps in 
Forgetting who I once was 
Slowly changing 
Who I once was 
 
Each moment seemed so small 
When looked at by itself 
But it adds up 
And it has torn me down 
All lines are gone (whispering silence) 
 
Whispering silence

Compromise creeps in 
Forgetting who I once was 
Slowly changing 
Who I once was 
 
So close the truth 
But still impossible 
 
It was never one thing 
And too many to try to add up 
Fueled by faint deception 
Conflict without acknowledging opposition 
 
All because I had taken pride in my hidden lies

unraveled the tangles of my heart 
all i felt was stale hollow air 
these streams of uncertainty 
they are collapsing upon my mind 
upon my mind 
yeah 
torrents fill my veins until i burst 
with mistaken guilt and shame 
my battered bones 
try to keep fighting 
against the endless ocean of self defeat 
as time goes on 
some months are yet to pass 
as time goes on 
some months are yet to pass 
as time goes on 
some months are yet to pass 
are yet to pass 
let's go 
puddle puddles of ink 
surround this tired chair 
all of my sorrow has been spilled 
into into my reflection

Oooh  baby  I like the sound when  
 
The switch is on  and you start poundin'  
 
Out my radio and pretty soon  
 
Salt and Pepa will boom into the room  
 
 
 
Clap your hands now people  clap hard  
 
Clap your hands now people  clap your hands  
 
Clap your hands now people  stomp your feet  
 
Clap your hands now people  clap with me  
 
 
 
Listen hard and tell me what you hear  
 
Is it noise or is it def beats in your ear?  
 
You said you want one, and now you got some  
 
Vicious snare, high hats, and a bass drum  
 
First the mix empress to impress you  
 
Cutting right on time and I'll bet you  
 
Didn't know it (did you?), you can't believe it (could you?)  
 
Word to life, I swear, we wouldn't kid you  
 
And she can cut it up like a wild animal  
 
Slicing and dicing away as a cannibal does  
 
'cause only a beauty can make you people clap with me  
 
 
 
Who is the best?  
 
We are the best!  
 
Who's one of the best?  
 
 
You're one of the best!  
 
 
 
Why am I so def? Why don't I have flaws?  
 
Why do I cut for Salt and Pepa? Because  
 
When my turntable talks your body will listen  
 
To a message ??? tested and kickin'  
 
Out of my speakers and into your sneakers  
 
Providing conversation for the woofers and tweeters  
 
When I play the Technics obey  
 
'cause I'm a fader translator, a mixboard slave  
 
And I'm-a do like this on 'em...this on 'em  
 
 
 
When I'm on the floor, beat is like romance  
 
The rhythm makes love to me as I dance  
 
And from what I see it's about to be  
 
A relationship between beauty and the beat  
 
Word up y'all, it's a royal ball  
 
Turn hip-hop clubs into concert halls  
 
Inside is live, if I use up highs  
 
Twelve hundred ????  
 
Power in high drive, the woofers don't lie  
 
Opposites attract so the birthrate's high  
 
Your chest and ribcage the bass is poking at  
 
(Lower the what?) Stop joking...  
 
We can't do that it possess power  
 
You ask how-a people get louder  
 
 
 
[Uh, step aside, sir....  
 
Sir, will you please step aside for the....]  
 
Salt and Pepa MC's represent beauty  
 
We want y'all to see why we're the only  
 
Nominee nominated representing our race  
 
This jam is dedicated to all the pretty faces  
 
And we're gonna rock like you like  
 
Spinderella on the mix, Salt and Pepa on the mike  
 
And we can satisfy your desire  
 
We can make your body perspire  
 
Make the men all want to get with it  
 
Then take 'em down to the ultimate  
 
Sounds and I say: Spinderella's not a fella  
 
But a girl DJ!

Dissin' all of the opposition  
MCs  it's my butt you're kissin'  
Because I desire  
 
Yo  wait a minute  chill  I want ya all to hear  
Why rap is not a joke  for us it's a career  
Others try to imitate but none has come near  
So you see why everybody stands up and cheer  
And if you really think about it you know what it means  
To be a female rapper from the heart of Queens  
And see others dream about being supreme  
But once on the scene we start killing kings  
People claim we're too wild to tame  
On stage we behave like sizzlin' flame  
And oh, so cool when we rap you need a sweater  
The rhymes so tough you swear they're made of leather  
Get the best of your bunch, and I bet that we're better  
Tell 'em why, Pepa, tell 'em why - 'cause I desire  
 
DJs come and go just like the wind  
But mine is better than all of them  
She's sharper than a razor when it comes to a cut  
More lethal than a laser if you want to play rough  
Not the object of a show, subject to cut ????  
????? tell you Spinderella's dope  
 
Call her Spin for short but she don't take ????  
want to duel? You're a fool ????  
Choppin' beats for these until the turntables bleed  
Scratches so damn hard you'd swear the mixer had fleas  
She's the mutilator, music carnivore  
Spinderella rocks the records with a chainsaw  
You're still amazed by the way she plays  
Not a fad but a phase of the hip-hop craze which I desire  
 
Salt from the Pepa and my name is Cher  
From Queens, New York not Delaware  
I like my steak well-done 'cause I hate it rare  
And I'm lovable and huggable like Yogi the Bear  
 
Pepa from the Salt so do not rip  
'Cause if you do I'll shift from first to fifth  
Lights out, it's heard, I thought you were dead  
Short, fading went I went upside your head  
So get back to the beat 'cause the beat is bad  
The beat pro and the bass gets much impact  
The beats rock and just because the beat kicks bass  
We're gonna bounce this beat all over the place 'cause I desire  
 
While you're on the set let the cameras roll  
Salt and Pepa are the stars, the world's the video  
Your room is boomin' when we're on your stereo  
So hold on tight, don't dare let go  
We're the teachers, you're the students - class is in session  
 
Pay attention boys and girls, and learn your lesson  
We're running things, yes, we're taking over  
You be the grass, we'll be the lawnmower  
Never fakin' or takin', not givin' no slack  
Not trying, succeeding 'cause it's like that  
Hot damn, how could you be so doggone dumb?  
Trying to dis Salt and Pepa when we're number one?  
But we excuse you 'cause you're dippy, your mind's in a daze  
Like every duck you're confused in so many ways  
Giving nothing, taking all whether big or small  
 
We got a ? beat and it's dope, def y'all  
Every day of the week you're at my beck and call  
You want to try me out? You don't have the gall 'cause I desire</field>

My mic sound nice, check two 
My mic sound nice, check three 
 
Are you ready 
To rock y'all, to the beat y'all? 
A-keep on and you don't stop 
Rockin' on, keep rockin' on 
 
I'm the queen on the mic and it's true when I say that 
The Pepa MC is here to stay and you know 
If I was a book I would sell 
'Cause every curve on my body got a story to tell, yeah 
Word 'em up, w-word 'em up 'cause 
I'm so fly, nobody can deny 
The girl hasn't been born that can deal with I 
Me, Sandy D., undoubtably def 
Don't need to be dressed, I'm fresh to the flesh 
Yes, so tough you know it is a must 
Now Salt, get on the mic, and tell 'em why you go crush 
 
'Cause I'm oh-aye, I'm on, I'm on 
Yes I'm oh-aye, I'm so damn on 
Like a grasshopper hoppin' on the morning lawn 
Like a needle on a record when it plays a song 
Like Little Boy Blue blowin' on his horn 
And you know I got to be on 
Mcs rockin' and shockin', but it won't last 
Salt's on the mic, and I'm kickin', ask 
Me no questions, I'll tell no lies 
It's just a little warning, a word to the wise 
You been hopin' and scopin', layin' and prayin' 
But on the bottom is where you're staying 
 
You're wack, I thought you understood 
You're not related to me so you could never be good 
I know you come from Babylon (And you know why?) 
'Cause you're a Babble-On MC (That's right) 
You babble on the microphone about what you wish 
But could never be, so please 
Don't tell me how you're gonna rock 
Don't brag about the things that you ain't got 
Don't feed me lies 'cause now I'm full 
My cow just died, I don't need your bull 
 
Yo, yo, turn my mic up a little bit 
One, two, one, two, alright, thanks 
 
My mic sound nice, check one 
My mic sound nice, check two 
My mic sound nice, check three 
 
Right about now as you can see 
In the place to be 
We're not talking about geometry 
History or biology 
So Sandy D. explained it to me 
Why do they call you the Pepa MC? 
You mean you don't know? Uh-uh that's a shame 
OK Salt, let me explain 
 
I'm hot like a fire, burned down, diminished 
Oh, now I see! Chill, let me finish 
I wanna make one and all understand 
I don't play, I slay when the mic's in my hand 
The room temperature reaches a hundred and four 
You can scramble eggs on the floor 
The pressure soars, the crowd, they roar 
Sweat will drip down to your drawers 
The Pepa MC is like hot ice 
And I paid the price to make the mic sound nice 
 
Forget about the rest, yes, I don't jest 
You're blessed with one of America's best 
So I think y'all better count your blessings 
When Salt's in the house, hell's in session 
It's a fact that I will wax 
Mcs out there are gonna get taxed 
Rockin' to my funky beat 
I'm a trip so I know you're gonna fall for me 
'Cause this is the year all men fear 
Female MCs is movin' up here 
Salt and Pepa is strictly biz 
You know the color of this, you know what time it is 
"Super" is the strength of the boomin' bass 
"Nature" describes our pretty face 
Turning out without a doubt 
Make no mistake, Queens is in the house 
Yeah, check it out 
Ch-check it out</field>

Lend us your ears and eyes  
 
 
 
The Showstopper is stupid fresh  
 
 
 
When will you be satisfied?]  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yo  bust it Sandy D.  
 
 
 
Yo  what's up?  
 
 
 
Have you ever been to jams when people just stand  
 
 
 
And they pay to come in  and they don't even dance?  
 
 
 
They're so uncouth they think they're cute  
 
 
 
Am I lying? No  it's the truth  
 
 
 
Right now I'm gonna show you how it's supposed to be  
 
 
 
'cause we, the Salt and Pepa MCs  
 
 
 
Will chance the circumstance rocks your pants  
 
 
 
My fans, this is called the jam  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sandy...What?...Sandy...What?  
 
 
 
Sandy, we'll be breaking hearts, ya know  
 
 
 
That's true, it's all about money though  
 
 
 
But Douglas and Richie won't like it (So?)  
 
 
 
Come on then, let's stop the show  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yo, this beat is stupid fresh  
 
 
 
Huh, yeah, you know it, cold dissed Doug Fresh  
 
 
 
Top choice, of course, the rest is soft  
 
 
 
Set it off, do it Set it off, do it  
 
 
 
Set it off, do it Set it off, do it  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Listen now, I ain't down to rap  
 
 
 
Are you serious? Just like a heart attack  
 
 
 
Come on now, Cher! I don't want to  
 
 
 
Get on now, Cher! Do I have to? Yeah!  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Well I really don't have too much to say  
 
 
 
Yo, then here's my story anyway  
 
 
 
It's just a little somethin' too hot to be missed, girl  
 
 
 
I was going downtown (???), serious  
 
 
 
Cher took the train home from work  
 
 
 
Pissed off because of a stain on my shirt  
 
 
 
The train made a stop (Where?) Two hundred and five  
 
 
 
And a little soft guy walked inside  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
He wore plastic Bally's and a booty Gucci suit  
 
 
 
Cracked a little smile and showed a fake gold tooth  
 
 
 
Was he cute? Negative, he was a dupe  
 
 
 
Instead of Polo he wore ????  
 
 
 
La-di-da-di What?  
 
 
 
La-di-da-di Uh-huh, word to mother  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The boy was rude, I didn't approve  
 
 
 
He tried to make a move I said, "Stop it, dude!"  
 
 
 
I started to cuss and began to swear  
 
 
 
He said, "Listen girl, I like the way you comb your hair  
 
 
 
And I like the stylish clothes you wear  
 
 
 
Is there something that I can do  
 
 
 
To show how much I really care?  
 
 
 
Like when I'm all alone with you  
 
 
 
My heart just skips a beat or two  
 
 
 
And you put that fire inside of me  
 
 
 
That shows it's more than just a dream  
 
 
 
And I like it, and I like it"  
 
 
 
I said, "Please, don't get excited!"  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Don't you know I'm too young for you, mister?  
 
 
 
Sally from the Valley - she's my sister  
 
 
 
And that lady you dissed - that was my mother  
 
 
 
You hurt two of my family, you won't get another  
 
 
 
He tried to deny it, said it was a lie  
 
 
 
He wanted to explain, explain to me why  
 
 
 
I said, "Don't bother, there's really no need  
 
 
 
Sally died when she hit the concrete"  
 
 
 
He said, "Come on, you're puttin' me on"  
 
 
 
As I got up to walk he sang this song:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Oh, baby please don't go  
 
 
 
What must I do to show  
 
 
 
The way I feel for you, girl  
 
 
 
Is going to be real?  
 
 
 
But in reality, I know we'll never be  
 
 
 
'cause you're still walking away from me"

So listen close to what I say 
Don't take this a simple rhyme 
'Cause this type of thing happens all the time 
Now what would you do if a stranger said hi? 
Would you dis him or would you reply? 
If you answer there is a chance 
That you'd become a victim of circumstance 
Am I right, fellas? Tell the truth 
Or else I'm-a have to show and prove 
You are what you are, I am what I am 
It just so happens that most men are 
 
Tramp (What'd ya call me?) 
 
Have you ever seen a dude who's stupid and rude? 
Whenever he's around he dogs your mood 
I know a guy like that, girl 
He thinks he's God's gift to the world 
You know that kind, excited all the time 
With nothing but sex on the mind 
I'm no stunt, on me he can't front 
I know the real deal, I know what they want 
It's me (Why?) Because I'm so sexy 
It's me (What?) Don't touch my body! (Boy!) 
'Cause you see I ain't no skeezer 
But on a real tip I think he's a 
 
Tramp (What'd ya call me?) 
 
On the first date he thought I was a dummy 
He had the nerve to tell me he loved me 
But of course, I knew it was a lie, y'all 
He undressed me with his eyeballs 
Trying to change the whole subject 
'Cause everything he said pertained to sex 
So I dissed him, I said, "You's a sucker! 
Get your dirty mind out the gutter 
You ain't gettin' paid, you ain't knockin' boots 
You ain't treating me like no prostitute" 
Then I walked away, he called me a teaser 
You're on a mission, kid yo, he's a

The mic will sing soon as I touch it 
Do this smooth and easy like 
So we might get hyped in here tonight 
Be nice, relax, MC's further back 
If you ain't with that, I'm-a have to attack you with a bad rap 
That can smack the smile off your face Jack 
So don't start no crap 
Givin' a little bit of heart and soul 
As we do it to you in your earhole 
Huh, I ain't going out like a sucker 
And if you think so, boy, then pucker up 
And kiss the butt of this lyricist 
Blow on the mic and make a wish 
This groove is set to soothe and move you 
Party people now it's time to 
 
Get up 
I think the sound will make you (get up) 
Word up, I swear you got to (get up) 
Everybody get up 
Get up 
Everybody get up 
Get up 
Everybody get up 
 
Spinderella my DJ's a turntable trooper 
My partner Pepa she's a power booster 
Word to life, I swear, she'll seduce ya 
Don't take my word, I'll introduce her 
I don't need no introduction, I just bust in 
Grab a microphone and then start dustin' 
So-called lyricists can never deal with this 
Swift-lipped vocalists either and also if 
I was a mute, I'd still knock boots 
Put up your dukes, troop, and I'm-a play ya like a flute 
To show you all on me you can't sleep on 
Spinderella, please drop some beats on 
This crowd, pump it up loud 
Gimme a scratch, OK now 
It's time for hell to be raised 
As I kick some lyrics on the beats Hurb made 
Salt's at my side with a shotgun 
A little action? I just had some 
Wicked I say, the girl don't play 
Gonna skip town on Judgement Day 
So don't just sit there like a poo-putt stupid 
The record's called "Get Up", I think you better do it 
 
Get up 
Everybody get up 
Get up 
Everybody get up 
Get up 
Everybody get up 
 
Salty that's me flippin' on MCs 
I'm not gonna waste your time on the strength, I'll be 
Def, dumb, dope, completely phenominal 
You didn't know? Yeah, right, come on now 
Oh, I'm supposed to believe E-M-C-E-E's 
Are glad Salt is makin' G's? 
Save that crap, I got my public to rap to 
Tried to play me out, I ought to slap you, punk 
For being disrespectful 
I grip the microphone like a pitbull terrier 
Yes, but I'm scarier 
Under a ton of rhymes I'll bury ya 
Hyped like a poet, on the mic I'll show it 
Do-re-mi fa-so-la ti-do it 
Jazz, rhythm, blues, soul, pop, rock 'n roll, even hip-hop 
Lovers, are my brothers and sisters 
All in all over ten billion listeners 
Lend me your ear when you want to hear 
The hypest and ripest sound of the year 
 
Get up 
Everybody get up 
Get up 
Everybody get up 
Get up 
Everybody get up 
Get up 
Get up 
Get up

I'd like you to meet my mic  last name is phone  
This is my house make yourself at home  
Now see those chairs? Please just ignore them  
Believe me  they'll be no need for them  
I got a rhyme  and I'd like to exploit it  
You came in here so you cannot avoid it  
This beat is hard  it's as hard as atomic energy  
Thinkin' as long as we're rhymin' to it  
And it's addictive like smoking  
Word to the parents, see, I'm not jokin'  
You'd be a thief only this life is harmless  
Couldn't kick the habit if you tried your darndest  
So don't fight it, don't fear it  
Just take your hands, applause and cheer it  
I gave you more than you ever expected  
And when I did then you gave me respect  
With your support we're reachin' new heights  
Salt and Pepa's insanely hyped on the mic  
 
My supporters are massive, my sound is passive  
If I was you, I'd take time to ask if  
Others you've heard really deserve to be ranked as the best  
Great or supurb, to be or not to be, that's a good question  
How good they used to be, well I give less than a damn  
'cause the present day counts if you can't rock a tone  
I suggest you just count  
I said please, but it's not like I'm pleadin'  
So don't get supe, peasant, stop speedin'  
'cause I'm about to rain, and when I rain I don't drizzle  
It's gettin' hot in here, we're gonna sizzle  
See, I understand that you had the dishes  
But if it's too hot, get out of the kitchen  
'cause frauds and fakes are the ones I don't like  
And they are the ones that get me hyped on the mic  
 
I'm gonna play you for keeps, got a system in my teeth  
Outside on the street people heard all of the beats  
That I rapped or mastered so throw the wax on  
Pepa is that strong, they can hear the last song  
First class status, I'm a blessed event  
God rocked the full-size for my silhoutte  
Yes, solo this woman, rise all before me  
??? jump on it  
Don't try to be 'cause I will protest  
Oh yes, I have an uzi I've been dyin' to test  
Livin' larger than life but to be precise  
I'm Pepa, much deffer when I'm crazy hyped on the mic  
 
We're gonna break it down to you how it should be broke  
Rhymes written not ? and how it should be wrote  
People jammin' not standin' and what you hope  
A show funky not junky, you say rhymes are dope  
??? he'd be madly hyped  
Spinderella had to tell him, "Boy, you ain't my type"  
Get away from her, I tell you before she gets pissed  
She's got a left with a cut, and it'll go like this  
 
Started wheelin' doin' wheelies, but you were a big wheel  
Started dealin' like a dealer, but you just couldn't deal  
As you flip like a freak the whole world just flopped  
Couldn't rock like a rocker so you just got rocked  
I'm the defest gettin' deffer and ought to be kept  
Take a breath between rhymes with a bet, tell 'em Pep  
Or let's kick it like a kicker, the rhymes I kick  
Like a sticker gets stuck to your butt I'll stick  
When the hype is gettin' hyper, when the hip-hop's hype  
Salt and Pepa, that's right, you know we're hyped on the mic

I went to a party the other day around the way  
 
 
 
With my partner  her name P E P A  
 
 
 
We were dressed to kill  ready and willin' to make a killin'  
 
 
 
Met Spinderella at the door, what was she doin' Salt? Chillin'  
 
 
 
We walked inside a man asked the three for ID  
 
 
 
When he found out who we was he said, "Go ahead girls, y'all can go in free  
 
 
 
The drinks are on the house, anything you want is yours"  
 
 
 
Then he gave us the keys to the V.I.P. doors

I'd like to have it like this for the rest of my life  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chillin' at the bar drinking Moet and caviar  
 
 
 
People pointin' at us 'cause they know who we are  
 
 
 
Word had gotten around that S-N-P was in the place  
 
 
 
Now they gathered around to get a little taste  
 
 
 
"Yo, please, baby, please, I want to hear you MC"  
 
 
 
Is what this guy and his friend had said to Pepa and me  
 
 
 
Although we tried to resist, but then I said, "Hey, what's the use?  
 
 
 
One song won't hurt, and besides, his friend is cute"  
 
 
 
Spindy got on a set, handed a mic to me and Pep  
 
 
 
Then we started to rhyme, and I'm sure you know the rest  
 
 
 
They said...  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It feels good when people are on it, don't it? You know it does  
 
 
 
Being treated like a queen on any scene just like we was  
 
 
 
Call it juice, call it jocks, whatever it is I know it rocks  
 
 
 
Till you sweat me and expect me to like it a lot  
 
 
 
And say...  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[Yo, what are you doin'?  
 
 
 
Put the beat back on

Yeah, boy, you know...you know we need some (bass!)  
 
 
 
Yeah, it's chill now

Never ever no static, beats will come out clear

            <field name="lyrics">Pep had to step  she'll be back in a sec  
But in the meantime  I like to have sound check  
 
One two's what I say as the record gets played  
 
 
For a little bit to make sure it stays on track  
 
 
 
The wax can't be scratched unless Spin is there  
 
 
 
So she can catch it on time so then I can rhyme  
 
 
 
The vocalist on the mic is me  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I'm the short and sexy one in effect  
 
 
 
About to bring it to you straight up, wait up  
 
 
 
You ready? Huh, it's time to pay up  
 
 
 
The capital S gonna spot  
 
 
 
I'm here to wreck shop [Salt, where's Pepa?]  
 
 
 
Yo, she's at the next stop  
 
 
 
So all aboard, grab a seat and get set  
 
 
 
Spinderella, start it up, now let's check  
 
 
 
Overdrive, rhyme after rhyme, I'm still the best  
 
 
 
I'm holdin' down camp keepin' punks in check  
 
 
 
So snap out of it, me the soloist for what?  
 
 
 
Salt and Pepa with mics, Spinderella with cuts  
 
 
 
Let's get paid, get paid  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yeah, comin' in and goin' in, growin' in and throwin' in  
 
 
 
We got the flavor, and everyday we're showin' it  
 
 
 
So just stay back 'cause Salt ain't takin' no fronts  
 
 
 
'cause I'm dope, I look good, and I'm paid to be blunt  
 
 
 
Reigning supreme, all hail the queens from Queens  
 
 
 
You think it's def now? Wait till Pepa steps on the scene  
 
 
 
So petty rappers take a seat, make sure you sit up straight  
 
 
 
The name Salt and Pepa, the year '88  
 
 
 
Let's get paid, get paid  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Doin' the chores on behalf of my partner  
 
 
 
Like money in the bank so thanks, now I'm a spark of the ashes  
 
 
 
Strike the match, light the fuse  
 
 
 
Spinderella, me, and Pep singing the Get Paid blues  
 
 
 
To the petty I'm like a machete making confetti  
 
 
 
'cause you don't see Pepa, punk, step up, you still ain't ready  
 
 
 
You want a piece of what the Salt releases?  
 
 
 
Take a chunk, punk, and now you're leaving in pieces  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step left, jet poo-putt-putt in your Nova  
 
 
 
Before you thought, think again, you won't get over  
 
 
 
With a clover, four-leaf, chief, to be brief  
 
 
 
Yo, Pepa hurry up and come and get a piece of this mic  
 
 
 
'cause I'm hoggin' it, Holmes start loggin' it  
 
 
 
They want to know do I rock? Salt be doggin' it  
 
 
 
Shakin' and bakin' the mic just like a chef  
 
 
 
I'll rock this beat until there ain't none left  
 
 
 
Let's get paid, get paid  
 
 
 
Let's get paid, get paid  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If I run out of breath, I take a pause  
 
 
 
If Pepa's on stage I say "Go for yours"  
 
 
 
But if she ain't then this mic I'm minin'  
 
 
 
I say "Spin, drop it" and keep rhymin'  
 
 
 
When Pepa comes back she'll say "Salt, chill"  
 
 
 
Grab the mic, and go for the kill  
 
 
 
But you're lucky 'cause she ain't back yet  
 
 
 
Relax, men, you're a nervous wreck  
 
 
 
Wipe the sweat off your face and stop panickin'  
 
 
 
You look scared, stiff as a manequin  
 
 
 
But still you're back again to see me rap again  
 
 
 
Spin, cut the final hit, let's just pack 'em in  
 
 
 
Cuff 'em and stuff 'em, they know I still love 'em  
 
 
 
If they can't stand the heat well then chuck 'em  
 
 
 
Salt and Pepa, Spinderella came here to tell ya

Salt was rockin' the hell out of some of you cats

Everybody needs soul power  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I'm the Pepa, much deffer  
 
 
 
Half-stepper? No, I'm never  
 
 
 
World renowned as a vocalist  
 
 
 
When Salt is not around I'm a soloist  
 
 
 
Puttin' pep in your step seriously  
 
 
 
Conquest is the best lyrically  
 
 
 
The mic is a component I use on my opponents  
 
 
 
Only to flaunt it, it just sound good, don't it?  
 
 
 
Rhyme power, organic as a sunflower  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And full of soul power

I'm gonna tell you what to do with it  
 
 
 
Wave it like a flag, dirty rag  
 
 
 
Keep 'em there till they get jet lag  
 
 
 
Pepa's on the mic, and the mic is on  
 
 
 
If Salt's at my side, nothing can go wrong  
 
 
 
Meet the mix empress, Spinderella, head on  
 
 
 
And that, my friend, is the meaning of a rap song  
 
 
 
Keep your shirt on, don't lose the buddies  
 
 
 
If I ain't done rappin' yo, Spin, keep cuttin'  
 
 
 
Ain't nothin' gonna stop us now  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We on a roll with syncopated soul power  
 
 
 
Got to have syncopated soul power

[That's all right babe I'll be your tramp  
You know what I'm sayin'?  
Phat rings (always) thick gold chains (whatever) know what I'm sayin'?  
I even got gold on my teeth (So what?)  
You a tramp (Please...)]  
 
Home girls attention you must pay  
So listen close to what I say  
Don't take this a simple rhyme  
'Cause this type of thing happens all the time  
 
Now what would you do if a stranger said hi?  
Would you dis him or would you reply?  
If you answer there is a chance  
That you'd become a victim of circumstance  
 
Am I right, fellas? Tell the truth  
Or else I'm-a have to show and prove  
You are what you are, I am what I am  
It just so happens that most men are...  
 
Tramp (What'd ya call me?)  
[Yeah, I'll be your tramp (Please...)]  
Have you ever seen a dude who's stupid and rude?  
Whenever he's around he dogs your mood  
 
I know a guy like that, girl  
He thinks he's God's gift to the world  
You know that kind, excited all the time  
With nothing but sex on the mind  
 
I'm no stunt, on me he can't front  
I know the real deal, I know what they want  
It's me (Why?) Because I'm so sexy  
It's me (What?) Don't touch my body! (Boy!)  
 
'Cause you see I ain't no skeezer  
But on a real tip I think he's a...  
Tramp (What'd ya call me?)  
[This is gettin' riduculous  
Don't waste my time]  
 
On the first date he thought I was a dummy  
He had the nerve to tell me he loved me  
But of course, I knew it was a lie, why'all  
He undressed me with his eyeballs  
 
Trying to change the whole subject  
'cause everything he said pertained to sex  
So I dissed him, I said, "You's a sucker!  
Get your dirty mind out the gutter  
 
You ain't gettin' paid, you ain't knockin' boots  
You ain't treating me like no prostitute"  
Then I walked away, he called me a teaser  
You're on a mission, kid - yo, he's a...  
 
Tramp (What'd ya call me?)  
[Why you gotta be all that?  
Why you gotta be all that?  
I'm tryin' to talk to you, and you're tryin' to dis me  
 
You know what I'm sayin'?  
Now if I rolled on you, I'd be wrong, right?

Pepa MC  and her first born  whatever it may be]  
 
 
 
Yo  Spin  once again help me get this crowd on its feet  
 
So we can set it off  
 
I've got your back  Salt  you know I'm never soft  
 
Yo  where's your records at?  
 
Right beside me  
 
Ready to give a scratch?  
 
Yep  like poison ivy  
 
 
 
It's the Nineties  the year for change  can you prove it?  
 
I made this beat  I'm an Invincible, and I produced it  
 
It's in my soul to roll and flow, take control  
 
Sold the show, can go like a pogo stick  
 
Hot hit, dop, dip, rock, rip, don't shop on my hit list  
 
'cause I can be a witch if  
 
They music is cool, and it can calm the savage beast  
 
Then we got plenty of beats for the beasts to eat  
 
A party animal that's livin' rather large, in fact  
 
Take out the camera, Salt, (Why?) I want to picture that  
 
Make sure it's focused or you may only not have noticed  
 
Before I cut up a jam I yell a "hocus pocus"  
 
And right before your eyes you'll understand the name  
 
Musicans and magicians are usually the same  
 
And the fame, proclaim, obtains, the stain will gain a rain  
 
That pours, it soars my brain to yours  
 
Ordained by law to train the poor  
 
I'll make sure that there ain't gonna be no more  
 
It's a treachery hidden up the sleeves of men  
 
Magic will only work for those who do believe in them  
 
 
 
Black magic, it's black magic  
 
Do you believe in black magic?  
 
It's black magic  
 
I believe in black magic  
 
It's black magic  
 
Do you believe in black magic?  
 
It's black magic  
 
I believe in  
 
 
 
We call this song "Black Magic" 'cause it's a fact  
 
Anything that's tragic relates to black  
 
Coincidental? (No) Here's an example, Jack  
 
Words as ancient as fossils or artifacts  
 
Black Sunday or Monday  
 
Black tongues or lungs may cause a black sleep  
 
Why say black sheep?  
 
Black sabbath is evil, black market illegal  
 
A black widow is deadly, black potion ain't healthy  
 
See, some try to say dark-skinned men ain't sexy true  
 
Darker the cherry, you know how sweet will be the juice  
 
Music's the only thing that brings the dead right back to life  
 
Have faith and it will guide you through the night just like a light  
 
Never say Salt steered you wrong inside a concert hall  
 
My crystal ball can see the future, to the beat y'all  
 
 
 
Magic, it's black magic  
 
Do you believe in magic?  
 
It's black magic  
 
I believe in magic  
 
It's black magic  
 
Do you believe in magic?  
 
It's black magic  
 
I believe in magic  
 
 
 
And my feet in the street is black magic  
 
And my soul in control is black magic  
 
And the life that I live is black magic  
 
Anything that I give is black magic  
 
 
 
It's black magic  
 
Do you believe in magic?  
 
It's black magic  
 
I believe in  
 
 
 
In magic, a dimension of sight and sound  
 
Where people see in only shades of brown  
 
And reality is the same as a fantasy  
 
Is this the way you want your world to be?  
 
Not me, I want variety in my society  
 
Where I can change if I don't like what I see, you see  
 
This is a woman speakin' bringin' door-to-door, seekin'  
 
Tranquilty, that abilty will keep on repeatin'  
 
To saw someone in half may be a trick or treat  
 
Making them dance and laugh is somethin' quite unique  
 
Abracadabra, Salt's comin' at ya  
 
You say my music was a phase, a fad, huh, I proved you wrong  
 
Over ten years and still goin' strong  
 
Whoever heard of a fad kickin' for so long?  
 
 
 
Magic, it's black magic  
 
Do you believe in magic?  
 
It's black magic  
 
I believe in magic  
 
It's black magic  
 
Do you believe in magic?  
 
It's black magic  
 
I believe in black magic  
 
 
 
And the life that I live is black magic  
 
Anything that I give is black magic  
 
And my feet in the street is black magic  
 
And my soul in control is black magic

Ain't nothin' but tutti-fruity 
Get on the floor if ya got that booty 
Yo, you got that funky beat 
Let's do it, man 
 
Yo, we got a little problem 
Yeah, we - you and me 
You gotta let me know somethin' 
I don't know - you say you like me 
So what's up?  You know what I'm sayin'? 
 
You said it loud, and I heard you 
Never tried to hurt you 
Some say I'm old-fashioned 
I like to take my time and do it slow 
You know with the flow  
But don't try to rush it 
So ride it like a horse  
And let nature take its course 
Get to know each other 
Be my friend not just my lover 
Share your thoughts with me 
Love my mind not just my body, baby 
 
Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know 
'Cause if you really like me I suggest you tell me so 
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came 
'Cause I may be the kind of guy you like 
 
Ain't nothin' but tutti-fruity 
Get on the floor if ya got that booty 
Wait a minute 
 
Please understand the way I feel 
I must have trust or there's no deal 
My emotion's ain't to be 
Played with or given free 
I appreciate greatly 
The way you toleratered me 
Sometimes I do act flaky 
Wouldn't blame you if you hate me 
You put up with my butt 
When I wouldn't give it up 
Yeah, I know that really sucks 
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up 
 
Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know 
'Cause if you really like me I suggest you tell me so 
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came 
'Cause I may be the kind of guy you like 
 
Yeah, all right 
I know what you're sayin', and it's cool but... 
Yo, I gotta know what's up, you know what I'm sayin'? 
'cause sometimes when we're alone kissin' and huggin' and things 
I feel like, "Yo, is this it?  Is it really gonna happen?  Yes!" 
And then pow! bam! boom! - nothing 
Why you teasin' me? 
 
Who me?  A tease?  Brother, please 
You're just having bad memories 
About some skeeze who did the squeeze 
And had you on your hands and knees 
Look, I am telling you straight out 
That's not what I'm all about 
I'd just be playing myself out 
If I spent the night at your house 
Now don't get me wrong 
I didn't mean to turn you on 
We haven't known each other long 
But this is my life not just a song 
 
Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know 
'Cause if you really like me I suggest you tell me so 
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came 
'Cause I may be the kind of guy you like 
 
Ain't nothin' but tutti-fruity

Ah  to the beat y'all  
Yes  yes  y'all  
Salt and Pepa's here with a brand new call  
People are saying  "No  it just can't be them"  
But yes  it's Salt and Pepa on the mic again  
 
Here to let you know how the rhymes just go  
When it's time to pick up the microphone  
And let the voice flow  
So yo  Steevee O  let the beat go  
Whether it's fast or slow or medium tempo  
No one can ever flow smooth as this  
Whether he's a Mister or she's a Miss  
So come one, come all, ya gotta bust a sound  
Or rather the rhyme will just gather around  
To see the doper than dope ones, fulfill the circumference  
Go out and buy an amp so that you can pump this  
 
It's startin' to irk me, yo, Salt, what irks you?  
Other MCs couldn't fill up a circle with fans  
While we were on vacation you couldn't complete your end  
Salt and Pepa now we're back and again featuring  
Spinderella, she's not a fella but a pro  
And on the wheels of steel good to go  
Cuttin' up a storm sometimes it's frightning  
First comes the rain then strike the lightning  
Doper than dope, can anyone cope?  
Yes, a-maybe, ahh - nope, so why do you persist and try?  
Look me right in the eye and tell me are you that fly?  
That you can pick up the microphone  
We stake the mic alone  
Hope that you never run into Salt and Pepa  
'cause we're doper than dope  
 
Yo, it's been a long time, but now we're back  
Salt and Pepa's gettin' funky on a brand new track  
And more up-to-par, swift like a car  
Stickin' to your mouth like rooftop tar  
Leaving a scar on those who spar  
So pass the cigar, get a drink from the bar  
Lyrics gonna flood your mind like the reservoir  
Here they are, come and join the Salt and Pepa seminar  
The rhymes are refined, some call them bizarre  
But they can catch your ears like a bass guitar  
And speakin' of base, why did ya in the first place?  
Walkin' around town till I see you face to face  
You didn't want to speak so I rested my case  
And now you're feelin' kinda fragile like an antique vase  
But don't worry friends or even give up hope  
'cause this time we're hyper than hype on the mic  
Call us doper than dope  
 
Spinderella, where ya at?  
Give us a funky scratch  
This is it, this is it  
Gettin' doper than doper than dope can get  
Uh, hit me  
Two times  
 
Three-two-one break down, ya broke up  
'cause you started speakin' when you shouldn't have spoke up  
You went the wrong way, you shouldn't have tried  
To dis Salt and Pepa 'cause half-steppers gettin' fried  
'cause these females at five minutes a beat  
Is all it takes for us to take control seven days a week  
You're wack, stick to your skeezin' please  
And let's not waste time on the weak MCs  
'cause they're unreal, and we're the real deal  
'cause we reveal the real sex appeal  
 
Yo, fellas, you want some, come and get some  
Doper than dope rhymes so I can hit some  
Musical notes that can hypnotize  
Keep your eyes on the lips, hips, and thighs  
Try to concentrate on the whole scenery  
'cause this is Salt and the Pepa MC  
Yo, here to rock right with the Idolmakers clan  
There's Steevee-O, Hurby the Luv Bug and also  
The Invincibles, Fat Doug, Dre, and Bougie  
And much more so get your VCR and pick my Fuji tape  
And rush for your house, don't move slow  
'cause you might miss the main Idols in the video  
You guessed it, yes, it's no joke  
Salt and Pepa's on the mic gettin' (what?)  
Gettin' doper than doper than doper than dope  
 
Enough (Why?), 'cause this ain't your average stuff  
And when it comes to rockin' rhymes Salt and Pepa don't bluff  
We were the Showstoppers that took your men  
We made you shake it then you push it, and we started a trend  
But this trend is kinda different, it's not a gold rope  
This time it's Salt and Pepa, Spinderella gettin' doper than dope

I'm not a man, but I'm in command 
Hot damn, I got an all-girl band 
And I wear the gear, yeah, I want to wear it, too 
I don't care, dear, go ahead and stare (ooh) 
Afraid to be you, livin' in fear boo 
Expression is rare, I dare you 
 
Express yourself 
You gotta be you and only you, babe 
Express yourself 
And let me be me 
Express yourself 
Don't tell me what I cannot do, baby 
Come on and work your body 
 
Yo, excuse us while we rap 
Go ahead, girls, express yourself! 
 
My party, your party, anytime drop in 
Cold hip-hop is always rockin' 
Don't you like it when the music drop 
Jump, spread out, and stop? 
Now bring in the go-go (uh-oh) 
Look at how my butt go rock from left to the right 
You wanna step to me, groove me 
I know you wanna do me 
Come on now, fellas, don't fight 
At my door they're bum-rushin', they hear the percussion 
Sound of my go-go band 
I've long ago learned my 
Lesson it's all about expression with the real 
Salt and Pepa please stand, and 
 
Express yourself 
You've got to be you, babe 
Express yourself and let me be me 
Express yourself 
Don't tell me what to do, babe 
Express yourself 
And come on and work that body 
 
Express yourself 
You've got to be you, babe 
Express yourself 
Don't tell me what to do, babe 
Express yourself 
You've got to be you, babe 
Express yourself 
Don't tell me what to do, babe 
 
Express yourself

[Yo  Play  I never expected that from you  
 
A guy's entitled to one mistake  Cheryl  
 
One mistake? That ain't what I heard (laughs)  
 
Yo  what are you trying to say?]  
 
 
 
Look  let me kick it to you like this  
 
It's not that I don't miss your kiss  
 
Well what is it?  
 
I'm scared of gettin' hurt (what?)  much afraid  
 
Of who? Me? Come on  baby  don't try to play me  
 
It's true  
 
But you know that I feel for you  
 
Yeah, I do but (what?) yo, Play, I can't trust you  
 
Come on, why?  
 
How could you stand there with a straight face and ask  
 
I ain't the first or will not be the last  
 
You got it all wrong, those days they all gone  
 
Yeah right, I ain't goin' out like a pawn  
 
Come on, you make it sound like I'm a little ho  
 
Yo, let me tell you somethin', buddy  
 
 
 
I really don't know  
 
Oh, I get it, now I see  
 
I really don't know  
 
After all the time you spent with me?  
 
I really don't know  
 
All the good things that we had in our mind  
 
I really don't know  
 
First I was sad now I'm gettin' mad  
 
 
 
[You gettin' mad?  
 
That's right, mad  
 
What are you gettin' mad about?  
 
Yo, you better...yo, girl, I'm tryin' to tell you  
 
I better what? Tell me what I did  
 
Look what I've done for you, you are ungrateful  
 
Yo, Salt, I'm tellin' you lead that's goin' to your head  
 
Look how you...look how you dissed me  
 
Aw...  
 
Shut up]  
 
 
 
Now how could you forget so soon  
 
All the nights with dim lights in the bedroom  
 
The things we said, the things we did  
 
All the talk about the house, the cars, and the kids  
 
Yo, I'm not sayin' those things didn't happen but  
 
That was before I found out you was a slut  
 
Rappin' to all the girls in and out town  
 
It didn't take long for word to get around  
 
Yo, if you walk out on me, I'll understand  
 
And have to take my lumps like a man  
 
You see, nobody's perfect, neither are we  
 
Love is knowin' when to say you're sorry  
 
Yes, and I apologize  
 
You sure that's not a lie?  
 
Yeah, cross my heart and hope to die  
 
 
 
Just let me know what is it with you men?  
 
And don't tell me it's a Tom and Dick thing  
 
Is it a must you lust for every big butt?  
 
You realize it caused the end of us?  
 
Ok, it's understood, the things I did it wasn't good  
 
Now can we live our lives like normal couples should?  
 
Mmmm, no  
 
No?!  
 
Well, I mean, I still don't know, it may be a mistake  
 
Don't think it's fake  
 
I poured my heart out, and you still don't believe me?  
 
Well go ahead then, you might as well leave me  
 
I think you're right, though  
 
I know I'm right  
 
Yeah, so?  
 
So what?  
 
 
 
Yo, I really don't know  
 
Come on now, I ain't gonna beg  
 
I don't know  
 
Didn't you hear a word I've said?  
 
 
 
Yo, man, this ain't gonna work  
 
Word, they're tryin' to play us like a bunch of jerks  
 
Yo, I ain't gettin' on my knees for no one  
 
I'm with you, true  
 
Let's go have a cold one  
 
Oh, you the dude  
 
 
 
[Well, how'd it go?  
 
Oh, I don't know  
 
At least we're still friends...  
 
Yeah, me, too, so what's goin' on tonight?

Already? So do I

As the smoke clears you can hear  
 
And the ringing in your ears just disappears  
 
Your body's soft, but you still want more  
 
You might end up as a casualty on the dance floor  
 
I'm an addict, strung out on dopeness  
 
But you can't chew, sniff, or smoke this  
 
If you want to get high step by the speaker  
 
And overdose on somethin' sweeter  
 
Do you suffer from migranes or other pains  
 
That's caused by stress and strain? Brother, refrain  
 
You came to the right place to get your head straight  
 
The cure's for sure, the beat's the bait  
 
I won't wait for the crowd to get loud or rowdy  
 
I enjoy my life 'cause I like to party  
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
I like to party, night and day  
 
I like to party in every way  
 
I like to party, I can't stop  
 
I like to party till I drop  
 
(Repeat)  
 
 
 
We're steppin' on the case, watch your face  
 
Don't like the pace then leave the place  
 
It's Ladies Night, yeah, and we hype  
 
Heels, shirt, tights, and a mic  
 
Like three the hard way we're doin' it our way  
 
Rollin' and gettin' funky like Kid 'N Play  
 
See her over there behind the phonograph  
 
She's a psychopath, I make the breaks last  
 
A Salt and Pepa parade this is  
 
So march on the dance floor with his  
 
Arms wrapped real tight around your body  
 
And you'll understand why  
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
 
 
[Make it funky, Pep]  
 
 
 
Oh, I feel hot then again why not  
 
This ain't pop, it's hip-hop  
 
And got a lot to rock to, dip and dop to  
 
You don't have to, but you probably want to  
 
It makes you laugh because it's really fun to  
 
Twist your tongue and exercise your lungs to  
 
Tonight on the mic we're showing  
 
We're strong enough for a man, but made for a woman  
 
Hey you! Where do you think you're goin'?  
 
Yo, Stan, my man, keep the horns blowin'  
 
Havin' a good time ain't no crime  
 
When the joint is jumpin' and people are dancin'  
 
Everyone does it, now it's no sin  
 
Yo, I just did it, and I'm ready to do it again and again and again  
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
 
 
[Wait a minute...  
 
Now I think it's time we give the drummer  
 
Some of this funky groove we got here  
 
You ain't got to throw no solo in, brother  
 
Just keep what ya got  
 
Yo, turn it loose 'cause it's a mutha  
 
 
 
Now when I count to four I want y'all to chill  
 
And let the drummer get ill  
 
And when I count to four I want y'all to come back in once more]  
 
 
 
It's in my feet, feels so sweet  
 
Said it's in my feet, feels so sweet  
 
It's in my shake, oooo, but it work me to death  
 
Said it's in my shake, but it work me to death  
 
I want the floor, I want to rock the floor  
 
c'mon, y'all - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - hit it!

Try to dis my girl Salt  up goes my guard  
Still feminine  feminine still  yes  
But then next pump a hundred weight bench press  
So what it mean  Pep? I'm not impressed  
'Cause I wear the pants  and you wear the dress  
Punk  you're lovin' stunk  you're not a hunk  
This is independent funk  
 
And I'm gettin' ready for the year 2000  
Independent, yes  I'm housin'  
Independent, yeah, now watch me  
Independent, no one can stop me  
 
Woman and I am independent  
I make my own money so don't tell me how to spend it  
'Cause you need me, and I don't need you  
So listen close, boy, to my independent funk  
Yeah, can you feel it?  
Yes, it's my, it's my independent funk  
 
(Yawn) You're sleepy, go to bed  
want to step? Go ahead and jet  
Now wake up from your dreamin' 'cause you're dealin' with the Pep  
Like Oakley from the Knicks, yes, I'm havin' a ball  
You think because you're leaving that I'm gonna take a fall?  
It was small thing, oooo, it was really too small  
Livin' large, boy, standing ten feet tall  
Now my heart won't dent, keep the money I lent  
And don't forget I pay the rent, this is my apartment  
I'm independent  
 
I am independent  
That's right I said it, and be damn sure I meant it  
'Cause a girl like me can have anybody  
So give my love, boy, to my independent funk  
Hey  
 
Salty the V.I.P., you should have stuck with me  
What are you stupid? Huh, my pockets run deep  
So flex the Rolex and the sex that I gave ya  
In jail with no bail and now nothin' can save ya  
You want me to visit? I ain't with it lizard  
We had magic now ya lost without the love wizard  
Ya had to cross me, and now you lost me  
Get off me softy, I'm the boss, see?  
You can't disguise the lies in your eyes - you're not a heartbreaker  
You're a fraud, and I'm bored - you're a fake faker  
It's too late to debate with the moneymaker  
After while, crackhead - see ya later, gator  
 
Woman and I am independent  
I make my own money so don't tell me how to spend it  
'Cause you need me, and I don't need you  
So listen close, boy, to my independent funk  
Yeah, so funky, so funky  
 
No, no, no more nookie for you 'cause I gave ya the boot  
Go ahead and go in your Yugo, gonna miss the Benz Coupe, hometroop  
Who's supportin' ya now?  
Got a job or do ya rob? I heard you're sellin' drugs - wow  
Big man, huh? But just understand Uncle Sam know the scam  
You'll end up in the can  
Singin' a sad song 'cause you did me wrong  
Couldn't fool me for long, I got it goin' on  
I'm independent  
 
Yes, I am independent  
That's right I said it, and be damn sure I meant it  
'Cause a girl like me can have anybody  
So give my love, boy, to my independent funk  
Hey yeah, my independent funk  
It's just an independent funk  
Get with this independent funk  
 
You're a baby so maybe you just needed a babysitter  
Bitter? I figure I'm rid of a piece of litter  
Tiger, tigger, I bounce back, and you're a quitter  
Your girl is gone for good so just forget her  
You're blind, you'll never find another better  
Your mind stays on a behind in a tight sweater  
Burned your flowers and your love letters  
Never a tear will I shed  
I'm independent  
 
Yes, I am independent  
I make my own money so don't tell me how to spend it  
'Cause you need me, and I don't need you

(Yo) 
So, don't tell me what I'm doin' is illegal 
No, I resort to violence only when provoked 
Contrary to rumors I'm no joke 
 
If I sound hard it's because I'm peed off 
And do you wanna know why? Go 'head tell 'em Salt 
All right, let me explain what upset me 
No we ain't tryin' to be sexy 
 
Dismiss is quick with a miss like a tongue 
'Cuz I'd run if I was a chick 
Pick up a hit list 
And I'm-a kick it like this 
 
The word is out, you played me out 
I won't scream and shout, straighten it out now 
Don't lie and spy, stop tryin' to connive me 
Slow your roll, you don't even know me 
 
I'm not a militant but I'm equivalent 
To an activist, all I'm after is cheer among all 
I don't care if they're big or small, short or tall 
We've got to stand to fall, ain't that right, y'all? 
 
Now all I can talk about is what I know 
And all I know about is what I witness 
What I witness is what I see 
Me, way below status quo 'cuz I'm a Negro with an ego 
Yo, that don't go 
 
Put some faith in your race 
Put some faith in your race 
Put some faith in your race 
Put some faith in your race 
 
I'm black and I'm proud to be a 
African-American Soul Sister 
Usin' my mind as a weapon, a lethal injection 
And oh yes, I'm the best in whatever I do 
 
I do better, I'm clever 
I never half-step ask Salt or Pepa 
We're partners in rhyme, one of a kind 
This affair is rare and you will never find 
Another like me, gimme the mic, it's mine 
 
Keep your mitts off this, yo, Salt, it's time 
To let the public know the subject of the show 
Is what America calls a Negro with an ego 
Yo, that don't go, that's a negative so 
 
Put some faith in your race 
Put some faith in your race 
Put some faith in your race 
Put some faith in your race 
 
Porche, Benz and BM's are all suitable 
For people who sell pharmaceutical 
That's a stereotype, that's the hype 
Don't ask me why I have an attitude 
(All right) 
 
When I drop a nine-eleven on my 200C 
The cops are surprised to see, a minority 
Behind the wheel of this car, it must be narcotics 
How else could she have got it? 
 
A brown-skinned female with two problems to correct 
Wrong color, wrong sex 
Sometimes I feel the real deal is to be a rebel 
But that would bring me down to their level 
 
I won't settle for that, it's unacceptable 
'Cuz Salt-N-Pepa's always very respectable 
Sometimes we get crazy and outta hand 
But it's all in the fun of makin' everybody dance 
 
I'm proud of 
Who and what I am 
So call me a Negro with an ego 
And get ready to go blow for blow 
 
Put some faith in your race 
Put some faith in your race 
Put some faith in your race 
Put some faith in your race 
 
Faith, faith 
Faith, faith 
Faith, faith

Slippin' on my dancin' shoes 'cause I'm a lady of the eighties  
 
It's Friday night  I just got paid  my house is pumpin'  
 
Or listenin' to my Hammer tape  while my sound system is dumpin'  
 
Picked up my girl Salty  she was waitin' on the porch  
 
I shared my fly  fly Mercedes  yo  lit the highway like a torch  
 
On the way to pick up Spindy we raced with a 1 9 D  
 
He was a sucker duck if he thought he could buck with us in E  
 
The party started  
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
Let's get this party started  
 
Let's get this party started right  
 
 
 
Rolled up at the party, saw a fella black and fine  
 
Bow-legged, high-top fade, then I said, "Yo, that one's mine"  
 
Stepped out of the ride, told the bouncer, "Hold my Benzy"  
 
Heard the bass, it was the place so I slipped my man a penny  
 
When we walked in the jam fans met us at the door  
 
They yelled, "We love you Salt and Pepa!" "Yes, we love y'all even more!"  
 
Some foul, wack, nappy bitty tried to step to Spinderella  
 
I was cool, I made my move, then I droppped her like a fella  
 
Start the party, boy  
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
 
 
Now this is what you call a hip-hop beat from S and P  
 
So get out on the dancefloor, and don't even rough with me  
 
I ain't goin' for it, I ain't buyin' it so don't even try me  
 
Dance sucker, Mother Tucker can, that old lady gets busy  
 
Yeah, I don't give a damn, Salty is who I am  
 
And man, I'm gonna slam this jam, you understand?  
 
Yes, we will stay the queens no matter what the means  
 
The party started, let's get retarded, now work them bluejeans  
 
Rock the party, y'all  
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
 
 
[Yo, Salt, you want to continue the story?]  
 
Yes, I told the people move, he made a move  
 
To the stage and grabbed the mic  
 
From these stank, sorry, frauds - Run D.M.C. look-alikes  
 
Spinderella took the set, made her fingers nice and wet  
 
And you bet she made that DJ sweat, and he won't soon forget  
 
Pepa took on the speaker, bust an oh, so funky rhyme  
 
I did a step right on time and made the crowd lose their minds  
 
The whole place was on the floor, we was rockin' hardcore-core  
 
We left them wantin' more, and we headed out the door  
 
We rocked the party

Then get the heck out  
Put on your battlin' gear  but don't come strapped  
Bullets are not needed  this time it's rap for rap  
I'm makin' the move  and soon you'll have to make yours back  
In fact  the further the rhyme is dancin'  Jack will get a lip smack  
So break up because it's time you shook up  you gotta make up  
It's time to break up the party  now you're shook up  
Salt and Pepa's gettin' swift, livin' up to par  
And competition, how to "Whassup" is to ride the bra strap  
Hurby's on the beats, Steevee-O has the musical notes  
Spinderella's like a propeller spinnin' music so dope  
Makin' a lot of noise for all the boys shootin' the gift  
Hold on tight 'cause tonight Salt and Pepa's gettin' swift  
 
You might have thought about goin' against the spices  
Salt and Pepa's a mixture like Chinese rices  
Battlin' time, Mr. Macho, please don't try to rip  
Because I'll melt ya like Nacho cheese  
You want flavor, well here's something to savor  
Why don't you wave a microphone in front of my face  
And a do small favor, gimme a beat so I can bust a rhyme  
For all the nerds, let all the words feed your mind  
Statin' the things and pleasin', takin' a rest, I'm out for easin'  
Bodily functions makin' 'em dance and Pep, this is the Christmas season  
This is duck season, and I'm gettin' high  
You're outta luck, duck, now it's time for you to get and die  
The ebony queens are back on the scene  
I assume you still suck like a vacuum machine  
Cornball sucker, give me a break  
I'm-a drop you from the sky like snow, you a cornflake  
Born to break any sucker or half-stepper  
Who wants to get assaulted with a deadly pepper  
Go down, low-down, this ain't no showdown  
The competition, I'm sure they'll blow down  
Even if you seem to stand stiff  
The breeze of the rhyme makes you move, and we get swift  
 
Suckers and flukes, it seems you lost and time to put up dukes  
'Cause you just forced it, the furious females to fly to (fuck) with  
Stay stiff suckers, soon you'll be stuck with a rep, torn to shreds  
A musical score leg, need a victory? I left an 'S' on your forehead  
Don't fuse up now, it's time to put out lights  
I won't ease up, pal, 'cause I'm-a go outta sight  
Lyrical queen, mess around, and you'll get creamed  
The star of every male's fantasy or wetdream  
The ebony princess in a lyrical safari  
 
Battlin' me is like a Honda racing a Ferrari  
If you were the king, what laws would you have me obey?  
None, my son, 'cause I'm quicker than a ???  
Quick to split the chick tryin' to get slick  
You're nothing but a prostitute turning a new trick  
Little Miss Wench, my mind is a trench  
Makes you drop, then you stop in your tracks and as I clench  
My fist, I twist words you use to rip  
The next time you flex, I'm guaranteed to get swift  
 
Hip-hopper's, rap artists, and rhyme fanatics  
Can you believe there's a sucker trying to cause static?  
Break out the health supplies and medical aid  
Prepare your mind for a super, alphabetical raid  
Rhythmic explosion without corrosion  
Rhymes, in effect, that protect like a Trojan  
Against disease, sorta like a wack MC  
Rhymes more powerful than a punch at Jack Dempsy  
I fear no one, plus I tell no tales  
 
I will stand up to any male or female  
Ones who persist to resist end up a prisoner  
Hissed in a daze or a faze because he is in a  
State of shock, too hard for one to take  
So in a multitude of crowds I run to break  
Beats for torture, but don't get played  
I stay paid, I caught ya now you shook, you're afraid  
Scared of the fact we came back to uplift  
The name, we designed the game, and we get swift</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Magic, I'd like to send this one out to the partner 
Pepa MC, magic, and her first born, whatever it may be, magic 
Yo Spin, once again help me get this crowd on it's feet 
 
So we can set it off, I've got your back, Salt 
You know I'm never soft, yo where's your records at? 
Right beside me, ready to give a scratch? Yep, like poison ivy 
 
It's the nineties, the year for change, can you prove it? 
I made this beat, I'm an invincible and I produced it 
It's in my soul to roll and flow, take control 
Sold the show, can go like a pogo stick 
 
Hot hit, dop, dip, rock, rip, don't shop on my hit list 
'Cuz I can be a witch if, they say music is cool 
And it can calm the savage beast 
Then we got plenty of beats for the beasts to eat 
 
A party animal that's livin' rather large, in fact 
Take out the camera, Salt, why? I wanna picture that 
Make sure it's focused or you may only not have noticed 
Before I cut up a jam I yell a 'Hocus Pocus' 
 
And right before your eyes you'll understand the name 
Musicians and magicians are usually the same 
And the fame, proclaim, obtains the stain, will gain a rain 
That pours, it soars my brain to yours 
 
Ordained by law to train the poor 
I'll make sure that there ain't gonna be no more 
It's a treachery hidden up the sleeves of men 
Magic will only work for those who do believe in them 
 
Black magic, it's black magic, do you believe in black magic? 
It's black magic, I believe in black magic, it's black magic 
Do you believe in black magic? It's black magic, I believe in 
 
We call this song 'Black Magic' 'cuz it's a fact 
Anything that's tragic relates to black 
Coincidental? No, here's an example, Jack 
Words as ancient as fossils or artifacts 
 
Black Sunday or Monday, black tongues or lungs 
May 'cause a black sleep, why say black sheep? 
Black Sabbath is evil, black market illegal 
A black widow is deadly, black potion ain't healthy 
 
See, some try to say dark skinned men ain't sexy, true 
Darker the cherry, you know how sweet will be the juice 
Music's the only thing that brings the dead right back to life 
Have faith and it will guide you through the night just like a light 
 
Never say Salt steered you wrong inside a concert hall 
My crystal ball can see the future, to the beat y'all 
 
Magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? It's black magic 
I believe in magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? 
It's black magic, I believe in magic 
 
And my feet in the street is black magic 
And my soul in control is black magic 
And the life that I live is black magic 
Anything that I give is black magic 
 
It's black magic, do you believe in magic? 
It's black magic, I believe in 
 
In magic, a dimension of sight and sound 
Where people see in only shades of brown 
And reality is the same as a fantasy 
Is this the way you want your world to be? 
 
Not me, I want variety in my society 
Where I can change if I don't like what I see, you see 
This is a woman speakin', bringin' door-to-door, seekin' 
Tranquility, that ability will keep on repeatin' 
 
To saw someone in half may be a trick or treat 
Makin' them dance and laugh is somethin' quite unique 
Abracadabra, Salt's comin' at ya 
You say my music was a phase, a fad, huh 
 
I proved you wrong, over ten years and still goin' strong 
Whoever heard of a fad kickin' for so long? 
 
Magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? It's black magic 
I believe in magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? 
It's black magic, I believe in black magic 
 
And the life that I live is black magic 
Anything that I give is black magic 
And my feet in the street is black magic 
And my soul in control is black magic 
 
And the life that I live is black magic 
Anything that I give is black magic 
And my feet in the street is black magic 
And my soul in control is black magic

I only live once so I gotta get right  
The first time 'cause there won't be a second  
I'm not in the mood to preach about the wrong of the world  
It can't be changed by three girls  
On the trio tip we're not a proof of that trip  
Excuses that's the truth when the proof compellin'  
I ain't tellin' or sellin' out to the pop life  
I like the spotlight  
Gimme a mic and a beat so I can speak words of wisdom  
I may be young, feed some, fall down, and filled up, I'm gonna build up  
Knowledge is food for thought so let's eat up  
Whatever goes up, comes down, you see nothin' lasts forever  
Not even MCs, you, he, she, and even I should live and let live  
Or live and let die  
 
Live and let die  
You're wastin' time tryin' to change the mind  
Of those who's souls are full of holes  
I do unto others as I wish them to do unto me  
Life ain't nothin' but death without money  
My way of thinkin' is one-track  
My method of convincin' combat  
Success is a mission, it's there for anyone who wants to do better  
You know where I'm comin' from  
Survival of the fittest, and I'll admit it's vicious  
I testify as a witness  
Let me say this first for what it's worth  
It's true that the meek shall inherit the earth  
But that don't mean you gotta be weak or soft  
Even on the mic you can't take no shorts  
I only help those who want to help themselves if no one else  
As a youngster they taught me to live and let live  
And that's what I always did, word to miz  
But there's a change in the world that I live in  
So don't be surprised if I live and let die  
 
Live and let die  
Live and let die  
 
That's the eighth time that baser almost O.D.'d, man  
Live and let die  
Yo, Finster, baby, went up for homicide  
Live and let die  
He's out there skeezin' with no jimmy hat  
Live and let die  
K-bone was shortin' the fuzz and got dumped  
Live and let die</field>

Everybody wants to be a big shot  
Everybody wants to make a quick buck  
Everybody wants to be on the top  
Everybody wants to be 
(repeat)  
 
Just like me just like me  
The S to the A to the L to the fa sol la T's makin' dough  
(Nuts?) No  but as in big bucks  
So (huh?) so (who?) so what the hell  
It doesn't matter who goes 'n buy my records long as they sell  
And I can tell that you don't like me very well  
Pop-popular hit, pop hits is makin' my pockets swell  
 
And makin' me a little rich now (yeah, baby)  
You ain't seen nothing if you think that I'm a bitch now  
Check it out, check it out  
Just watch me, just watch me  
 
I wasn't tryin' to be a hooker sellin' pootang  
Up and down the block just ain't my thang  
I seen a lot of women fall and gettin' fast money  
Cause either AIDS or jail will get that ass, honey  
I needed more to explore so I tried rap  
Now in 1993, I'm livin' mack stack  
Check my attitude it comes with the territory, baby  
And now I'm drivin' niggas crazy  
 
[Chorus] 
 
Everybody wants to get paid, paid like a Lou Mays  
Poppin' that coochie or sellin' fake Guccis  
Whatever's in style and costs some big ?  
Just to get one, niggas get a real five  
It's all about the great paper chase  
A million dollars worth of whip appeal could even buy Babyface  
So read me all the rules so I can have my money right  
Cause I'm a new lady boss keepin' game tight  
 
So, you think you're all that, feelin' kinda phat  
But can you see where the wrong is?  
I, I don't know much about ya  
But there's no doubt you're out to get yours anyway you can  
 
[Chorus]  
 
[You know what? I can't stand them Salt-N-Pepa bitches  
They think they're all that 'cause they're popular in Europe  
Yeah, probably sell-out hookers  
Oh, oh, and they swear everybody want to be like them  
Please, I don't want to be like them bitches  
I know, I live in a big house and have all them bills and headaches and stuff  
Oh, and Spinderella  
Nah, nah, nah, she's cool, it's them other bitches I can't stand  
 
(So I'm a bitch now?)  
Oh, Sue, there they go, right there Salt, Pepa!  
(Sometimes I be buggin' because I'm rich now)  
Yo, Pepa, can I get your autograph for my son?  
(Well, I don't need nothin' 'cause you know that I'm a bitch, y'all)  
Yo, y'all's hair is real fly, where'd ya all get your hair done at?  
(You say, "oh, ain't she somethin'" because I'm rich now  
And I'll bet you want to be like me)  
Still can't stand them bitches  
(Because I'm rich, y'all, and I'm a bitch, y'all  
A rich bitch, y'all, and I know)]

See the crowd swayin' to the phat joint playin'

And some got sad songs, mad songs, and moody blues  
 
 
 
There's good news and bad news, military coups  
 
 
 
A rebel with no cause in a pack of fools  
 
 
 
I never lived in the slum, never shot a gun  
 
 
 
But I'll use one, don't make me use one

Heaven and hell is on earth

Heavyweight boot-knocker, whatcha want to do  
 
 
 
In the waterbed room, yeah, just me and you?  
 
 
 
I got the fever for the nook-nook  
 
 
 
So if ya never seen a body like this take a good look  
 
 
 
Take a good look, bet that ass'll be hooked  
 
 
 
Because I'm better than a good book  
 
 
 
She can't match the cat, and when she looks at your back  
 
 
 
She sees Salt in a passion scratch  
 
 
 
We go round and round so let me break it down  
 
 
 
If she was all that, you wouldn't be here right now

No one does it better (bet no one does it like you do)  
 
 
 
No one does it better (no one does it), better than I do (yeah yeah)  
 
 
 
No one does it better (no light) (whether they're cute too) (oh no)  
 
 
 
No one does it (yeah), oh baby, no one  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Well that's true, that's why you never have no beef  
 
 
 
'cause when the bugle is blown it's all tongue and no teeth  
 
 
 
You're gettin' done between the sheets  
 
 
 
And I know you don't cheat 'cause at home you gets freaked  
 
 
 
And worked out to capacity  
 
 
 
A good piece of ass to me, that's all you have to be  
 
 
 
I lay ya down to the maximum  
 
 
 
And I'm extra in the middle 'cause that's where I'm waxin' him  
 
 
 
Honey knows where the flavor's at  
 
 
 
Who's cat is all that, who keeps comin' back...  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To me, can't stay away  
 
 
 
Gotta have it night and day just because  
 
 
 
No one does it better (no one does it), better than I do (no one)  
 
 
 
No one does it better (nobody does it like you do)  
 
 
 
No one does it better (no one does it to me), better than I do  
 
 
 
No one does it (yeah, oh), oh baby, no one  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You're damn right no one does it better than me  
 
 
 
Pepa's got ways to keep ya happy  
 
 
 
Don't put nothin' past me  
 
 
 
If I want to I do, if I don't then don't ask me  
 
 
 
Aim to please the man and freak the man  
 
 
 
Twenty-four seven 'cause he's the man  
 
 
 
Got thrills and frills like a theme park  
 
 
 
Before the chill part, you can't have an ill heart  
 
 
 
'cause it's definitely on when I hit the bedroom  
 
 
 
That knows zooma-zoom-zoom in his poom-poom  
 
 
 
Pep's the body mechanic so don't panic  
 
 
 
I'll let ya have it, but love ain't always automatic  
 
 
 
I never had a complaint, never said I feel faint  
 
 
 
I got the face of a saint, you think I am but I ain't  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
'cause you know (I know), you know that

            <field name="lyrics">What's the matter with your life? 
Why you gotta mess with mine? 
Don't keep sweatin' what I do 
'Cause I'm gonna be just fine check it out 
 
If I want to take a guy home with me tonight 
It's none of your business 
And she want to be a freak and sell it on the weekend 
It's none of your business 
 
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to 
It's none of your business 
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time 
It's none of your business 
 
Now who do you think you are 
Puttin' your cheap two cents in? 
Don't you got nothin' to do 
Than worry 'bout my friends? Check it 
 
I can't do nothin', girl, without somebody buggin' 
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't 
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one 
Opinion's are like assholes and everybody's got one 
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to 
 
Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm steppin' closer 
I'm not one for playing high-pole 
Like the house of ditty-nine-oh-two-one-oh type of the ho 
I treat a man like he treats me 
 
The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothin' but a fee 
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me 
You're poppin' all that mess only to stress and to spite me 
Now you can get with that or you can get with this 
But I don't give a shit 'cause really it's none of your business 
 
1993, S and P, packin' and mackin' 
Bamboozlin' and smackin' suckers with this track 
Throw the beat back in 
 
If I want to take a guy home with me tonight 
It's none of your business 
And she want to be a freak and sell it on the weekend 
It's none of your business 
 
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to 
It's none of your business 
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time 
It's none of your business 
 
How many rules am I to break before you understand 
That your double-standards don't mean shit to me? 
I know exactly what you say when I turn and walk away 
But that's ok 'cause I don't let it get it to me 
 
Now every move I make somebody's clockin' 
Don't ask me nothin', will you just leave me alone? 
Never mind who's the guy that I took home, to bone 
 
Ok, Miss Thing never givin' up skins 
If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz? 
Your Pep-Pep's got an ill rep 
With all that macaroni trap for rap you better step 
Or better yet get your head checked 
 
'Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards 
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulivard 
My face ain't scarred, and I don't dance in bars 
You can call me a tramp if you want to 
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you 
Or you can front if you have to 
But everybody gets horny just like you 
So, yo, so, yo, ho - check it, double deck it on a record butt-naked 
Pep's ass gets respect, and this butt is none of your business 
 
If I want to take a guy home with me tonight 
It's none of your business 
And she want to be a freak and sell it on the weekend 
It's none of your business 
 
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to 
It's none of your business 
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time 
It's none of your business 
 
So the moral of this story is, who are you to judge? 
There's only one true judge, and that's God 
 
So chill, and let my Father do His job 
'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swingin' again 
'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swingin' again

Yo, Salt, I looked around, and I couldn't believe this

The brother had it goin' on with somethin' kinda, uh 
Wicked, wicked (ooh) had to kick it 
I'm not shy so I asked for the digits 
A ho? No, that don't make me 
See what I want slip slide to it swifty 
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks 
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks for him 
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked 
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit 
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do 
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop shoop shoop

Umm, you're packed and you're stacked 'specially in the back 
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (thanks, Mom) 
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie? 
If looks could kill you would be an uzi 
You're a shotgun, bang! What's up with that thang? 
I wanna know how does it hang? 
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover 
Like Prince said you're a sexy mutha well-a 
I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile 
Smooth black skin with a smile 
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun 
Come and give me some of that yum-yum 
Chocolate chip, honey dip, can I get a scoop?

Show 'em what ya got 
Show-show 'em what ya got 
Show 'em what ya got 
 
Hey, yo, show 'em what ya got 
'Cuz shit is gettin' hot 
Show-show 'em what ya got

Hey, yo, show 'em what ya got

(Show 'em what ya got) 
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves 
(Show-show 'em what ya got) 
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves 
Forget that you're a lady, and give 'em what they deserve 
 
Now I've got this real phat attitude because of all the hype 
Jealous-ass rappers broke as hell trying to play me on the mic 
So test my respect, mess around, yeah, bitch 
Jump up and get beat down 
Now Salt shorty, light-skinned, sexy, and your man know 
I got him screamin' like a hooker in the front row 
So you better check my record, better yet, bum 
My name is super for a record, check my platinum album 
 
It's not meant for you to do 
You even sound wack when you try to check the mic 
One, two, one, two 
But wait I'm not through, how you livin' sayin' old rhymes 
Tryin' to get new? 
You don't work like the two to make hip-hop 
So you can talk until your big, suckin' lips pop 
The next time you try to play me, you might catch a fist to the 
Nose, ho 
So there you go 
 
You hear talk about Pep around the way gettin' skeezed 
Yo, me and my man was with Pepa last night, yo 
Nigga please 
You couldn't hump me if my first name was Cooty Cat 
Your little Jimmy can't even hold your zipper back 
Why don't you tell the story right, man? 
The only skins you ever hit was the skins on your right hand 
You rolled up on me in your man's Beemer 
And I could look at you and tell you was a meat-beatin' daydreamer 
 
You put the window down tryin' to act real slick 
And started smilin' like a hooker with a bag of tricks 
You stuck your hand out the window trying to show me gold 
Your forty-second street Rolex was kinda old 
I wrote a number, and I know you thought you'd get humped 
But it was Dial-A-Date 1-900-Chump 
So why you runnin' around town playin' Jeopardy? 
Get off my bra-strap, boy, stop sweatin' me 
 
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves 
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves 
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves 
Forget that you're a lady, and give 'em what they deserve 
 
Give 'em what they deserve 
Give 'em what they deserve 
Give 'em what they deserve 
Forget that you're a lady, and give 'em what they deserve 
 
Now somebody's gettin' on my nerves, and I'm wrecked to get crazy 
It never fails to amaze me 
How people never miss a possip, they just believe the gossip 
Instead of finding out the truth of what's up 
It's got my nostrils flairin' 
I'd be a fool if I believe half of the dumb shit I be hearing 
'Cuz ev'rytime I meet a guy that's got it goin' on 
One of my jealous girlfriends gotta find something that's wrong 
 
If he's not drivin' a Benz or Beemer then he's bummy 
Or he's sellin' Buddah if he's got plenty of money 
Now ask me why, I don't know why or well or what the hell 
So breakin' up the code because of someone's getting jeal 
I've got enough problems of my own 
To sit up on the phone talkin' about on who he's gettin' bone 
 
Hey, yo, show 'em what ya got 
'Cuz shit is gettin' hot 
Show-show 'em what ya got

            <field name="lyrics">Somebody's knockin' at my door [Yo  yo!] [Who is it?]  
Somebody's ringin' my bell [Open the door!] [I'm comin']  
Somebody's knockin' at my door [Let me in  please] [Damn!]  
Somebody's ringin' my bell [Come on  baby]  
 
It's your man driving to my house every day  
Trying to get a play but I say no way  
Keep him on a leash 'cause he's a D O G  
 
Hot diggity dog comin' for my coochie  
Boom bam-boom, knock-knock-knock  
 
Waking up my Moms, waking up my Pops, somebody call the cops  
And get this fool off my stoop, see  
 
 
 
Can you believe that your man is a groupie?  
 
 
 
Not-not dedicated, ought to get him spaded  
 
 
 
Cut the nuts and get his shots upgraded  
 
 
 
So what ya feed him at home? It must be bones  
 
 
 
Give him some meat so he can leave me alone  
 
 
 
He's a somma time man, so what ya gonna do?  
 
 
 
Like Eddie Murphy said, "Yes, your man, too"  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
 
 
He's a somma time man, some of hers, some of mine  
 
 
 
He's a somma time man, get ya some of the time  
 
 
 
He's a somma time man, some of yours, some of mine  
 
 
 
He's a somma time man all year 'round  
 
 
 
(repeat)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now here's a description of the (nigga) that I'm dissin'  
 
 
 
If your man fits this category then dismiss him  
 
 
 
You gotta dig him, get rid of him, have no pity for him  
 
 
 
Send him on his way, yeah, girl, and forget about him  
 
 
 
He's got a problem, and it's similar to drugs  
 
 
 
Not weed, cocaine, crack or dud, it's an erection, huh  
 
 
 
He's a mission, a sexual transition  
 
 
 
Addiction, affliction, so girls, sign the petition  
 
 
 
He's a man that likes easy pickin'  
 
 
 
Thinking that every girl is like easy stickin'  
 
 
 
You gotta realize that girls are not store-bought  
 
 
 
Like Newports, a pack of cigarettes smoked to the butt  
 
 
 
So now I know that what I know I know is now true  
 
 
 
You're being true to lovin' a brother that's not with you  
 
 
 
You want to bootie smack from the back  
 
 
 
But if you come like that you might catch a Diggum smack  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
He's a somma time man  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[Yo, this is dedicated to all you somma time fools  
 
 
 
And you know who you are  
 
 
 
Sometimes you will, sometimes you won't  
 
 
 
Now you see 'em, yo, now you don't  
 
 
 
1993, you know what I'm sayin'?  
 
 
 
It's time to be true to the paid  
 
 
 
'cause this AIDS thing's goin' crazy  
 
 
 
So don't you ain't throw it out there, baby]  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
He's a somma time man, a summer somma time  
 
 
 
Especially when it's hot sex is always on his mind  
 
 
 
Lookin', dippin' and dog your short skirts, no stockings  
 
 
 
No matter who it is, long as he's boot-knockin'  
 
 
 
???  
 
 
 
???  
 
 
 
La-di-da-di all the way to ?  
 
 
 
Runnin' through girls like it's musical punanee  
 
 
 
So come one, come all, he try to right you all  
 
 
 
With that greater than Tibet-time free-fall  
 
 
 
Talking that same old same lame ???  
 
 
 
Diggity-yack cat brother talking that bullcrap  
 
 
 
But everytime he parts his lips  
 
 
 
It's funny because I always seems to smell his (shit)  
 
 
 
From June, July, August, September  
 
 
 
All year-round so girls, just remember

I'm your honey dipper so you say  you know  
 
Then you react and attack every flirt and ho  
 
But oh  no   you gots to go now  bro  
 
To and fro  unh unh  no more  
 
So just walk out the door and be out like Margetta  
 
I've been through this before  but now I think I better  
 
Kick ya to the curb 'cause this hurts  word  
 
You dis and want to kiss? Now that's absurd  
 
Yo  Spinderella ain't the kind type to be pulled down, ya know  
 
Before I go out I go blow-for-blow  
 
So tell those hos that sittin' there waitin' by the phone  
 
That they can have you 'cause you's gone  
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
All you gotta do is just step-step  
 
Me and you, we're through so just step-step  
 
All you gotta do is just step-step  
 
I hate to be ya  
 
 
 
I'm not the one to be gone  
 
You better go out and get someone else, hon  
 
Who can eat your lies when you feed it to her  
 
And take that little thumb when you give me to her  
 
'cause you was packin' now you're lackin'  
 
You used to be stackin' when you was the mackin'  
 
But that's alright, it's a small thing, a small thing  
 
A two-minute brother, girls, I stress a small thing  
 
Yo, back to the track in the matter  
 
I don't need to see you think you're all of thatta  
 
Regardless of you my purse and pockets will be fatter  
 
I leaved ya flat, I leave ya flat, I left ya flatter  
 
 
 
CHORUS  
 
 
 
I wouldn't take ya back if ya paid me  
 
It was so sweet, oh no, I can't believe ya played me  
 
I'll admit you pulled it off kinda well  
 
But guess what? I did it, too, so what the hell?  
 
You reap what you sow, you know, you know how that go  
 
I know you're kinda shocked, but it was you who showed me so  
 
Swallow your pride, take it in, be a man  
 
I understood, now you understand  
 
That the minute you started showing me neglect  
 
Is the same minute I started feeling the effect  
 
Why I held it in I didn't want to accept  
 
That it could be over just for cheap sex  
 
Experience is what we need to learn from  
 
I know we all made mistakes, but you're a big one  
 
So to the lucky man who's up next  
 
Either treat me right or just step (step-step)

Here's we go y'all 
Singin' out the message for those of y'all 
Who think feel like you're strugglin' 
It's a simple song 
 
Yesterday, a man step to me 
He said, "How can you smile 
When your world is crumbling down?" 
I said, "Here's my secret, when I wanna cry 
I take a look around and I see that I'm getting by" 
 
And hold on

You can make it 
(You can make it) 
 
Hold on 
(Hold on) 
Everything 
(Everything will be alright) 
 
Some people like to worry 
Some people like hide 
Some people like to run away 
From the pain inside 
 
Now it's your business 
Do whatever you wanna do 
But if it don't work out 
Here's what you oughta do 
 
Now just hold on 
(Hold on)

Everything's gonna be alright 
(Everything will be alright) 
 
When the troubles of life weigh you down 
Just lift your head up, yeah, yeah 
When the love you seek is hard to find 
Don't give up, just keep strong, keep the faith 
 
And hold on 
(Hold on) 
A change is coming 
(Change is coming) 
 
Hold on

Here's the little simple song, y'all 
When the trouble seem like they just won't go away 
Friends let you down, things gettin' bounced around 
Here's the little lullaby we like to sing 
And it goes a little like this, come on, listen

Boy toy, I love you so 
Temporary lover, never let you go 
I spend my money on you 
Boy toy, I love you so 
Never no stress, let's keep this flow 
I know you feel the same way, too 
 
Where you been all my life 
No diamonds on her fingers 
But I know you got a wifey, boo, word to life 
No proof, 'cause Pepa got plans for you 
Reservations for two on a flight to Honolulu 
No disrespect, for losin' sweats 
You take the keys to my Lex, and this here blank check 
So shop till you drop, thanks to hip-hop you tight 
Have you fly, F.B.I. want to indict 
Bet you shit is right, got my daisies 
Goin' crazy, the 20 ways you laid me, uh 
Now come and bathe me, want to get high 
Take this helicopter ride 
From the westside down to the eastside 
Pick a highrise, I'll buy, uh, you know why 
'cause you're all that, no commitments, no lies 
Never settle for less, I'm the best, no stress 
So rests, yes, my boy toy 
 
[Chorus] 
 
(Seeking) Black female (Word) seeking black male (Uh) 
With the nice tail, uh, not frail (That's right) 
I like 'em focused, 20-20 
A man that needs little but gives plenty 
I'm never vexed givin' up no sex 
Unless I want to release stress 
And get this shit up off my chest 
Enjoy how you massage my mind, at times 
Feedin' me some knowledge instead of tryin' to out rhyme 
Not insecure, for sure, not bored 
Send you a first class ticket when I'm out on tour 
Show me a lot of love in the club 
You know your place, you give me my space, stay out my face 
A G worth a cristal, for you and your pals 
I love to see the other women yearn waitin' on their turn 
Money earnin', more money, cash, checks 
But you ain't never met a girl like this yet 
 
What's up, man 
You got that package I sent you 
Yeah I got it 
Did you like it 
What 
You know you earned it 
Yeah 
Put the thing down right 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Me and my girls chillin' at the mall, laughing and all 
Brother's kinda tall, you think he play ball 
Damn, you look live, hmmm, so fine 
I think I estimate about 4.5 
My pockets goes high, so we can ride 
I'll pick you up about nine-ish 
Take you to the finest, masseuse 
And we can get loose, sleigh la bouche styles 
Get wild, I'll bet I leave your ass with a smile 
Always a mouse, Spinderella, trick cheddar 
I like a good fella but I love a boy toy better 
 
Cheryl James, you know my name, I love the same 
I check for a player with a lot of game 
Not a little, not tryin' to get caught in the middle 
Uh, I like my toy part like a Tonka truck 
Hit the middle, uh, like Larry Zonka, what 
 
[Chorus] 
 
I'm not scared to tell you (Whoo) 
S-N-P, it's your boy toy 
All day, all night 
Nine-seven, like heaven, baby 
 
Boy toy, I love you so 
Never no stress, let's keep this flow

Hour after hour, phat tracks as the money stacks 
Keep comin' back with the bomb, to the dawn 
Uh, I keeps it on without a break

Paid dues so I choose, I call you out, you owe me 
Made a way for you, don't play like you don't know me

With the yes, yes, and then 
Check it, check it out, ladies say, ow 
To the beat yo, fellas gotta, ho 
You gotta earn my respect, break a sweat baby, work it 
Eliminate the job, turkey, or you can jerk it

My temperature's blazin', show me how it feels, uh-huh 
I'm savin', my secret sauce for the course (That's right) 
You gotta hit me off with that God kinda love 
That work it out through the hard times kinda love

No fame, no crew, now what you gon' do, Boo 
He say, she say, we say, why say 
The fly-ways my way 
The try fray, hit the highway 
 
Mad Lion: 
Say one, then some 
The paper, can't understand, uh 
One degree says, she can't understand 
Oh some friend come, wait, you been scammed 
The thing that everone thought 
Bought the Mr. Lover some 
Said why you gotta be like that, uh 
We make your money, bought you watch and my stacks, uh 
I know you want to play the games we play 
Only man, finds his car fade away, hey 
 
[Queen Latifah:] 
You smile in my face but all the while you want to take my place 
Put it on a paper chase and you can't keep my pace 
You're jealous 'cause I'm this shit and you ain't 
Far as I'm concerned, I don't know you from a can of paint (Hey yo, who you) 
No time to worry about who likes me, who didn't invite me 
Behind my back callin' me shysty, that don't excite me 
Backstabbers keepin' that he said, she said runnin' 
Always in my business, I leave when I see you comin' (Yo, I'm out) 
See you got the game twisted, I could care less 
My house is bought and paid for, your rent's due, you're stressed 
Nevertheless, you want to keep some drama on blast 
But I don't worry 'cause I'm quick to come and check that ass 
 
[Mad Lion:] 
They're spine behind your face 
But meantime, they want to take your place 
Those back-stabbers, hey, back-stabbers 
 
[Sandra "Pepa" Denton and Cheryl "Salt" James:] 
Check it, everybody sees you as preemy and teeny 
You see me in 3-D, and need me like a genie 
All your wishes are washed up like lock up 
We need to write a book called Shit That Botched Up 
One thing that Sandi can't understand 
The all the world jet but see a plentiful of hands 
So tell me, how can we shake 'em, firmly you break 'em 
Get 'em hot, and bake 'em, run to miss 'em, I may say 
Chase me 'cause I don't chase them, chill, in fact 
Like friends we are family with a bill attatched 
Pep's that green-eyed monster, make them ill and that 
Well if envy ever tempt me, Salt steer me back 
 
[Mad Lion:] 
Said why you gotta be like that, uh 
We make your money, bought you watch and my stacks, uh 
I know you want to play the games we play 
Only man, finds his car fade away, hey 
Never never, never should you get paper 
Think you better, better, get up, get up this place 
Some new, shit, on my tongue and lip 
Only one time, then, I will be done with it, go 
Some will get with it, some will get wrecked with it 
Some will host and they claim, that they say, we did 
You faced it and if you why, sack and I messed with 
His name was ah-uh-huh-uh-huh, forget this shit 
Mad Lion is sick 
No bed could get up in this re-lyrical 
Full of new time threat, hey 
I got my rhymes and the national anthem 
Got more rhymes than either Oleen or Tonet 
Got more rhymes than they made us sweat 
Of a nigga, of a crooked waitin' for the damn check, uh 
But let's not forget the, back-biters is the name of this set, uh 
All the people, and we know you bite mine 
Soldier people shall shine 
Yo' come in the next track, up this</field>

Blowin' like the wind, no need, got my own ends 
Player-haters never win cuz I'm a ball to the end

Feel the vibe, ride bass slide 
Yo, can't fight it ho 
Let it flow and move, show and prove 
We can do this, shake your groove thing 
Hold tight, ain't nothin' to this

Can you pace platinum and gold 
Lexus, drop top, gold 
Big houses, crazy dough 
Mad lucci, crazy Gucci 
Knowin' Lawton 
Let's get it on 
 
I'm livin' a good life 
No more showin' inside, ooh 
I'm livin' a good life 
I'm livin' the good life 
A good life, a new life 
 
Crispy currency is my smell 
And the body's packed well 
Can't you tell, Spinderella got new clientele 
Well I'm livin' swell, or should I say swollen 
I eats gourmet, and it slides easy through my throat 
And when I'm rollin', cruisin' in whatever car that I be usin' 
Passin', knowin' who's 
Always winnin' and never losin' now (Who rocks the best) 
Yo, it doesn't matter, 'cause I live a little phatter 
No concern about the chit-chatter 
Once I heard the pitter-patter, I had to blow so 
You know what happened, reach and grab for all the dough, yeah 
Livin' good like a Nubian Queen should 
Just put it on the bill 'cause it's all good 
 
[Chorus] 
Good life, whoa whoa (I'm livin' the life, oh yeah, yeah) 
I'm livin' the good life 
No more wastin' my time 
It's the good life, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah) 
I'm livin' the good life (I'm livin' the life) 
Yes, I made up my mind (Made up my mind, yeah, yeah) 
 
Credit to the hills, pimpin', loungin' by the pool 
And I love the way it feel, of course, I keep it real 
Garcon, come here yo, I'm kinda parched 
I want a big Blue Hawaii and easy on the liquor part 
Plus an entree, forget about the buffet 
Don't feel like walking, these dogs are barking 
Spend all of day shopping and I stopping to relax 
My credit cards are maxxed and I wonder what's the tax 
On 60K, call my accountant 'cause I want to know today 
But Lou that never played 'em in the black, baby 
Schedule bounce is a moonlight cream like Columbia to Texas 
 
[Chorus] 
 
He runs smooth, ooh, I'm in a groove 
Movin' in my land cruise 'cause my Lexus caught a flat 
So had to take it back 
Gold and platinum albums bought me gold and platinum credit cards 
I work hard, and now I'm livin' large, caviar, fast cars 
Living lavishly, this has to be a dream 
Then again I think not, I bust my ass to get the cream-team 
My royalties exceed, brought me on my knees, please 
Anything I want, anytime, anywhere I be 
I know my see's will keep a-reelin' if I feel like skippin' town 
No need to hang around another place we're pavin' out 
We're climbing stars, we're gettin' into cars 
And mixed drinks and live on bars 
Chauffeur, once around the lot, Rodeo Drive is where I shop

I've been knockin' knockin' 
Knockin' at the door 
Open up and let me on in 
I want to be more than friends 
Woo woo, woo woo woo 
 
Check you, Mr. Slick, who you tryin' to trick 
See a sign sayin' pick, want to play me for a quick stick 
With the next chick telling me you working late 
When my girls already saw you on a date 
Whoopty-whoop, black, the hell with that, can't get me back 
Bread's on the menu, pictures of the chick you had 
Now you want to flex to impress with the Lexus 
Diamonds and negators, uh, I'll check you later 
There's more comin' attractions in the movie theater 
I turn you down with the fader, don't be a player-hater 
'cause you know what I'm workin' with son 
The same damn thing that had you shook, trickin' from day one 
Feelin' the pimp now, pockets lookin' slim now 
I'm want mad shit, it's sh-sh-shoopin' like, hmmm, with him now 
No doubt, yeah, 'cause I love the way he work it out 
And he showed me things you don't even know about 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
Always and forever, I remember when you sang it to me 
I feel you sleezin' me, sleepin' with the enemy 
The lifestyle you was livin' was a mystery 
Don't say shit to me, 'cause now you history 
Don't ask where you are, I want to know how far 
I hear you trickin' on hookers at the bar 
You're makin' moves on the girl 
Ain't got a care in the world 
That's why I made you double up every time I twirled 
But the sex is not the best, don't expect me to take less 
So rest, and the next man come and bless 
The daisy, boy you crazy, don't play me 
Get over yourself baby, 'cause you don't even faze me 
I'm known as Salt in the game with aim and no shame 
And I still have my fame to claim, ain't nothin' changed 
But the weather, and how to make the cheddar better 
And I'll never take you back, that's always and forever 
 
And those roses on the bed 
And you grabbed me and said 
Ooh, you got it, hmmm, you got it 
Remember I held you real tight 
And I rocked it all night 
I said, hmmm, I got it, hmmm, I got it 
 
(So) Let me in, (Let) let me in (My baby) 
Let me in, let me in (Ooh) 
Let me in, let me in (I'm on my hands and knees, girl) 
Let me in, somethin' 'bout the way I feel 
 
Oh my, how the table's turned, play with fire you get burned 
What goes around comes around, now your ass is hurt 
Reminiscin' how the Pepa was a real lover 
The type of girl that made you uh-uh-uh, over and over 
You talkin' like you want me back, but never brother 
You blew it, when I pulled your cover, however 
No need for me to stress the mess 
The mess caused in our love nest, nevertheless, yes 
 
Moving on, looking good, and I'm well-dressed 
The blessed achieve high self-esteem, fulfill my dream 
That's why I always get the cream 'cause I got my child 
Who makes me smile, no time for the man who keeps it wild (That's right) 
I'm keepin' you on foul, you exiled, that's how it gotta be 
So cease 'cause you ain't pleasin' me 
Salt-N-Pepa brand new, uh, for the nine-seven 
Sorry asses get to steppin' 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
You and I together forever

Look me up and down when I pass, just keep the ass 
Vibin' with your girlfriends 
Jealous of my dividends and my Benz, and my ends

Bars stay lean and cream keep stacking

So move with the groove, makes your knees weaker 
Salt-N-Pepa coming through your speaker 
Hot blazing, so amazing

On the dance floor, nonstop how we movin' in 
Game so tight, lubrication couldn't loosen it

Shake what your momma created until it hurt ya 
Daddy came to freak it down and work ya what time is it?

Display many styles for years I've been here 
Iced out sex appeal I put your lights out 
Pull your mics out, we rock the party 
Freak your body, no need for a shottie 
I'ma make you sweat all night, hold tight 
All heads turn when I snatch the mic 
Send the party into orbit 
Coppin' drop tops 'cause I can afford it 
Ain't nothing, party over here what you doing on the other side?

And music of the power  
 
Ooh ooh eeh eeh ooh ooh eeh eeh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh music 
 
Music was my first love 
Music was my first love 
Music music music music music 
Music was my first love 
Music was my first love 
Music music music music music  
 
Music was my first love 
And it will be my last 
Music of the future 
And music of the past 
To live without my music 
Would be impossible to do 
In this world of trouble 
My music pulls me through</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I got two strong arms blessings of Babylon 
With time to carry on and try 
For sins and false alarms 
So to America the brave 
 
Wise men save 
Near a tree by a river 
There's a hole in the ground 
Where an old man of aran 
 
Goes around and around 
And his mind is a beacon 
In the veil of the night 
For a strange kind of fashion 
 
There's a wrong and a right 
Near a tree by a river 
There's a hole in the ground 
Where an old man of Aran 
 
Goes around and around 
And his mind is a beacon 
In the veil of the night 
For a strange kind of fashion 
 
There's a wrong and a right 
But he'll never, never fight over you 
Near a tree by a river 
There's a hole in the ground 
 
Where an old man of aran 
Goes around and around 
And his mind is a beacon 
In the veil of the night 
 
For a strange kind of fashion 
There's a wrong and a right 
Near a tree by a river 
There's a hole in the ground 
 
Where an old man of Aran 
Goes around and around 
And his mind is a beacon 
In the veil of the night 
 
For a strange kind of fashion 
There's a wrong and a right 
But he'll never, never fight over you 
I got plans for us 
 
Nights in the scullery 
And days instead of me 
I only know what to discuss 
Of for anything but light 
 
Wise men fighting over you 
It's not me you see 
Pieces of valentine 
With just a song of mine 
 
To keep from burning history 
Seasons of gasoline and gold 
Wise men fold 
Near a tree by a river 
 
There's a hole in the ground 
Where an old man of aran 
Goes around and around 
And his mind is a beacon 
 
In the veil of the night 
For a strange kind of fashion 
There's a wrong and a right 
But he'll never, never fight over you 
 
I got time to kill 
Sly looks in corridors 
Without a plan of yours 
A blackbird sings on bluebird hill 
 
Thanks to the calling of the wild 
Wise mens child</field>

Right about now, Thugs-n-harmony is on a come up 
So to all you bustas out there, beware 
 
Stalkin' (gat fools), walkin' jack moves 
 
[Krayzie] 
Woke up this morning with the thought of robbin' a bank to get rich 
Ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click, bitch, gimme your shit 
Fresh out the pen, and I'm low on ends, fuck calm, I tried to stay thug 
Got flowin' skills, but niggas, they bitches, now I just can't buy my bud 
With my steel, grabbed the forty-four mag plus a sack 
And I snag my leather rag, can't reveal when I glide with the moneybag 
ride to the hide, count my flags. I be livin' on the darkside 
And I can't escape, some say it's a phase 
If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is if I play with my gauge 
It's a raid. Put your face to pave 
If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed 
Pull down them shades, empty your pockets, watches, jewels, and you'll be safe 
I snatched the clerk up by her neck, put the gun in her mouth and said 
"Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe 
if you want to be killed try some stupid shit 
And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell"  
Trail to the back with the money in the sack 
Locked 'em all in the vault, time to bail 
Well, tickets I'm out the door 
hopped in the smug, and I break fast 
Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, loc'd out as I flip through my cash 
At last, nigga made good, and I got away smooth 
Now, I'm straight. Covered my tracks 
Only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool 
I gotta get mine, and if you stall, then I'm gunnin' 
Just work your job, get paid. I'll rob ya 
See, a nigga creep on a come up 
 
Stalkin' (gat fools), walkin' jack moves. 
 
[Layzie] 
See, I'm sittin' in my room, and a nigga feelin' down 
steady thinkin' 'bout how to get paid 
Gotta gauge at my waist that be spellin' out murder 
That'll get a nigga locked the cage 
Lay my head to bed, start to thinkin' hard, money is the cause 
What can I do me for? Need to hit a lick, not a bullshit 
But a real lick, like robbin' a jewelery store 
Select which one will I raid. Got be headin' downtown 
'cause tonight's the night 
Dressed in my black, wearin' makeup on my face  
so a nigga can't be seen in the spotlight 
Stole two cars, and I parked one north 
Parked one east for the smooth switch 
When a nigga bail, how the fuck he gonna tell if a  
nigga don't dwell in the same shit?  
Climb to the roof, and I'm peepin' out the scene 
And there's no one I can spot, so I get my ass down 
Looked around through the window, and I broke the bitch out with a rocl 
Now I jump my ass in. Start to fillin' up the bag 
And a nigga comin' up on these diamonds 
Grabbed a couple herring bones, and some rings 
And some (brooches), still thinkin' how them diamonds was shining 
Went to the cash register, broke the bitch open 
Grabbed all the money they had 
And a nigga gettin' goin' gone to Bone, yeah 
Got to let my niggas check out my bag 
And I got away smooth, 'cause I had the shit planned 
And ain't no bullshit get brung up 
That's what I gotta do if I want to get paid 
'cause a nigga be creepin' on a come up 
 
Stalkin' (gat fools), walkin' jack moves 
 
[Bizzy] 
Downin' Jamacian spliffs, little nigga Ripsta on this lick and bang bang 
Nigga that's the click on my brain, ? another victim insane 
Feel the murderous nerve 
this twelve shot pump, and I gotta bigger gat to back me 
Peelin' in my smug, thug, hoody, black skully, black khakis 
Creepin' in my smug, so reapin', peek into the window, let me cock this 
Nigga must've been meant to be jacked, 'cause here comes me hostage 
Up outta the door, with a pump to her temple, shoulda seen her tremble 
Push any alarms, and I drop them bombs on moms 
It's just that simple. I took my ganjas and fried 'em 
Don't gimme no hassle, bitch, 'cause I've been scopin' for weeks 
and I know y'all got some shit 
Clack back me gun, hollow point mixed with dumb-dumb kickin' 
Ladies and babies scream onto the floor 
("Shut up and listen!") It's a jack move, fools 
Give me the jewels, the dope, the weed, the cheese 
and answer me: why and you hoes is cryin', 'cause bitches are dyin'?  
Blood clot, here to be dead what one of them niggas said 
Buckshots up into them dreads, and I love when I hear them pump red 
One that callin' me bluff, I stuffed him with the quickness 
He made out with a smooth thirty G's  
So all bodies must bleed, I need no witness 
So with a me slug, mo thug jumped into him smug, rolled the blunt up 
good stuff reefer, hitted the Bone to give up love to my thugs 
'cause I done made it clean as fuck, and I flees the scene with a buck buck 
'cause a nigga be creepin' on a come up.

My nigga just entered your business, so can I get a witness? Can you duck? Fuck the po-po, pow. Startin' to kick this,  
gonna get my shit, and then you fucked up. Me buck. Me bang. Niggas ain't talkin' 'bout them thangs. Thugs remain, hang,  
swang with a click tight claim, come again, now. They drop down when I'm off the block. Fuck them cops. Me and Krayzie  
runnin' through the Boneyard, daily. Gotta give 'em up to the glock-glock, so I can serve me thugs and maintain to the brain,  
and thugs remain to slang thangs. Long live the dope game, and it won't end ya, as long as my niggas remember: no pretender.  
Get right up off the Clair, nigga, Fuck it. No surrender.

Layzie:  
Not wantin' the copper to hit me, a lick up, found me a victim to stick up, pick up, rollin' the nine-ball, slippin' that's why me  
trippin', bloody victim, get him when the time calls, dog. Take two-eleven, bailin', thuggin', knowin' these niggas well, then  
Bone's fuckin' with the hoes, here comes them po-pos. Nigga, that pig done peeped me, me gots to flees and get my creep on.  
Bone get gone, hit a wrong turn, mash the gas, and dash on. Jump outta the hottie, move me body, hittin' them cuts and trails,  
runnin' like we lunatics, gotta make it back to (?). Escape and eludin' the chase, buckin' me gauge, so nigga, remember: me  
killa, me no surrender.  
Me killa, me killa, me killa . . .  
 
No surrender. |  
Wish:  
Puttin' me on my knees, tellin' me move and I'm dead, 'cause I'm killin' all your bitches, turnin' them blue suits red. And then  
I'm comin' to that funeral to shoot that bitch up, because I know that's where y'all bitches is bound to meet up. Cop killas, all  
up in they chest, and I know what to do with that vest, man. Twenty-two shots. I killa. You don't want to fuck with Bone,  
nigga. And it really ain't shit to pu1l a trigger on a copper, 'cause if I go down, some of y'all goin' down, 'cause I'm goin' down  
poppin'. So muthafuck all coppers. Let me catch you slippin', nigga, bet I pop ya.

Krayzie:  
Ya better believe it's judgement day. So, nigga, just throw your pumps up in the air. Now kill 'em, kill 'em copper, like ya just  
don't care. When they come, they come creepin'. Me peepin'. Gotta watch them po-pos sleepin', put 'em in deep in gutters.  
Me keepin' 'til a me rich and gotta get mine, every time. This'll be over in nine nine, so, nigga, get down for the crime, gonna  
be more coppers dyin' in the line of fire. With thugs when I be slangin' my drugs, tryin' to cuff me and my nigga boy, gotta rip  
them guts, and lay your head in blood. Better check yourself next time you test and try to smoke a nigga. Bitch, remember:  
me killa. Me no surrender.  
Me no surrender. Nigga, me no surrender. Me no surrender. Don't make me put one in ya. Me no surrender. Don't make

Steadily pumpin' as me killas kill ya

Now if you ah thug nigga pick up ya pump and buck it

Little Boo, God's got him and I'm gonna miss everybody

When playing with destiny, plays too deep for me to say 
Lil' Layzie came to me, told me if he should decease well then please 
Bury me by my grand-grand and when you can, come follow me 
 
[Layzie] 
God bless you working on a plan to Heaven 
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days, GOD is who we praise 
even though the devil's all up in my face 
But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace 
For the case to race with a chance to face the judge 
And I'm guessing my soul won't budge 
Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs 
Oh what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll 
Can I get a witness let it unfold 
We living our lives to eternal our soul aye-oh-aye-oh

While you laughin we're passing, passing away 
So y'all go rest y'all souls 
Cause I know I'ma meet you up at the crossreads

Now Eazy's long gone 
Really wish he would come home

Gotta go bye bye 
All a thug could do is cry, cry 
Why they kill my dog and man 
I miss my uncle Charles y'all 
and he shoudn't be gone, in front of his home 
What they did to Boo was wrong 
Oh so wrong, oh so wrong 
Gotta hold on gotta stay strong 
When the day comes 
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on (lean on) 
 
Hey and we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray

Nuts bucks and guts nigga mistakin' them balls for dogs   
All niggas'll get mauled no thing to pick up a pump  
and people know ya and never hold ya especially when them rolls up   
Bet I bringin' in them guns run a thug get low down   
You don't want to get nutted cause' nigga you gonna get bloody  
once you see the braids and skully  
Cuttin' that throat when I'm rippin' up somethin' lovely   
What is it in ya? deep in the dead when we get fried   
POD when I comes to ride 
Creep but you sleep and then fall in the night  
once inside forgettin' about remorse your curse will ride   
cry now when you're ready to lie down   
when I'm weak in a mental state  
Somebody gonna die now

and all I seen was him jump when that lady yelled   
(And that was it.)  I don't know?

Well I saw his wife begging him

We had to get 'em up with two thugs 
Runnin' side by side with number one

When the po-po chase, 
If they catch me barehanded I'm done 
Rip's gripping the six shot pump, so spill it 
Copper lettin' the lead off 
Copper thought that he had me caught 
Little Layzie blew his head off  
Get him up, and get up, 
The bullets they start to get lit up, 
Number one best start duckin' with ah gun already buckin' 
Bust me lead on the double glock 'n 
Where the fiends roll up for rocks 'n, 
This perfect getaway, 
From the pigs when I peel and I hit the fences, 
Rippin' up the trench and, 
I'm bailing while they trailing 
Better in hell than in the cell 
And it ain't no telling where the coppers be dwelling, 
One had spotted me, pick up ah piece and shot a me 
But I practice what I preach 
And see that these slugs up in his body got him, 
Run, wid smoke coming from the barrel ah me gun 
Hit the bend, oh what the dumb dumb I got yum yummed on the dead end 
They set in, then they lead in, 
They wanting me off in the coffin 
Cops from everywhere was yellin and wailin' I went unconscious, 
From the stompin' taking ah loss, and waking up in the coffin, 
And without no stallin' 
Cell I was tossed in to be arraigned at dawning, 
Looking in the eyes of a judge, 
He knew right where to put that thug 
Made to be so, with no parole 
In the hole but I won't budge 
Sent me to deathrow, 
Watchin' the time by fly past 
But Rip'll be sittin' mindless never spineless, in silence 
Hoping I die fast, but chill, 
Never do, sleepa, gotta get put that on all me reefer 
Somehow must beat ya, so peep out the creep or the reaper will meet ya 
 
[Layzie Bone] 
Bailin' on ah mission, flippin' the script 
Betta check what the wind just blew in 
Betta think again, it's a preacher with ah grin 
On ah mission for revenge, with that Mack-10 
Little nigga Rip, had to empty the clip 
Gotta pump them slugs up in them cops 
Steady made 'em drop glock went pop pop 
Goin' out like a thug on the double glock, 
Back from hell and ready to bail, 
Time to hit they trail cause they wanted my nigga fried 
Holdin' the Bible when I got a grenade I'ma go inside the squad, 
Gettin' ready for the rumble 
When I heard them mumbles, pullin' me gauge in laughter 
Keep buckin 'em faster all I was thinkin' 
When I see them busters scatter 
Betta watch out for them buckshot's 
Cause them can't fade me gauge, 
Gotta bust them souls in the grave, 
So I'm buckin' them straight to the pave, can't be saved, 
I'm bucking, little Ripster reinforcements comin' in faster 
Blast give my nigga double Zs the Mack-10 
Lettin' the gun gun blaze on they ass, 
Gotta rip in them chests through vests 
Mack-10s, sawed off eruptions, got plenty ammunition 
No missing listen destruction I'm bustin' 
Cause I'm making that getaway, bound to getaway, 
Niggas got to escape and it's never to late 
When you dash and tryna' break 
Nigga just can't test the Bone fate 
We steadily runnin' duckin' 
Comin' up to the front door barri-caded, 
And I pulled ah grenade, tossed to the door, let it explode 
And we made it, creepin' in the courtyard 
So Krayzie feelin' safety coming 
Hittin' the fence and jump in it quick 
From Krayzie's tech-9 bullets humming. 
 
Well it seems as if them two boys Bizzy and Layzie 
Done got they selves into another jam 
(Well I'd love to see them boys get they self outta this one) 
 
[Krayzie Bone] 
Soon as I went in the smoke, rollin' real fast like a dog 
And began with a rage and the gauge can't let go 
They done labelled my nigga psychotic 
Bitches is got him sittin' on deathrow, 
Scoping out the tower peeping the scene 
So when my niggas trail, 
Screaming out one eighty seven and bail, 
Gotta get my nigga Rip out that cell, it's all over now, 
How my nigga number one disguised as the preacher, 
Won't be pullin' ah Bible mission for survival nigga so I creep the 
Tech millimetre, somebody done pull the alarm now it's on, 
Slaughterin' Bone, sprayed off the tech 
Gotta let 'em know which way was on, 
We got gone but them police was pullin' up quick nigga what's up 
Quick bust in first when he hit that fence niggas got cut the fuck up, 
We steady bucking, steady duckin' buckin' while I was jumpin' 
All we was thinking is don't get caught 
Nigga like me get the gun running 
Gunning fronting with thugs gotta get to the smug 
Turn around and we pump slugs, put 'em in the mud, 
And all across my face was the red that lay in blood, 
Dodging the who, make the gun flip with ah swoo, 
Bailing back on with my troops, 
I'm runnin' with 4 crazy niggas 
That's down with they niggas they ain't scared to shoot, 
Now I'm rolling, no more than ah half ah mile we get stopped 
Cops surround Bone, we load glocks 
And squeeze say fuck all these road blocks 
Busted ah you, then put that bitch in reverse 
And I get the swish and I push the button 
That boy came out the trunk and, 
Put it in drive see that Souljah boy bucking, 
Back in the other direction, 
Po-po came quick then heat up, 
Niggas blast at each other, 
Open up they doors and they get they feet up, 
I jumped outta the car, had to jump over the hood, 
Cause I'm headin' straight for the woods 
So the niggas they follow behind me 
We getaway smooth, ah nigga made good 
Came up quick to the hideout 
Wait until midnight till we ride out, 
Hit ah car so we can drive out, 
While we waited we all got fried out, fool 
If you'se a thuggish ruggish thug nigga scream mo, 
Took one ah my niggas off deathrow now we got one mo to go

Don't niggas don't want to start shit, 
Buck, buck to the bang, 
Sendin' bullets to the brain, nigga, yeah 
A nigga that always at my city with me, 
Now, who was that nigga they put in the plastic? 
Nigga that thought he could bang. 
That nigga's stuck. 
That nigga's blasted. 
They got my man from the Land. 
Never ran, I step with deadly men. 
If ya come a little bit closer, 
I can turn you into sand. 
Now follow me, now roll, stroll down to Cleveland. 
We thuggin', we theivin', we put it in deep, 
And the blood is seepin'. 
Got niggas in alleys, 
Fuck niggas in badges. 
We say bang. 
Eighty-eight through the ten-five (and Clair) 
St. Clair ain't shit to fuck with. 
Pumpin', Krayzie be bumpin', dumpin' the bloody body. 
Me never knew one that could flow with the tongue. 
We comin' to shoot up your posse. 
My niggas-they comin' up out the woods, 
To get the goods. 
Krayzie be thug, and (want to) die-that's from comin' up in my hood. 
We killas. Get a gat, pap, pap, clack back me gun, 
Bust one, they done. 
Cleveland is where we from. 
Hearts-thugs have none. 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
High techs and khakis when jackin', sawed-off,  
There's really no place to run. 
Niggas get vicious with my click,  
'cause even the bitches carry guns. 
 
[Bizzy Bone] 
Soon as I hit the scene, ? 
Feelin' for a pistol, 
But I didn't have no gun. 
Come with original thugsta shit. 
I be flippin' it with me tongue. 
Nigga, Cleveland is the city where we come from, 
And I show them hoes up outta the Clair that thugs don't run from none. 
Follow rip one, now, on and on, 
Them definitely got me back. 
And I'm throwin' up St. Clair thugsta niggas, 
With or without my gat. 
Forever be ready to pull out me murder tools East 99 style, fools. 
Me put it in mind on murderin' you, 
Followin' whenever me murderous trues. 
Niggas that claim to bang bang, 
When it comes to slang things, they do. 
They know they cannot buck me, 
One of 'em sure to slug me, 
But they hope the thug I be, Bizzy. 
Better let 'em him be or they'll see. 
Nigga, hangin', swangin', never to miss. The Biz is me. 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
[Layzie] 
Livin' in the Land of the Heartless, 
With a sawed-off pump, shootin' craps. 
Hand on my strap, roll thick, 'cause they jack. 
Runnin' up on the Bone, you needin' to be pap pap.  
Soldier thugs be pumpin' them slugs, 
Defendin' they drugs. 
When they roll up, 
Niggas be creepin' up slow, 
Heavy packed with they gats, 
And try to pull a hold up, 
But nigga, now hold on. 
Want to test the Bone? 
The gauge is shown. 
Any is mind blown, 
Lookin' down the barrel of this mausberg chrome to the dome. 
Bone, clack back me gauge in a rage, 
Copper take these here rocks. 
Double glock, 
My pistols be pumpin' and buckin' out shots whenever 
The trouble knocks. 
Steadily hittin', me clean up, 
Get lit up for ready your soul to burn, 
And I blow your shit up, get 'em on the get up, 
Cause niggas must learn. 
Yearnin' to earn cheese. 
Ready to die, so niggas can't take these. 
Wantin' to clock G's, want to move keys, 
Not takin' a loss on my green leaves, please. 
East nine nine, crime finds mine, 
Strayin' on this road to hell, 
And prison walls, testin' balls, 
For the cause, gotta get that sale, 
And bailin', kickin' up mud, rollin',

Can't fuck with my gang no thing, 
And the bullets they ring out 
Strangle the man, and drug 'em up off the Claire, 
We strip 'em and beat they brains out, 
I gotta give p's to all ah my Trues 
Steadily paying them dues 
We niggas with nothing to loose, 
Trippin' and sippin' on brews and actin' a fool, 
Mo Thug be loving to smoke mo bud, fiend for the green leaves 
Nigga quick pull out them trees 
I pull out me cheese,

Remember me killer cap peeler, 
Still a realer nigga, 
And I'm on to dig ya, 
So bitch if ya run up I'm bound to rip ya,

Pullin' me bullets it hurt,

Diggin' ya deep in the dirt, squirt blood,

Ready ta fuck you up must bust them, 
And steady be dumping thuggin' on the Claire, oh yeah,

Whena me forty four let go, 
Feelin' the glock glock roll,

We peeping out the few coming outta the back do' 
Hang, on the darkside ride, 
Pick up your tec and let fly, why?

Ride, me killa, gravedigga nigga, coming up out my trench 
Rest in peace and runnin' from the holice, 
Jumping that barbed wire fence, 
Hittin' the pavement dazed, the gauge was blazing, 
Gotta watch for the po-po raising up up on me 
Turn around and face 'em, 
Pump pump and fade 'em now.</field>

Thuggin through my thuggish ass hood at night, with my pipe 
Thuggin down the double glock 
Tryin' to get my serve on 
Watchin' my back while six-five try to roll on 
But one to the suckas head and two up in his body 
Now peep my creep I eat the reefer smoke all up inside me

Nigga don't take the wrong turn  
Or you will enter the hood and were spittin  
So cover your dome 
At a cut where the thugs and hustlas roam

You're liable to get your wigs split and dumped in a ditch bitch 
Cause them thugs, sendin' them slugs 
Leavin' em off in the cut in a puddle of blood say what 
Don't make me go in my trench

To your gravesite as John Doe for fuckin wit those...

And if them runnin' off with me cash, 
That ass gonna have to pay the price, 
(Meet a motherfucking' po-po, gotta hit 'em with the fo'-fo') 
 
[Krayzie Bone] 
Don't be fuckin' with my money, nigga no, 
See when Krayzie pull the pump, then I kill 'em all. 
Pump slugs, when blood hit the wall, watch 'em fall, 
Now dog who ya gonna call? 
Puttin' niggas in the coffin where they probably better off 
And Leather face is not a punk bitch so a nigga just can't fuck me, 
Nigga better have me cash, 
Or I kill his whole family when the twelve gauge pump blast, 
Now test me, 
Never ever let a nigga ride when he think he fin to slide, 
Pop him in the spine, get him for the money, 
Nigga tried to play me and dash, 
And that's why me thugs should put slugs in that ass, then tell he 
And me never want to see no, 
Oh jealous muthafucka tried to keep a nigga ends low, 
If he scared to smoke a primo, 
Gotta go with the fiends and in the click is a no no. 
Gotta make that money man, 
Gimme all my change, it's a murder thing, now 
Even in the dummy game,  
Niggas comin' up slain for collectin' they claim 
Now, Leather face, me pick up me gauge,  
Leather mask and nigga, me blast, 
So ya better respect us, when you see the bill collector, 
Rippin' killin' niggas for that mad money thang 
 
[Layzie Bone] 
Niggas steady payin' them dues, runnin' with trues, 
Nothin' to lose, everything to prove, 
Little thug from the see-Town, never caught sleepin', 
Always on the come up creepin', 
Runnin' this shit now puttin' that Bone down, 
Gotta let a nigga know for the love of cheese, 
Movin' thangs in the nine-five, rollin' with 
Ruthless, thuggin' with my niggas from the Clair, 
And we smokin' them green leaves, fuck with me now, 
Oh nigga don't test rest, straight Leatherface in the place 
On a mission don't be messin' with my bankroll, 
Niggas want to gank on Bone, so I stack them prank hoes, 
And I'm bettin' on me takin' no more losses, 
Put 'em in a coffin, and they life is better off, 
And these niggas they don't know me they can't know me, 
Thought you had a homie, but ya fuckin' with the muthafuckin' Bone see, 
Nigga gotta get me mine on the nine-nine, 
In the nine-five, bodies dropping 
When you hear my pistol select ah dome, 
Respect that True how's the underground shit, 
Mr. Bill Collector, Bone 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Wish Bone] 
Nigga take it off thank ya, 
Please don't make me stank ya, 
Time to pay the bill, write your checks up all night, 
Catch a slug or chill, bill collectors better respect 'em 
Mo Thug, sellin' dubs, pumpin' slugs all up in that rectum check 'em, 
Click-click, fall to the ground when the glock pop,  
Nigga chest pump blood, 
And takin' too long, better drop it on down,  
Or ya catchin' two to the head, 
Shoulda gave 'em up bitch, 
To the Mo Thug lunatic quick to pop, now you dead dead, 
Gotta pull that nine on the niggas everytime, 
Sellin' rocks on the nine-nine, 
Gotta put him on the pave, 
If ya want to die, put 'em in the grave, 
Better give me all them dimes.

Clean, and I'm out to fade 'em. 
Hey, and I'm out for money, gauged 'em, 
Better pray to save 'em, but it won't do any good, now. 
Bang bang, caution I lossin' me brain, 
Get 'em up off the 'cane, bang, 
Kill a nigga, bang, 
Peel a trigger, bang, 
Comin' up out to wet 'em, man. 
Off with the blood,

Reachin' on back as we bail to pick up me shells,

And ready to bring the war up your way 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?) 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?) 
 
Comin' through the door with my militia, why do they bring big niggas? 
Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards 
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas 
Steppin' out the limos the bitch soldiers maintain 
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin' 
My gang, you know me, homies got mo' love 
And I'm blessed, when I'm outta my sentence 
Pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders 
Jesus sent me his roll or loco, sober, load a revolver, hold up 
Now, buck 'em all to hell, 'cause I'm showin' 'em 
And I seen that the bullet holes was too much, no luck 
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out 
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up 
Hold up, and wait a minute 
It's time for Bone Thugs, 'cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga 
 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?) 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?) 
 
What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original? 
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin' years ago 
And that's just like a nigga want to take all the credit 
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, kid 
Don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy 
And I don't want to say a nigga's name and all that 
But a y'all fin to get stomped, let 'em loose 
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh 
Uh-huh, hey, we murder motherfuckers in a deadly way 
Fully automatic when we let 'em lay 
Aw shit! Get down, Leatherface 
Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect 
Come on, now, put them to rest 
What a bloody, bloody mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress 
I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me 
It's all in your mind, but in time, you'll find we as real as we speak 
 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?) 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?) 
 
All I see is this soldier, pistol in holster, givin' you the most, I toast to them thugs 
Nigga, nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table 
And a nigga want to test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud 
Harmony smooth with the thug shit, mo murda to the fools that clone 
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga 
And it's war when you craft these Bones we can get it on 
And I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches 
Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that 
Rollin' with the E since ninety-three, shuttin' 
Shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that? 
I know y'all niggas want to roll with pros, and make friend of foes 
But we chosen, God done blessed us with His potion 
Pure devotion, freely spoken, baby 
Niggas can't see us never, stay together, my click too clever 
Ridin' through the days of the stormy weather 
Remember, eternal, it means for everlastin' 
Number one assassin blastin', bashin' on all you niggas's what I'm doin' 
All of the heavens gonna be rulin' trues, when He come 
We won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong 
 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?) 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?) 
 
I see five killer realer niggas ready to roll wherever I go 
True to pull the trigger, smother a nigga, put 'em in a river 
We the killers, and that's for sure 
Niggas out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine 
And when I see you, bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double time 
And it's like that, you won't get 
Come and get some pap, pap 
Want to sound like? 
Want to be like? Nigga, we can't have that 
Why a nigga want to bite the bone shit? Platinum raps 
Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin' outta nothin' 
Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down 
Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the forty four mag, I'm glad 
'Cause when you're fuckin' with Bone, we sendin' 'em home in a body bag 
Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killa thug puttin' it down with 
Harmony, harmony 
 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?) 
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?)

recruited on this thugsta groove. Whatcha gonna do when they come for  
you?  
Tony Tone and Boogie Nikke:  
I love my family, this Mo Thug family, you mean the world to me.  
Heaven's where we gonna be.  
Together, together we stand. Together we fall, ya'll. I never turn my  
back on y'all. I got my halo, cocked (?) drop (?) fall,  
ya'll.  
Layzie:  
Come and look at this world that's ever so cruel, but the good Lord  
blessed us. Gave me true family I can depend on, 500  
Benz with the (?) chrome rims on, now I can get off when the wind  
blow, but I'd like to thank You, Jesus Christ, for givin' for  
givin' up Your life for us. Now, I can think twice, 'fore roll the  
dice, advice from a thug, tell mommy I love her everyday, think  
of her. Take a look at your thugs to the front of the line. Hear the  
thunder grind off in my mind. We done partied overtime.  
Destruction, terror, oh what an era, let's get it together 'fore it's  
over. Be a soldiers like my Mo Thug family.  
They never ever turned their backs on me [backs on me] when I was  
down. My Mo Thugs is always around, and if there  
comes a time to pick or choose [pick or choose], my Mo Thugs won't  
never lose [don't ya know your gonna lose]. We are

listen to our funky groove.  
Sin:  
I guess if it was not for them blessings, weak evil thought would  
control my whole existence. We preach and speak true belief  
from within this, family tree would fall, crumble like Sodom,  
Gomorrah.  
Tombstone:  
Can't duck, can't run from the cut, back up the wasteland field, peel

Gates:  
Natural born in the world of madness, no gladness, leave a nigga

We, who gets conflict, must just be weak, it's gettin' clearer  
and clearer [and clearer]. Enemies want to break my family down,  
pinnin' it. If we ever needed the Lord, we need Him now.  
Amen. Amen. Bless the Mo Thug children, and could You watch over mine

I'm sending a message to warn you imposters 
All hating in my business 
When I see you I'm a drop you 
Get slugged and get drugged 
My niggas I'll hustle to pay the judge 
Got you when I spot you I should pop you 
Even the boss was telling me not to 
But I won't stop until they get shot 
When they get out the hospital 
They gonna get shot, too 
The fast one bringing that AK 
Better walk, then we even 
When I leave and flees to Cleveland 
Now, murder 'em and rest in peace 
So goodbye. We're shutting it down 
And now we're prowling niggas from alleys 
Cloning our sound, we found your town 
Now is you ready for the war? 
Cry loud and go 
Many if all niggas 'll fall off in they sleep 
And even oppose and order them hoes 
Gonna flee with me? 
Bitch, fuck with me then see that 
My little aliens, yeah 
We come to your city. Can they really 
Put it on down with the pistol? 
Can you feel me, feel me? 
 
Verse 2:  Layzie Bone 
They beat biters, dope-style takers 
When I see you face-to-face 
My nigga, I'm a treat you like a hater 
You niggas ain't Bone, you clone 
You wrong. What the fuck? 
You niggas ain't thinking 
What's the consequence? 
Now I'm 'bout to get 
Real deadly. Ready for the war 
When we just start bombing shit 
Trying to cop my click? 
Hell no! Real raw. y'all niggas thought this was a game? 
Now it's time to make you feel the pain 
want to test my everyday thang? 
I aim straight for your temple 
It's really that simple when I seen it splatter 
Had I even killed one of you clones 
Then the rest of y'all wouldn't even matter 
Scattered. Run for the border 
Your career is getting shorter 
Nigga, better hide 'cause I already warned ya 
Mo Thug Records taking over 
I told ya. Soldier man your post 
Better cover your coast and lock all entries 
If one of my sounds is off in your town 
Then it's going down by the means infantry 
Instantly finna be World War 3 
If you fucking with my family jewels. You fools! 
You niggas break golden rules 
Gotta walk the walk in your own shoes 
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony 
Them niggas going platinum every time 
I'm ready to ride. You ready to ride? 
It's do or die. Then, nigga, I die 
I jump in my Five Double-O 
If you got it, better flaunt it 
I'm a drop the top, and lock the locks 
And cock the Glock; it'll make you want it 
Come get it. And while you're rapping 
On your song, just remember no pretenders 
Bitch, you hoes ain't Bone! 
 
Chorus:  Krayzie Bone 
I hope you realize that you ain't Bone 
You ain't Bone 
Why don't you realize that you ain't Bone? 
Nigga, you ain't Bone 
Ring the alarm (Ring the alarm) 
To let 'em know that we're charging 
Clones pay 
Come on now ring the alarm (Ring the alarm) 
To let 'em know that we're charging 
Clones pay 
 
Verse 3:  Bizzy Bone 
Straight from the corner and I'm a thug 
All my diamonds 
I bet you wanted to stop my shining 
Didn't we warn you, nigga? 
The sign. See? Blinded 
Run but they finding 
Me in my Double-big-Five-O 
And critical with a pistol 
With pistols. Feel that the verbal 'll 
Serve you. Heard my words 
Are satanic and wishful 
Then see you all get pissed off 
My generals need no horse 
We need are-15s, twenty Glocks 
With beams, and TNT 
Nigga roll with me 
Burial. Fuck the world! 
When I deal, hope I repented 
'Cause if the world I resented 
It just might catch me up in heaven 
But I'm a work this earth til it hurts 
Gotta done make the worse 
All the way through trial 
I'm back in the court for some dirt 
Get 'em off soil. They wait for alarm 
I curse that silly ass bitch said I stoled a purse 
And at them bullshit awards. But they told me 
I stole beneath of my shirt. And it makes me sick 
Even Ripsta's sistas plus family understands 
Fuck with it. Put it on your Grammy 
Even my mammy's scared to tell. And 
Deep in my mind, devil seeped in. Scary 
Stay wary and carry on. Promise to burn me 
Never bury and hurry if you ain't Bone 
 
Verse 4:  Layzie Bone 
These niggas want to erase me 
'Cause they can't face me 
Crash collide with the niggas that hate me 
Fucking with the real, y'all see how the fake be 
Ducking the cut, trying to look for safety 
Make me reach for my pistol and pop it 
Niggas gonna pay on the day that I spot him 
Toss him in the trunk of the Caddy 
On the way to the rodeo, killing all carbon copies 
I'll be damned if I let a nigga breathe. Indeed 
I grieve for the war. What's next? 
It's all about respect, bitch nigga 
I'ma get that shit if I don't get nothing else 
To the end I'm steady flipping 
Fucking the world til they give Bone props 
Nigga, you got knocked on blocks 
With rocks, beat down by the cops 
And it still don't stop. Glock Glock 
I'm grinding, steadily climbing 
To the top of the charts. Where you want to be? 
Off in my prime it's all about timing 
As I look at my shit make history 
No mystery. Mistook and, nigga 
That eight-time platinum real 
How do you feel to the thugs appeal? 
Make nigga want to sound like Bone for a record deal 
Should'a kept it real and quit fronting. Nigga 
Go round-for-round with the best 
Nigga, step up and meet your death 
Fucking with Kray, Little Lay, Biz, Wish, and Flesh 
Yeah, it's all about survival of the fittest and it's on 
Nigga, realize, or you die. You bitch ass niggas ain't Bone

Nigga, once you come you must pay like crazy if you  
(Muthafucka, don't play me) play me 
Nigga, not today 
I see you but you can't see me 
I know with all of government and 
Yes, this will get crazy and blow (bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) 
 
Got your mind blown, vocal tones keep it sewn 
Blastin' out your steroes or your headphones 
The roots exploited clones; therefore 
It's my job to describe the loudness, the habitat of rap survival kit 
Artistic skin abrasion, so when 'em fadin' my worldly reflections 
It's magnified to new levels of elevation

And flippin' on police, yeah they know me 
I'm not lonely, only, show me when the smoke clears 
And at least I had my homie and a nigga, K, homie 
All bitches, look into it as you want the real killa? 
Well, pull out your pistol, bitch, and shoot it, shoot it 
And you knew it, do it, when, when you looked in my eyes 
I'm ready to die 
And I hope my mama really loves me 
'Cause daddy's bye-bye 
Inner pride with the Ripsta 
Let 'em hit ya with the scripture 
Picture me locked out and smoked out with a half of fifth of 
 
Three sixty-five out of all the round trees 
They'll be Japanese, Maje$ty's corruptin' record companies 
Nigga, jump for cheese, catch sub-zero freeze 
And crack once the atmosphere brings the temperature back 
Sacks only in dress pants 
Have you ever danced with the devil in pale moonlight? 
I have, Hollywood niggas make me laugh 
Sell a dream to 'em 
Cash, no royality, grab they royal keys and dash 
My overhead projects how ends meet to foul or ejected 
Lyrics was selected beyond my control, last door on the totem pole 
Pockets swoll from tape residue, last interview and went in daytime 
It's made a promise to let down smooth criminals gently in my business 
Grab your earlobe and billion, this is big business, buy tapes 
Don't lend, niggas mad while I scrap change for phillies, why grill me? 
Got bigger balls to chase waterfalls with Chili 
Explore on four wheels or foot, I bring it to that ass over the hook 
So when you slip, gots it. I ride up on it 
I had to maintain my mental frame, and now I'm Boneless 
Word sound 'til I'm foamin' 
Cybergenics wanted my genes for clonin' 
Disownin' heads like Romans fight rebel Trojans 
More than civil suits make my longevity boost, articles 
And promotions make me more potent 
Deadly to the mind, 'causin' somethin' to be blind 
Re-define lines entertwined with all mankind 
Would that rain outshine divine Maje$ty, shame 
The boogie down punks is where the hearts still remain 
 
I'm a let a nigga know 
You know what I'm sayin', just right off the bat 
I gives a fuck about no nigga 
Don't be no (corvie) - ass nigga 
I'm tryin' to tell niggas that off the rip 
Off the rippa, baby (I must me losin' my mind) 
 
Where's the mob? 
Find your specialty, let's give this nigga a job 
Is you ready for jail? 
Yes and no, but somebody's gonna try to rob 
We can spar, but you gon' drop (drop) 
I'm a bomb, ready for war, will I p-pop pop 
Better look out for miles, been doomed since I womb 
Will he put me in my tomb? 
I've been thuggin' so assume when I enter your room, boom 
Stomped through Compton 
And cities y'all ain't never heard of and listen 
I bet there's thousand people screamin' out 
"Murder, murderin' ya" 
Hypnotized, took off my shirt, I got a life 
I'm tatted so when I die you can see what's deep my eyes 
Trues ride but trues die, my nigga, don't cry 
I shedded my last tear when I found out love was a lie 
So I try, but it ain't nothin' for my mental 
So piss off my pencil, and I blast, dash in a rental 
One nigga got out and off he in a trap with sawed-off 
They took a chance and lost 
Let's spray A-K and make gangsta gone 
Don't finish the wars when they ain't over 
I love you thugs, but all them skeletons got so close 
And they got so ? if it ain't ? 
This family that don't give a fuck who you are 
It ain't nothin' like some trouble 
How close? How far (how far, how far)?</field>

Better not be so quick test us, 
(May they lay, they lay, may they lay, may they lay, may they lay) 
'cause we'll come to kill ya, now 
We'll kill ya, now 
 
[Krayzie] 
Aw, triple-platinum, nigga, digga 
And still thuggin' with the roughest muthafuckas  
in my city, and a nigga wonder, "How they still chillin' like that?  
Ain't you scared of a nigga that's tryin' to jack ya paper, snatch ya?"  
No, I really wish a nigga would turn and want to take what's mine 
'Cause I got an AK-47 shootin' trey-O times 
You didn't think I'm willing to find a way to say 
"Oh, my!" but check it out, though 
I done made enough money to buy my ghetto a lot of weapons, y'all 
And I made it, takin' out my weed. Here, stay high, nigga 
So paranoia is factor when a nigga want to act up 
Nigga figure I'm quiet, then he 1ook at my sawed-offs 
And they figure they can try me 
Like a muthafucka won't swang back or somethin' 
Or even pull a nine out my jacket, and start dumpin' 
Fuck 'em, I think a nigga see us on the video and playa hate  
And say that we ain't true to what we say 
But then again, when you see us on the street and playa hate 
We bang them fuckin' brains (we bang them brains) 
But then, we switch subject 
And fuck with them clones that suck the thug dick 
Run around foul, tellin' people we stole your style 
Muthafucka, we ain't never been in your town 
It's all original when it's comin' from the Cleveland criminals 
So here we go, got a gun - should I buck 'em on down?  
Or should I kill 'em when I put the instrumental on?  
Why they want to sound like Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish and Flesh?  
I'm so full anguish 
Gotta style so cold everybody and their mama want to claim it 
But they can't get the hang of it 
Yeah 
 
Chorus 
 
[Flesh] 
Beat 'er up and you'll sleep when I step so stone-cold 
I chalk 'em, coffin off and they frontin' that time  
That they shot a nigga straight to the temple 
Done a little bit simpler to me and all bodies start steadily fillin' 
Get real high, steady droppin' the time on 'em, time from time and again 
Here to pick all that know with the Bone it's a party everyday 
So say, "Mo," and it's still this strong to brain 
I hop on the phone with the homies to see what's happenin' in the hood 
It's all good. Niggas, they thug us, smuggle 
Roll so deep in they own cut, but they gon' sacks sellin' for life 
If you pull a shyste off to the fiends 
Then gank 'em and leave 'em hangin' for the sake of come up 
Yeah, takin' ends, and we'll split ya, lost it in the stick up, yeah 
We better shank 'em, thank 'em, fuck it, I thank 'em, and hope for respect 
'Cause shit, he got sacrificed, my snatchin' a life in the midst of the dark  
And I sped off with the quickness, strikin' 
Send a knife to the back of a playa hater, hate a thug 
And they thought that I bruise easily 
Come, they go through this little, (spin 'em) 
Most of what goes around, comes around 
Ooh, bla-bla-bloody mess even though hoes really want to test us 
To the chest, Flesh buck buck, haters guess with a gun 
They change in a whole new muthafuckin' attitude 
 
Chorus 
 
[Layzie] 
Nigga, let me in 
Double glock and never about to change, man 
To the temple I aim and claim to gain control 
Fin to rid your soul, creep or roll 
Put some pressure on these hoes that, yo 
They pose as foes, gotta let 'em know 
Got a nation of my niggas out to back me 
Got another nation--killas out to try to jack me 
Exactly, what the fuck you thought you was gon' pull?  
Fool, try to jack a St. Clair true, you lose, you lose 
Nigga, I'm a tell you 'bout these haters distraction 
They down with the puffin', the passin', 1ookin' for some action 
Facts and stacks, never will my mission collapse 
If you really want a thug, then you better pin these raps 
And a I'm a give a little game in this world that we livin' in it 
Sinnin' in it, and it really ain't free to me 
You get it how you take it, but the only way you'll make it 
Givin' peace to the G-O-D, your Lord 
And it really don't mean that evil's gonna quit 
Because the hater's gonna hate, and then the real - it's gon' feel 
But I bet that after all of y'all fall  
that the faker's gonna perish in the fire 
Dip, and you know when I'm rollin' 
I'm equipped with the Ruger on my hip with the infrared beam 
And I gladly put it on ya from the land of California 
Leavin' all of y'all goners, if you know what I mean 
Yeah, so quick to test us, jump off in the Lexus with K.B 
We gonna take a little journey around the world and see what we see 
Any y'all niggas comin' with me? So, come on 
 
[Wish] 
Let me up in here and kill 'em 
Feel 'em niggas want to bite the Bone, bite the Bone 
Didn't a muthafucka say I'm wrong?  
Well I get down for mine, for my nine and blow 
We shoot 'em up, buck 
Yeah, strange we erupt on playa hation 
Anybody hatin'? Erase 'em 
And biters, everytime I see you on T.V. 
it makes me feel good 
'Cause I know when we run up on you 
you'll see we, we gotta get paid good 
Nigga, don't shit come for free in this land of poverty 
Bone in harmony, we hungry 
Since it's all about money, give Bone a little bit of that evil money 
Don't gather the fly shit, fuckin' with Cleve, top of line in my Benz 
Should I 1et 'em spin on all of y'all,  
should let my 20s spin on all y'all haters?  
Everything we write, I swear, it's all original 
Niggas mad at Bone because we be all original (all original) 
 
[Krayzie] (Flesh) 
Better not be so quick test us 
(May they lay, they lay, may they lay, may they lay, may they lay) 
'Cause we'll come to kill ya, now

'Cause when they catch me without my heat, and I'm thuggin' 
In tha streets and I'm rollin' 
Thuggin' by the deadliest G's, you can't fuck wit us 
To the pressure out of pressure, I'm loadin', blow you up

And we'd tested stress, want to be blessed consists of tha sin 
In tha ways of tha sin, to be dead.

Which way do I turn when there's so much stress 
Surroundin' me daily? This world's so cruel and shady 
And I really do miss my baby baby boy, oh boy 
Me and yo' baby brother we keeps the rhythm 
You'll always be our lil' nigga, and I know yo' mama miss ya 
Picture the day when I get my callin' but until then 
I guess I'm stuck (oh fuck) 
The team knew I meant so much when I get to heaven they're 
"Boy what's up?"  We can ride and roll, I know 
Without this po-po trailin', bailin' 
Although in heaven betcha that's a promise 
Comin' with tha niggaz can't test this 
Creep if heat is all ya 
Rollin with tha niggaz that pack the heat 
And the sack of weed straight out of control 
Test tha souls, hoes, nigga rolls, playa haters 
And tha po-po as well 
Figure everybody need and we livin' in hell 
Nigga really can't tell, so why? 
Prepare for the worst and hope for the best 
And the rest as written, some want to treat my 
Like I'm forbidden, but I'm just lookin' for the shit that's hittin' 
Could I be? Come a little bit closer 
Why you cautious when you approach? 
Is ya scared of tha fact we soldiers mo' thug 
Breakaz fittin' to take shit over 
Under my halo pray mo' say mo' thug with love 
To tha depth that tha game goes 
Die all you hoes, foes, and you propose

Is my mission, we heatin' shit why vision? 
Be crooked beginnin' of my endin' 
Why is my mind spinnin? I'll say hey, fuck it 
My family ain't livin' for nothin' but strugglin 
Was one of the reasons I'm thuggin 
Instead of straight hustlin' somebody tell me somethin' 
What is there?  Nothin'? If I give you, what'll you give me? 
You'll fuck it all up for the love of lust 
Cause I love you so, but unlike my friend you're just my foe 
Peace 'til the end of the road 'cause we're all gone 
But no, nigga don't lose your soul 
Put trust in mine, alright then we can roll (roll, roll)

Doin'it layin' down. What went wrong?

Cause outta all that shit I got two sista's and a brother 
And I learned to harmony 
On the streets, on tha Clair, that's where 
I'm from y'all, on the streets of tha Clair 
That's where I met Bone Thugs y'all it's gettin' time to be a man 
Gotta get out tha house cause I can't stand mommy's man 
He talks with his hand 
Come come creep on tha streets with me 
That's where I learned how to sell drugs 
It's where I learned how to pump slugs 
It's necessary, necessary for me to get down for mine 
So I creep and I grind don't give it up but get down 
And I know that shit was wrong but 
Don't blame me, blame tha thugsta in me 
Cause that's where that shit comes from (comes from) 
Bloody red rum, nigga, we nuttin' but survivors 
We survivors, that's why we be

Come and picture for the family scripture 
Tell me what do ya see, club nigga in a mask 
A man tryin' to blast ass

You know we put you in the, no Bone in we pretender 
You know we put you in the, no Bone in we pretender

And all the way to heavens that's my mission 
Standin' up ready for the war in position

In the past, get a pipe and a chance n I'm ready to throw down 
Low down, dirty mothaphukin' shame, in a world so cruel

Before I had a little money, niggaz what's hatin me just 
For nothin, breakin' my gear and thinkin' it's funny 
Get around bitches n niggaz be frontin', but I'm hustlin'

Oh well, if ya snooze ya loose 
Stop bringing that pistol and fetch ya, 
Shoot it and catch ya, shit, pap, 
Stay packing that gat in yo lap away 
So if ya can't roll strapped 
Now how about that 
That pistol go tap at niggas who 
Go fucking wit one of my own 
No no, wrong, Any place where my chrome 
Left devils at they home 
Double bang, execution, we mo murder, stupid trick 
You bitch that asked me 
We don't play wit me game that be remaining mine and little man ran 
To disaster, wish I asked him 
And I popped up and capped him 
And Eazy is where we began 
But I blessed him in the master plan 
Niggas thugging off in the Claire 
It's still the pen 
Can't fuck wit these Cleveland Claire players 
So as long as ya better be working 
Cause the Bone and Mo Thug on this mission 
Listen, better pray everyday 
Cross us on the way hoe 
 
Oh, oh, oh 
I just wanna separate from the precious, baby 
Or maybe, 
I was meant to live my life caught up in this world of games 
And God's name I pray 
The devil, he be bringing me down 
I can feel him cause he pulling me now, 
I've been blessed wit an incredable style 
When there's pushing, it's just try to seperate  
And to break this all down, 
Now ain't that foul, 
So I asked the Lord to help me 
"Lord, why does this life overwhelm me?" 
When we living in hell, 
But we chill most every day like we in heaven 
Oh well, 
But time will tell, 
Singing, "This is for the ringing of the bell, the bell, the bell." 
But it be hard to maintain and stay peaceful 
If you don't know to tame the devil then the devil will beat you, 
Defeat you, deceive you, evil, 
He will never leave you alone 
I've been looking for a better day, 
But they don't ever seem to want to come my way (my way) 
Hey, I've had a hell of a time 
Trying to make it cause my people steady stressing my mind, 
So I stay high 
So I'm already sitting on the top, ya see me, 
When he be wit me, 
He's daily innovating me 
Rarely see ya on the daily mission 
Keep your distance from the flames, 
Maybe you can survive, forever and a day 
 
Hell yeah 
Got me flipping in the North Coast 
Remember me, 
The crook who wrote the book, 
I'm off the hook, 
Most of y'all niggas better take another look 
Cause if ya player hate the Bone then yo life'll get took 
So quit, never bringing ya no bullshit man, 
Face to face it's that assassin gang 
Bringing the heat, all y'all niggas bringing is lame, 
But if ya wanna bring the pain, then ya gotta maintain 
Coming in on another level, 
I'ma put you on deck up at the top of the pile 
Fake niggas wanna claim my style but Imma break em on down, 
But you gotta come unique, 
It's the thuggish ruggish sound 
That you're looking for, or searching for 
Everybody boy wanna be like Bone and stay high, 
Little kids no longer wanna be like Mike, 
That's right they trying to be like Bone and keep thugging for life 
Getting ready for the end, dog 
Wit my nigga Ken Dawg, hustlers, shifters and Tre, 
II Tru, AJ 
Same motherfuckers from around my way 
 
This is how we play, 
Every day it's the same old same, 
Around my way (around my way) 
We be thuggin a-round my way 
This is how we play, 
Every day it's the same old same, 
Around my way [Repeat: x3] 
Come around my way, my way (my way) 
 
It's all Mo Thug, It's all Mo, Mo Thug 
It's all Mo Thug, It's all Mo, Mo Thug 
 
Little nigga wanna come, gonna feel my pain, pain 
On the brain it's a stress, a strain 
The game, the fame, the fame, the fame, (fame) 
What about those hoes, oh no 
Little Easy fo sho to teach Bone, 
And if he's wrong, well, he's gone 
For my journey to keep me strong 
But dear Lord I miss my peoples 
And it just seems so evil, 
And that I can't kiss my kids goodnight, 
Put em to bed, tuck em tight 
And catch some sleep and that's all right, that's all right, 
I'll get mine, yeah I'll get mine 
It'll take time, minimum crime, 
Weed and wine'll be just fine 
Got something buggin all of my peoples (what) 
In the back of a Caddy 
Jumping outta Caddies, spreading through alleys 
In Cleveland and Cali like daddy and, 
Oh, no, love, for double-a and double-a zero, 
Really wanna get yo combo, 
Said I'm ridding round in your boat 
 
You niggas can't fuck, with 
These Claire players, on top of the pile 
And we roll this 
Stand back, haters gonna be here for a while, 
Can't ya hear the crowd screaming real loud? 
And that's for Bone Thugs 
Dear Lord, my sis has got Bone to look up to 
And feel proud of, on top of all of that there 
Mommy's out the ghetto now 
I thank the Lord and thee, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, 
For everything it brings to me, yeah 
I thank the Lord and thee, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, 
For everything it brings to me 
Better believe that we'll do em, do em, 
Shoot em, shoot em 
Kill em, kill em 
Nigga ain't gonna stop nothing, niggas 
Been a long, hard way 
Been a long, long, long, hard way 
And I gotta get mine 
Gonna floss up in the bed 
Watching niggas watching me 
That's trying to take mine 
But I got something for em, watching niggas 
Running away from me 
It's time, bye, bye 
Nigga don't wind up player hating 
We got much love in Mo Thug 
It's all about Mo Thug 
 
It's all Mo Thug, It's all Mo, Mo Thug [Repeat: x4]</field>

With my mighty-mighty warriors

Cause this is all real, what you see 
I said it's all real it's just the thug in me 
 
(verse 1) 
Nigga just because Krayzie quiet speak less  
Don't be mistaking my kindness for weakness 
Humble but ready to rumble  
My violent side I can't deny 
I'm like a Jekyl and Hyde gemini 
Look if you see me quiet  
then I'm plotting to riot why tell me why tell me why 
I'm labeled a menace but I like it  
Destroy ya paranoia will make me blow you away but hey 
Nigga got to close to me and that ain't how it's supposed to be  
Nigga want respect but what do you show me you  
Playa hate and anticipate the day that you can see me fall 
Better act like yo know I'm rolling with Mo posse up 
Do damage and manage to wiggle our way out of handcuffs 
As we strut as thugs we must doin our best to obey god violent in these times 
Got to do what you gotta do war till ninety-nine 
Slim nigga gotta get up and go and get it if it's really coming 
Now I got it and I'ma floor the niggas acting  
the safety's off come and get it if you really want it 
(Hey, hey, hey) It's hating baby they gotta be so cold the gotta be heartless 
In certain situations like retaliation 
 
(chorus) 
 
2x 
Niggas be keeping it all real we keeping it all real with the real if it's  
real stay be real 
 
 
We come with nothing but the real thing baby  
Krayzie got nothing but the real thing baby  
We come with nothing but the real thing baby 
 Krayzie got nothin but the real thing the real thing 
 
(verse 2) 
Baby now this is the sound of me and my trues we put this down way down  
So now if you hear me releasing some shells 
Hit the ground with the quickness lay better stay down on the darkside  
Take a look and you'll find true niggas like no other kind 
Nigga say fuck the wine indo inside swisher sweet get me high 
 
(2x) 
Ain't nothin get to nothin somethin got to be real real somethin got to be

(2x) 
I still be thuggin in the khakis boots and skullies  
And since I'm weed fiend for the green nigga gotta make that money man 
  
(8x) 
It's real always 
 
(verse 3) 
Last night I P.O.D'd next to me Ouija, Ouija,  
and I fell in this fucked up state of mind 
Slipped in the dream and I see demons telling me it's time to die 
Why me I see some niggas they creeping outside my window 
I'm ready to bang bang bang aim the 12 gauge pump let my lead go 
Give it up for the bloody murda mo bloody murda mo mo 
See a nigga when he go through the window had to put a bigger hole in his soul 
If he get away running out my backdoor with me sawed-off swinging 
Get ready to duck now to the guts buck pap pap pow 
 
(2x) singing 
I claim my thang to slang  
(murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo) 
Them bloody bodies kill 'em all send them hoes up in flames  
Krayzie insane to the brain  
 
(verse 4) 
Now I know I done did some dirt in my time  
cause the devil was stressing my mind  
messing with my mind nigga 
Bone don't know every day they lie  
Turn to realize that everyday I can do it if I only pray 
Maintain cause a nigga was lusting 
For money had to get it cause a nigga was struggling 
I hit him with the Mossberg y'all heard about Mr. Sawed-Off  
Leatherface till them lay round after round after round 
They'll fall down down 
May they lay from the eruption man  
We putting them six feet deep we buck we bang

Come and get showed, there'll be gauges and Uzis 
Let us begin with bullets 
Can't none of ya break off a niggas from prison 
And let 'em come with us, retaliation 
We come and blast 'em with leather masks on

You need beware when your rollin' down the Clair 
These niggas is killas, try to feel us 
Thuggish ruggish niggas from Cleveland 
We steadily creepin' on ya 
And you better believe that we bring that pap-pap to your doorstep 
Ho-check, you don't want to fuck with Bone 
Let loose

Nigga, bulletproof, if a motherfucker pull it 
Then he better shoot 
Nigga never no 9-1-1 to your rescue 
Never repsect you, blowin' your chest through 
Labelled as a menace, but I'm feelin' it again 
And I'm in it to the finish, better check my manuscript 
Killa, for realer, drug dealer, little nigga, cap peeler 
Bailin' through the Land equipped 
When I grips the grip, pump, shot it, shot it 
Jump off in my hottie

Come with the war, then you're gonna get yours 
Expect the four nigga ring yo doors 
And don't you diminish 
Til I finish you with it or you would missed it 
On the hit list, couldn't resist it 
Nigga, you risk it, here to stick with it 
To the po-po, you know; 
Who don't roll in a sixty-fo' Impala go 
Lurk, better searchin' all the doors 
Runnin' through crouds 'til I get to Mexico 
Go, nigga, Bizzy Bone, the story of a warrior with talent 
Little Rip gets so sadistic it's story of (story of story of) 
 
[Krayzie] 
Killin' for my niggas steady got up in the pen 
Depend on me, let 'em leave 
Well, we better flee, set 'em all free, give up the game 
But I love the way the thugstas stay 
And when our niggas really get to poppin' at the cops 
You'll be lookin' at a hell of a war 
Muthafucka done rocked the boat 
And we nigga fin to even the score 
Nigga drank to much, took to much 
No surrender, no you're never gonna catch me 
Never gonna catch me, catch me 
I'll keep runnin', I'll keep runnin' for my life 
And duckin' bullets while you're tryin' to ruin me 
'Quicker the copper 
The quicker my niggas'll pull up and drop ya 
We shot ya

Hey, my niggas boxed ya

My nigga, we all in together in position for the maulin' 
Pac got his got headlight ahead of me 
Keep me raw, and fuck it, let the law end 
Open the coffin, top locked, let the body fall in 
Quit doggin' all the juice, runnin' loose for my crew 
Oh, what I'm gonna do is take a bite of the forbidden fruit 
And never seen us shoot 
If I could be the 187 on you 
Flesh-N-Bone got the chrome, and it's on 
For the next that get wrong 
Here's my TEC, and it's on, they they won't disrespect 
Then sleep with the rest 
Don't even expect, 'cause you ain't goin' home 
Who's next? Bring it on, whoever want to flex

Everybody by now should know my label, my thugsta 
These things guidin' your struggles 
All it is, is about this hustle, whatever it takes to piece this puzzle 
Why declare war on these fakers and haters eliminate us, traitors ?  
These are the days of our lives (lives) 
Do or die, (that died to Boo - he go bye) 
Whom die they lie in the face of our society 
Try at of every attempt to quiet me 
I got a nation that's down to ride with me 
Here's the deal, can I get a witness?  
It's deeper than survival 
Who am I? My brother's keeper?  
Yeah, I be clutchin' on my Bible, willing to die 
The wicked is near me 
Dearly departed, but nobody hears me 
Is we all gon' fall in misery?  
It's so serious, it bring tears to me 
Ears to the street, like a drum to the beat, creepin' up my block 
I'm already knowin' a nigga want to do me 
So I stay strapped (Don't pose for the cop) 
Crooked cops, they gonna harass me 
Ask me the same ol' bullshit questions 
Knowin' I'm a thug with bud for days 
Keepin' a pistol in my possession 
But a thuggish ruggish soldier like myself gon' move on 
And prevail, avoid jail, collect my mill with my Bones, splittin' domes 
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, 
Come on, don't make me hurt ya 
Come on, come on, come on, come on,  
come on, come on, come on, come on, all about that bloody murder 
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

Addicted to trouble, we never goin' change

Soldiers, I think we must be to O.G. ? loves thee 
Mama plead my family tree never helped a mother come up 
Seen it was hard tryin' to bring her sons up--they dwelled on the worse  
And ate nothin' for done up, comin' up, made it, eternal 
If I struggle, thank God 
I'm a count my blessin', trouble but never no stressin' 
Just called it a lesson 
'Cause life will be runnin' that test and better off in a cell 
See a nigga walkin' the streets 
And they label us foolish children 
'Cause I always knew this 
While the rest of my days I be livin' in Ruthless 
Fuck what you're thinkin', law, my Judge is up Heaven 
Look at my stomach and see the "7," 
Even scales is how I'm bailin' 
Rebellin', tellin' y'all nothin' but a soldier tells,  
critic can kiss my ass 
I might go to thinkin' about my past 
Get mad, I reach in my stash and blast 
Fuck all y'all that treated a nigga like we wasn't shit 
And soon as we hit, now what do we get?  
These fake-ass niggas tryin' to get in our click, all on our dick 
But you can miss me, actin' phony in my presence, love it or leave it 
You can't believe it 
It ain't that season 
Get to steppin', hater

Fucking with my thugs and I'm needing my love nigga what 
Bone niggas fin to do a little damage  
take over the planet with my daily tortures 
Of course it's the nigga that's takin no shorts  
Smokin on the newports your ghetto resource 
And bitch you wanna dig your own ditch  
and hit you with levels beyond your control 
My momma never raised no punks and hoes  
Just relear niggas comin up snatchin souls for dough  
I know y'all motherfuckers out there somewhere ain't nowhere to hide 
Makin motherfuckers feel the vibe for life 
In the midst of the twist I'll be down to ride

Ridin with death 
 
We niggas rappin but still we actin like criminals

We stay heavily sedated comin now back up my buck get shaken 
Deeply dreaming about this demon my daddy told me it was comin 
Trapped in the form of a bad omen it's wicked it was written I'll be 
Runnin while turnin around and blastin back to buck 'em fuck 'em 
Them fools come back like I'm ready for war is that all you got 
Heard the mack was talkin this and that bout some of my incidents 
Said I smoke and snatchin purses you heard this lil EZ told me 
Bitch clonin little EZ's niggas so fuck you you weren't original 
Mono y mono ain't no subliminal Hey

Catch me caught me must have seen

My mental seduction run your whole sound suction abduction of lyrics 
Is the loss of life love and spirits 
Capital offense for generics lost in the prison  
Lieutenants overseeing the barracks checkin in 
Mark ass copy cat incoherance is crucial 
Smokin hay that bite shit like microchips 
I watch you ride the rodeo straight to the bottom  
When you're fate rotten, bitch

Nigga whatever you niggas want, we bringin' it! 
Thug Luv, nigga. What time is it? 
Yo, I don't give a fuck where you lay at 
Nigga, it's time to slay these bitch-made niggas! 
 
They ain't even knowing what type of niggas we is 
Where my thugs at? Bone thugs-n-harmony 
I know you niggas been waiting for this for a long time 
Well, here it is, nigga. Here it is. What you gonna do with it? 
 
Well, it must be close to the Armageddon, Lord 
Know that I won't fly by that lesson 
You taught me to pull out my Wesson you brought me 
And I'm not stressing it softly 
Get 'em up off me, cause all we 
Wanted was harmony, been bombing em 
Yell up out of my ghetto, I won't settle, get on my level 
They can't stop me and pop me 
Nigga, they got me? Fuck no 
Little Pac gets schizophrenic, and manage to damage all y'all 
I'll talk about 'em, and you don't really want it 
'Cause they're cornered, and I'm want 'em to not jump 
I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down 
So quick to test, bullet, yes, declare war 
Roll, I'll flow when I get the gun for the murder 
Mo' horror! Why? They did it all, pause for the cause 
And I finna to pull a 9 or pistol, and lit a nigga with mine 
Fuck them niggas, it's on 
All y'all fall! Bizzy getting bitches to test me 
Bless the floor, and any attempt to arrest me, stress me 
Lord, looking at death with the last of my breath 
Follow, follow, my kids! 
No, don't sin in my steps! 
Yet the weapon is kept with the best of my secrets 
Deep in the reach, I'm alone. Nigga believe 
That I can see it, if needed, and if you really with me 
And well then let it be, get the greens and we running up over Cleveland 
 
Ha, ha! What's poppin', nigga? 
Put your muthafucking hands on your strap, nigga 
Thug Luv, nigga. Yeah, we can do this like gangstas and slug it out 
Or do this like punks and punk it out 
Pull your strap on me, nigga, you better kill me! 
Thug life, baby. Thug Luv 
 
I'll probably be punished for hard living, blind to the facts 
Thugs is convicts in God's prison, hands on the strap 
Praying so Father please forgive me! Police be rushing when they see me 
I flaunt it: America's Most Wanted, live on T.V 
Life: pleasure and pain, stuck in this game, holler my name! 
We all gon' die, we bleed through similar veins 
Please explain to me, now. Don't panic when my guns burst 
Heard the last jam, nigga? This one's worse! 
My nigga Bone held the chrome 'til I came home 
Thug Luv players tell these bitch niggas "bring it on" 
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening 
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathin' 
Now, who do you believe in? Hit the weed and breathe 
It's a cold-ass world; niggas kill you in your sleep 
Watch me until they stop me, bury, murder me or drop me 
I got Thug Luv for my nationwide posse. Feel me! 
 
Little thug from the Land, nigga, never ran 
Muthafuckas out to get me. They don't understand 
It's the #1 nigga out with a nation of niggas 
Down to put it some work and do some dirt 
Fuckin' around with the band Bone Thugs-n-Harmony 
Follow down the road, we stroll to meet karma 
Everything I do, it seem to cause drama 
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor, bomb ya! 
So quick to test us, nigga wanna crash me, eat dust 
For the love of the lust, niggas busting on us 
Hit 'em up with the buck, 12-gauge eruptions! 
It's the Art of War, putting niggas on the floor 
When I'm coming through the door, bringing nothing but terror 
Causing much pain to the nigga that dared us 
Tried to put a twist in this thugsta era. Paired up 
With a nigga like Pac, and a nigga like me: gotta stay high 
Thug luv 'til I die, keep my prayer to the sky 
But I'm still in the hood, smoke and fry 
So I beg the Lord save us all: escapers of misery 
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries, soldiers of the century, yeah 
 
Here to get it, told my niggas they need get the hell 
Down with the dirt, and we don't fuck around 
Buck a couple a rounds, and if your passing through 
Then hit the ground and don't get caught up in the crossfire, nigga 
Artillery thick, and you don't wanna get to fucking with this 
I'm straight devil, not a punk and pretend 
I reload, buck a little mo' 
Flee the scene 'fore the po-po even know 
"So, who ya looking for?" They don't know! 
A mothafucka with a leatherface 
Hey, man, she said I ran this way, said I ran that a way 
Ya hoes'll never know because I got away 
A criminal mind to keep a nigga on the level 
Sometimes I get high and analyze your crime 
Correctly organized and with results, you'll be surprised 
 
Oh, nigga, can you feel the vibe? We can ride 
Playa hating niggas, you got to die, it's only right 
It's over with Bone, better leave it alone 
Mo Thugs come crack their fuckin' domes 
Still in the hood, where the thugs play 
Fuckin' with nothing but thugs, mane 
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses 
We cracking them domes around my way 
Give it to 'em on another level, nigga, get a shovel 
You can dig a hole; bitches is dead! 
Infrared to your head. You can beg, you go fled 
But still gonna bleed bloody red 
Fuck with mine, we'll be seen in the moonlight 
'Cause we out riding, looking for you 
Better run for cover, nigga, duck! 
We about to bust. Straight got the infrared, put it on his forehead 
Makes a move, send flowers straight to his home 
Put a card in the muthafucka, send it to his mama 
Tell her he was dead wrong, dead wrong, now he long gone, long gone 
 
Pac Pac run with us, run with us, run with us! 
Pac Pac run with us! Pac and Rip with Thug Luv 
Pac Pac run with us, run with us, run with us! 
Pac Pac run with us! Pac and Rip with Thug Luv 
Pac Pac run with us, run with us, run with us! 
Pac Pac run with us! Pac and Rip with Thug Luv

It's East 1999 time 
 
[Bizzy] 
I promise that I'll hunt you bastards 
Zip 'em in casket, here to get drastic, fast in a hurry 
Is you ready for me magic? 
Let 'em blast, and nigga, better burn 
Then move, true to the murder mo, gladly 
'Cause the haters never had to have me 
Want to follow fools through alleys 
'Cause ready to lose and daddy 
who raised me like Layzie, Krayzie 
Probably St. Clair babies, so hate me 
But I handle my business 
So lately I can handle my shady 
Kill 'em, but we think I'm a bomb again 
No leavin' as they put me in prison and give me time 
I'm ready for the gun to go get'em 
And I'm a fill 'em with eleven of mine and one die 
Is he ready to lie if I decide 
Lookin' at my killin's in his eyes and boom to go bye 
I'm gonna fly (fly) 
Whom die they lie 
 
[Flesh] 
Whom die they lie 
 
[Krayzie] 
No mo' mercy 
 
[Flesh]  
Whom die they lie (Shot) 
 
Now, who want to go snitch? 
Talk shit about real trues, still be payin' dues 
Saw them sneakin' 
And a nigga gettin' sick of all the players, they hatin' 
Why so many fakers runnin' they mouth about shit and they lose 
Lookin' so deep eyes, and tell it when they lyin' 
Stop tryin', but they never convince none 
Got hundreds runnin' up with gauges 
Still I'm sure they sure they fryin' us, but I buck 
Sometimes I save it, for me kill 'em off late at night 
So, what if it got too late for me to get 'em? 
Then gotta switch to testin' G's 
In this game I aim to keep away from every crazy steady 
we're too quick to pull petty bullshit 
y'all thought that you could fuck with the Cleveland thugstas 
number one fillin' his gun, and I wish you would 
Bitch, pop, pop and pump and have to show you through 
When Mo' thugs comin' in, it's a headline 
Time to get on top of moff top 
When they got on stages all over this nation 
World, and I plan on 
Now look at you busters get mad 
Beat the fuckers on their own line 
Don't make 'em tell it to ya twice 
When you crack a grip, keep it real 
But you should die, pay the price top 
Whom die they lie 
 
[Layzie] 
Whom die they lie 
 
[Krayzie] 
No mo' mercy 
 
[Layzie] 
Whom die they lie (Shot) 
 
Time to stick it for the thugsta, thugsta 
Little sneaky motherfucker on a mission 
Grind, be plottin' for it quickly 
Who fried? Do or die, nigga 
You and I for the creep on the come up 
And pay these niggas a visit 
So is it, was it, wicked ways 
Got me strugglin' for days 
Hey, a nigga's gotta eat, so yo 
I gotta get paid and blaze 
So swift not to catch a case 
Crept up in his place 
While the nigga was gone for his safe 
And his stones, and it's on 
'Cause the Bones havin' a say 
I won't forget this evenin' 
Nigga had thief, Little Layzie Bone 
Thievin', 'cause he had cameras hid off into his ceiling 
Pin me, niggas run away 
They said they lookin' for me 
But I'm a find a nigga killin' before this nigga find me 
y'all niggas know a murder-bound city 
See me when I'm servin' now, parlay it down 
Breakin' it down in the see-Town 
Spot 'em on the avenue, follow him passin' through 
Get 'em at the next red light, green light 
Got the go ahead, infrared on your forehead 
Whom die they lie 
 
[Krayzie] 
Whom die they lie 
No mo' mercy, 
Whom die they lie (Shot) 
 
[Krayzie] 
I'm that nigga with the shot and, red-hand 
Answerin' niggas, poppin' enemy 
Drop 'em 
Me gotta get 'em 
Kill 'em before they get the coppers on us 
And you know the bitches want us 
But as soon as they close, it's the pap pap, pardon me 
Take a look, and what you see; 
Krayzie still runnin' from the police 
'Cause I got a fuckin' bag of weed 
I'll be leavin' sale now on the scene 
I can do it, I can kill 'em if he gotta be a casualty 
He after me, but I'm a put a bullet through your head 
Should of fled, but you didn't, so bye-bye 
Take 'em a couple a days to get your body outta the sea 
Meet your fuckin' fate and in grave lay 
St. Clair, Wasteland, all my niggas comin' 
Oh but they can't take it, if you want to make it 
Break 'em, hey, or can't a nigga get paid 
Or your fuckin' with some niggas in some desperate days 
Crime, yes, it pays, if it's cool with it, cool with it 
Never act a fool with it, broad, 'cause your losin' me 
Tell a muthafuckin' nigga, 'cause a nigga told another nigga 
"I know who did it" 
Rollin' with the thuggish bunch of all 
Testin' nuts, and, nigga, we'll cut your balls 
It's Mr. Sawed-off, Sawed-off 
Whom die, die, whom die, die, they lie

Whom die they lie 
No mo' mercy,

Nigga get ya checks from ya broads, get high 
Then your broads sneak ya keys from ya niggas and ride 
Everybody want to party, even the niggas with a problem-made nigga 
We done solve 'em 'cause, bitch we'll squash 'em 
Don't know me, fuck you when you got beef 
But you also got to clone styles, and no motif 
See me rappin' on yo TV actin' 
And it's a fact that when you see us in person 
Think we gon' flex, or show you no action 
Down for mine, got to show a nigga time to time 
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme 
So they can understand I'm filled with so much anger and pain 
And if I drop, then I'll explode like a fuckin' grenade nigga 
Fuck calm, time to ring the alarm 
Breakin' niggas out of prison killin' all the guards (Woo!) 
Power to the people, givin' people the power 
To put it down in your city 
And fuck them hillbillies 
Nigga, I can't stand no 
Motherfuckin' po-po 
When will we start killin' these bitches and takin no mo'? 
Yeah, Mo Thug, the only clique that I claim 
Although we all beyond the bangin' you can say I roll wit a gang 
And dissin' chin checkers in the making 
So nigga continue with the rotatation (rotation, rotation, rotation) 
 
I say the war shouldn't stop 
Until these playa-hatin' niggas body rott (body rott) 
Nigga the war shouldn't stop 
Until these motherfuckin cops body rott (body rott) 
 
I heard. I murdered. 
I heard. I murdered. I heard (heard) 
Yeah nigga, we holler about all of the murders, look what they did to Tyrone 
Flippin' the flow and let it burn 
Without pistols, the police ain't strong 
Finna bomb, bitch, you fuckin' wit all the black gat peeps 
And in the 1999 when ya meet up in the end, be it be no peace for the police 
The (Biz!) here to rip the (streets!) 
And get 'em all (pissed!) 
Get up and at least we don't take (defeat!) 
Me steppin' (retreat!) 
You can lose yo arms, better use yo feet 
Jus pick up my cannon, nigga, yeah yeah 
Hear the pump, it erupt, we're corrupt as the four, down to buck 
Come and get fucked up and get up outta the county 
Nigga get rowdy (duck into battle) 
Disappear-pear, in a ally, reappear-pear, off in Cali 
Can you feel me, daddy? 
Proudly handle stuff like a man and went through shit in Cleveland 
With the band, now look at me platinum 
Fuck the rap, and corner bitch made hation nation, nowadays an occupation 
So why you hate me? Still can't fade me away, go on, be gone 
The point of view was made with the song 
And while they pop, I'm ready to bomb (bomb bomb bomb) 
 
I say the war shouldn't stop 
Until these playa-hatin' niggas body rott (body rott) 
Nigga the war shouldn't stop 
Until these motherfuckin cops body rott (body rott)

Nigga the war shouldn't stop 
Until these motherfuckin cops body rott (body rott) 
 
How do you see me when you see me? 
Drinkin' on Hennesy and Remy 
Look into my eyes, my shit is dreamy 
Beggin' to Scotty, won't you beam me up? 
I buck, twelve gauge erupt, disrupt your order, infantry 
Ya'll better expect annihilation fuckin' around with the SCT 
And I better be a souljah organizer, but they're lovin just us 
Army see, full of harmony, and nigga 'In Thugs We Trust' 
So nigga I bust, so back up off me 
Givin' no mercy, shit is critical 
Killin' you individual with a Ouija type ritual 
I'm diggin a ditch for all you po-po who felt you could come and raid me 
Ain't no way to be safe, nigga, this the army brigade 
So listen up and hear what's spoken as I start this locomotion 
Retaliate because we chosen, open showin' the Lord his devotion 
 
I say the war shouldn't stop 
Until these playa-hatin' niggas body rott (body rott) 
Nigga the war shouldn't stop 
Until these motherfuckin cops body rott (body rott) 
 
I say the war shouldn't stop

Now when you're fuckin' with me, make sure you know what you're doin 
Got niggas knowin', rollin' with me 
Infra red to yo head, don't beg, you dead, we fled, gotta get away 
Gotta make sure I'm free so when you need me I can buck another day 
It's a Bone thing, better ride ride 
'Cause when you fuckin wit, you gon' die die 
Don't be surprised, Bone want yo presidents, want to run it all 
Run all of it (all of it), fuck that dog, fuck that dog 
'Cause niggas is superstitious 
Nigga don't pull no gun if you ain't gon spit 
Click clack clack be the sound 
These police and haters is wrong, oh 
We buckin' 'em down 
Trust in me, in harmony, I try peace 
Eternally bless my soul, Lord 
And everybody that rides with me 
It's from me to you 
It's from me to you (me to you) 
It's just my point of view 
It's just our point of view (point of view, point of view) 
Yeah, and that's why I stay high 
So high, so high like ladi-da-da-da 
Ladi-da-da-da, so high, so high

Until these playa-hatin' niggas body rott (body rott) 
Nigga the war shouldn't stop 
Until these motherfuckin cops body rott (body rott)

Break break down, steady breakin' me on down. 
 
You called yesterday to basically say 
That you care for me, 
But that you're just not in love 
Immediately I pretended 
To be feeling similarly 
And led you to believe it was o.k 
To just walk away from the one thing 
That's unyielding and sacred to me 
 
[Chorus] 
Well I guess I'm trying to be 
Nonchalant about it 
And I'm going to extremes to prove 
I'm fine without you 
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind 
Underneath a disguise of a smile 
Gradually I'm dying inside 
Friends ask me how I feel 
And I lie convincingly 
Cause I don't want to reveal 
The fact that I'm suffering 
So I wear my disguise 
Till I go home at night 
And turn down all the lights 
And then I break down and cry 
 
So what do you do 
When somebody you're so devoted to 
Suddenly just stops loving you 
And it seems they haven't got a clue 
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through 
Do you cling to your pride 
And sing "I will survive" 
Do you lash out and say "How dare you leave this way?" 
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away 
 
Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon 
 
Well I guess I'm trying to be 
Nonchalant about it 
And I'm going to extremes to prove 
I'm fine without you 
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind 
Underneath the disguise of a smile 
Gradually I'm dying inside 
Friends ask me how I feel 
And I lie convincingly 
Cause I don't want to reveal 
The fact that I'm suffering 
So I wear my disguise 
Till I go home at night 
And turn down all the lights 
And then I break down and cry 
 
It'll break you down 
Only if you let it 
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind 
Tryin' to break me down 
But I won't let it 
Forget it (forget it) 
 
I be feelin' like you bringing me down 
Taking me around 
Stressin' me out 
I think i better go and get out 
And let me release some stress (stress) 
 
Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain) 
Hoping for the sun 
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain) 
Lord, I just wanna maintain 
 
Yeah, I can feel pressures y'all 
But never the less 
Krayzie won't fall 
It's over, it's ending here (here) 
 
Well I guess I'm trying to be 
Nonchalant about it 
And I'm going to extremes to prove 
I'm fine without you 
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind 
Underneath the guise of a smile 
Gradually I'm dying inside 
Friends ask me how I feel 
And I lie convincingly 
Cause I don't want to reveal 
The fact that I'm suffering 
So I wear my disguise

Give it to em, bring your gun 
Give it to em, bring your gun 
 
[Krayzie Bone] 
Get cha gun, get cha gun, did you kill 'em all? 
To death, death, death 
Fuck with the niggas with the guns and you might get shot, get shot 
Get cha gun, get cha gun, did you kill 'em all? 
To death, death death 
You could be the first to feel the heat  
To see how much we got, we got  
 
I still be the thuggish ruggish nigga 
Dressed in all black khakis, fatigues, and boots 
Still don't give a fuck about the law 
Still run with a pump in my car 
And fuck who you are 
You're fucking with a couple of niggas that's really insane 
I'm talking loco, crazy as hell 
It ain't just a name 
It's the game 
And we done loosened up a couple strings 
And shook a couple of screws loose in my brain 
Besides that, ain't nothin' changed 
Look at me now I'm still a thug 
Nigga I still smoke bud 
You know I still represent St. Clair wig split shit, nigga what? 
This is Bone Thugs niggas  
Thinking I told you but we put it down like that 
And whoever we got to fuck up to prove that we do it 
And keep on moving, guess who's back up in the house? 
Original Cleveland Criminals 
Niggas just send em subliminal messages like "murder, mo murder murder" 
Never forgot where we come from 
Watch how you move your tongue 
Cause I got niggas that's ready to jump off in your ass 
And smash and crash 
Protect my niggas for combat 
Leather face at ya and on your ass like I was a heat seeker 
Quickly the reaper peep you 
Sweep you off your feet in Cleveland 
 
[Layzie Bone] 
I be the smoothest little nigga you can meet me 
But nigga you fuck with me then I'm a fuck with you 
Introduce you to this heat 
I sweep the street 
When I draw down, let me hear you say "fuck the law now" 
Rawest niggas in the town 
Ready to thug and go down 
Go pound for pound, nigga that's the motto 
Let me see you throw them things and if it's real 
Nigga keep it real 
Show me your game 
I'm sure gonna claim 
What the fuck is mine 
My nigga I'll take it 
Grab a player hater by the neck, choke him out and try to break it 
Gimme your money, drop them keys 
It's a jack move bitch 
And since you haters ain't got no business 
That's how we attack your shit 
Nigga we'll smack your bitch in the middle of the Grammy 
And the media might ban me 
Nigga this Mo Thug Family is for real 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Bizzy Bone] 
Pull it up, sit up, get up and count up your money 
Before it all gets spent up 
And you want to get rid of 
A hood bitch with game 
And every bitch said I'm a good bitch 
Fucking with the wood grain 
Everybody still playing that hood game quiet 
Especially when it's tired 
My environment ain't nothing but niggas dying 
In them chemical fed injections in Jasper Texas 
Split up these niggas off in different sections 
Don't hate my message 
Destiny led to mimic 
Chastity for my daughter 
Wad up a niggas sherm  
And come listen to the sermon 
Swerving in my Surburban, lick it up with the bottle 
But everybody know I got some problems 
Had dreams of the Apollo 
The fiends had faith in me, suckers wouldn't run 
A nigga not insane 
Niggas still with me 
Bone, somehow they turn up 
Run up and get your sign 
Run blindly, elevate through time 
Nowhere to hide 
 
[Flesh-N-Bone] 
Our dawgs finna haul off lead 
Sawed-off head 
Nigga you dripping soaking with bloodly body be begging me 
You know what you should've capped like 2pac with a glock 
They're deadly, better not upset my thug mentality sucker 
You know you done fucked up 
Don't you niggas? 
Runnin up blastin gas craters 
What the fuck you thought you saw with your head in the sky? 
Could it be a bird or maybe it's even a plane 
For the untamed 
Insane human only the Fifth Dawg 
Fuck you thought motherfuck fame 
For the fact the shit is a phat game 
Going remain number one in the Land 
Flesh, strangle the gang 
Bang bang! 
Bang! 
I dropped five guards in the name of the Lord I say 
Now how many times will I have to slay today? 
Will I raise my gauge? 
Oh God! 
How will I teach yea, but it's these tactics that he daily practice 
They gonna let you 
Don't have it? 
Have it, running up you sons of bastards 
Blast it, we sons of assassins 
Match it, collecting more cash 
That's true, you're feeling that 
Niggas said all my babies get a million 
Struggle with a villain 
Hit 'em 
With a venomous blow! 
I call on my mighty archang-el 
Gonna surround my soul but go with the calico yo' 
We the tightest you know Mo, the Mighty 
Yes trues humbly united 
My family never divided 
Desperado, Thug Line, Mo Thug, Millennium, Seventh Sign 
For the FBI you want to come test my enterprise? 
Bitch you better go think twice 
And open up your motherfucking eyes 
These niggas can't fuck with the fifth dog finna parlay 
Everyday storming your way 
You better lay low 
So you might just duck when I buck gauge 
Can't you see my niggas having a ball all day 
Since we having a ball all day 
Motherfuckers player hate

[Bizzy] 
One, two look at the tally they drew my picture with Bob Marley 
They probably want to kill me will I die in 1999 smoking phillies 
Bizzy the kid was bustin' in the ceilin' in my big claim 
Kickin' on something and dig this 
Got to feel it catch and don't let go 
Wretched in a fro 
Bone watching for the po, po 
Roll over then pull it got my bullet in my fo, fo 
I gotta stand it's turnin' to a jungle (Green Bay) 
Comin' out a four door Benz and I spend a lot for show 
No no don't spend a lot contend with a men 
Lookin' at my watch like a meal ticket 
Arrest the block they couldn't pin it better send it 
For the cops absorb you soul of course 
Praise to the Pharaoh 
Murder Mo, Curly I heard it lower and return it burn  
When our niggas still shermed out 
Court's adjourned! Court's adjouned!  
Rest and burn! 
 
[Layzie] 
I can't sleep at night cause I lay in my bed 
And I be tossing and turning trying to avoid my dreams 
And I can hear the niggas letting off they lead around the corner 
Got me feelin paranoia like they coming for me 
And I be clutchin' my heat, got me pacing back and forth 
So much shit on my mind, so many things to do 
So little time a nigga really got to do it in 
Man I be ready for war in my fatigues and boots 
From the minute nigga step outside 
Nina Ross on my hip and I got to pack one 
Just like Little Eazy-E told you and me 
Nigga never leave the house without packing a gun 
And that's real leave it for the dollar bill 
Niggas'll holler "Kill Kill" then start flexin' 
When the shit poppin' off in my direction 
Nigga got a 17-shot for protection 
Life ain't no joke 
Too many niggas I know was takin' shit for granted and that's foul 
Nigga if you see a fool, pick a fool right out the crowd  
And hit him dead in his mouth for being loud and wild 
Shit is real 
Ain't none of that elastic fagot rubber band plastic shit 
Motherfuckers in the battle zone blasting shit 
Put the match on shit straight up gassing shit 
 
[Krayzie] 
Hell yeah! It's that same nigga runnin' with the AK-47 
Busting niggas in the belly 
Give them motherfuckers more than just a headache 
Get back at that nigga faster than FedEx 
They're running retreating screaming Mayday we're going down 
Now why the fuck is niggas telling lies and rumors?  
Talking about we split up 
Cause I see Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh 
Niggas really need to shut that shit up 
If a motherfucker really want to rumble we can tumble 
We wilder than any animal that's in the jungle 
The name of the game is block the basket, strike him out 
Hit the goal make the quarterback fumble strategize 
Any nigga hatin' ain't a friend of mine 
Nigga considered the enemy niggas that's when you die 
I never keep my enemies close 
Cause I got a perfect view of 'em in my scope 
That's close enough 
Leather Face'll fuck a nigga up and smile 
And hit 'em with the millimeter 
And I show a bitch kill a nigga see me driving 
Bitch come on and try to rob me 
I'm willing to bet that 'cha get lit up 
Get off of me baby (baby),  
Keep on comin' and there's gon' be drama (drama) 
Telling you niggas you better not fuck with me 
Cause I ain't that quiet nigga that I used to be 
Look how the haters give a nigga attitude 
Nigga sick of being humble now I'm like fuck that I gotta get mine 
They try to show a nigga love, but fuck that it ain't no love 
Cause in the game you get fucked every time 
Got this feeling inside my bloodline 
Somebody finna get fucked up! If a nigga don't get some satisfaction 
Blastin' like a madman 
Gettin' with the static nigga loving the action 
Yeah My Bone Thug niggas come on 
If any one of you niggas got any problems 
Thinkin' you tough and you really want to solve 'em 
Don't be mumbling speak a little louder 
While you steady talkin' like you liver than the next nigga 
We'll already be up in you now hater feel us  
Who the realest The Bone Thug killas 
If there's any objections niggas deal with 'em 
Realer than them other motherfuckers talkin' about they thugs 
Jumpin all on the bandwagon 
Want to be like us, want to cuss, want to bust they guns 
Thugged out with they pants sagging they actin' 
But when it's really time to show some tactics 
The niggas don't have 'em 
We murdered the bastards, putting 'em all in bodybags and caskets 
Drop 'em in the river, splash that's that ass 
Cause when we clash ain't no coming back 
Huntin' niggas from the past 
We gon' settle this shit right here 
Fight to whoever blood be spilled first 
Who will be the nigga ridin' away in a Hearse?  
Not me I'm determined to wake up and still be livin' in the morning you  
Feeling me 
Quicker than a clocked damn missile 
Hit a bitch directly in the middle, right between your eye 
Then we makin' sure that nigga die 
Shoot a couple more times and ride out (ride out, ride out)  
Nigga we ride out. (ride out, ride out) 
Nigga we ride out. (ride out, ride out)

You know it's funny, I got my guns, better arm yourself 
Most don't have a clue, if it goes down what to do? 
Don't you know this government ain't built for me and you 
I have a dream, no, I have a wish 
If we can't save ourselves, then let's save the kids 
Let the world go, let these babies have somethin'

Hell yeah, what's up my nigga, ain't nothing just out here grinding, my nigga you know what it is

Aw hell naw, man I got this new shit, man 
This shit called ecstasy, man (Ecstasy, what?) 
Nigga this tha shit, man (The fuck?) 
Nigga this shit will have you on the level 
With ya' female and everything, nigga, look  (Tsk, this nigga tripping) 
I'm-a give you one of these motherfuckers, let you try this motherfucker out, man 
And I bet you be calling me tomorrow talking 'bout you want some more of this shit 
Man, I'm telling you, shit have you on the level 
Man, you need to put the weed down fuck wit this shit 
Boy, I'm telling you, boy, I'm telling you (This nigga tripping) 
This shit'll have you on the level (Fuck it, gimme one of them motherfuckers there, man) 
Here, take that one and call me in the morning, nigga 
 
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, 'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy 
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, 'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy 
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, 'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy 
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, 'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy 
 
As you can see I took the pill (I took the pill), right to the house 
Grabbed a shot of liquor and pop, pop, popped it in my mouth 
And I'm thinking to my self that this might be a waste of my time 
'Cause what if I don't even get high 
Thirty minutes done came by, I didn't even seem high 
Until I stood up and looked at the ceiling for some reason 
Now I'm tweaking, then I tried to walk but I was slow 
I guess I'm floating in ecstasy (Just like the nigga told me) 
 
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy 
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy 
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy 
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy 
 
My name come alive, be told 
And I'm poking in something, oh damn but it ain't no joke 
Cut guards and red beans 
And for them niggas that follow me around for my mojo 
Feeling so see, 'cause I'm floating in ecstasy (Alright) 
My nigga just call up the homey to hook us up on that liquid G 
And if these hoes don't want to see, they gotta check the spot quickly 
I'm feeling way high, but I'm also feeling way low 
But damn I'm stuck in between 
Fucking with broad boys and never get used 
Just help, just throw in a few more 
Diablos, nigga Flesh Bone so chill 
I'm feeling it hump through my body, feeling hot and exotic 
Feeling knocked out, feeling too sexy for my motherfuckin' self! 
Gotta find my bitch and fuck her ass to death! 
 
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy 
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy 
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy 
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy 
 
Who's my nigga that told me the level? 
I started to see the devil, nigga was floating in ecstasy 
Shit, I took the pill, couldn't feel nothing so I'm breaking 
But about thirty more minutes later, nigga was on the couch fainted 
Arms sweaty, man why in the fuck y'all let me do this? 
I'm looking at my home girl like I want her, nigga this some new shit 
I realized, nigga took one step and started stumbling 
And I was trying to call my nigga but he couldn't hear me, so I guess I'm mumbling 
Fall off into something, but I guess I'm on a mission 
Telling my niggas that I love 'em now but it ain't nobody listening 
Whistling, hanging out the window, need me some indo 
'Till I let go, like, me silky fine-ine, ine 
Flown the expo, knock, knock, knock at the door 
But nigga was paranoid, so I grabbed my gun bucked it at the door 
Ooh-wee, shit happens, my family got me faded 
But I'm running a secret cous', 'cause a nigga can't take it 
Shake it, if I can but I blend in with the killers 
And I wish "E" was here to feel pillish (Pillish, pillish) 
 
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy (Come roll with me) 
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy 
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy (Come roll with me) 
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy 
 
I've been smoking weed for a very long time, why should I change? 
And plus they say that ecstasy shit fucks up the brain (Brain) 
Ah, why should I, just to get high, weed gets me high (Weed gets me high) 
"Nigga try this here," they said "better then that there" 
They say, "ya like it (ya like it)" so I tried it (I tried it) 
I thought the shit'll have a nigga high and horny 
I'm high, but I'm too high, I want to hurt somebody 
Nigga you tripping, get a hold of that shit, and ride that high 
But I'm tripping, body moves, won't nobody get hurt (Hurt) 
 
Groaning, groaning, groaning and she ain't even in the car 
Layzie won't believe we high off the LSD 
Would ya slow down, we riding on the highway 
Get the wheel so I can go down on ya, I sever it on my own way 
She reaching feeling so zigidy zigidy zigidy 
Got these bitches, fucking them bitches 
Baby be peeled off, peeling on, moving slow 
And Bizzy be rock hard, tongue well and mean slow 
We in the club drunk, fucked up, and still rolling 
They know my pockets swollen, hold up, show them we rolling 
We rolling, rolling, rolling and rolling, rolling, rolling 
 
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy and we rolling on that ecstasy 
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy and we rolling on that ecstasy 
And we rolling on that ecstasy, and we rolling on that ecstasy 
And we rolling on that ecstasy, and we rolling on that ecstasy 
 
Fuck it, gimmie a pill nigga

People ask me how do you maintain 
You got to keep your mind on money (T-H-you-G) 
Don't let the snakes ever short you for ya change 
Nigga, let 'em know how much you want it 
 
[Krayzie] 
Nigga 1993, hooked up with Eazy-E 
1994, rushing through the door with the Bone flow 
Nigga was creeping on a come up, doing it for the love of money 
1995 we really let 'em know, Cleveland is the city where we come from 
Brought styles motherfuckers never heard before 
But we never got our props  
'til we dropped that said song, see you at the crossroad 
But the man know, Eazy running with the lost souls, rest in peace 
That was 1996, we back in the mix 
I guess they thought that we'd gon' quit but we got love for this shit 
But everything started changing, business rearranging 
Then the time when Bone and Ruthless wasn't vibing 
Tried to keep my mind together through that industry shit 
Somehow I'm feeling like what I deserve I didn't get 
But I'ma stick it out, believe I'ma keep my head up 
And show my loyalty for Eazy E, even though I'm fed up 
1997 hey, everybody grab ya weapon, its the art of war 
It don't stop, it won't stop until we drop, body rott 
Not to mention when we venture through the family scriptures 
1999 nigga, still struggling 
Trying to get some money with this mastermind I'm juggling 
Sharpen up ya thug mentality 
And by the year 2000 I'll be thugging, but so immaculate 
I gotta get some money, blast if I get hungry 
So if you read that I done flipped, then you know the story, about me 
 
[Chorus] 
 
(Ed. note-I'm not too sure about any of this verse) 
Take a good look into my eyes, and all over my face your bloody death 
With a bloody bloody, mess, I'm serving you none the less 
? that crazy motherfucker from the world's most dangerous group 
Mo Thugs Nation, ? on your life 
That's absolutely what I'm gon' do 
Blast at them niggas who thought they knew me 
Now I'm that motherfucker that be ?, the nigga that bust all y'all 
My mission in life to be the coldest nigga that ever spit shit on the mic 
I'm coming in smooth, rocking this hip-hop music just the way you like 
Telling all biters to please stop trying 
Let it go fry fool, when I make my move all y'all gonna die 
Split up and fry, open his eyes ? pop,  
Shot one through his head 
Oh my, oh my, now look what you made me do, this nigga dead 
It ain't my fault, you niggas too soft, ain't got no skill 
Now look through the ?, stop steel 
Y'all some fake-thug living tryna get notice by hanging with stars 
No need to say no names, niggas know who the fuck you are 
We all true sound, nigga united gathering souls, how we roll 
And that's love for the paper, folding, I saw these hoes 
But I had my ?, nah nigga that's my nuts ? don't touch that 
And then he won't hesitate to buck for the love 
You can't dust on these bustas, so they die 
They only got love for those who love me 
In the meanwhile I main to keepin my mind on my money 
And no, this shit that we spit ain't funny 
Especially when you hungry, nigga 
With no hustle, nigga, to get them funds 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Bizzy] 
In '91 I'm running from the fucking cops, don't ya know it 
That bitch was trying to find a hiding spot, he show it 
Know niggas that'd had no pussy 
Said that would never read or get to L.A. 
And niggas went cannibal on 'em, either 
Smoking that reefer, niggas know how I'm living 
'Cause I was having children when y'all was looking for women 
But mine aside, so why you telling your same ? 
When niggas ain't have shit, tell me who's the one that ride 
We gon' ride ride though, you can call me Mr. Murda-mo 
Get ?, burn the whole store down all by myself 
? for fucking with the Bone flow 
Heaven and Earth, God and my loved one, and ya gotta roll 
And what you want my people to hear, that I'm a fucking sell-out? 
But who's the one on solo shit, and who want me the hell out? 
I'll bail out with a ?, that pussy makes me change 
Or expansion on the mansion or acres in the shooting range 
Shooting things (shooting things), it don't make you a villain 
The villain is chillin with his children 
Bitch, I keeps it real! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Layzie] 
I keep my mind on my money, my money on my mind 
A straight up soldier in the field out here pushin my line 
Nigga designed a gold crime as I'm racin through this obstacle 
007, Layzie Bone, knew it was possible 
Got shot, got out the hospital, started on my mission 
Listen, nigga pay attention 
Oh, and did I mention, had a tape before I crept on a come up, Faces of Death 
Blessin 40 o-z's, Lay and Leather face and double Z's ? 
Niggas often wonder why my mind on my money 
Nigga these bitches all up on me, and half the industry phoney 
It's like this nigga, I don't even fuck around 
If a nigga ain't got no money for Lay, I'll come around 
Ain't it funny how niggas turn funny-style 
When they think they fall in trinkets, ain't even ran a mile 
See my niggas doin a damn thing, Flesh 
Trues Humbly United Gathering Souls, just to let you know 
Heaven's Movie, yours truly, Mr. Gambini 
(Krayzie)It's the mentality, and next to the baddest, little Stevie 
And when you ask me how I maintain 
I watch my niggas rule, act a fool, and ace the game 
Mo Thug one, witness the Family Scriptures 
Mo Thug two, Family Reunion comin to get ya 
Mo Thug three, presentation of the mothership 
Niggas on some other shit, by smoke and maintain

We in the last five days of these trials and tribulations 
And I'm waiting for the Lord oh please don't leave me forsaken 
Caught up in the doom prepare for Satan 
We facing a situation while I'm drunk and scared 
Heavily sedated wonder will I make it to the pearly gates 
Or will I burn off in that lake now, 
Could you feel the earthquake shaking the dead awake 
How many wait it's too late it's over now 
Niggas had a lack of faith so life ain't straight, if you incapable, 
Having a little trouble a day with ah fiend or somethin' 
Betta plead to bloody Jesus 
Watch how the majesty control it 
Don't let it go slow down hold on 
Now can I get a witness shout Hallelujah,Amen 
I'm feeling the Holy Ghost makin' moves through ya 
Smooth, I made it to free your mind to the rhythm 
I got designed when the world drop dimes 
This world you'll fine there's no other like my kind

Code Murder One, Code Murder One, 
Code Murder One, Code Murder One

If the world should end today! 
Fully automatic gunning through it 
Gunning things, red rummed when strumming pain 
Mo murder, I heard 'em holla holla, clock dollars 
Swallow me baby cause we balling hollow point tips to the CI 
Enemies keep rolling, get 'em off that flaunted fluid 
Making me nauseous cautious these niggas is flossing 
My Nina Ross tossed out I'm slaucing 
It's for the auction rapper bop the copper got gospel on 'em 
Who want to magnum? 
Who want to tag 'em? 
Bag 'em up ain't no problem, baby(bitch) 
Smoked out in high school 
Sleeping the fifth grade selling chicken 
Gotta get paid we in the kitchen 
Cooking up grade and baby go on go grym 
Hold on, motherfucking gun 
Another fifth took one hood shot she split up 
Talking bout the get up for everyone ya lit up and hit up 
So huff and make it settle

You wit me nigga you wit me 
Militant minded perfect timing it 
Always on the incline ah shit 
Nigga that's down for the grind ah shit 
Keeping real niggas rewinding this, 
Deep in the ghetto in the streets ah Cleveland 
We call it thieving mind deceiving 
Hear the reasons for hustling season 
Bottom line money is power 
And the power mean muscle 
Money and guns stacked up to the ceiling 
Nigga get down for his hustle his hustle hustle 
Now nigga now what ya gon' do when they come for you 
Well I'ma tell ya right now what we goin' do 
Scream M-O-G and start blasting 
Nigga never did like them boys in blue 
No regards for authorities, 
want to dump ah nigga up with the ferozine 
Oh you invited to the bloody ass whore scene 
Know what I mean you betta get with the team 
Cause this is the soldiers ready for war nigga, 
We from way down under nigga been waiting for the day 
To let off these rounds it's thunder, it's thunder 
Got my mind made up, and if niggas str8 balling up outta control 
Just as those hoes nigga rose 
On ah mission tryin' ta get that dough 
Separated mine through prose, 
Open and close just like a case 
Place to place ya feeling ya safe 
HB all up in my face, 
And it just ain't safe it just ain't safe safe 
I'm knowing they want me to catch it in war 
Boy boy I seek and destroy any nigga that throw the decoy 
See me I'm stacked and ripping shit 
Taking off my shirt and breaking them sweats 
Tattoos all over my body 7 on the stomach, 
Skull on my chest, Nine millimeter in my pocket 
Ready to buck on the crowd, 
As long as that one little nigga 
Sagging and bragging and talking loud 
Talking about he bout it bout it 
Nigga I got yo whole clik 
Real niggas don't run they mouth 
Real niggas make moves and get rich 
 
[Flesh N Bone] 
Mobbing in ah Expedition 
Thinking of ah proposition 
Settle my composition 
Feeling relentless fucking up gun condition 
Mo murder competition, 
How many niggas on the front line 
Ready for whatever my nigga with yo tech nine 
Nigga disrespect mine, 
How will you lose the chalk 
For marrow rip through thine spine 
If you want to listen to what I say 
Hey gotta pay intuition, 
This ain't no free exploit of an exhibit 
Cause, my niggas, to exquisite 
I'm so Armageddon, just as my Smith and Wesson 
Here's a nice slug for you 
And my nitrogen glyc bomb 
Can land on them newly morgue 
I watch when they all come stormin' 
So when my one hit 'em up they fall 
Let off with ah little frustration bust my gun 
Bullets haul

I'm stuck in this penitentiary called life 
Deciphering wrong from right 
Dodging these institutions these niggas shooting 
Puttin' the oldest far from life, 
Facing a brick wall at a stand still 
Was it a dream or was it reality 
Now it's a nightmare hunting my sanity 
Thank the Lord up in heaven ain't mad at me 
It's sad to see I be bustin' my ass 
I'm down for my grind getting nowhere fast 
I'ma thug so you know ah nigga built to last 
To the point ah no return tryna' get the cash 
Feel mo' wrath, murder on the government 
War for the niggas on the streets 
It'll be no peace till the top dog eat 
Tryna' stop my meal you can catch this steel 
6 feet deep is where you be layin' 
Worms and maggots is where you be stayin' 
Desperado 2000 all about the money murder 'n mayhem 
I look at the niggas I went to school with 
Shot pool with was always cool with 
Same niggas I just can't fool with 
Niggas got guns and ready to use it 
So I'm trapped up against the wall 
Watchin' y'all niggas plottin' on me 
Tryin' ah catch me up in that robbery 
Put they mob on me and do ah job on me 
But I'm proud to be that nigga in the ghetto that just can't stay out 
Ain't nowhere to run ain't nowhere to hide 
And it ain't no way out

Could you tell where you run to

(And leaving yo family at yo people dog) 
When it ain't nowhere to turn to

(And ain't got no hustle to make that buck dog) 
Could you tell me where you run to

When it ain't nowhere to turn to

Together forever, 
I know they want to see us fall 
And if I had no money you would probably player hate me 
Selling dummies all dumb dumb dumb dumb 
Oh every, nigga don't want to see us with no money 
You won't see me when I've said it 
And if some come run only to visit 
No muse so if I told you would you tell me like you did it? 
I hate that wake that sucker up buck buck buck 
'N tell him to take that with him 
Now that we still thugging 
Spitting as we run away from prison 
Nigga we still running, 
But the bad bad boyz is still coming 
Nobody want to start this revolution, 
How could they be some soldiers you ain't neva been in no war 
The end of it, been training during, east time and least time 
Getting ready ah mind could learn to love it 
And when I release mine on the public 
Thuggish ruggish and plus it's all, real 
I put that on yo nine millimetre steel 
All judges, that's strictly real 
 
Could you tell where you run to

y'all ready for violence violence 
But niggas don't give ah fuck

Niggas learn the hard way should of stayed at home 
Got ah couple million on this uh huh 
Got ah couple million on that (that's right) 
Got ah couple million on everything we do 
Can you sell that? 
And it didn't come easy round our way, 
We had to hustle to survive and didn't eat some days

I'm stuck lookin' for the lost soul 
Niggas stucked at the crossroad 
Thugging with my people and I seen so much evil 
In the midst I hear you, but I fear no evil 
Crooked life revealing tick tock racing against my time 
Against my grind while you coming and stand here 
Nigga better wake up cause they're not blind 
While I live the thin line, between love and hate 
How many goin' survive Armageddon 
Just waiting to atone that day 
In the Roman gates here to make no mistakes 
Handle stakes and man Lord meet me half ah the way 
Kicking up dust thugging with my runaway slaves, for safety 
Livin' in ah world so cruel 
And I got nothing to lose 
Rippin' and thuggin' with Trues 
Smoking the sweetest cheeba drinking brews 
My motherfuckin' niggas killing when it comes to my screeler 
Bang bang I gotta stay down for my hood thing 
 
[Bizzy Bone] 
Never ask where the killers at 
Niggas run with automatic weapons 
All I really wanted was ah gun 
I never gave ah fuck and drop never one in the bay and had away wid her 
Bone's hitting all day with the Lay with ah play 
With the seven other niggas no protecting smoking hay what 
Would he pray with her would he pray with her 
Oh oh no no 
Stressin' henny got fiend and green and nicotine 
Noooo-torious bustin' wid my regime fiends all around me 
Ah genuinely pumpin' new millennium 
Thugs caught up brought up believe me 
Revelation to the station holocaust 
Billow and smoke the ozone, so 
Can't stand just listening 
Go on ah God like mission to live all the written inscriptions 
Nobody was gifted so many lifted spliffs been hold 
That's while I'm pissing 
It's nowhere to turn to no shit

Just believe what you saw 
Till I die, I'm down to ride in the war 
When you niggas get serious, let a nigga know, 
Maybe then we can roll 
Nigga bad to the bone, 
But I sure don't click with hoes 
And no busters, haters, or hoes when 
They poppin up at my door 
I get excited, all uptight, and violent 
Bitches was not invited! 
Put 'em in a coffin before they get me man 
Krayzie, loco, insane, bang bang 
Running with the pump pump, no bluffing 
We buck! 
Nigga better realize still claim 
Nineteen nine nine the nine nine 
Motherfucker, fuck?Em to the end, 
And when I run out, 
I reloading and bucking again, some mo! 
Nigga putting it down, worldwide 
Them wicked bad-ass thugs 
You punk niggas hate us, 
But we don't trip, 
We still get mad ass love 
I show you the rapper that's sick of this song 
We'll straight up toss his ass 
And if he flossing cash and jewelry, 
Rip it off his ass, 
Keep walking fast 
Thuggish ruggish till the day that I die, 
Fuck it that's all I been all of my life 
It's just t-h-u-g we be 
And it ain't no thing, 
Keep bucking bucking, 
Dumping, fucking 'em busters up with my gauge

Paper, paper, paper, paper, paper 
 
Time after time, 
Everywhere I look, 
Everywhere I turn, 
Niggas talking bout death 
Like a nigga can't dream of nothing else, 
But a lil' bit of wealth 
Trying to help they self, 
And I really can't blame you, 
Cause I do the same too 
Man do what you gotta do 
But what I'ma do is keep protecting my cheddar fool 
Ain't none of y'all niggas do it better, oh 
And I'm ahead of you and y'all hate it, 
Only the real thugs keeping it raw 
Gripping that heat tight, 
Living that street life 
Nigga I'ma let it fool round and get war 
Niggas is plotting that 2-11, 
That's why I got heat for armageddon 
Picture lay on his knees and I'm begging, 
Nigga better shoot me and send me to heaven 
Fuck all the drama, I'ma just blast, 
Hollow point tips off in that ass 
Tha slicka the nigga 
That's pulling the trigga 
Is the nigga that's standing up last 
Counting this cash, 
Still doing this mash 
Blowing much weed 
As we watch you bleed 
Nigga got killed for the love of the cheese 
Now you can't do shit cause your 6 feet deep 
Fucking with lay 
Is a game you shouldn't play, 
Even myself I could die today 
I could lie, but hey it ain't worth it, 
Shit, ain't none of us here to stay 
I'ma hold my ground, 
And I'ma lace my boots 
So when its time to shoot, then that's it 
Screaming out mo thug in this bitch, 
And bone thugs in this bitch, nigga 
 
It's all about money, yeah

Can't be fucking with niggas that ain't got none 
Cause lately y'all been acting funny,

Get out my pockets,

Four other niggas that I run with, 
You don't want to fuck with

Remember back in the days when we was fucked up 
But not anymore (uh uh, no, no) 
And ain't a damn thing come easy, 
A lot of planning, bus rides, and (eazy)

Y'all got ta clear this motherfucka off 
Curfew nigga, get ta fuck up outta here off my block

While I'm in the county I can die 
Flipped up my style-why as we came at the same time 
Baby tempted, in the tension 
Ouija shit got you demented 
Crash the Benz and ending your sentence 
Born for criminal defendants 
Critical breaking in the ghetto bar thinking 
Millennium shit like pestilence war and famine 
Animals move animals reputed 
Every daily grades let it be the reason 
My Cleveland niggas revolve like dead bodies 
In Eden leading seeping 
And I don't wanna rock the pump 
But I doubt it if I have ta pop the trunk 
I'ma get 'em when they thinking they miss me what 
Nigga that thuggish ruggish fuck them up 
Rolling wid my bucks in the biggest snatch shit 
All of my dogs all of we lie 
Nigga you touched and stuck on murda 
Smoking up bud and fucking up blunts 
It was the 7th sign regime 
Wid the nines and beams the philly and green 
Wid a clik tight team and a nigga like me 
Ya couldn't go wrong wid we 
Eyes bloodshot red when I floss instead 
I rather run up and smash you wid a passion 
And they chalking it off his head 
Nigga instead I'ma let them bleed 
Nigga, immortal warrior from the walking dead

But if you lie ta me and don't die for me 
Look in my eyes and see you can't hide from me 
Sleepwalk shit talk nigga

Now get on my level rebuking the Devil 
Representing like ah heavenly rebel 
Even though my screws loose I can tigheten 'em up 
And put a twist to the game like a monkey wrench 
For the funny shit 
All about the murda for the love ah money shit 
Gettin' paid, got it made in the shade nigga 
If you got and I want it I'ma take it 
Nigga made it and I told ya we'd make it 
Kept it real and it'd neva be fake shit 
Half baked and gone off this indoe stick 
Wanna hit it call just as you next

Feel my bombs motherfucker, undisputed round for round 
Putting it down, town ta town tearing the roof of this mother-fucker 
When I'm in your city get wit me fuck wit your nigga 
When I'm in Maui hoes around me still come fuck with your niggas 
But if you ain't talking about no money

To the apostle living a revelation set off the revolution

Can you feel it? (feel it, feel it, feel it) 
Do you feel the same weed high that I feel? 
'Cause I'm so high (reefer makes you feel that way) 
And I feeling so right 
Roll (roll), let's smoke, I got to get high 
I been high since the last song (off that la, la, la, la, la, la, la) 
And I just been smokin' and smokin' 
Smoke another blunt, roll another up 
You know that weed can really ease your mind 
Every time I smoke good reefer that indo high makes me fly 
If everybody smoked a blunt, relieve the mind, the world could 
Be a better place 
If everybody took a break and we all just got wasted 
Toked out (out, out out), smoked out (out, out, out), 
Choked out (out, out, out), pull another O (out, out, out) 
Let's get P-O-D-ded (P-O-D-ded, P-O-D-ded) 
 
The weed can't get no better (no better baby) 
 
Twenty dollar hollars, all day, everyday 
Come around my way, you gone want to stay 
Weed makes me hungry, happy, and all I can say 
Sure I need some more 
Don't make we wait, stay awake, fake sleep, 
Got the weed between the sheets 
Catch me, Mary J. blessed me 
Open up the dime, stimulate your mind, slide my thumb up the blunt 
Open up and what you'll find in there (you don't really want) 
I never been in High Times (I never been in High Yimes) 
I never been in High Times 
But can you tell me that I've been so high all my life 
Am I high enough (am I high enough) 
Am I high enough (am I high enough) 
 
I remember being a little thug 
Weed, really didn't know what it was 
Then I took a puff and I realized 
I should always, stay high 
The weed (the weed), makes me feel alright (alright) 
If you feel like I feel, I got half on yo dime 
If you got weed smoke it, I'm a real weed smoker 
If it's mine then I would 
Since its yours you could, you should 
If I ain't there when you blaze a blunt nigga huh, please think of me 
'Cause you know I nigga like to get high (high), high and free 
Smokin' all night, feelin' all right 
Bone Thugs get high, so high 
High, high, all night, high, high 
So high 
 
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my my my my 
I know you wonder why I do it 
Love the sky 
And I soar up so high 
This mornin' I was in my bed 
Bangin' and ringin' inside my head 
I wanted to make love to you baby, but last night I got P-O-D'd instead 
So please don't go away, that's all I got to say 
Is I gotta have you mary j 
Such a heavenly feelin' I get when I'm taking fat ass blunts to the brain 
Oh darlin' I'm going insane, and I really wish we can 
Kick it at home in America, like it was on in Amsterdam 
You heard enough, you heard it all, nothin' but a, a really thug nigga 
Nothin' less than a killa, I'm out in front makin' my scrilla 
I'm happy to know , the slide is the ball, and kick as strong as me 
You rippin' the bone like me, can get it as long as me 
 
And when I need to free my mind 
I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed 
Everything I need, leave it to the trees 
It can make me feel better, and every day I wake 
Niggas rollin' up blunts, and mo blunts, and mo blunts 
And I keep a case of Swisher Sweets in the trunk 
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin' 
Through the city in my drop top 
Glock cocked, rollin', just rollin' 
Me and Mary Jane 
Its my world, its my thang 
The way she penetrates my brain 
Buddah, done blessed me with game 
Good game, you want to chop it up, 
We can kick it, smoke a fatty to the dome

Introduce you to this heat

Rawest niggas in the town ready to thug and go down 
Go pound for pound nigga that's the motto 
Let me see you throw them things 
And if it's real nigga keep it real 
Show me your game I'm sure gonna claim 
What the fuck is mine my nigga I'll take it 
Grab a player hater by the neck 
Choke him out and try to break it 
Give me your money 
Drop them keys 
It's a jack move bitch 
And since you haters ain't got no business 
That's how we attack your shit 
Nigga we'll smack your bitch in the middle of the Grammy 
And the media might ban me

Before it all gets spent up 
And you want to get rid of 
A hood bitch with game and every bitch said I'm a good bitch 
Fuckin' with my wood grain 
Everybody still playing that hood game quiet (quiet quiet) 
Especially when it's tired 
My environment ain't nothing but niggas dying 
In a chemical fed injection in Jasper, Texas 
Split up these niggas off in different sections 
Don't hate my message 
Destiny led to mimic chastity for my daughter 
Wad up a niggas sherm and come listen to the sermon 
Swerving in my suburban lick it up with the bottle 
But everybody know I got some problems 
Had dreams of the Apollo 
The fiends had faith in me 
Suckers wouldn't run 
A nigga not insane 
niggas still with me bone 
Some how they turn up 
Run up and get your sign run blindly 
Elevate through time nowhere to hide 
 
Our dogs finna haul off lead sawed off head 
Nigga you drippin' soakin' with bloody body be beggin' me 
You know what you should've capped like 2-Pac with a glock 
They're deadly better not upset my thug mentality sucker 
You know you done fucked up don't you niggas 
Runnin' up blastin' big ass triggers 
What the fuck you thought you saw with your head in the sky 
Could it be a bird or maybe it's even a plane 
For the untamed insane human only the fifth dog 
Fuck you thought motherfuck fame 
For the fact the shit is a fat game going 
Remain number one in the land 
Flesh strangle the gang 
Bang bang bang I dropped five guards 
In the name of the Lord I say 
Now how many times will I have to slay today 
Will I raise my gauge 
Oh God 
How will I teach ya but it's these tactics that he daily practice 
They gonna let you 
Don't have it have it 
Runnin' up you sons of bastards blast it 
We sons of assassins match it collecting more cash 
That's true your feeling that 
niggas said all my babies get a million 
Struggle with a villain hit them with a venomous blow 
I call on my mighty 
Y'all can joke 
Gonna surround my soul but go with the calico yo 
We the tightest you know Mo the Mighty 
Yes trues humbly united 
My family never divided 
Desperado, Thug Line, Mo Thug, Millennium, 7th Sign 
For the F-B-I you want to come test my Enterprise 
Bitch you better go think twice and open up your motherfuckin' eyes 
These niggas can't fuck with the fifth dog finna parlay 
Everyday stormin' your way you better lay low 
So you might just duck when I buck gauge 
Can't you see my niggas having a ball all day 
Since we having a ball all day motherfuckers player hate

Jump in my 5 double 0 be -E-N-Z XL and I hit the freeway 
 
[Chorus] 
 
(Bizzy) 
? on Sunday 
Never know I might bust on you one day oh 
Swiggin' with jack and the bombay oh bye bye go po po  
Yeah nigga fuck you o hell yeah fuck you too 
Better than God devise realize you can end up bigger  
But my niggas in the middle ballin' we won't stop 
The foul sinnin' the killin' now 
And then nobody gets in the middle together  
And they tell the nigga it good to be back  
From prison but don't nobody feel him but them niggas around the globe 
And the mission was money was gold 
Everyone nutty when money because he was out of the gutter 
When nothin' but avid souls better make us and touch 
No one will touch me one wait till they ruff enough 
Got him at last but I just corrupt 
I don't even erupt  
Creep on ah come up, what up 
Trapped in a rapture the trumpets pumpin' tellin' us somethin' 
Snatch you we havin' a blast you tatterd like cattle 
And medalion diamonds in the ??? 
Ghetto was bastards runnin' much faster than the average asses in the shadows 
Out of the battlefield 
 
[Chorus] 
 
(Big B) 
Call me a secret weapon 
I think the war is on 
And when they ask em who is he  
It's 7th sign and bone 
Call me a secret weapon  
When the war is on  
And when they ask em who is he 
It's Big be and Bone 
Frontline soldiers

The name is Krayzie, big bad ass bone, 
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole, 
Along with some cash I even took the mayor's daughter, 
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with us so I brought her. 
Dun got myself into a whole heap of trouble, 
Double crossed by the law so it's nobody to run to, 
Yeah it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun, 
I dun now call him 'Leatherface' 
I'm headed for the west heard they got a couple banks in town 
That ain't been held up yet, well uh, I ought to make it by sundown, 
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown, 
So I continue my mission, it's gettin' dark 
So now I'm watching for them damn injuns, 
They like to catch up then they rob -n- split. 
I'll be a rootin' tootin' shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips. 
All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes, stopped my horse, 
Whoa Nelly! 
Who in the bushes, you better speak up, 
Or I'm-a let my shotgun's song sing out. 
 
Who's this? 
Hope this ain't the law, draw out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun. 
 
Come on out right now I'm gettin' angry. 
Took a step back 'cause it could get dangerous. 
 
Please don't shoot it's just me Thug Queen Horse Stealer. 
 
Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes 
 
I'm wanted in four counties, for armed robbery, 
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men with my head, 
Stole two horses, thought you was the law that's why I jumped in the bushes. 
 
Goodness. Now she was hotter than a barrel of fire but 
I could use her for the job so I told her to ride, come on. 
 
May I ask you what you headed to the west for? 
 
I got a partner got a plan for some dough and if you're down 
You can pick up yourself a pretty penny. 
Be in town in a minute now be sure if you're with it. 
 
We be up before the sun rise got a stallion here for your partner 
To ride hit the saloon before the moon shine down 
For whatever let's ride let's ride. 
 
These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona 
When we arrive we'll cop a place we can bunk, 
And meet my boy in the morning for details 'n hookup. 
 
You better count your money 
You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy) 
You better count your money 
You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy) 
 
Rise 'n shine, good morning, howdy. 
Nine o' clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley. 
Now I dun came a long way and I don't wanna be late. 
 
Tell him I'll make it to him, you know we ain't. 
 
Move out, giddy up giddy up giddy up 
Move out, giddy up giddy up giddy up 
Move out, giddy up giddy up giddy up 
Move out, giddy up giddy up giddy up 
 
You better count your money (Ghetto cowboy) 
You better count your money 
 
I'm peepin' Krayzie's 'Wanted' poster in the saloon, 
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon. 
Glanced across the room I seen this youngster gettin' ready to fight 
But if he mess up tonight I think that Krayzie just might take his life. 
So I approached him and I paused. 
Look man, I really don't wanna brawl, but won't you chill before them laws, 
Come messin' up this master plan, 
Since he already rowdy I'm just asked the man (Dang) 
You want some work well partner put in your bid 
And by the way now what's your name, they call me Layzie the Kid. 
 
The name's Powder Pete, can I get a twelve gauge! 
Outlaw every day, on the front page. 
Mister Kid, if you give me the low down me and Blackjack, 
Be ready for the showdown, with two double barrels pointed at whatever, 
We'll stick together, I'm pretty clever. 
 
So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon because it's all goin' down. 
I heard the guy runnin' the bar screamin' 'Krayzie's in town.' 
 
Now when we get to this saloon, you don't worry, wait outside. 
Don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses. 
Stepped inside the bar. 
Layzie Kid you son of a gun! 
 
Hey man I'm glad you made it safely, now let's go have some fun. 
And this my partner Powder, he's a young gun. 
 
Howdy 
 
Mighty glad to meet ya son. 
Oh yeah, you know I also brought a friend along, meet Thug Queen, 
The horse peddler, straggler, just met her. 
 
Howdy partner, already got the horses saddled up. 
 
I hope you're good at robbin' banks like you rustle that cattle up. 
 
Now y'all, it's gonna be gettin' dark real soon. 
 
I think you're right I say we move, come on let's. 
 
Move out, giddy up giddy up giddy up 
Move out, giddy up giddy up giddy up 
Move out, giddy up giddy up giddy up 
Move out, giddy up giddy up giddy up

And makin these hits stay move the streets

when I was 14 like cancer victims... (Bone Thugs) 
Uh huh 
Cause haters they get quarantined 
Women they comin' with sorcery 
I'm livn' with curses, smokin wed... (Bone Thugs 
Burn me 
Don't bury me 
Hurry 'fore my momma see me 
Somebody call Johnnie Cochran 
Some niggas they want to be Biggie 
Some niggas they want to be pac 
But I just want to be Bizzy 
As soon as they hear me????? 
Like Richard Sim-mi 
Don't run away, where's your nuts at 
It's the original hydro smokers, somebody bust that 
Trust that, what's packin'... (Bone Thugs)

[Krayzie] 
Nigga was born and brought up in Cleveland 
Cool quiet just like my daddy 
When I was thuggin' out in the alley 
With my boys in a stolen Caddie 
I was shooting the pree blowing some weed 
And every now and then I sip some Hennesey 
And after my niggas was busting we probably was looking for trouble 
Uh Oh here come the po po 
Y'all better toss that llello quick and tuck ya bankroll 
Don't think I forgot where I come from dog 'cause I know 
Cleveland Ohio for sure where we slang dope in the slo 
 
[Wish] 
I'm from the streets the streets of Cleveland 
Its mandatory you need it 'cause niggas'll catch ya slipping 
And niggas'll leave ya bleeding 
Fuck what they said about Bone catch us anywhere 
Grab a couple of my St. Claire niggas take us anywhere 
We don't care 
Handle that and take care of that 
If it goes like that then it goes like that 
It's Cleveland (Cleveland) 
Its mandatory to leave these niggas bleeding (bleedin) 
And you could never hate against Bone you wrong 
You know we brung it on so strong 
 
[Layzie] 
We get em, split em, we hit em 
And Bone been the shit since I could remember 
Before most of these niggas even thought about rap 
We was screaming out no surrender 
With a gat in the hand running wild in the land 
With a pocket full of boulders 
Po po know they can't hold us 
When they east dog coming from the shoulders 
And the older niggas they told us 
You gotta get down fo yo hustle 
Got glocks to show you this muscle 
Get the money little nigga don't struggle 
That's no bitch nigga that's the rules 
All my Cleveland niggas said to me 
They're the ones that gave this game to me 
I'ma push this shed to the head ya see

Ya better believe Syann I be scared when I was there 
Nigga you know I ain't going nowhere

When I went to Cleveland they said where you been 
When I'm unconditional with my loving

It's all about money ain't nobody frontin' 
I gotta go get it we gotta survive 
Whether it's workin' a nine-to-five 
Or ridin' the hustle I gotta get mine, bottom line 
 
Most of my time I'm out here puttin' in work 
For all of my days that I run this earth 
I'ma make it count for what it's worth 
You never know about this life and the type of pain that it can bring 
 
That's why you gotta get off of you're thing 'cause it ain't no dream and it ain't no game 
We so serious, dogg you know it don't stop 
I know time is the devil's workshop 
 
See I do it I did it 
And why y'all know that I'm wit it 
I'll give anything for passin' and take to it back 
A hustlin' little brother with crack 
 
But now I grind a little bit harder 
Harder my niggaz stories in order 
See, it was hard for me momma 
My mother dropped in the water 
 
My sister was damn fast, Heather was right behind ya 
Cassie, that's my little sister 
My father loved you like the only child 
Funny, he ain't never seen my smile 
 
You gotta get up, get out and get something

You better get on yo grind 
You better go get it if you really tryin' to shine 
You better be keepin' yo eyes on your prize at all times 
Keepin' it real for my all of my thugs in the projects 
 
The niggas that ain't got shit 
Not havin' this nonsense my niggas 
My momma said, boy if you ever want to be anything 
Get off the couch and out my house, use your brain 
 
So I took heed and I jumped right up on my feet 
Got off the streets and I'll be 
In heat I'm laughing at police now 
 
Coming to you like this 
This used to be child 
Is now a grown man 
Don't play with the wrong hand 
 
But I never could quit 'cause I'm playin' a strong man 
Everybody got a point to prove you might as well start today 
Rather than puttin' it off tomorrow 
You're lettin' it slip away 
 
Lil' Lay, I parle 
And get paid, and that's all 
And I creep and I rise 
In yo eyes I still ball 
 
And stand tall with my chest 
And my cheek to the sky 
I'm in it to win it my nigga believe it until the day that I die 
So come on

Anything you want, anything you need 
You gotta get it, yeah and go get it 
Ain't comin' to you, you gotta put in your dues 
Show the world that you can do it 
 
Don't let nobody hold you back 
So you better get your hustle on 
Baby better get your hustle on 
You better 
 
We some of the livest, you know 
True thugs don't really mind to riot, let it go 
They sayin' get up and get it 
Yes we went and did it 
 
You won't admit it 
'cause you hatin' 'cause you can't get it 
Every since I was a young thug 
Been creepin' showin' mo' love 
 
Even when I got it you best to give it up 
It's Cleveland, until we get what we want we ain't leaving 
 
This is what we want with no chumps, please believe it 
You gotta get up, get out and get something

Thirty million sold and that I'll just stay at that now what about that 
Listen to the thuggish 
And listen to every other rapper rap about who that come from 
Talkin' Bone fell off 
Say what they bust just like us 
They ain't even knowin' were it came from like richer niggas 
They ain't going to give it to us so we gon take it

Put up yo money honey what ever ya got we won't lose 
Put up or shut up 
Get slapped in front of all your dogs 
And all your dudes 
Cause I'm a smarter thug all ways wanted to be a thug 
What do you think 
Do you think he gon do something 
Don't let the money fool you 
Don't let the money do you 
Cause it ain't really about nothin' (nothin') 
Its just so much they gon let in 
Toss that we gon show you who you are messin' with 
That's why I started a war in this rap game 
You got to hit hard

When we meet on the concrete jungle 
We can do it 
We can rumble 
Take it to the streets 
And let the whole world crumble 
All I ever seen was heavy smoke in the air 
Bustin' heavy shots 
They just don't care 
If you don't then I'm goin to get all the bloodiness 
Niggas want peace but I know they all goin' test us 
The thugs comin' back to bring the thug essence 
Thugs comin' back to bring back the thug blessings 
For the lord where doin' to fight the wind 
I'ma fight to get them all hyped again 
Tell the Bone Thug story again 
If a nigga still hatin' a pipe again 
Like I did before creep creep and I came 
Just four more niggas down for there thing 
Never been afraid to let my nuts hang 
How to you think Bone Thug made it to the top of the game nigga

Coastin' on freeways keep rollin' till we hit the ocean

Pullin' pop up bitch nigga if you talkin'

I been stuck in the struggle 
And I been wonderin' if I'm ever gon' bubble 
I'm gettin' caught up in the dust 
Instead of usin' my muscle 
And every time I extend my heart to my mother 
Caught up in the game now I'm back up in the hustle 
Sometimes I sit and I wonder 
If a nigga pull my number 
If it wasn't for the Bone Thug fam' 
In this world where nobody don't give a damn 
But I'm still a man 
Got a soul program 
I'm a pump my fist 
I'm stayin' ready for this 
And you can put this on Wish 
I never stayed in ya buis' 
And when I needed a ride 
You wouldn't give me a lift 
And now I'm poppin' my cris 
You niggas all on my dick 
I want to change the world 
You want to change ya life 
I wouldn't a put up a fight 
If I knew it was trite 
They say everything happin' for a reason 
Can you tell me why these niggas bleedin' 
Needin' general assistance 
Out here needin' public housing 
Out here trying to make ends meet 
Tryna get on their feet 
But see so cloudy 
And I know what you don't know 
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough 
See the real niggas ready out here taken control 
See I'm screamin' out Mo' 
With my pockets on swoll 
Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house 
Quit bringin' distrust to my spouse 
Casuse I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out 
If you niggas try to run up on the Bone 
I'ma show you like this I'm a pull out my chrome 
I don't want to have to send a nigga home 
Lord please take me home 
Come and take me home 
 
[Chorus: Phil Collins] 
Take, take me home 
Cause I don't remember 
Take, take me home 
Cause I don't remember 
 
[Krayzie Bone] 
Home, Home, Home, Home, Home 
Home, Home, Home, Home, Home 
Please take me home 
When I'm lookin' at my money now 
Livin' foul 
I was runnin' wild, surviving 
Cause I'm nine-to-five 
And even puttin' overtime if I had to grind 
I was stayin' up, slangin' up, hangin' up on the block 
Duckin' the cops clocked on the night-shift 
Didn't think I'd ever make it out, out, out of the ghetto 
But we finally made it 
Stay dedicated to the music we made yeah 
Now it's on Bone Thug 
Leave alone, came back the next year 
Number one platinum song it blew up from the go 
And what do you know (Oh no) 
Eazy, rest his soul 
Left us in the mess, I don't regret it 
But we better get up and get it, go 
Everything's gon' wrong 
Especially Bone, it never been right 
I knew it would of been on 
We would of been tight 
We would of been in the zone ridin' so high 
Up in the game fire, does, lie 
See we used to love makin' music 
We was always in the studio, groovin' 
We kept it movin', we was ready to do it (Right) 
But you know I'm goin' through it 
And ain't feelin this rap thing right now 
They got me trippin' ready to flip 
They got me trippin' ready to come get my chips 
They got me trippin' loadin' the clips 
They trippin', Lord I feel like I'm losin' it right 
Now (Right now, now) 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Bizzy Bone] 
I'll never give in 
I'll never give up 
I'll let 'em live in 
They sinnin' 
They pretend to be tough (Pretend to be tough) 
Pretend to be blessed 
They want money and women, it's never enough 
Hope nobody knows just too much 
You better be good, you know up in the hood it's so, 
We give 'em the dough 
Fired out, laughin' up 
When niggas died, niggas brought around nasty junk 
And to the grave, I been one of the brave 
Not one of the slaves 
And I'll be one of the same, stay hatin' the fake 
On the television runnin' 'round tellin' niggas be ready for hate 
Guard Leathaface and the grin right up under my face 
I steady debate the pain that I bring with hate 
Sweet as the cake, I take another puff and shake 
The smell of right it's all about guarding, guard the weak 
Lost mommy, poppy left home 
I miss Wish' Uncle Charlie 
Sit list in the back tellin' his selection 
His date is probably 
Probably my mommy, song 
Cryin' for the life of you gone 
Just me and my destiny let's roll, let's roll 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Wish] 
When I lost my Uncle Charlie a part of me went wrong 
And it happened when the Bone was comin' up so strong 
We just wanted him to see what we do 
You motivated us at the shows we see too 
And I really hope you live through what we spit on the song 
You might have through somethin' hopin' nothin' like Bone 
Like one said we'll never make it 
Like two, thirty mil in they faces 
Crossed over, back to the hood we souljahs 
The music nigga make it back, scandlous 
But faith kicked in and the world shows and we winnin' now 
Gotta keep it comin' fool in my baby's mouth 
And things have changed like relationships 
Ain't did nothin', now you want to flip 
Suin' people things you would've never made on your own 
Now I want to stay, watch thug niggas leave the hood 
Bye, think I'm home 
Stick in the hood, mess with scrubs, it'll all be gone 
You can really help a buster if it ain't meant to be 
Wit a little ooh wee, wit a little ooh wee 
I'm tired of tryin' to help these thugs 
Lord just guide em' home, guide 'em home

But don't you give up its going to be better times if you believe just believe 
 There's no tellin' what you receive  
If in proof just look at me, look at me, look at me 
And you got to love this gift we been blessed with. I do 
Number one and nobody can touch this you know 
Gotta hit my knees and let them know I thank you wit out you 
Where would I be

Don't want to live wrong 
And no guarantee you gon' make it home 
What go around come around 
Everybody know its real when you speakin' tha carma 
So do on to others like you want to be done like Mary J no more drama 
Ima paper chaser believe that walkin' on the ground is where I plat my feet at 
If it's not bout money don't need that 
You can keep that gossip can't you see that 
Stay locked on my mission  
'cause most of these niggas in the world ain't thinkin' bout the future 
Young black entrepreneur 
And I'm out to get more 
So baby open the door  
Nigga gotta let me in 'cause I'm getting it again 
And I said I was going to get dollars 
And if it's not about cheese I holla 
Fuckin' with a nigga that's way to pollish 
And if the road get to rough imma stand my ground 
Keep my faith and call on the lord 
And I don't hafta worry no more 
Even if I fall

Imma be a soldier  
Runnin' from gun shots for the day I see Jehovah 
You think you know us 
Even though you want to 
Don't think I'm in it just because of crossroads 
And grab a grammy and did nothing for my family 
This artist is half ass and scared to tell the truth 
And I'm heartless niggas and I think he's raising to you 
To the fo who thought that someone was bullshitin 
And admitin' you sayin' anything 
Up lifting within' the distance that the kids that use to listen to the don  
Better prepare old English and essents of a mission never relied on county and prison 
Messin' up my kitchen 
Better be survive in you 
Treated  these prisons  
Trinity is wating for you 
Baby swallow and ride 
And let me get a ride

Nigga be hurting, life'll be hurting 
But nigga for certain, this is the game 
Man don't let them win, never let the system think they got you 
If you relentless they can't stop you let em hang, they gone watch you 
Yeah we the enemies of the world, won't let no territories homie 
You got to get up, get out and get something, that's what they told me 
Back in the days didn't have a pot to piss, went to throw it at em 
Now I'm balling doing my damn thang, laughing at them dollars 
Holla holla, if you hear me shorty, I'ma live everyday 
Like it's my last, only the winner gone get the glory 
What you thought I play for keeps 
Put it down wicked in these streets 
Heavily armored with the heat 
Just in case a nigga want some beef 
Being broke I know the feeling, that's why I'm paper chasing this cash 
Better be smart and keep a stash, never know how long it's gone last 
You do the math, hustling niggas multiply like mountains 
Bone Thugs, Little Layzie 30 million and counting, come on 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
Money money, the mighty dolla dolla 
Got to get my grind on, grind on, grind on 
I don't want to be broke no more 
 
[Bizzy Bone] 
You ain't worthy, none of you niggas could stop me 
And none of you niggas could hurt me 
If worse come to worse, I'ma get down and dirty 
Though the Ouija can't curse me, NWA 
Eazy E, that's the nigga that birthed me, hey 
Thug style motherfucker, live forget ends 
I'd never testify, Satan can't divide my piers 
No weakness inside my fears 
Drop tears, for niggas that died 
I'm gonna safe divide, mind gone 
And I think I'm running out of time 
The god damn baby's daddy 
And I'm gonna damned to hell, if I don't abide 
and that's why I yell, B-E-N-Z we ride 
Straight to the corner, down to the side 
In the B-E-N-Z we 
Roll around the corner with the F-O-R-T 
S-C-V, and a nigga can't fuck with me 
Not even the devil with B-O-N-E 
T-H-U-G spell it motherfucker 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
[Wish Bone] 
Scandalous, straight up out of the hood type nigga 
Stick up's, robberies, do we did gives a fuck nigga 
See all ways to money so we mashing, we dashing 
Get paid around parting give me twist a thug and I get up, in that ass 
I'm here to get that money keep it coming, show me love 
We made this, gotta get mine want to slip, it's about mine 
It's harder to get, I'm serious not playing that's the pay wits 
The streets have come back, real fast on that ass feel me 
Cause I don't want to be broke no more 
Standing in front of the liquor store with rocks no more 
Cause my man, never had nothing to done that 
It's like reversing time on my mind I can't go back, fuck that 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
[Krayzie Bone] 
I came up a nigga that never had nothing but hard times 
I was always grinding, and talking up out of the hood 
Into the bullshit, but I'm surviving 
I got to get me some money man, put it down for the General 
A nigga'd rob your ass, if I caught a nigga flossing cash 
What it was four niggas, and we punk niggas 
But you no niggas got us scared, a couple more green 
To get up for everything reach the scene, clean 
And we was the niggas that stood on the block 
With a couple of rocks and a glock with the cops 
Can't nobody have the nuts to say our name 
They call me the Dummy Man 
I'm sell him a fat twenty piece and then I reach for the bomb 
The things they get awfully man 
want to see what I put them shit come 
Took em for they last dollar, holla 
Man I ain't giving a fuck it's do or die 
So get on the ground, lay it down 
Give me some money my nigga POW 
I ain't waiting I need it NOW 
Ain't too much changed 
I'm still on the grind in deuce double O deuce 
I'm just a little more serious 
Bout my reefer and my dough 
Show me the money 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
[Wish Bone] 
Let me hear you say make money, money 
Make money money, make it 
Let me hear you say take money, money 
Take money money, take it [Repeat: x2] 
Take it

You know, why me? 
 
[Krayzie]  
I guess you blamed it on the wrong nigga, it ain't mine 
I took the test and the results read it, you was lying. (bitch you was lying, lying) 
But you was crying in my motherfucking face 
And all the while telling niggas how you fin to get paid off Kray' 
Thought you had a bone 
Bitch got shit all wrong, a y'all know 
I was suspicious from the front door, (front door) 
Wasn't surprised when the ho took me to court and say she want do 
Now the bitch has got the people in my business, (all in my business) 
They come to find out, ain't even one of my children 
You illin, playing with these kids man 
You're dead wrong, got this baby calling me daddy 
But daddy's a unsolved mystery 
Cause apparently mommy ain't caring what she sleeps now 
What ya gone do? 
Tell her the truth or say I left you, like ho's do

[Layzie] 
I should of knew your ass was drama 
Round here telling everybody yous my baby mama 
Saying I'm a buy you this and that like I'm your fucking sponsor 
Look your honor, I ain't paying a dime 
Because that young'n right there mine 
I ain't lying, I ain't no deadbeat daddy, with intent to be neglecting 
All I wanted was some sex, but now she trying to get a check 
But baby hold on won't you wait a minute 
The DNA a read negative, fucking these chickens ain't no way to live 
They trying to get up in your pockets and break you down 
For 18 years, so who raping who now 
Ninety-nine point nine percent not 
I mean I ain't that baby father, I ain't gotta be bothered 
With all that bullshit you stressing me with, testing my wits 
I'm just about to slap in the clip, and do me a bitch 
I'm through with this shit, I keep it real with my lady 
Now you chickens that play me, don't knock that nigga little Layzie 
 
[Child]  
Catch 
Mo-mmy, hey mommy where's my daddy, where's my daddy? [Repeat: x4]

I chip in, cause I'm chilling enough 
Making millions, she wants some do, bitch no! 
Go get a J-O-be	 
Willing to help and I, help yourself for sure 
I better play daddy 
Coming out a woman in which she never had me 
Sadly, always in transition leaving gladly 
Shit, I tried to be the papi 
Nothin 'gainst the baby, momma can't make me happy 
Fuck yeah I'm crazy, my father never knew about me 
I was young, while another man mad at me 
I got no real fam, maybe it's swelling straight 
God I love you Lay', no one get in the way 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
 
[Wish] 
Why can't we pressure these broads, the way they pressure on us 
That paper came and it read that nigga wasn't my son 
Why can't we counter sue these bitches on the way they do us 
Test one, test two, said I wasn't the one 
So you can cancel that money! 
Ridin'!, and flossing my money! 
Oh, I know you had a plan, lovely! 
I hope the real baby daddy live his life, y-eah! 
And you can tell your little girlfriend to stay out my face 
I see you ain't told her the results of what you got in your case 
You get's nada, what you ain't heard 
I ain't the real baby's father, not a dollar 
I guess the best is the best, somebody would of got hurt 
Cause I ain't paying for nothing, I got for free with no work 
You so scandalous 
Heard about my Benz, look they came and tried to relate us

(What about us?) What about my niggas still out on the street? 
(What about us?) What about my partners doin' time? 
(What about us?) What about this arresting from the police? 
(What about us?) What about my young thugs cry? 
 
It's for my incarcerated niggas 
That stuck in the pin they coming home 
Gotta stay strong cause you ain't alone 
Remember you always got love from home 
They steal this pain and may not know it 
I'm a boy and I gotta show it 
I hear them cries from the babies 
I wish they had a chance don't want to blow it 
But unemployed for all the little girls and boys 
You got'sa, love your mom and daddy 
And make them wonder why you give them ploys 
Oh boy, its getting deep but more expensive then ever cheap 
But what about that little nigga running the streets 
Making a living through his beats 
What about these whack ass politicians 
They don't care if we live or die 
What about that elderly barely breathing, gotta survive on SSI 
They say America, it's the land of the free and home of the brave 
It's mass hysteria, so bring your knees and hope we can fight 
And if bury us, at least we can live as we believe 
Dog ain't ever gonna break our pride 
Ain't nothing you can do to keep us weak 
And all of my soldiers come together 
Get on your feet and get ready to bust 
What about this war against terrorism (fuck that) 
And what about this war against us 
 
[Chorus] 
 
What about them thugs that's dead and gone 
What about them thugs that ain't even grown 
What about them thugs that out here lost 
And ain't ever gonna find their way home 
Suspicion got you furious, so grab your shit and listen up 
It's violence and violence, it's the only way their gonna respect us 
If it's this system, in the ghetto back far to one place one time 
Know we gone, how they sleep at night if they know they be lying 
This shit we deal wit', we young black and fit less 
Living in the ghetto to ghetto and ghetto 
to ghetto cause ghetto is all we know 
They beat us down for dumb shit, they lock us up for dumb shit 
Find out that I'm innocent and still gotta fight for money they owe me 
And they wonder why we riot in the damn streets 
They can't hold us down we getting all that money 
And watch what I tell ya, everybody wants some 
How they get it they don't care 
Try to kick it when you spittin' real smooth 
But they listening in my business trying to fuck up my move 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Dead niggas I've been to war 
Been tall with shit I seen it all 
Like soap operas from ghetto stars 
I can tell when rappers getting bored, really 
Sometimes she a bitch sometimes my lady 
And times when niggas die she help like I was a baby 
The simplest things in life were always the best 
Breathing your ass back inhaling when chronic in your chest 
Hey somebody call my momma and help me one more time 
Before I die my momma she carry me no comma 
Niggas bitches and drama 
I recollect walking and stoppin' 
Cops not even checking on me, juvenile delinquent 
And baby y'all be respecting me 
The B.O. it taking me in 
Whether we saving fuck the last thing we did 
And let the cops see all the shit that I did 
Like spittin' on them foxies skied up 
In the palm of my dick 
This is the life that I love 
This is the life that I live 
And it's a life full of lust nigga 
 
[Chorus] 
 
My partner called me after court 
They said they got 25 to life just for slingin' some dope 
They making some cheese just to feed their folks 
And they like somebody won't go home 
Its sad cause its sadder for us to get caught up by the po-po fo sho' 
And what about our boys and young girls 
In their wicked young world 
Coming to school wit' heaters bustin' their teachers 
Whatever happened to family and humanity we possess 
What about our babies, that struggling in this mess, don't stress 
Crooked coppers scaring the niggaz off in the hood 
What about them niggaz that get blown off this block if they good 
See most of the niggaz still on the street 
Still struggling and hustlin' trying to get something eat 
Some of them resting in piece and some will never get free 
Bone Thug gotta show love, keep it real and really real 
And let 'em know about us

Clear, but you couldn't see or hear Flesh slowly creepin' in  
Silence. Know it ain't over, took you over, (decrepitate) in your  
Grave 'til then only Mo Thug. The violence trippin' in and out  
The insane asylum. Livin' life and goin' to Hell. Police, they trail  
And want to lock me up in a cell, 'cause I stay high, smoke,  
Inhale. And I play ready with an AK-47, no thang, I'm a set it off,  
Aim and spray. Anticipation'll get you slayed, but what if he  
Hesitate? Make my day. They lay, any day, any fool, if he choose to go  
Pick up a tool, and do me in. Well, then, come get  
This shit done and over with, partner. Must've been one of my friends.

[Chorus] 
Now you can call me when you're chilling all alone 
Or being naughty cause your nigga not at home 
All you gotta do is holla to the phone 
And I'm a be through there with some good tree to blow 
Plus you're telling me your dude ain't been servin' ya swell 
So I'm a hit it real good and provoke ya to tell 
If he's a player then he knows the rules very well 
Nigga, you're broad chose me, she rollin' wit' me 
 
I said Kid pick me up a sack I'm on my way 
With a little sticky icky and that potent Bombay 
You can jerk me, call me, hit me on the cellular 
I'm slidin' though so quick I'm so into her 
Baby girl you keep it jumpin' 
And I love the way you do that little thing with your tongue (Yeah!) 
Forever realer than the rest of them niggas better believe baby girl I'm the one 
But hold on let me answer the other line somebody calling me 
DJ Ice's hittin' me 
Baby you know how the ballin' be 
See he got Stevie on the phone 'bout a show for 20 
Communication rule the nation baby I got plenty 
If you don't mind I'm a head outta town 
When I honk the horn twice I need some head to go down 
Take that frown off your face girl I'll be back soon 
Don't have that line disconnected I'm a need that soon 
 
[Chorus] 
 
See I was in my black 'lac 
Laid back like a fat mack 
She pulled up in a black ac 
On top of that she brought a fat sack (I'm in love) 
Said my boyfriend's been cheatin' and he left me all alone 
I saw your number in my phone 
And I was just thinkin', hopin' me and you can zone, go and zone 
I said yeah I just say you can call me 
I'm just playin' girl I'm really glad ya called me 
We can cruise, sip some brew or go straight to the telly 
Pop some lead and let's get ready, swear you'll never forget it 
It's all about you and me 
Movin', creepin' just for one night 
All it takes is one night 
To have ya really down to ride 
And I ain't even tryna turn ya on girl 
But it's a wonderful thing to bone the world 
 
[Chorus] 
 
I'm a beat it, beat it, beat it up for ya 
Beat it 'till ya go to sleep 
Girl ya better call me 
Tell me when you playin' wit' 
Call me when ya fingers wet 
Girl, girl ya better call me

And I'm a hold mine 'till ya get it 
So put my number in that phone 
And don't ya forget it 
Don't ya not dail it 
Don't know what ya missin' 
Not braggin' but I bet I can take ya there 
I know ya love it come here and I'm a make ya forget 
Just for a couple of hours, shower, you can go right back to ya life, just holla 
When ya need me I know I got ya number girl 
Scoop through grab you and I'm ready out on the ones 
I'm coming tonight 
I got what I want and she hold it, so glad she caught it 
Real thugstas gon' do what I said, grab bread 
And then I'll be right there, call me

Fire! burn, baby, burn!

Yeah, we got that fire! burn, baby, burn! 
Burn, baby, burn! burn, baby, burn! burn! 
The roof, (the roof), the roof, (the roof), the roof, (the roof) 
I'll heat ya block with heat so, hot, hot, hot 
The roof, (the roof), the roof, (the roof), the roof, (the roof) 
Me squeeze one shot, and leave ya not, not, not 
 
Anywhere you wanna do it, nigga we can get it poppin' like a firecracker! 
But I'm wild, I get at cha, hit a nigga like a tractor, collapse ya, thrash ya 
Rat-a-tat ya, matter of fact ya dead! 
Never comin' back here, sendin' out last year 
Took a look at the competition, there was none there 
So a nigga hit the hood, let it rumble in the streets 
To let everybody know, we keep heat! 
Nigga got that fire, fire baby! got that fire fire baby! 
Got that fire, fire, baby! got that fire, fire, baby! 
Got that fire, fire, baby! got that fire, fire, baby! 
Got that fire, fire, baby! got that fire, fire, baby, baby, baby 
Try to test me and I bet you get burned! 
And at the same time learn, that I'm not that nigga 
Nigga on it for reala, you wanna deal with the killa 
Give the scrilla to me, really, I get 'em, I get up in 'em! 
They betta be able to handle the heat 
Cause we gon take it to a million degrees! 
Somebody betta go and call the fire department 
Them bone niggas all knock shit on fire! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Lil burna finna burn it up, we got 'em runnin' to the radio to turn it up! 
Like "is it really them thugs?" yeah nigga this us! 
And when we come with the heat, we gon burn ya up! 
Finna do damage cause I'm a certified criminal 
I know it's illegal, but I'm a leave a nigga critical 
Put the gun down, nigga we can get physical 
Bullshit, tricked ya bang! you invisible! 
Disappear like the rest of these niggas that are turnin' to ghosts 
Cause they can't come close to the original nine-nine 
You know where to find mine, I'm strapped with a four-five 
I'm posted with that fire, fire, baby! that fire, fire, baby! 
That fire, fire, baby! that fire, fire, baby 
I ain't even gotta tell y'all niggas that the rhythm that I ride to the beat be scorchin'! 
Like the middle of the summer, tryna sit on the porch, no shade and your body be torchin'! 
Keep my name out ya mouth with that he say, she say, nigga better peep what we say! 
Fuck around and get caught up in the heatwave, y'all nigga better not try to be brave! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Ah! 
Let me tell ya somethin', nigga, if the fire's started 
I'm the nigga with the matches, let it flame up! 
Scare me, scare whoever shot, before you pull it 
Better know what you're goin' do and who's who 
Guaranteed to bring the flames, got that fire 
When you're listening, yes that-that fire, fire 
You don't like me, so what? act up, fire goin' make ya hate me 
Fuck sick shit up, move up, burn shit down, spark it up! 
Then ya lay down.. cause I got that fire, fire, fire baby! 
Got that fire, fire, baby! got that fire, fire, baby! 
Got that fire, fire, baby! got that fire, fire, baby 
And I'm old school, still don't believe me 
Then ya let it all burn, then there's no clues 
Gotta do what its goin' do, and that's burn, baby, burn! 
No questions, that's juks, snitches talk, thugs get to walkin' 
Them other niggas goin' get served in the chalk 
But not me, no witnesses, thugs, so burn, burn!</field>

I jumped up, got my coat and walked right out of the door 
Because she got a little bit crazy 
I don't want no deranged lady 
That'll have a nigga sleepin' under daisies. 
 
I don't want another insane lover 
Cuttin' on my rubber 
Houndin' me just to tell her I love her 
Gotta give it to them big butt girls 
The ones that don't give a fuck 
"Just-wanna-bust-nut" girls 
When them feelings involved 
Now you playin' with fire 
Gotta let 'em know from the gate 
Man, you ain't tellin' no lies 
I just wanna (touch that) 
I just wanna (couple times) 
I just wanna (no ties) 
Can a thugsta hit that there? 
No need to blow me up one day, we right back here 
Doin' what we do, I see you like that there 
Baby girl, let me just keep this fair 
You do you and I'll do me 
Can we do it, do it like that? 
Keep it creepin', creepin' 
Yes they say it's better than sneakin', sneakin' 
But when it's all over, it's just over 
No knives or policemen

Now me and her been rollin' together 
Now for quite some time 
And she been naggin' a nigga 
The whole damn ride 
When I first met the girl 
Everything was all good 
She grew up around my way 
So hey, the love was all hood 
So I figured it was cool 
And we could do this 
And, plus she had a booty 
That was sicker than lupus 
I had to scoop it 
Anyway, we started hangin' out 
And talkin' on the phone mo' 
And before you know 
We on her floor doin' the Grown Folk 
Everything was cool, y'all 
We had it plain and simple 
She wasn't my broad, and I wasn't her man 
More like "homie-lover-friends" 
She said she understand 
But I can't tell she comprehend 
'Cause she keyin' on my Benz 
While I'm sleepin', she be creepin' on me 
Sneakin' in my pockets 
Lookin' for numbers in my phone 
And condoms in my wallet 
Then she overdid it 
This bitch pointed a pistol at me 
Talkin' about "We need to talk" 
'Cause she ain't happy 
So shit.... 
 
I jumped up, got my coat and walked right out of the door 
Because she got a little bit crazy 
I don't want no deranged lady 
That'll have a nigga sleepin' under daisies. 
 
I jumped up, got my coat and walked right out of the door

Little sweet thang 
She love to floss 
Clothes to her lip gloss 
Makin' hard thugs turn soft 
Lookin' like Diana Ross 
Slim, sweet and sexy 
Something like a little sister 
'Til the day I messed around and tried to kiss her (damn) 
To be so skinny, baby girl had a nice round ass 
I used to stay two steps behind her while I walked her to class 
Back in school, a nigga's mission was to fuck 'em and flee 
But I was young, so I let her get close to me 
And I was kinda in love 
Everyday a nigga wit' her 
After school a nigga wit' her 
At the mall takin' pictures 
All the while I got my niggaz sayin' I'm breakin up the group 
I'm out here missin' my rehearsals 
'Cause I'm tryin' to knock boots 
She ain't even let me hit it 
Got me talkin' about commitment 
Got me climbin' through the window 
Won't even let me get it 
Last thing that she said 
Snapped me back to reality 
We in the 12th grade 
Talkin' about "you wanna marry me?" 
 
I jumped up, got my coat and walked right out of the door 
Because she got a little bit crazy 
I don't want no deranged lady 
That'll have a nigga sleepin' under daisies.

I got a lot of negative problems; I call 'em baby's mommas 
There be always drama cause they always callin 
Draggin me in and out of the courtroom, man 
How much is enough to support you, ma'am? 
Got a nigga in the jam I am, sittin in the cell with no bail 
But I got cash, man I tell y'all 
Women, playin the game birthin children to make a livin 
She don't need a 9-to-5 cause she workin the system 
Bitches! Grimy, nasty, old wicked-ass bitches 
Schemin and tryin to skeez on a real nigga 
Hold my baby ransom and tryin to get some advances 
But before I give you half Miss, I go to jail and chance it (yeah) 
You golddiggin hoes get nothin, nathan, nada 
You're lucky if I even holla

Bitches have you locked up, and it's fucked up 
Shit, we gotta have that ass, and it's no love 
Mamis just be at that stash, tryin to get me 
Pop one in and now she got my ass for 18, she got my cash 
Now the people in my business, gotta pay up (pay up) 
Or it's on, I'm gone, while the slut lays up 
But naw, naw dawg, I can't see myself bein broke 
Or trippin 'bout no broad, dawg (hell naw) 
If in fact, if it's mine give it back 
One-two-three-fo', baby daddy's past mistakes 
Gotta pay for that share, I'm 'bout the garbage-ass kids 
Let me catch another nigga, leave that bitch!

See I was brought up on the side of the tracks 
With the roaches and the rats 
Brats, big grimy bitches approaches niggaz with the gats 
Out to rob ya, out to get ya, nigga livin is a gamble 
Bitches settin niggaz up, with their baby mama scandal 
Women these days worse than fiends in the 80's 
Tryin to collect all the welfare, havin about ten babies 
Shady, shiesty women, they might like me 
See a nigga with money and they think they might try me (I doubt it) 
Keep it movin baby, I'm the one that keep it player 
No matter how you fix your hair or how you shake your derriere 
I won't fuck it, trained not to love it 
She won't cut into my budget with kids playin the puppets 
It's a goddamn shame, America the great 
Give a nigga a case because my pockets ain't straight 
Look nigga, if you can't take care of your kids 
'Cause these set-up grimy bitches tryin to use them to live, nigga

I?m tryin'to resist all this temptation that I?ve been facing lately 
Constantly praying that I can make it and keep on shakin' Satan 
It?s drivin' me crazy 'cause he makin' the plate look oh so tasty 
Then again, I?m knowin' that it?s only Yahweh that can save me 
Livin'in this world today It's really gettin harder to stay awakened 
But I'm not tryin' to get caught too drowsy 'cause I know we're waitin 
Just contemplatin' on my situation, hopin' that my desperation eventually breaks my concentration 
But I'm waitin' cause I'm aware that it's a snake in the grass 
Can't wait for God to free us" we can scream it at last 
Now oh my God, God, God! God of my God, God, God (Now, oh my God, God, God...) Steady all day  
 
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way, Beelzebub; 
Get behind us, behold the Yahweh, 
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way,

As long as the Lord got my back, I won't be afraid of the evils around me when they surround me 
I drop to my knees and I pray to the Lord proudly 
Probably, these trials and tribulations in front of my face is a test so I be standin' firm in my faith 
Stand not in my way, stand not in my way 'cause I'm a soldier ready for Armageddon, prepared for my day 
Make no mistake-stake-stake stake; These bells above, they never break-break-break 
You hear the alarm; We're headed for ruin 
This world is so wicked; Controlled by the superpowers, the Federal Government 
They' wagin' these wars for this oil, actin' like they love it 
We rise above it 'cause they can't deny the truth 
And the truth is to the youth; Better strap on your boots  
 
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way, Beelzebub; 
Get behind us, behold the Yahweh, 
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way,  
Beelzebub; get behind us behold the yahweh  
 
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way, Beelzebub; 
Get behind us, behold the Yahweh, 
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way,  
Beelzebub; get behind us behold the yahweh  
 
Everyday's a replay; We always facin' evil people 
Some have them wicked ways, some donate they lives just to make us not equal 
And oh, my Lord I want to make it welcome in your home, but I must demand forgiveness 'cause I done did so wrong 
I gotta make a stand in my way, whatever I gotta do, I'll do it; Lord, just show me the way 
So I pray, yes for me, and all my peeps in here that don't believe 
It's hard to seein' what we see, but you got to 
Just let it begin and you will feel that faith inside you 
Never alone, always right beside you 
Every time something goes wrong, who's the person you call to? Huh, huh? Huh, huh?</field>

Nigga stop! (What?) Hold on, before you jump and just listen 
Take a second to stradle the fence 
Let me tell you about what you been missin' 
Ain't a damn thang (damn thang) are you thinkin' the grass is greener? 
Like a nigga just lost his first love, singin' "Have you seen her?" 
Tossin' high beams, chasin' pipe dreams 
Lookin' for shit that really ain't there 
I mean it is what you make it my nigga, you better just stay on your square 
Down here, killers and thieves, pimps and pushers is on the prowl 
If they find you out of your element, they'll pick you out of the crowd 
Thang to do is face the music, take a stand for yo' position 
Nigga get up, better stand up, man up in yo' position 
Never have no mercy for them niggaz that's not applyin' theyself 
And shit ain't perfect so you gotta make it work for yo'self 
You catch them coward niggaz runnin', duckin', lookin' for help 
But the realist niggaz in the game, play the cards they was dealt 
Me, myself, I got some issues; I ain't dealin' with yours 
Everybody got they own drama, rich or they poor  
 
They gave me the 25 with the L, I'm in my jail cell 
It feel like a movie, I'm gettin' so woozy from the stale smell 
Bailin', breathin' Hell's air 
My first day here I had to get down with a nigga  
That thought I was some kinda faggot, I had to show him no hoes stay here 
Havin' to die, it is my main fear 
Why did I have to kill that man? I should've never let my anger build 
Now my state of awareness keeps me wishin' I was thinkin' 
Should have reason I didn't really mean to stop the boy from breathin' 
I was awake last night, real late last night 
Cause I heard some nigga screamin', gettin' raped last night 
I did the crime, but I wasn't thinkin' about me doin' the time 
These 6-by-9's, is about to make me lose my mind 
Trapped in these closed walls ain't had no conversation  
With my family on the outside cause they won't except my phone calls 
After a couple of years of sheddin' tears, my heart is stone hard 
Believe I'm ready for war and on guard 
 
I've been shot, grew up without my pops 
In the hood round block seen niggaz shot 
Got rid of them thangs, tryin' to chase them knots 
Cause I had to have it, knew niggaz that's lookin' for where my stash at 
Watchin' my back, puttin' up ready for niggaz that wanna check that 
And I can't keep it kind, if you puttin' in work  
And your dreams is just like mine 
Wake up in cold sweats, regrets about what I thought was lies 
I can see me not doin' that 
But I did it, we live it, the hood shows you no slack 
And believe it, there's no, no-no, comin' back 
Make money, think you're on that 
Just ridin' through the hood, you might have to push your wig back 
Get the money man, the root of all evil 
They say "Take it home man," but damn I gotta watch my people 
You'll be high, cause one us lay there, not just him 
But damn, everybody he ran with 
They all gettin' money man, money man 
Right here (right here) damn, see how life is</field>

Nigga get ready for the big payback 
Been thuggin' and keepin' the gulley since way back 
Lot a niggas been talkin' 
They runnin' they mouths barkin' 
Runnin' around false 
They claimin' they want a weapon to rob us 
My record is flawless 
My method is lawless 
I'm an automatic weapon nigga you just a target 
The number one artist from the land of the heartless 
Fittin' to get cha, hit cha nigga they couldn't call it 
One nigga left and they talkin' about we ain't happenin' 
So we had to give that up and make em recognize platinum 
Look at everybody rappin' just like I'm rappin' 
Niggas got to admit it the bone thugs is the masta 
They die, and there's no competition, no competition! 
Tear the roof off the mothafucka 
I put a boot off in a mothafuckas ass 
Still down to blast or clash with anyone of you niggas who start we ain't trippin off of none of you niggas wooo 
Leathface the boy is back, with a little bit of action bring it 
Rap it sing it 
Bust it whateva dog 
Whateva ya'll want to do I'm with it wicked wicked

I done had a mil took a mil blew a mil still in the streets that's how I live I live 
I t don't mean a damn thing 
Still got a little change believe me comin' in 
Shit I pass a nigga seen a lot of niggas point him point him out thats him here 
It about to be e with a big cast eat him up 
Send him on his way 
Kick him in his ass have a nice day 
Went the wrong way 
Got a lot to say 
It can get so murderous murderous 
Touchin' us never that bone thug still the crack 
Crack and I can't lay back 
On the comeback 
Spit on these niggas, spit on these niggas 
Run up any you niggas, any you niggas won' be no recognizin' niggas 
Just one warning impatient one time only OK 
Don't repeat myself bad for my health don't want to do that rather spray 
Catch me on the wrong day, catch me on the wrong day 
Better stay out my way better stay out my face 
That's the last thing you wanna do thugs true 
See the blues I shoot at you now you? 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Layzie Bone] 
Ya'll know how I feel about fake niggas bitch niggas snitch niggas ain't no love for them 
Put a nigga in his place momma crying at the wake that's right that's what a nigga does for them 
I play above the rim I play above the rim 
With no lames in my circle cause I love to win 
With the real ass niggas with the thug in them 
And if you talk too much I put a slug in them 
Oh no don't play with 'em 
Lay gon get 'em if wish don't get em then kray gon' get 'em 
Straight up we spit em 
With a nine on my side and I slide to the rhythm 
Let me slow it down in case you didn't catch my drift 
Lift a nigga up out his shoes trigga finga not hesitant fuck it 
Let me speed it up hit em like the ammunition comin' from my heata 
Ya'll niggas can't see these thugs 17 shots from the nine millimeter 
On the creep with the nightvision infrared beams pointed at your dome, can't wait to see a niggas response 
When I rip that vest with the teflon teflon</field>

Nigga feel the beat in ya chest when ya leanin' 'n swervin' 
Bass in ya back, you feel it, you heard it 
Hand on the wheel no need to be nervous 
Ride 
With a g everything'll be perfect 
Put it down, put it all on the surface 
Dirty as we ride, it'll all be worth it 
('Til the wheels fall off) Nigga 
That's the purpose 
Nothin' but the best 'cause we deserve it 
They know when I'm comin, cause niggas can hear me before they can see me and they can't 
Believe it cause I'm bumpin Eazy-E 
And they just seen me on TV 
Navigate through the streets dog 
Keep it real to the beat that ain't no secret 
Jump 
Outta the jeep car 
Run up in the liquor store hit the freezer 
Grab a O, Gold, like my 4-0, my flow so cold, I gotta have some 
Turn the music back up 
To the maximum 
Them niggas hatin on us but I laugh at 'em 
I gotta 9 millimeter that I'll get me to the trunk 
If I make it to the trunk 
I'm a pop 
That trunk 
Y'all already know comin' outta the trunk is a AK who?  
With a 12 gauge what? 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Krayzie Bone] 
 
We back with a vengeance 'cause rap took a strippin' without us 
Let's be honest, this industry's now over crowded, forgot us 
Nigga ya time up 
Go back 
To practice sign with your life and sign up 
If niggas is lookin' for hits hit Swizz up, nigga he comin' to find us 
And we ain't hard to find 
Been 
Right here all the time 
That bling got y'all all blind 
These niggas ain't raw as I 
So don't make me kill ya 
Don't try to battle me cause ain't none 
Of you niggas skilled enough (skilled enough) 
I'm sick of these niggas, they killin' me, really they wanna be thugs 
Everybody wanna roll like us, smoke 
Blunts 
Cause we pump off in your trunk 
Them niggas get hypnotized 
Run up as soon as they feel the vibe 
They never been on a realer ride 
Just 
Runnin' up, let's turn it up till they know 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Wish Bone] 
 
'fore the liquor store close in a rush turn it up, let it drop, now nigga let's roll, roll 
Gotta fill up 
With a drink of 
Anything thing that bang 
Or roll up 
Gotta choose what I listen too 
Cause it ain't got much that I'm feelin' ooh 
Everybody talkin' violence 
Take a life live they been through 
 
I love that gangsta music 
Bump nothin' but thugsta music 
Except when I lay down and slow down, that lovin' music 
No pretender get in ya 
Thugs 
Runnin' through it 
The truest 
We still hear they love how we do it, we do it 
Thugsta 
Outta line cross mine 
Yes thugstas really rush ya

[Twista] 
Now feel the devastation 
And unification of the thugs in the middle of the map 
These niggas finna snap 
Spit it for niggas that bit it 
Then give them the business they gonna feel it when we jack 
And be quick with it, be crack 
Hit it with the lyrical accuracy and harmony I'm a see who 
I ain't fuckin' with the Midwest 
You could try attackin' me and bombin' 
Me I'm a be spittin' so fast, they wanna ask how he did that? 
Bone Thugs and we gotta spit a hard flow 
It's worthy competition everywhere that I go 
But ain't no messin' with Cleveland or Chicago 
Ballin' through the hood in a Murcielago 
Or Gallardo, or Ferrari, or Diablo 
As long as the car go quick, flow so sick 
Thought it was drama between Bone and Twista we do it like this 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Layzie Bonw] 
I'm from a place, really ain't safe, Cleveland the birthplace 
Midwest niggas, yeah, we stay thirsty 
Tim's in the winter with the j's in the summer 
All four season's we stay workin' 
Ride with a g' 
Come and slide with a g' 
With the true's on the lac we can ride to the beat 
Light it up, let it burn when you vibin' with me 
Gotta keep it real to survive in these streets 
Come see it for your self how live it can be 
Been walkin' to the chi back down to the d 
Michigan, Illinois, sho-nuff killa boys 
Standin' on the corner at 10 degrees 
We got pimps, dope pushers, and petty thieves 
Crooked ass cops won't let me breathe 
All my love for the city won't let me leave 
What they expect from me? 
They want the best from me 
They gonna get it, yeah 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Krayzie Bone] 
I think it's time we show them bone, how we ride 
And let everyone know just where we come from Midwest bounce 
It's that bounce 
That make a nigga feel it when he off that ounce 
Of the mary mary mary jane 
We the niggas showin' them different side of thangs 
Never seen a nigga that switched the rhyme this way 
Now everybody run and flip they style today 
Yup it's kinda strange but 
A nigga got to give it up to the Midwest 
Who made 'em pick up the page before they get left 
Get a little bit of Twista and hit that 
Roll it up with some bone thug sit back 
Just feel the vibe 
And ya never let a player hater kill ya high 
With this shit we be spittin' we gon' steal ya mind 
Once again it's the Midwest side (West-side) 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Wish Bone] 
You can tell by the way I walk, the way I flow from around here 
Nigga Midwest where the weed ain't the best but we came up 
Now we get flew from the West coast, (West coast baby) 
We flow fast 
So many words in one bar 
We spit it, rap it, nigga better go hard 
Who the underdogs 
The West done done it 
The East done done it 
The South hard 
They keep it together, (Together) 
On the same level 
Midwest got the weapons 
It's ours here them thugsta's, no care 
We like to fight, (Fight) 
On the West we get right, (Right) 
In the East it's about they favorite night 
In the South it's whatever ya like

Corner to corner this thing on lock yea it's hot on this block

Better do my damn thing and lift ya mayne 
Bitch won't leave the same way you came 
We soldiers tight put up your stripes we'll rip them off 
Slash somebody back with a attitude that right 
I'm sick with the money spent on bullet proof nigga fight fight 
Handle that, nigga handle that give back to the music fuck that fuck that 
Reach back throw back everybody in the car gotta lean back 
See now the game was soft so we back 
Hit em in the head with a relapse 
Younger than most of you niggas so what? you die you die if I decide 
Then we ride 
If it's on you rock a bye bye 
Thuggstas straight up warned you will, obey mine 
Oh we will ride yes we ride in the nightime

You know though nothin' come easy, you gotta try real, real hard 
I tried hard, but I guess I gotta try harder 
 
I tried so hard, can't seem to get away from misery 
Man, I tried so hard, will always be a victim of these streets 
It ain't my fault 'cause I try to get away, but trouble follows me 
And still I try so hard, hopin' one day they'll come and rescue me 
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow (hail, snow) 
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat, gettin' dough (gettin' dough) 
 
First, let me explain that I'm just a black man 
And I come from the dark side, so I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man 
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet 
Been in and out of relationships 
I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at 
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that you get that piece of mind of me 
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see 
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dream 
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me 
Goin' crazy (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it 
But I just can't 'cause the drama just grows greater 
And I been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off till later 
 
I tried so hard, can't seem to get away from misery 
Man, I tried so hard, will always be a victim of these streets 
It ain't my fault 'cause I try to get away, but trouble follows me 
And still I try so hard, hopin' one day they'll come and rescue me 
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow (hail, snow) 
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat, gettin' dough (gettin' dough) 
 
It's like I'm takin' five steps forward, and ten steps back 
Tryin' to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track 
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most 
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh, 
I just don't know, but I be out here fightin' demons, and 
It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland, and 
Lord, would you help me, and stop this pain? 
I keep inflictin' on my family (family) 
Hustlin' and gamblin', drinkin' and scramblin' 
And losin' sight of what I supposed to be handlin' 
It's hard to manage 'cause every day's a challenge and, man 
And I'm slippin'; can't lose my balance, and tryin' not to panic 
 
I tried so hard, can't seem to get away from misery 
Man, I tried so hard, will always be a victim of these streets 
It ain't my fault 'cause I try to get away, but trouble follows me 
And still I try so hard, hopin' one day they'll come and rescue me 
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow (hail, snow) 
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat, gettin' dough (gettin' dough) 
 
I see things won't change (won't change) I'm stuck in the game 
As soon as I get out, it keeps pullin' me back, man (pullin' me back, man) 
Got me doin' dirty dirt; so used to this hustlin' money 
That I don't understand no nine to five work 
Studied on the streets; hustlas know what I mean 
Thugstas ballin' before us; I'm tryin' to make that major league 
So we never leave, never till the sun came up (came up) 
Gotta get it, nope, no leavin', no grudge (no grudge) 
Today games they play, gotta go hard to get what you put in 
If you fall off, then it's all on you (on you) 
Gotta watch what you sign too; try so hard, but I won't act a fool 
 
I tried so hard, can't seem to get away from misery 
Man, I tried so hard, will always be a victim of these streets 
It ain't my fault 'cause I try to get away, but trouble follows me 
And still I try so hard, hopin' one day they'll come and rescue me

Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me? (Bone Thugs) 
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E (The lil' homeboy Bow Wow) 
Boy, if ya wanna make it (MC) 
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of (What's your perspective?) 
 
Monday we made love (I'm outta love) 
Tuesday you had time (And macked it all) 
We just break up again, you want me to let you back in 
But tonight I'm like no, oh, uh, uh, uh, oh 
My mind says no, but my body and soul said yes 
I hate this mess, boy, you just ain't no good for me 
This ain't the way real love should be 
 
Took you back once, took you back twice 
Took you back, three, four, five times 
They said your tricks were over 
Boy, you've gon' crossed the line 
Took you back once, took you back twice 
Took you back, three, four, five times 
Can't see the love in you, somebody help me! (Krayzie, give her a little bit) 
 
Now you look from the jump 
And a nigga was thugged out, but you bugged out and start trippin' 
Flippin' on me all time, and it's been like this all my life no matter how I try 
Guess it's the thug in me; got my mind on my money, man 
I'm spending my time on the grind tryin' to shine; I'm concentrating on running thangs 
I've been tryin' to hold it down, and you steady tellin' me it's over now 
She always talk loud; she always leave me but always come back around 
That's just what we go through, and you know it's so true 
Every time I slip up she behind me, gon' be right there to remind me... 
 
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E? (Uh yeah, ha ha) 
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me? 
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E (Just a little bit) 
Boy, if ya wanna make it (Layzie!) 
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of (Giver her a lil' bit) 
 
Can we take a long walk on the beach, get away from the streets? 
Baby girl, me and you need to rendezvous 
Cancun next week, how that sound to you? 
I've been meaning to spend a little time wit' you 
I can tell you fed up from all of the promises I've been making lately 
And I had to deliver, but I been so caught in my hustle, tryin' to make this payment 
And I should've considered your feelings 
I should've been better about it 
I should've been grown, not childish 
I should've been way more polished 
But my hustle done paid off, and I'm ready to spoil you, love 
Come look what ya boy gon' do (Gon' do), let me make this up to you (to you) 
 
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E? 
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me? 
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E? 
Boy, if ya wanna make it (Bow Wow!) 
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of (Give her a little bit) 
 
Weezy, girl, I can't believe what you sayin' 
You know you got it; should meet with my fans 
But every time I get a break I'm layin' 
Where? In your arms all night and day playin' 
You want some time, I send you Jacob 
Want sunshine, then take a vacation 
We ain't gon' make it if you keep complainin', everybody go through changes 
Love is a (Dangerous) thing 
It's full of happy and sad faces, break it up to make up later 
Talk it out so it ain't no anger 
We need more communication, you should have some consideration 
Cause you knew from the day we met, what, what type of player you was dealing wit', ha ha 
 
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E? 
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me? 
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E 
Boy, if ya wanna make it (Wish!) 
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit a (Give her a little bit) 
 
Everything I do, just for me and you 
Stack a little paper so it's never rainy days 
I got you, but just for me, then you got to understand that I hustle, hustle 
Diamonds, things, I gotta hustle, hustle; anything that brings the weight up 
See, a real thug too - it's in his nature, it's in his nature 
Not tryin' to say that you about that paper, but me and you, yes we like that paper 
Overseas trips, diamonds on the wrists; you must admit: your boy gets that paper 
I like bossin', girl, girl, but you beside me, slide wit' me, slide wit' me 
Try and take it away; that's when I ride and ride 
 
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E? 
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me? 
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E 
Boy, if ya wanna make it 
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of love! (Is that what ya tellin' me?) 
Oh baby, yeah (That all you need, all you need is a little bit) 
If you wanna make it 'cause you gotta give a little bit of love</field>

Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement 
In every hood I see 'em doin' the same 
There's a lot a haters that don't want me to make it 
All I want is for you to remember my name 
So that you'll never forget me 
So that you'll never forget me 
So that you'll never forget me

When I'm dead and gone they're gonna remember me as bein one of the livest 
Genuine ghetto survivors when they gain terror inside 
I pop in their mind, a silent killer 
Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga 
My lyrics were potent, my fight was venom 
I could kill 'em, when I get in them 
Niggas never knew what'd hit em 
Legends 
For what we done did on these streets 
And what we done spit on these records 
Blessin' 
We take em and put em on beats 
n we give em back no question 
Grandaddy of th mid-west 
Crazy Jackson 
The lyrical serial killer 
I fell 'em, the innocent is askin' about the mind I master 
When it comes to the rhyme I'm faster than half of these niggas rappin' 
When it comes to the grind I'm mashin' 
No time for second chances 
When it all goes down and they put me in my grave 
"Fuck em all" across my tombstone and bury me with my game 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Layzie Bone] 
My reputation is solid gold 
And my street cred is all polished y'all 
Known as th little boss hog in the hood 
Boy in my hood I'm a superstar 
Niggas in th past try t hold a nigga down 
But I put in my work and checked it checked it 
Now these niggas respect it 
Knowin I'm th wrong one they wanna mess with 
From the gutter 
With my brothers 
Knowin on these ghetto streets they don't love us 
Duckin' these undercovers 
These muthafuckers doin everythin to try n bust us 
But these suckas, know they cant touch us 
They envy deep in they hearts 
Nigga if they ever try to rush 
Nigga they know we gon' rip 'em apart 
Niggas go hard, from the start 
Nigga this heart is my bodyguard 
Fuck with mine and I'll charge 
Little crazy-ass nigga at large 
Pullin cars, on these lanes 
Nigga I never let go of my heat 
Stand up man on his feet 
Little Lazyie Bone on this beat nigga 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Wish Bone] 
What I got to do for you not to forget who bought you with that straight thug spin 
Sped up a little bit with gangsta talk with that harmony all over it hey! 
Bones sing, 'n mixed in with that street talk 
'N then the lazy get their creep on 
'N he went home, but its all good 
He left the right ones an hes still in th hood 
Rest in peace, like him when I die I hope they remember me 
Thats why I know I gotta reach you with these beats 
Its not for nothin remember the thugs for the songs that we sung 
N makin it through that struggle, that struggle 
It aint easy believe me, we bleedin believe it 
Still goin with that hustle, gettin stronger so they remember me

Jeremiah 10: 23,24 
"We will know oh Lord that to Earthly men his way does not belong 
It does not belong to man who must walk even to direct his step 
Correct me oh Jehovah however with judgment not in anger 
That you may not reduce us to nothing" 
 
[Chorus:] 
Order my steps, lead me, guide me everyday 
Send your anointing father 
I pray order my steps in the world 
 
[Layzie Bone] 
Why am I payin' this price for fame now with the shame 
I'm goin' blame cause I'm solo empty 
When I can stop and give it all to Christ 
Cause in his name no weapon should be formed against me 
Simply know that the world gon' tempt me Satan is the enemy 
God please help us I don't want to be selfish 
I don't want to live my life tryin' to be rebellious 
 
[Wish Bone] 
Who be checkin' when ya know ya doin' wrong huh? 
Got your steps, give your blessings 
Know right from wrong turn the lights on 
All ya gotta do is follow faith till they call us all home 
But its so hard temptation is everywhere 
Gotta hold my guard like oh my God 
 
[Krayzie Bone] 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, now I might not make it to Heaven 
But I'm tryin' to come back in the resurrection change my place in paradise 
So I pray to God try to change my life

Man I gotta cool out, still I need to stop smokin' 
I need God's guidance without it I'm hopeless

A lot of soldiers in the pin ain't ever comin' home 
Can you find it in your heart to pray

Momma just wanna feed her babies 
Tryin' to keep a safe place to stay 
Don't stress it's a test God Bless all ya 
Really gotta do is just keep your faith 
 
[Wish Bone] 
You can feel it if you open up, you can get it if you need love 
As much as a mustard seed is all you need 
Small price to pay for the air that we breathe 
And the baby is born, place to go when we leave 
Food that we eat, weapon when we sleep 
It's a miracle no believin' the Lord

Hey! 
What cha seein' on the news has already been written in the Bible 
But ain't nobody takin' the time to realize that believin' and readin'

I wanna live forever and I would a lot better 
So when Armageddon really come true what chu gon' do?

You know God is great and everyday I wake 
I gotta thank him for my life and even though its hard

I can remember that little nigga when he was just a young lad 
Nobody thought he make it up outta the hood, before the gun blast (Gun blast) 
'Cause Johnny wanted to be a thug 
Runnin' from cops out on the block, the boy was hot and didn't give a fuck (Scandalous) 
Runnin' up in the black mask, niggas if you got cash, drop it off in that bag and make craps fast 
Destroyin' the system, make some money to survive the streets 
But you deep inside this ain't how you tryna be 
But it's all to think when you're strugglin' and can't sleep 
'cause ya hungry and can't eat, 'cause livin' just ain't free..but shit 
Pappa been laid off...momma been laid off 
Everywhere I here the same old song...

To probably take a loss, I'm tryna fight these demons 
By any means, by any cost I'm out here reppin' Cleveland 
They got be bobbin, weavin' 
Nigga give me the reason 
To let 'em flies...do or die, niggas no longer breathin' 
Known as a (?), before Layzie Bone it was Steven 
And I'm just tryna break even, leavin' you leakers steadley creepin' 
Shit get deep when daddy gone (daddy gone) 
And momma can't do it on her on (her on) 
Lights off, gas gone

I guess not, sell rocks, rappin' with my niggas Bone

So you ever been to the Chi? Me too 
You ever been shot? Me too 
Sold rocks, all nighters on blocks 
Catch cases...shit me too 
That's the story no one ridin', nobody can tell it for me 
Momma workin' double shift... daddy who? Daddy who? 
And when he do it's always later, never came 
He done broke that boys heart, man again, damn again 
Don't wonder why it's like that in the ghetto 
Grew up, outta luck 
Don't give a fuck about life so we let 'em go 
I know my heart is cold, you know how them ghetto children grow 
Give me money and I can keep my temper low 
Everybody knows love, clubs, cars and hoes 
Priorities fucked up, but we already know!

Man you fuckin' with a boss, cross pass with me,

You can ask my homies

The early bird get the worm 
Take the game by the throat and squeeze 
Till the muthafucka broke believe 
Its murda we wrote 
Its dope that we serve on the curb to the booth 
These niggaz don't feel it cuz we spit the truth 
Aint never no fake and they got me to prove 
Haters just hate and we do what we do 
 
Let 'um talk to you in the face 
Only because we blew up in they face 
If was Bone hurtin' 
If that was the case 
I'll probably go loco and catch me a case

Wanna get a pound of that floatin' stuff, some of that smoke and puff (puff) 
And if you smoke enough you sure enough get P.O.D.'ed 
Cleveland it's the same thang, they out there puff M. Jane 
Inhale (inhale) exhale (exhale) back on the plane 
Headed to the city that's sunny all year round, that's right Miami 
It's like a little planet, full of sin, well we got to have it (have it) 
And I'm simply tryin' to tell these motherfuckers  
That we thug all day (day) we Thug always (way way) 
So come to the party (party) and bring somebody (body) 
And bring some weed and a tank of Bacardi (Bacardi) 
It's gon' get rowdy (rowdy) 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Come and roll with the everyday thugs, stayin' "Down Foe My Thang" 
Stayin' true to the game cause that's all I know 
I'm a street nigga, keep the heat nigga 
Gettin' street figures, all night long 
I gots to go get me some money  
Cause just like that, nigga gots to have it 
It be greens or spinach or cabbage 
Whatever you call it can do your math 
And work this magic, get on the grind 
In position to be the boss 
Niggas can floss and talk, but I know they soft 
But a nigga like me stay raw 
On the D.L., cause what we sell 
Ain't none of nobody's business, never was 
And nigga never will be 
Thinkin' I'm broke but I'm out here filthy, feelin' me? 
Y'all niggas be killin' me 
Brag about the money that you claim you makin' 
Fuck around, catch your dumbass sleepin' 
Then that money be up for the takin' 
Yeah, I bring home the bacon  
And nigga that's all I'm a let you know 
You already know when I stole the show 
Little man with the big dough run these hoes 
 
[Chorus] 
 
I'm a thug, seems like every time I come out gotta prove I'm thug 
Like a nigga ain't put in work, with his blood 
It's gonna be the same, cause nigga gonna stay on his game 
This is how we gets down, with money man, money man 
Monday Tuesday Wednesdays, I mighta been chillin' 
Thursdays Fridays Saturday I'm out there kickin' it with all my villains 
Go against us, you ain't goin' nowhere 
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony keepin' it real for St. Clair 
Anybody that want it, even if it's on my mornings 
I will wake up, just in case you want it 
And I ain't got shit to prove it, thirty minutes over you do it 
Put it down nigga, really, now move it 
 
[Chorus] 
 
You know, we like the echo and oh 
We like the Roley y'know, we like the Benz-o but oh 
He the homie but no, he the enemy fo' sho' 
Pull a .44 out of the holster, bust on him like real niggas supposed ta 
Sticky-icky blowin' brew in my leather sofa 
Little nigga, roll a spiritual soldier 
Like Nat Turner, clap burner, murda mo murda 
Murder motherfucker, shit as hot as the kitchen furnace 
From smokers to workers, Cleveland to Cali 
Ghetto in our suburbia's, Little Bizzy stay pimp in alley 
And finally the vinyl be vital, and why should I flip?  
I already got the title, besides my vibe is the shit 
It's too many sides

Leavin', leavin', that's how we came up 
Ooh, and can't nobody believe it; yes, you better believe it 
Trendsetters in this game and we really ain't leavin' 
With all my dogs, just admit that we are raw 
With all of y'all behind us we will never fall 
All-oh-all-oh-all-oh-all-oh-all (what's that) 
 
[Chorus] 
 
And nigga let the world go around and around 
Livin' out in this strugglin', hustlin' just to get down 
Some of us need a memoir, and some of us need the crowd 
Children of the underground 
Remember how we clowned havin fun, rippin' and runnin' around town, so dumb 
But where we from means anything and a gun 
Sounds that they hear in the suburbs 
And chirpin' they birds, my nigga chirpin' the suburban 
On the curb, Layzie he was rollin' up the herb 
So superb that ya beat is twirkin' 
A little nigga earned, feelin' broke 'til the motherfucker still splurgin' 
Snatchin' purses and sellin' dubs and twurkin', twurkin', twurkin' 
I was talkin' in the church, in the church, in the church 
And then everybody dressed up  
And you know they was perpin', they perpin', they perpin' 
They not knowin', they not knowin', knowin'

The world, the world, the world is yours 
 
Young thugs, my young thugs (buck 'em on down, y'all near the end) 
Young thugs, my young thugs (when I bust 'em on down) 
Young thugs, my young thugs 
Young thugs, my young thugs (when I bust 'em on down)

Young thugs, my young thugs (y'all near the end, y'all near the end) 
 
Standin outside is a broken thug (that's me) 
Who don't wanna go home (no) 
Rather stand here frozen up 
Hangin out in the cold, zero below 
Tryin to find a soul 
Before the mind is gone 
Tryin to find that God and roll 
And keep rollin on 
On, on, on, rollin on 
You better keep rollin on 
On, on, on, rollin on 
You better keep rollin on 
 
Every time I look into the mirror get to thinkin I'm wrong 
Cause I thug, I thug 
All I see lookin back is a thug and I know I did wrong 
Young thug, young thug (uh) 
It's amazin how we get them second chances and he let us live on 
All thugs, all thugs 
T-H-you-G, is all I wanna be 
All my little thugs is really thuggin with me 
I really don't get it straight from poverty, they broken no more! 
You really need to stop because you know them Thugs is gonna live on! 
 
See baby got it goin on 
But she was born in a fucked up home 
And ain't nobody feelin her, momma seem to be stuck on niggaz 
That'll beat us every time she's gone 
And ain't nobody real as her, here we go again 
There he go again, I don't wanna be here no more 
Now I'm havin a baby, only nigga that held me 
You don't have to tell me - he went crazy and he left ya 
Yeah that nigga went crazy, but I thank him for the love 
That's all I've got (what) 
Baby got it goin on, 19, nail shop 
Bail drop, bling watch, talent fulfilled 
Hoops in with the hair all prepped and propped 
Don't give a fuck about a nigga now (I don't care) 
And the shit don't stop, yeah 
'Til the casket drops, yeah 
I'm all that I got, got, got 
 
Once upon a time there was a little young nigga runnin wild and smokin weed 
And if you was lookin for whatever, he can get you what you need 
Down Thuggsta with some problems, nobody never seem to spot him 
One day somebody shot him, and the drama got started 
Now his momma's on the pipe and bigger brother's in jail 
Nigga go on and cop a seat, I got a story to tell 
See, first he was just chillin then his belly got hungry 
Everybody in the family out for self, ain't got no money 
So what's a young thug to do now? (and do now) 
Ain't nothin to do but hit the streets  
And get some heat and put the rules down 
That's what he get, lil' hustler off to the races 
Tryin to win it while he in it, actin bad and catchin cases 
Before he knew it he was in too deep 
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, he was in too deep 
He coulda, changed his life, but no he didn't 
Now the little nigga layin dead in the grave still not listenin 
 
If I could teach the world to be 
A Thug in perfect Harmony 
If I could teach the world to be 
A Thug in perfect Harmony</field>

Every time I, turn around 
Every time I, turn around 
Every time I, turn around 
 
Every time I turn my head, man 
Somebody's schemin' on a bad plan 
Tryin' to deal a nigga a bad hand 
One after the other, harassin' a Thugsta 
At first they try to bring me in court for child support 
Women deception and they lies 
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe 
I have to go and serve state time 
There's always somebody talkin' 'bout you owe 'em 
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada 
Niggas ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride 
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine 
Every time I turn around there's somebody straight trippin' 
Hatin' on a mission, fakin' on a nigga 
They always talk with some dump in they mouth 
like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out 
Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches 
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest 
Every time that I turn around 
Somebody all up in my business 
Actin' like you know me, I've never seen homie 
He try to lean on me I'm a put the beam on him 
Tele-screen on me, really if he only 
knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him 
Every time I turn around I see another phony 
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment 
Bone Thug niggas never beat, we told 'em 
Guess they thinkin' niggas was weak but we showed 'em 
We on top it ain't no stoppin' us, the suckas wishin' we would go away 
so they can flood the game with that garbage 
I'm poppin 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray 
Kray "Take Action" Jackson 
 
Every time that I turn around 
I'm duckin' haters over here, haters over there 
Everywhere I turn they everywhere 
Every time that I turn around 
Duckin' haters over here, haters over there 
Everywhere I turn they everywhere 
 
Every time I turn around somebody doin' somethin' foul 
I can't turn my back without these haters tryin' to shut me down 
Plot and I watch, strategize, but the clock 
is sayin' time don't wait for nothin', it don't stop 
Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it 
Like pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, but y'all lucky 
Eastside, front to back, we guard that 
Don't nobody want you when yo' ass is broke flat 
Yeah nigga all that, we livin' in a cruel world 
It's rough in the ghetto but we put family first 
When friends turn to foes and the enemy's exposed 
That's when you gotta move on and kick dirt 
My wife and my seeds dependin' on me 
to make it home safe with them groceries 
How it's 'posed to be, they ain't close to me 
Yeah I'm in association but I'm playin for my own team 
Too much division, head-on collisions 
is blockin' my visionary skills 
Get back to the mission to pay my own bills 
Stay on point and I guard my own grills 
Skills I'm possessin', in my possession 
Why they wanna rob a little nigga for the blessin'? 
Who is you helpin', the world or yourself? 
Put it on the table cause that's the real question 
 
Every time that I turn around 
Turn around (turn around) turn around (turn around) turn 
Every time that I turn 
Every time that I turn around 
Every time that I turn arou-rou-rou-rou-rou-rou 
 
Keep it thuggin' green, nigga sweet, come get it 
I wouldn't even take it if I wasn't gon' listen 
But look here, this here, some of y'all garbage 
I know you didn't feel it when a nigga didn't call ya 
Keep your CD, save your money, it's hard to make a dollar 
You wastin' your time, swallow your pride, be smart 
You good to take advice? Alright, nigga get a job 
And a message to the niggas tryin' to sue me 
You make me hate the spotlight 
Cause I really wanna do you 
Lazy-ass bums, in-the-cut cowards 
Back door pussies stretchin' them undeserved dollars 
I know you want a taste, I'm a bring it to your face 
Bring it to your face, say it to your face 
I hear your little chatter sayin that the Bone done 
Smilin' in my presence hatin' on that Thug love 
But Bone got a category, fan base thug love 
Hit the avenues, never done, let 'em know it 
Y'all niggas chump change, chase fame, earn mine 
Within the right to take mine 
Take it to the top with a dream from the block 
Didn't believe, now they got they hands out 
Make me feel bad with the weight on my shoulders 
Damn, every time I turn around 
 
Every time that I turn around 
Gotta watch my back from these haters, cops and fakers 
Come with the drama, nothin' can break us 
Every time that I turn around 
Gotta watch my back from these haters, cops and fakers 
Come with the drama, nothin' can break us 
 
Every time I turn around 
Somebody givin' me the rules, a new ordeal 
The cops harassin', shakin' me down on parole 
and put a nigga through the whole damn spiel 
This kid lookin' polished 
No wonder I got a rap sheet way more enough to fill an album 
Stack keep it full throttle 
They lookin' for the heat, that's why they got 'em, C-L-E my motto 
Within the Lord I'll abide 
Example of a good role model I'm tryin' to provide 
But every time they pull me over, it's like I'm back on trial 
They tryin' to catch a thug dirty while I'm ridin' 
You see a nigga fully rehabilitated 
Back reunited with my fam, still we are the greatest 
Broke up then we woke up (woke up) 
Spoke up, niggas got it together and made up (made up) 
Now we got 'em jumpin' back on the bandwagon 
When we gon' drop? That's all they keep askin' 
When we do this shit we'll hit the fan 
Every sucka that hated on they gon' get a thrashin' now 
Every time I turn around  
these biters tryin' to take our sound 
But yo it ain't nothin' that can fade our style, my style 
 
Every time that I turn around 
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there 
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier-ier 
Every time that I turn around 
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there 
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier 
 
Every time I turn around gotta listen to the sound 
of the negative crawlin' all over the ground 
Like look what you did, let me enter in your kiss 
Nigga save me, suck my what? I'll kill your babies nigga 
So the wicked was the corner place, dweller place 
Never gon' eat that, eat that 
Satan the original serpent on his last track 
Flat broke, dead on his back, crawlin' on his belly 
Lookin' for his celly, I can call the telly 
L.A., Kelly, Rowland, rollin 
Next my ass, I know you bitch 
You gets no ass, goin down like Nelly 
Every time that I turn around 
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there 
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier-ier 
 
Turn around 
Every time that I turn around 
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there 
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier 
Every time that I turn around 
Every time that I turn around</field>

'Creepin' On Ah Come Up' from sunup to sundown.  
Movin', we get up and get around. 
(Facts don't lie!) (Uh huh, uh huh, Uh huh) 
Where snoozin' is for loosers, that's something we can't allow! 
No matter what, we holdin' it down!  
(Facts don't lie!) (Uh huh, uh huh, Uh huh) 
 
Hey! Run up on me nigga you better be ready with your heat. 
If you wanna know if I'm really a "G" then get out your car and come see! 
And I'm like a battering-ram, knockin' them bustas flat on their back. 
I'll show 'em how bad I am the baddest when it comes to this rap! 
My nigga now Flesh is home.  
Bizzy Bone he's still insane. 
And I'm still hangin' with with Lay.  
This nigga Wish Bone he ain't changed. 
D.J. U-Neek supplied the beat,  
That nigga's still creepin' up on ah come-up! (Yeah!) 
They sayin' the thugstas fell off, they washed up, they done! What?! 
We claimed and we say the game is done!  
A hot rapper that ain't used Bone's flow? 
Name me one, I'll wait! (I'll wait) 
Nigga it is what it is,  
We made it do what it do, just remember this here! Uh huh! 
 
This for my aces and my spades! All of my N.W.A's, 
All of my above-the-law niggas knowin' the tricks of the trade. 
Hey! It's like a pay day nigga! flesh gon' call it a lay day, nigga. 
I'm a call it a Kray day nigga, you Bizzy, Wishin', this mayday, nigga! 
I got an AK nigga like my name was Jeremy. 
My heart like Stew's nigga, so these niggas is scared of me. 
They don't compare to me, never gonna get ahead of me!  
Money the mission it better be. 
Livin' my life Heavenly.  
These streets is watchin' me studyin' B-O-N-E. 
The hustle is really in me, so money we makin' plenty. 
'Bout the skills and the bills. 
Still collectin' for the thrill. 
So I'll with the real. I just tell the bear to chill! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
My niggas we at you on a do or die mission! 
It's about to get ugly for you,  
We threw the bait and they took it now since they hooked, 
Flesh will cut 'em up something lovely!  
And serve em one hell of a platter, 
Worse than a natural disaster!  
They should've expected this chapter! 
But! There's no way to prepare plus they game ain't ready for it! 
Them original thugs, got something that'll shut all you bitch niggas up! 
Trust! that facts don't lie!  
Stack's about to take flight! 
No tellin' how long that ass'll gone nap  
When I cut off your fuckin' light switch! 
Shakin' you niggas up with each medley.  
So heavy it's deadly still the rawest of reaper melody. 
Fresh off the main line.  
From the pen and the county right back to the block, 
No matter where we at we holdin' it down "G"! 
 
Some of you niggas got soldiers  
How many of you got it that need to have a hole in em, 
Wanna lay back, wanna stretch that 
And pop a cold one huhh. like "Fuck!" 
Ain't too many that can walk in my shoes! 
I never think of losin',  
I do my part with a lot heart  
So I suggest you stay up out of my ozone 
And listen so it's clearly in the block with that top gone (top gone!) 
Don't pretend I'll bust first  
Cause that's if they do fear and now you wanna argue 
Getting back would be my new career retire on that ass, 
You sick with that flow  
But I'm so quick with that grab and blast! 
You sensitive niggas get shattered like broken glass!  
So we can do my thugstas like whoa! 
Silence is all you hear, and ain't nobody talking! You just gone.  
Play with me, nigga! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
These are the signs of time, time, time.

If I had one wish, that wish would be clear 
That I would not have to go, that I could stay here

For now I am gone, for now I am gone (gone)

When I'm dead and gone don't even worry 
Don't mourn me too long, death'll get you discouraged 
Keepin' your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtin' 
I know it for certain if I'm really restin' in heaven 
No need for you to fear, don't cry 
Cause death won't forever have a grip on our lives 
So I'm a be comin', be ready for the next shine 
Cause I'm a believer that I'll see a resurrection 
Don't believe that I'll burn in hell 
I study the scriptures and they learn me well 
No trippin', no drippin', no purgatory I dwell 
I sleep, I rest in piece 'til I prevail 
It's just a temporary lay down, I won't forever stay down 
So keep me in your memory, don't let me fade out 
I'll probably never see you at the crossroads 
Guess I was wrong, I'm gone gone, long gone 
 
[Chorus] 
 
We hit the road back in 1993 
Had a vision like a prophet, the project was go see 
The logic was so deep, I come back and do a lotta good 
I heard the callin' so I headed out to Hollywood 
One-way tickets, my niggas and no fear 
Some said that we was trippin', the mission was so clear 
Don't wanna go there, the money was over there 
I still love ya 9-9, I miss ya St. Clair 
Yeah, now I'm movin' on a roller coaster 
Just ridin', tryin' to be Jehovah's soldier 
And I'm grindin', tryin' to make it better for ya 
So for now I best be gone, be gone 
I made a vow to change the world somehow 
I'm a impact it and see it in this lifetime 
On the dark road to bring back the sunshine 
But for now I'm gone - I gotta go get it 
 
[Chorus] 
 
If it's out there to get, then I'm a go and get it 
Get it 'til I got nothin' left, chasin' better livin' 
It's a 'tinuous mission, so I'm steady movin' 
And I gotta get it in, never settle for losin' 
I'm a Thug true, add to or get out the way 
You could settle for less, but I need more on my plate 
Eatin' good, family good 
Okay 'til that day I'm a get up and move, move 
Show my babies how the Thug do, ooh 
I'm a play it like it's my last game 
If it's due better give it up right away 
Cause a thug nigga's gonna bring pressure 
See me fucked up, starvin' nigga, never 
And as long as niggas out here gettin' paid 
Back to my old ways, who they gonna run and tell, huh? 
It's a street thang, c'mon 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Yeah we ready, back up in 'em with nothin' but the harmony rhythm 
Hard hittin' flows all we give 'em 
Flows that spit venom, no cop, there goes the end of 'em 
Ever since the beginnin' we winnin' it 
Get a glimpse of legends standin' on deck 
'Til we come we'll be here holdin down the set 
Keep on wonderin' what the Bone 'bout to do next 
Still they humble and the hungriest, God bless 
The fan fam' flex all across the U.S. 
Overseas and Tel Aviv and back west 
You know we go the hardest, no need to say we better than the rest 
It's obvious more or less 
Came down off my high from the wet 
When I had to do a stretch, I signed so I cashed the check 
Had me caught up in a game, insane, my head blown

Hard times got my mind in bind. 
I'll go crazy tryin' to climb out the grime that's in my life (my life). 
I'm surprised I survived.  
It's amazin'! (amazin')  
I'm alive, I got by with my life! 
 
Every time I look around it seem  
Like I'm in trouble, pressured by the devil. 
Lord I love You and I really trust You.  
Wish that I could hug You. 
Disappear from the grain and the rubble  
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under. 
We ride, Eastside, blowin' in the wind. 
Each time I try, they lie, no lie!  
Judgin' from the outside lookin' in. 
Never had a clue of what Id really do.  
The ghetto pushin' through, but I'm a do it right. 
Never buckle, never stop to struggle! 
Layzie gotta muscle through the pressure,  
Bust pipes, my life, highlights,  
Bright lights, all right! Story of a warrior.  
My flight, final destination, thug motivation,  
Time never wastin', pacin' my stride. 
 
Tryin' to get it good! Feel the hustle and flow. 
You know we are them mighty soldiers. 
Had it been for all the shit we been through  
And doin' whatever but God surely knows. 
So here we are steady on the go.  
Its too late cause we been through crazy. 
Everyday seem to bring a twist  
That take us on a loop but we don't let it phase. 
Raisin these babies through it. 
 We never run away from responsibility, but where you goin'? 
Youre gonna have to face the music anyway.  
Livin' through a true reality but you be blowin'!. 
If they test you make em feel the pressure,  
Let off some aggression and yo the flesh  
Will really give em something to stress,  
More likely even less. 
 
[Chorus] 
 
My life! (My life)  
Lil' nigga bailin' through the hood,  
Livin' crooked like I could. 
Get cha for your goods! Make it understood! Put it on the wood! 
Nigga what! (what!) I used to have to grind in the dough. 
Did a little time in the poke. 
A couple wicked rhymes  
That I wrote really helped a nigga shine with my folks. 
Cause, nigga, I was broke.  
Eazy heard us go. And Eazy said, 
Whoa, yall niggas dope!  
Five niggas loc, five killer flows, y'all finna blow! 
So temptation made us sign the papers overnight sensation! 
Clearly chasing satan.  
Niggas really famous. 
Got a lot of haters, calling us the greatest,  
Number one and can't nobody fade us! 
Got that top spot (done did it, done did it)  
And then came back fallin' down. (down) 
 
I don't know what happened?  
What happened? Why did Eazy die? 
Whats wrong with Bizzy? He alright!  
Is Flesh really comin' home? Is Bizzy comin' home? 
Just wish he'd come and take Henny the dome!  
I'm so high, stay faded. (faded) 
Might feel a little better but the pain stays there.  
Its OK, the real gotta spike. 
Everywhere we go, the hood ? 
They can relate to the fight, the real from the fake. 
Sound good hes alive. 
 
[Chorus] 
 
As I wake up early in the morning.  
Light my cigarette and wake up all my bitches. 
Take a shower, quickly tell The Lord I love Him!  
Didn't invite the devil cause I gave him ? evil. 
I never ever thought I'd keep my candles-lit up,  
Get em' hit em' get em' ? Bizzy! 
Nobody know my struggle nor my hustle.  
I'm a certified rider! Gave up all my children. 
Women in my shit and dipping,  
Now you know the Lord is always with me that's my only weapon. 
Talk to every sinner Bless em'.  
Then I raise my seven ? and I don't give a fuck either!  
Television celebratin Livin ?  
Every now and then I'm chillin'. 
Nigga this is my life and I'm a live it  
And give it right back to God.  
Now listen!</field>

[Chorus: x2] 
Now that I'm gone 
None of my enemies can hate on me now 
And all my friends can do is pray for me now 
Only God can judge me 
 
Now that I'm dead and gone I finally got these niggas up out of my business 
Death has severed all my friendships, it's been hell ever since I've been here 
All these fake niggas come to my funeral, look at them sheddin' they dry tears 
Look at my baby mamas and them trippin' out, actin' a fool front of my kids 
Then I got niggas puttin' drug paraphernalia in my casket 
A spliff, a picture of me still livin and a bullet from a Magnum 
Man I feel bad for my family, but in death it's a safer place 
than bein' amongst these chumps and scavengers, then one of my niggas say 
He said, "I'll see you in the afterlife" (in the afterlife) 
Don't he know that it's only G-O after life? My nigga been learned wrong 
I don't plan on goin' to heaven, I'm tryin' to get ready for the resurrection 
But until then I'm patiently restin', think of my sins, no need on me stressin' 
 
[Chorus] 
 
See now that I'm gone and I'm dead  
And I'm buried in life in a hurry like why did I run with straps? 
I made it, tell Fe-Fe don't worry, I scrambled and scurried but only my lungs collapse 
Surely I'll make you a song for that, how could I really go wrong with that? 
Sayin' that smokin' was killin' my vocals, not sayin' that Layzie put on for rap 
Known for rap and soldier'd up, can't none of y'all say that I owed y'all nothin' 
When I fade to black just hold it up, y'all better say that I made y'all somethin' 
When the shells collapse and the soul relax, lookin' down at yo' body (Wally) 
Walk through the tunnel went into the bright light, hopin' he did right by somebody 
I mean, I ran with the right team, did my dirt had fun in the night life 
It wasn't a pipe dream, my legacy tellin' me I live Christ-like 
I hear what they sayin' but fuck all the weepin', I peep it just keep it, I live mine 
Celebrate them good times, just read the will, Stevie, Stevon 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Life dealt me a raw deal, had to make it for what it was worth so went on to sick-ville 
Just what have I done? Signed in my balance then had to get strong when I took the deal 
Strugglin' and strivin', farther my purpose to toil harder 
Tryin' to make good off my honor 'til a hater really make me a martyr 
Kiss my, gonna miss my daughters, hope I taught my seeds proper 
I love my mother and father equal but I did damage to so many people 
So much evil it's hard to see through the dark, gotta fight fire with fire 
Let it spark and light up my way, they said he went out in a blaze 
My enemies steady hatin' waitin' for me to take my last breath 
No longer Flesh, had peace and yet the rest consume and avenge my death 
Served my stretch, did my best then it's back to the Lord who made me 
All the rest of y'all can judge but it's only up to God to save me

They know I'm crazy by the flow 
N-gga never lazy 'bout my dough, dough, dough 
I'm in the flesh but I'm quest for mo' 
Bizzy, Wish, and baby just pay me the money I'm owed, owed, owed 
 
Oh yeah 
Back is that mighty reala 
Oh yeah 
Doin' it the way they never 
Oh yeah, Ooooh, oooh yeah, ah yeah 
 
See, all I know was get out and get it 
I stay on the grind all night 'til my feet go numb 
Blowin' mo' weed than Cheech and Chong 
Livin' by the motto: To each his own 
Got speed, its on 
Flesh freed, he home 
Then we'd go wrong, it wasn't in the plan 
Designed by the Man upstairs 
This testimony and we say, 'We can, we can!' 
We can do it 
Gotta put ya mind to it 
Put ya feet in the dirt 
Just push right through it 
When shit get rough 
You gotta stick to it 
Play that Bone Thug music 
It's that feel-good music 
Chill or act a fool with it 
Real thug niggas with real-life drama is just like watchin' a movie 
Soundtrack of my life 
Right how they bounce back more than twice 
Alright, I admit we done did some crazy shit 
But I stop, repent 
Kept God in my sights 
Recognize it was a fight 
Either you're wrong or you're right 
Let the song be the light 
Eternally them Bone Thug soldiers 
I'm Mighty Mo-Thuggin' fo' life! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Oh, yeah 
They back, finna hit y'all with that mighty real good, oh 
No doubt about it 
You bound to feel it good 
We still hood, even though we came up 
Changed the whole game up 
No matter how much they angry steady saying we ain't the same. 
Pointing the blame at us 
The only thing is Imma go get it even if I gotta split your wig 
They can't get enough of my style cause I got the job well done winning it (winnin' it) 
Big up's to all of my hustlers 
While the globe spinnin', it ain't time to sleep 
Break me off a piece of that paradise pie 
'Til the day I die, Imma represent my peeps 
Hit up food from all of this 
Somebody sneak they piece 
Nothin' but heat for the streets 
Now turn up that Bone beat (beat) 
They tried to hold me, but couldn't keep me down cause Flesh got a whole world of my trues to be found 
 
[Chorus] 
 
You owe me money, man 
If not I gotta get my respect 
It's too many years of grindin' 
Baby mama want my royalty checks 
It ain't about Twista 
But nobody flippin' their tongue like Ripsta 
No nigga done caused my earthquake like march 
Remember that way little Capo got hurt when 
My niggas is hurtin' daily 
Good thing Wally see me and Krayzie 
They would have just left them hailin 
And there were shots in the melee 
It was never to protect myself 
little Layzie got em baby! 
And I pop, popped everyone else 
Tanks swell over the double 
Me problems tends again and never left 
When I see the face of Zee 
Bothers me, back'n yo step! 
You never could feel my wepts (remember that) 
Would never have got dissed with Bone 
Off to another dimension 
You owe me, but I'm on my own 
Now come on! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Yeah! 
Still chasin' that paper, dawg 
And I won't slow down 'til I done made it all 
They better give me what's mine 
Imma get it then go grind 
Get up in it one mo' time (time) 
Better ask about my rep 
Better check yourself, self, self 
They must've thought I was somebody else, body else 
Yeah, everybody better (?) little bit of Bone Thugs 
Bet they'll never own us 
We originated that there, sho' nuff 
Better run and go get they flow heard 
Came from Cleveland, Ohio 
The realest that I know 
They'll never sound nothin' like Bone, clones! 
Them faders, the greatest, and even the haters is singin' 
Yeah we make 'em zone 
We make 'em sing, sing! 
No matter what they say 
Everybody, all know Bone changed the game, game, game 
We made them sing like me 
Against the grain, grain, grain 
If they don't wanna respect me and where I come from 
I tell 'em they can run on up, come on over and get 'chu some, get 'chu some, some

Energy of an eagle.

Niggas don't wanna see me fly higher than a rocket ship. 
Life is not rocket science. 
Every day is documented. 
All of my time is occupied. 
I'm gonna grind and I'm gonna shine! 
Ballin' 'til the end of time. 
Hate on me and it's all fine! 
You just ain't no friend of mine. 
 
I'm tryin' to focus on bigger and better things. 
With so many odds against me, I had to step up my game! 
Imagine problems with crooked coppers. 
Why they wanna go there? 
Try to pop me, lock me, but couldn't knock me off my square. 
I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see Flesh stretched out without one thug, 
While I'm steady stressin' out 
But we doin' our own thing ' the wrong thing. 
You suckas fail every time tryin' to stop my shine!

Stay away, fade away, playa hater! (I need you to) 
Stay away, fade away, playa hater! 
Stay away, fade away, playa hater! 
Twenty-four seven grindin'! 
Tryin' to get my shine on. 
That don't give 'em a reason to hate me, hate me, hate me! 
But I know my mind's strong. 
None of you suckas can break me! (Ha!) 
Nothin' can save ya now! 
They caught the Krayzie vapors! 
Stay away, fade away, playa hater! 
There's really no need to be crowdin' me, 
'Cause I can't deal with you haters surroundin' me, houndin' me! 
Tryin' to get my paper, hard to keep my faith up. 
It's time for me to raise up, and do this sucker shake up. 
True T-H-U-G's and we come to kill you, kill you, kill you! 
I think they might be scared (might be scared) to let me shine 'cause I'm a righteous playa!

Push that's why I got my swagga down. 
Could never slip in the clip in. 
I know they want my life. 
Any weakness, not here, you know that Wish gonna ride! (ride) 
Hit the streets with that, better love! 
Watch out if you kiss and tell. 
You know not to show 'em love. 
It's just that they talk too much. 
They never know who to trust. 
And just when you get enough, a target ' you will become. 
That's just the (?) 
 
It's the devil's perpetuation! 
Tryin' to make my innocence. 
It's my retaliation, I don't need no ignorance. 
I'm standing against this army with Bone Thugs-n-harmony, harmony. 
Danger is just a part of me, like it's stuck in my arteries. 
These poor playa-haters are the motivators. 
But I get my paper, paper. 
The same rappers that hated us bought the verses, so we can take from them. 
Critics ' we can't escape from them. 
Don't you drink too much Hennessey. 
Ain't no time for to be slippin', we the world's worst enemy! 
 
Why they gotta hate? (Hate!)

Made it up with my pride

Why they wanna steal my shine?

Put some classic in your music, and put some tragic in your music 
And make it platinum when you do it, and feed your family while you do it 
That's how my Thugstas get it crackin', attackin' and move to it 
Make it happen, take advantage, do that and act true to it 
We're ready for anything and we sing to make through it 
No time for delays, back down, we can't do it 
Doin' our thang, see the Bone remain strong, y'all knew it 
 
So give it all you got, give it all you got, don't stop

Sound good, just like our orchestra when we 'round wood 
Late night, burnin' barrels; play fight, singin' carols 
Stage fright, nigga never, we be on the level! 
The World's Enemy, rebel never settle for less 
No them haters ain't on our, level, incredible, yes we are the best 
We gets live, it'll be no others liver 
Wise when they ride with us, soul survivors

United we stand even though we might fall out 
It's all in the fam' if family members brawl out 
Whenever whatever, never say never, yes we goin' all out 
We stuck with a plan, them Thugstas boys made it 
Now we keep 'em stuck in a trance, it's hard to shake it 
With that lyrical combination that flipped it and swept the nation 
Mystical, creator, motivator of true innovations 
It's music don't abuse it, just use it and evade your pain 
Don't let them harmonies fool ya, still take aim 
Comin' to let it go, we show no mercy to lames 
A whole fifth sippin', that ounce of kush we smokin' mayne

I think you're gonna have to find who you are 
Can't find your, lane but you wanna be a star 
A star, do you wanna be a star? 
Can't find your, lane but you wanna be, wanna be a star 
 
I know the grind, she tryin' to be a star, she goin' hard 
Doin' a hundred in the car but never could make it out the yard 
Cause you're stalled, how, when you can't even get it started? 
It's probably cause you too naughty to get up in the party 
She wanna make it so she'll sleep with him, late night creep with him 
He'll tell her he can make her famous if she did him 
Suck him lick him, another victim of a "bust and ditch 'em" 
Why must you suffer this when really love, what's the mission? 
Because you still live in your daddy and your momma house 
Shoulda knew homie was not about to go the dumber route 
Left you with a lot of doubt, kinda like in a drought 
Got no mo' integrity, slow flow, what you tellin' me? 
There's jealousy goin' on, all because she wanna make it famous 
And sip champagne with the greatest 
So you wanna be a star, the ride you'll take is evident 
You'll never get ahead so it's irrelevant (relevant)

Baby girl can sing, she thick, man I think she got it 
But they tellin' me to watch her, call her baby pockets 
So I bring it to her straight, to a real knight 
She got herself on protection, we all good all night 
She said they only wanna cut, bustas never business 
Sometimes she wishes but uh, maybe then they'll listen 
Dirty game, I feel the same 
And do I think her career woulda jumped if she just laid down 
A tear in her eye, baby don't cry 
And then she told me all about her church background 
And how she lovin' this life, livin' this life 
Now I think I'm dealin' with a headcase 
Any heart put it all in, tell yo'self it's a must-win 
Apply pressure never give up, laugh in the end then fuck 'em 
Stay on yo' paper nigga straight face, attitude nigga pay me 
Still wanna be a star, huh, huh? Reach hard! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Hear you wanna be a star, huh? 
Think you got what it take to make it large, huh? 
Don't even know who you are, huh? 
You say you wanted to learn it, huh? You say everybody feelin' you 
"Flesh I hear 'em" what a wonderful tinglin' feel in you 
How straight are your priorities? So the story goes 
Chasin' dreams, all they tellin' them is sacrifice they souls 
You really listenin'? Learn a lesson from these bro's 
Playin' the game it's heavy heatin' up and down that road 
 
They say the boy got talent but he can't catch a break 
He doin' everything he can but he makin' mistakes 
Plus he runnin' with the crowd cause he wanna be seen 
Got the tendency to follow instead of takin' the lead 
We in the league of extraordinary gentlemen check 
And if you wanna play the game you got to give 'em the step 
Make no impression with expression but you gotta be focused 
They don't pick you for the team just because you the dopest 
Too many niggas got the game twisted lookin' for fame 
Instead of lovin' what they do, and makin' a name 
It's a shame how they idolize the idiot box 
Feel the pain in television, the deception and shock 
And when they finally figure out it ain't about what they seein' 
Take the money and the toys, niggas still human beings 
All of that ain't jack if you ain't got the respect 
Cause a real superstar know how to double them checks, yep 
 
[Chorus] 
 
I see women givin' they bodies like David Letterman love you 
Strugglin' in the hustle, slangin' tapes on the internet avenue 
Get you capitol shit, know how the ratchet do 
Sorry I was late to tell you exactly what masters do 
You don't have to sell your soul, no not anymore 
Parker Brothers, Ouija board, I covered that Adam whore 
Niggas get their labels but wait, it's a recession in weight 
You downloadin' on all the industry's veterans 
Been a star but bein' a star don't pay the bills 
Know 'bout the spinnin' wheels, baby Bizzy keep it real 
Don't open battle seals, no matter who you are 
Now get your money, only Jesus can make you a star 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Oh, ooh, oh (so you wanna be a star, star) 
You wanna be, you wanna be (never, never, never) 
You wanna be, oh, oh, oh (you say you wanna be a star, star) 
You wanna be, wanna be (never, never, never) 
Wanna be a star, star, star, star 
Oh, oh</field>

You can you meet me meet me in the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky!  
You could meet me in the sky,  
(You can meet me in the sky! )  
The sky, the sky, the sky, the sky.  
'Cause we flyin' above the haters! 
Oooh! 
'Cause we flyin' above the skyscrapers!  
 
They done gave me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!  
They done gave me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!  
They done gave me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!  
They done gave me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!  
 
I done made it up the mountain,  
Lookin' down on the valley,  
And I'm feelin' I can fly,  
So I dive off the cliff.  
Hear the little kids scream;  
They don't know I got wings.  
'Til I sprinkle them with the dreams,  
And I hit 'em with the gift.  
Say "Bye bye" to them haters, haters.  
No more lies ? they can't fade us, fade us!  
Why they wanna test?  
Now you rockin' with the best  
And my whole fan fam' is the greatest, greatest.  
Moves countin' like a calculator,  
Evaluate the master playas.  
Operation: "Stack Your Paper."  
Captivatin' money makers feel the love from above, 
He's an eagle, he's a dove,  
Call him Bone's emancipator!  
Everybody's a congratulator.  
Come and ride on this elevator,  
Better yet take this escalator.  
Graduate to the new skyscrapers!  
 
When we put 'em on a level that's if you can deal with!  
We take it to 'em runnin' nothin' but realness!  
Surely livin' in the life, it's for the thrills.  
We went up and over the hill,  
Went through the whole drill!  
Haters try to kill with kindness,  
But there's nothin' they can do to the finest.  
Though they won't dare cross over the line,  
For tryin', y'all know what's gonna happen,  
So they might as well remain behind us.  
Way behind! We on the hardcore grind!  
I never take my mission for granted  
Since I'm cool they go and take it for weakness.  
Better take it in stride!  
They don't wanna see us alive,  
But yet we steady creepin', reapin', weepin'.  
N-ggas went and got in way too deep in! (deep in).  
You gotta practice that before you start preachin' (preachin')  
But ain't no way that they can keep up (keep up)  
'Cause we keepin' the heat on.  
It really don't matter where we can meet up!  
 
[Chorus] 
 
N-gga had it bad,  
'Cause I never had more than plenty cash,  
Thinkin' that the rainy days was over!  
Livin' in the past, livin' ghetto fab',  
Never lookin' back!  
But the fact is that I never went nowhere!  
The truth is, me and my own ghetto got a love affair.  
(Got a love affair)  
It's so real, things we did, my conscience outta here.  
I don't care, I deserve everything I earn.  
Hell yeah I deserve some pain!  
I know I hurt! Stop talkin'!  
Night-walkin' real night stalkers,  
Zoners, hungry, heard it here first!  
Don't believe me? With wings I'll meet ya!  
 
Playa hater hate!  
They can hate me but they better stay away or see Krayzie loc' insane!  
So if they wanna hate me let 'em hate me from the bottom,  
Way up underneath my feet.  
'Cause really I done turned a new leaf to never ever let the suckas rise,  
Or let them bustas kill the high.  
'Cause they jealous in the mind,  
They remind me of gravity always grabbin' at me,  
Pullin' me down. Bad storm for the flight,  
Keepin' me on the ground.  
Still I rise and when I takeoff they fall.  
(They fall, they fall)  
Raise to the ceiling,  
Try and stay away from the pretender.  
You don't really even get involved.  
(-Volved)  
We play 'em all from afar, in a distance (distance) 
 
[Chorus] 
 
And when I met Him in the sky,  
He had a body like a man and the lower body tellin'  
The Lord that he had a plan to make Him sure I wasn't evil.  
But I'm comin' with my people.  
Ain't no sequel, ain't no women,  
Ain't no vessels.  
I'ma settle with a scepter and a lethal dosage.  
I will live forever with a serpent on my head.  
Little glory, that's my man.  
I'll be damned!  
If I comin' through, I'm runnin' with my pistol.  
Weren't for Moses,  
I'ma die but I'ma come back wit' ya!  
(Wit' ya, wit' ya) 
That's the way to get ya.  
Picture sinister plots!  
I'm not "nigga with no land."  
I imagine a strand of lightning bolts and tightened ropes.  
I'm fightin' folk with no hope.  
Earth got me loc'ed! Now chillin' in the smoke house!  
No doubt! No clout!  
Now we're goin' all out!  
Earth-ball that's all!  
Never let the devil call.  
Revelations!  
Little Biggie n-gga so long!  
Go long! Metal was so precious.  
I was resurrected! Why?  
Juniors fly to The Creator.  
And my brother be, brother be 'C'.  
Throw it up!  
Uncle 'L' comin' straight from the sky, what!

As we continue to pick up the pieces, they follow us Kings 'til the sundown. 
Deadly issues of telekinesis, better show love or lay down. 
Everybody wanna sound like, sound like, sound like Bone, Bone, Bone! 
Everybody wanna rap like, rap like, rap like Bone, Bone, Bone! 
As we continue to pick up the pieces, they follow us Kings 'til the sundown. 
Deadly issues of telekinesis, better show love or lay down. 
 
Hold down! Welcome to the showdown! (Showdown!) 
I think it's 'bout time little Layzie let 'em know now. 
Take it to the streets and let the pump, pump go pow! 
Take my style, let me show you how I go wild. 
Now you playin' with a fully-grown man, with a fully-blown plan, with a fully-loaded clip. 
I don't play with little kids, I spank that ass, boy you know who we is!  (Bone, Bone, Bone!) 
My homies the greatest, I roll with the best, see? 
Who in the fuck wanna test these niggas from the S-C-T, C-L-E? 
We got heat! 
Y'all know what happened to the thief when the king catch him stealin', 
Got his hands in the cookie jar. 
Off with his hand! 
Fuck it, off with his head! 
Make him stand front and center, let me see what the rookie got? 
Bet a nigga ain't got nothin', they bluffin'! 
Tryin' to come up on somethin', bubblin'! 
I'm-a say this really, really, really loud! 
Y'all wanna rumble, I'll bust them, rush them! 
Trust him, never! 
On a whole 'nother level. 
If God The Creator, then y'all niggas' devils. 
The fight won't end 'til the war get settled. 
And Bone gonna win 'cause them Bone niggas' rebels. 
Playa, yeah, nigga! 
 
Everybody wanna sound like, sound like, sound like Bone, Bone, Bone! 
Everybody wanna rap like, rap like, rap like Bone, Bone, Bone!

They don't wanna see me shine! 
Everybody wanna sound like Bone though come back in the Bone zone! 
But you just beginnin' with the daddy you don't know. 
They call me The Granddad ' Granddaddy of the Bone flow! 
Well little lazy rappers, obviously we never figured this would be the lick and we'd be next to shine. 
And we got everybody screamin' and singin' but these out-of-shape suckas need exercise! 
So I'm-a get up in their mental. 
I'm-a work 'em out over the instrumental! 
Give 'em a criminal rhythm, the lyrical nympho! 
Wanna see the wicked? 
Better know what you're in for! 
First, the fan side could be forgiven ' you didn't know! 
Second time, I got up in 'em like "here we go!" 
No matter what, they sayin' we still the most realest that ever did it, feel me flow! 
And everybody want a little bit against a little Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh! 
A little taste so they can test and make 'em see how we the best 
And I'll be realer than the rest don't flex 'cause the pump gonna get 'em. 
I'm like a bullet to the chest, suffer a cardiac arrest that's so hard 
And I can still get their heart and leave 'em dead and give 'em all they can get! 
Send them suckas to the lyric cemetery, or the rap hospital. 
Never no competition! 
 
Everybody wanna sound like, sound like, sound like Bone, Bone, Bone!

Come 'on, now let me take you back to The Land, you know where the heart of it all. 
In 1993, when we was up out the scene. 
The fellas with hell of a harmony with the flow hooked up with Eazy-E and shook up the industry and y'all just in time to get another phase. 
This certainly is somethin' that you wouldn't wanna miss! 
The drama when it hit the fan, we got 'em trippin' off the gift, and split a wig up with a pretty sick twist. 
The Ruger like a surgeon and it's on, exactly what I cut you with is sharper than a scalpel. Actually, it's too many Bone Thug clones and they all malpractice, arrested, and send 'em to the gallows! 
My trues brought a style that's unfound and you can feel it naturally. 
But we ain't no magicians. 
Really ain't no thing to make a fraud disappear. 
Steady givin' what they love to hear, make 'em listen up close. 
Everybody know we got the dough. 
We choppin' nothin' but missiles, still the nigga who the greatest! 
Y'all lost! 
Can't even afford the cost, this is authentic and nothin' that's dealin' with them world-wide bosses! 
We got the sauce, baby, we got the juice! 
We keep 'em in a frenzy fiendin' for more! 
On the ThugLine with F.B.G., 7th Sign, and Mo' Thug once again we about to blow! 
We about to blow! Set it off, explode! 
Set it off, explode! 
 
Everybody wanna sound like, sound like, sound like Bone, Bone, Bone! 
Everybody wanna rap like, rap like, rap like Bone, Bone, Bone! 
As we continue to pick up the pieces, they follow us Kings 'til the sundown. 
Deadly issues of telekinesis, better show love or lay down.

I'm-a treat it like a race and I gotta win it! 
Ahead of you bums with the Bone flow, thug invented. 
Haters wanna wonder why them thug niggas still gettin' in. 
Nothin' changed the game like we did so we here, still with it. 
Gotta tell the truth. 
We changed things. 
Bringin' somethin' new that's everlasting. 
I'm-a keep it real. 
It's next to nothin'! 
Doin' the same thing 'cause less creating. 
Flow just borin', the spit just corny. 
What happened to old bitin' 'self? 
Writin' battles done face to face. 
I miss those days. 
These days, ghost writers, fake artists with nothin' to say. 
I'm-a give it Wish due my street dues. 
Just stay cool. 
I know I got you when I need to pop you'll let loose. 
And you don't wanna see a thugsta hit with a Grey Goose. 
Or we could buy the bar, just stay cool and we good. 
Recognize we thug, could of been all hood. 
The flow's all love, thugs could of been all hood. 
Pick up on it, never fully get it - this Bone flow! 
Smilin', hatin' but you'll see me on the low! (low) 
In the game with the number one! 
Straight from the Cleveland slums. 
Straight off the block, never hustle to the floor though. 
Kickin' 'em down how them Bone Thugs came through. 
Yeah, yeah. 
We took it to another level (level), level (level), level (level) 
Yeah! 
 
Everybody wanna sound like, sound like, sound like Bone, Bone, Bone! 
Everybody wanna rap like, rap like, rap like Bone, Bone, Bone! 
As we continue to pick up the pieces, they follow us Kings 'til the sundown. 
Deadly issues of telekinesis, better show love or lay down.

As soon as I'm receivin' the call, now give me the ball, I run with the dogs, then keep the b'all. Now meet me at the mall, you can check on every shelf on the wall, they makin' money off the Bone Thugs! 
Equipped with a saw, with a knife in my back. 
Everybody rappin' fast, but the harmony ain't in it, and now that's too much to pass. 
Now that's too much to ask when you pick up a crash course style to change-up, come on! (I swear!) My trigger-finger's itchy, but my carpel tunnel was gone it was written and rippin' problems like water flowin' in humbles. 
I'm workin' with seven shovels, the grave-diggers and others! 
Nobody understand The Man. 
Clones, now shut-up! 
I'm quicker than a boogey-wicked-monster, never just like the movie. 
We know when we pray to God. 
Keep goin' we get the hustle on in the Spring, Fall! 
In Summers and the Winter months, we gonna praise Jesus! 
Don't even represent us, like we ain't said nothin'! 
Present the flow then grown know where we come from. 
Sun come shine in, Equinox rhymin', Layzie (Layzie!) perfect timin', grab my gun! (gun, gun) 
Much love to my nigga young Hova, Twista, Bun B, Pimp C, A.C. Killer! 
Get your money, get your paper. 
Elevate like my nigga DMX, here's a prayer, God bless playa! 
 
Everybody wanna sound like, sound like, sound like Bone, Bone, Bone!

then give them the buisness they gonna feel it when we jack 
and be quick with it 
be crack 
hit it with the lyrical accuracy and harmony i'ma see who 
i ain't fuckin' with the midwest 
you could try attackin' me and bombin' 
me i'ma be spittin' so fast 
they wanna ask how he did that? 
bone thugs and we gotta spit a hard flow 
it's worthy compitition everywhere that i go 
but ain't no messin' with cleveland or chicago 
ballin' through the hood in a murcielago 
or gallardo 
or ferrari 
or diablo 
as long as the car go quick 
flow so sick 
thought it was drama between bone and twista we do it like this 
i'm from a place 
really ain't safe 
cleveland the birthplace 
midwest niggas

come see it for your self how live it can be 
been walkin' to the chi back down to the d 
michigan 
illinois 
sho-nuff killa boys 
standin' on the corner at 10 degrees 
we got pimps 
dope pushers 
and petty thieves 
crooked ass cops won't let me breathe 
all my love for the city won't let me leave 
what they expect from me? 
they want the best from me 
they gonna get it 
yeah 
i think it's time we show them bone 
how we ride 
and let everyone know just where we come from midwest bounce 
it's that bounce 
that make a nigga feel it when he off that ounce 
of the mary mary mary jane 
we the niggas showin' them different side of thangs 
never seen a nigga that switched the rhyme this way 
now everybody run and flip they style today 
yup it's kinda strange but 
a nigga got to give it up to the midwest 
who made 'em pick up the page before they get left 
get a little bit of twista and hit that 
roll it up with some bone thug sit back 
just feel the vibe 
and ya never let a player hater kill ya high 
with this shit we be spittin' we gon' steal ya mind 
once again it's the midwest side 
you can tell by the way i walk 
the way i flow from around here 
nigga midwest where the weed ain't the best but we came up 
now we get flew from the west coast 
we flow fast 
so many words in one bar 
we spit it 
rap it 
nigga better go hard 
who the underdogs 
the west done done it

jeremiah 10: 23,24 
"we will know oh lord that to earthly men his way does not belong 
it does not belong to man who must walk even to direct his step 
correct me oh jehovah however with judgement not in anger 
that you may not reduce us to nothing" 
order my steps 
lead me 
guide me 
everyday send your anointing father 
i pray order my steps in the world 
why am i payin' this price for fame now with the shame 
i'm goin' blame cause i'm solo empty 
when i can stop and give it all to christ 
cause in his name no weapon should be formed against me 
simply know that the world gonna tempt me satan is the enemy 
god please help us i don't want to be selfish 
i don't want to live my life tryin' to be rebellious 
who be checkin' when ya know ya doin' wrong huh? 
got your steps 
give your blessings 
know right from wrong turn the lights on 
all ya gotta do is follow faith till they call us all home 
but its so hard temptation is everywhere 
gotta hold my guard like oh my god 
hallelujah 
hallelujah 
now i might not make it to heaven 
but i'm tryin' to come back in the resurrection change my place in paradise 
so i pray to god try to change my life 
but temptation make it hard for me to make it out 
man i gotta quit lustin' i need to stop smokin' 
i need god's guidance without it i'm hopeless 
lord please help me stand strong 
a lot of soldiers in the pin ain't ever comin' home 
can you find it in your heart to pray 
so it seems everything goin' wrong 
and you're just tryin' to find your way 
momma just wanna feed her babies 
tryin' to keep a safe place to stay 
don't stress it's a test god bless all ya 
really gotta do is just keep your faith 
you can feel it if you open up 
you can get it if you need love 
as much as a mustard seed is all you need 
small person pays for the air that we breathe 
and the baby is born 
place to go when we leave 
food that we eat 
weapon when we sleep 
it's a miracle no believin' the lord 
hey! 
what you seein' on the news has already been written in the bible 
but ain't nobody takin' the time to realize that believin' and readin' 
the scriptures could mean your survival and i don't wanna die no never 
i wanna live forever and i would a lot better 
so when armageddon really come true what you gonna do? 
swing low god loves me 
swing low ask me how i know 
swing low god loves me 
ask me how i know 
swing low god loves me 
ask me how i know 
swing low 
swing low i know cause the bible tells me so 
you know god is good 
you know god is great and everyday i wake 
i gotta thank him for my life and even though its hard 
i know i make mistakes i give it everything it takes just to make it right 
this is satan's land understand the plan you jesus 
coming back with a furious mind better praise everyday

and you know ain't nobody perfect 
and when the curtains close

and it looks like the sinnin' won't end 
so i'm reachin' high up above

girl 
i will be there when the morning comes 
'cause these hands were made for survival 
there's many levels to my hustle 
the struggle won't take me under 
they wonder how i survived it 
kill it then revive it 
witness a survivor 
the man is strictly the provider 
the ambitionz of a ridah 
it's too strong 
i gotta make it 
but if makin' it mean i gotta fake it 
i'd rather stay on my cray shit 
basement 
nigga we keeping it real around here 
they tried to lock us out of the game so now we're coming from 'round rear 
gotta hold my head up high 
only got ten toes on the pavement 
the survival's oh so real 
with one foot in the grave 
we just signed a new deal 
plenty more money to make 
i can eat whatever meal 
now i can get my bills paid 
still hold down the block 
still runnin' and duckin' cops 
tryna slam me back down but that's not possible 
i'm keeping my eyes on the prize man 
that's how i'm focus 
pedal to the medal and my own lane wide open 
girl

yes here bizzy be still in the zone 
when niggas ask me what i'm doing 
i proceed to make it known 
you don't have to be the coolest 
it don't mean you ain't a bone 
i'ma have to be the truest 
homily to leave the throne 
nobody fuckin' with me 
got be ready and then i be gone 
and after i'm done 
they gotta purport fear 
baby we're debutant 
have no motherfucking fear and i put that on the lord 
i'ma pull out one of my swords 
i don't give nobody none of my tears 
i live and work 
girl

'cause these hands were made for survival 
give 'em an inch

aaaahhh! 
ooohhh! whoooo! 
what have we done to the world? 
look what we've done! 
everybody's gone crazy 
amamzed that it ain't the same. their faith has swayed! everything done got a little bit stranger 
major complications plague the days. everybody caught up in the fame and bright lights. while so many gonna swing in the night life. stabbin' ourselves with so many pains! 
life's like really leavin' me plain as i fight to try to make it out of satan's 
system. but really all they gotta do is shape the world. make the world realize we must escape this world! 
hopin' i can get up outta here with my integrity and come up on a better 
me and try to do it big 
do it big and through it to the heavenly 
won't be no hell for me 
just paradise 
so what you gonna do 
what you gonna do? 
when the new world order come for you. all you can do 
what you can do is recognize the truth! 
realize these signs could pertain to you too! 
it's just for comfortability! 
it's killin' me floatin' rock already we damage the ozone. ain't nothin' been hot as the sun since steady b flex his authority! 
and what may be important to me 
electricity's older than trees. and that's why the lighting be crackin' the sky. precious the metal was meltin' 
but what about me? 
when it comes to the mind 
core 
and the animals stick with us. b go with fire 
entangle the body 
the brain 
and security 
visual forces are 
not with us 
why? 
and the timing is dire! 
oh 
i'm rich i feel so elated it's time to go. i love you baby. before and after i'll remain to the day with a theory 
from here to lake 
erie. you know that the devil's a liar! 
the choir 
i sit on my phone 
all alone with my baby just singin' my melody. raisin' a son. i never get tired 
i'm too rugged for 
i couldn't retire! another dimension. releasin' my tension. they're payin' attention 
they're walkin' so blind. oracles 
snakes. signs keep showin' 
goin' on. can't believe how my mind has blown. i witness mostly wickedness. how much more mischief can go wrong? 
steady holdin' on down to slow it down 
tryin' to make it to a better place. with the enemies up 
they stay wide awake and everybody else caught up 
in the rat race. watch how they done trap you. don't let 'em catch you. wipe away your whole existence. it's not easy to resist temptation or escape all the resentment. so much 
tension 
seem like i'm havin' a nightmare that's reoccurin'. the vision is blurry 
the 
curtain is closin' in a hurry 
that's something worthy of worry. dig deep and researchers 
their story is full of dissention and 
transgression! 
now we gotta find a way to reserve this recession. what have we done? lord what have we done? 
look what we've done! look what we've become! 
lord what have we become? 
richest country in the whole wide world. then why do got hungry little boys 
little girls? spent. in one man lies their dreams. come clean 
just come clean. mothers 
fathers 
sons 
and daughter 
it all adds up to their selfish greed! 
they're greedy 
greedy 
greedy 
greedy 
they greedy! 
how about one laugh for every lie 
twice for the unnecessary lives. but 
since they cowards give 'em that firing squad 
get 'em outta here quickly 
quickly! violence must be met with violence 
be we be the one's settin' off 
the riot. oh no 
no 
look what we done 
done! i'm a voice of power! 
i must protect my ghetto son! 
without him there's no blacks tomorrow. we all 
so stop the violence and watch how you change the world (the 
whole wide world). it's clear 
won't get outta there. if you really want change 
take a look at the man in the mirror 
in 
your mirror. ain't got no apology for the economy. logically thinkin everybody gotta eat. blame the economists 
all of their promises. not bein' honest 
why would they lie to me? 
i'ma be clea 
what i see is fear! 
they set up the satellites 
labeled us televised! 
population in check 
people petrified! 
cnn on deck 'til they testify. invadin' these countries for natural resources. they wipe up the forests to get the oil in the industry 
although they 
claim to be loyal 
through all of the turmoil 
their families get spoiled. and i mean! heee heee! can we just go green to kill the population? 
we need a solution 
the future dependin' on it! 
you know what i mean? if you don't put the endin' on it 
armageddon gonna come real soon maybe then you want it. landlords put their tenants on it! u.s. congress put the senate on it any moment! 
i want an atonement without secret service bein' nervous political warfare. ghetto came out of nowhere. let the last be first 
it hurt 
don't go there! 
so what you gonna do 
what you gonna do? 
when the new world order come for you. so what you gonna do 
what you gonna do? 
lord what have we done?</field>

heyyy 
wooo 
ooooh 
hey yeah 
ooh now 
if i had one wish 
that wish would be clear 
that i would not have to go 
that i could stay here 
and although it hurts me 
to leave you all alone 
just know i'll come back to you 
for now i am gone 
] 
for now i am gone 
for now i am gone 
for now i am gone 
for now i am 
gone 
for now i am gone 
for now i am gone 
for now i am gone 
for now i am 
gone 
when i'm dead and gone don't even worry 
don't mourn me too long 
death'll get you discouraged 
keepin your vision blurry 
prison and mentally hurtin 
i know it for certain if i'm really restin in heaven 
no need for you to fear 
don't cry 
cause death won't forever have a grip on our lives 
so i'ma be comin 
be ready for the next shine 
cause i'm a believer that i'll see a resurrection 
don't believe that i'll burn in hell 
i study the scriptures and they learn me well 
no trippin 
no drippin 
no purgatory i dwell 
i sleep 
i rest in piece 'til i prevail 
it's just a temporary lay down 
i won't forever stay down 
so keep me in your memory 
don't let me fade out 
i'll probably never see you at the crossroads 
guess i was wrong 
i'm gone gone 
long gone 
we hit the road back in 1993 
had a vision like a prophet 
the project was go see 
the logic was so deep 
i come back and do a lotta good 
i heard the callin so i headed out to hollywood 
one-way tickets 
my niggaz and no fear 
some said that we was trippin 
the mission was so clear 
don't wanna go there 
the money was over there 
i still love ya 9-9 
i miss ya st. clair 
yeah 
now i'm movin on a roller coaster 
just ridin 
tryin to be jehovah's soldier 
and i'm grindin 
tryin to make it better for ya 
so for now i best be gone 
be gone 
i made a vow to change the world somehow 
i'ma impact it and see it in this lifetime 
on the dark road to bring back the sunshine 
but for now i'm gone - i gotta go get it 
if it's out there to get 
then i'ma go and get it 
get it 'til i got nothin left 
chasin better livin 
it's a 'tinuous mission 
so i'm steady movin 
and i gotta get it in 
never settle for losin 
i'm a thug true 
add to or get out the way 
you could settle for less 
but i need more on my plate 
eatin good 
family good 
okay 'til that day i'ma get up and move 
move 
show my babies how the thug do 
ooh 
i'ma play it like it's my last game 
if it's due better give it up right away 
cause a thug nigga's gonna bring pressure 
see me fucked up 
starvin nigga 
never 
and as long as niggaz out here gettin paid 
back to my old ways 
who they gonna run and tell 
huh? 
it's a street thang 
c'mon 
yeah we ready 
back up in 'em with nothin but the harmony rhythm 
hard hittin flows all we give 'em 
flows that spit venom 
no cop 
there goes the end of 'em 
ever since the beginnin we winnin it 
get a glimpse of legends standin on deck 
'til we come we'll be here holdin down the set 
keep on wonderin what the bone 'bout to do next 
still they humble and the hungriest 
god bless 
the fan fam flex all across the u.s. overseas and tel aviv and back west 
you know we go the hardest 
no need to say we better than the rest 
it's obvious more or less 
came down off my high from the wet 
when i had to do a stretch 
i signed so i cashed the check 
had me caught up in a game 
insane 
my head blown 
what's goin on cause ain't nobody home 
gone 
i'm gone 
i'm gone 
i'm gone 
i'm so gooooooooooooooooooooone

you can you meet me meet me in the sky 
the sky 
the sky 
the sky 
the sky! 
you could meet me in the sky 
the sky 
the sky 
the sky 
the sky. 'cause we can fly above all the haters! 
they done give me my wings! let's fly 
high 
high 
high 
high! 
i done made it up the mountain 
lookin' down on the valley 
and i'm feelin' i can fly 
so i dive off the cliff. hear the little kids scream; they don't know i got wings. 'til i sprinkle them with the dreams 
and i hit 'em with the gift. say 'bye bye' to them haters 
haters. no more lies. they can't fade us 
fade us! 
why they wanna test? now you rockin' with the best and my whole fan fam' is the greatest 
greatest. moves countin' like a calculator 
evaluate the master playas. operation: 'stack your paper.' 
captivatin' money makers feel the love from above 
he's an eagle 
he's a dove 
call him bone's emancipator! 
everybody's a congratulator. come and ride on this elevator 
better yet take this escalator. graduate to the new skyscrapers! 
when we put 'em on a level that's if you can deal with! we take it to 'em runnin' nothin' but realness! 
surely livin' in the life 
it's for the thrills. we went up and over the hill 
went through the whole drill! 
haters try to kill with kindness 
when there's nothin' they can do to to the finest. though they won't dare cross over the line 
for tryin' 
y'all know what's gonna happen 
so they might as well remain behind us. way behind! we go to hardcore grind 
and never take an issue for granted since i'm cool they go and take it for weakness. better take it in stride! 
they don't wanna see us alive 
but you always steady creepin' 
reapin' 
weepin' 
niggas went and got in way too deep in. you gotta practice that before you start preachin'. but ain't no way that they can keep up 
'cause we keepin' the heat on. it really don't matter where we can meet up! 
nigga had it bad 
cause i never had more than plenty cash 
thinking the rainy days was over! 
livin' in the past 
livin' ghetto fab' 
never lookin' back! 
but the fact is that i never went nowhere! 
the truth is 
me and my own ghetto got a love affair. it's so real 
things we did 
my conscious outta here. i don't care 
i deserve everything i earn. hell yeah i deserve some pain! i know i hurt! 
stop talkin'! night-walkin' real night stalkers 
zoners 
hungry 
heard it here first! 
if you don't believe me 
with wings i'll meet ya! 
playa hater hate! they can hate me but they better stay away or see krayzie look insane! 
so if they wanna hate me let 'em hate me from the bottom 
way up underneath my feet. 'cause really i've been turnin' them leaves to never ever let the suckas rise 
or let them bustas kill the high. 'cause they jealous in the mind 
they remind me of gravity always grabbin' at me pullin me down. passed on for the flight 
keepin' me on the ground. still i rise and when i takeoff they fall. raise to the ceiling 
try and stay away from the pretender. you don't really even get involved. we play 'em all from afar 
in a distance. and when i met him in the sky 
he had a body like a man and the lower body tellin' 
the lord that he had a plan to make him sure i wasn't evil. but i'm comin' with my people. ain't no sequel 
ain't no women 
ain't no vessals. i'm a settle with a scepter and a lethal dosage. i will live forever with a serpent on my head. little glory 
that's my man! i'll be damned! if i comin' through 
i'm runnin' with my pistol. weren't for moses 
i'm a die but i'm a come back with y'all 
that's the way to get y'all. picture sinister plots! i'm not 'nigga with no land.' 
i imagine a strand of lightning bolts and tightened ropes. i'm fightin' folk with no hope. earth got me loc'ed! 
now chillin' in the smoke house! no doubt! no clout! 
now we're goin' all out! earth-ball that's all! never let the devil call. revelations! little bizzy nigga so long! go long! metal was so precious. i was resurrected! why? juniors fly to the creat or. and my brother be 
brother be 'c'. throw it up! uncle 'l' comin' straight from the sky

i got the feeling that i'm finna go over my limit 
and never underestimate me cause i got it in me 
i know how high i can go 
i used to get it started after sundown 
forget about my problems 'til the sunrise 
and let me live the life at least one time 
i'm like how i high can flow 
i got money in the bank 
so i can still get high 
you keep thankin' what you thank 
cause i'm gon' pop this bottle 
you keep drankin' what you drank

it's medicated so it's legal 
so we can creep 
sneak out back

sack of fire

come lets flow 
we tryna stay high

they stronger than a do not sign 
fried on friday 
high on the god damn highway 
you don't wanna see me shine 
eyes on my day 
my mind my way 
slide your bitches to the side in my flyway 
i'm elevating 
for levitation 
i've been takin' over imitation in my

i'm just confirmin' ya

ask 'em! 
don't need a hand. rappin' insane with the same average 
always above! 
nigga 
never no love 
you niggas is artificial 
insufficient 
not an issue. our position is monumental 
all your shit was accidental! 
simple 
don't be no fool! 
don't be consumed in auto-tune. 'cause it's a deadly storm blowin' through here soon. originators can survive it if they stay true and innovate. imitators 
fakers 
they all die 
y'all simply can't all rap and it ain't no time to play. twenty-four hours a day 
that's seven straight! 
my killers be rallied up 
the scrilla - they tally up. like bally's - i exercise you. like dahmer - i victimize you. criticize you for using auto-tune. recognize here comes your doom. there's no room for the wack. they be givin' a black eye to the game. but there's more than a thousand ways to get 'em and leave the lames strangled. flesh banged on 'em and i never did let up. fandango you hoes! 
opponents they keep their back on the ropes 
their faces hit the floor. suckers ain't nothin' but jokes with their vocals made artificially. i'd rather buck 'em y'all exposed 
now they gotta get disposed. my temp is still burning hot 
while these phony's 
they hardly not! 
we can lock on up and then see how hard of a hit you got! 
na

why they want to sound like 
dress like

why they want to look like 
dress like

it's the critical 
criminal 
non-subliminal. set it off 
let it off 
lines is visible. i battle 
i challenge 
i rhyme my syllables. sound like bone 
that's dispicable. i'll put you in i.c.u. i see you is not original. it's pitiful 
niggas ain't lyrical. give me that deal 
give me that miracle! 
they lackin' the talent 
they lackin' the balance 
they lackin' the harmony. these niggas pretenders 
no contenders 
it ain't hard to see. no authenticity 
they won't make history. they only makin' lil lay-lay mad 
they going out like they j.j. fad. now how do these stars assume they can use the auto-tune 
just because the bass go boom i spend my dollars 
consume? 
but naw 
i bring these lames to their doom. better wake up! wake up! wake up! 
we bringin' back innovation. we havin' a celebration 
cause flesh-n-bone is home. been ten years strong 
that's domination. never need no nomination 'cause homie the streets respect it. we keepin' it epic and never neglect it we get it in on a record. i'm talkin' about keepin' it classic 
they talkin' about keepin' it plastic. they puttin' the game in a casket. we gonna live on like the jacksons. i'm sorry i'm endin' your cycle 
i gotta do this for michael. you heard from jay-z 
but nigga this layzie 
it's somethin' i'm willin' to die for 
yeah. come on! come on! come on!

ass nigga 
put that out 
shine in everybody's category. cut that out 
flat out! 
it's a damn shame 
for spare change 
what come out these fraudelent rappers' mouth. or should i say entertainers 
i'm complainin'. north 
east 
west 
and south 
cut that out. 'til 'em all pac and no slouch. if you can't sing 
then don't sing! 
the realest knew they place and they did it. we blaze auto-tune so you need to sense this. rest and silent hood living. they feel me resonate it. get bible realest. quiet me 
i'mma stay hood 
harmonied out. invisible cut the crucifix 
explodes into the galaxy! 
show you niggas how loose i get - no! no fatalities! 
zeus 
i'm comin' to juice the mix. operation: totality 
opium flow wherever i go 
auto-tune to the matrixes. shot myself in cali 
woke up without no witnesses. satan 
think she my mistresses. mohammad 
where my bitches is? 
eve's wicked as witches is 
yeah! nigga this peanuts! 
i'm t-pain 
back with my nazarinians and we nuts! 
these palestinians with 3 buck shots!

The blitzkrieg bop 
 
They're piling in the back seat 
They're generating steam heat 
Pulsating to the back beat 
The blitzkrieg bop 
 
Hey ho, let's go 
Shoot'em in the back now 
What they want, I don't know 
They're all revved up and ready to go 
 
They're forming in straight line 
They're going through a tight wind 
The kids are losing their minds 
The blitzkrieg bop 
 
They're piling in the back seat 
They're generating steam heat 
Pulsating to the back beat 
The blitzkrieg bop 
 
Hey ho, let's go 
Shoot'em in the back now

I told you why we just can't make it,

Someone had to pay the price.

I think of times we were together, 
As time went on it seemed forever, 
Times have changed now things are better, 
Someone had to pay the price. 
 
And I think of times we were together,

(Scatting by Scatman John)  
Love is not possession and it can't be possessed,  
If I should try to own you ,I'd be like all the rest.  
I've learnt from past conviction that love is not addiction,  
I've tried that many times and failed the test (Scatting).  
Baby,baby,baby,you're so good for my soul,  
Baby,baby,baby,I'm the one you can hold.  
I've simply got to tell from the bottom of my heart,  
The first time that I saw you I was sure right from the start.  
Only you,  
Only you,  
Only you,make my dream come true.  
Only you,  
Only you,  
Only you,make my dream come true.

What you are is just enough,  
Don't have to be no more (Scatting).  
I don't care 'bout the way you wear your hair (Scatting).  
I don't need to mold you,  
I only want to hold you,  
Girl,so you can breath a wholesome breath of air (Scatting).  
Mama,mama,mama come get your baby boy,  
Mama,mama,mama you're my sadness and joy.  
Your're my life (Scatting), shining bright (Scatting),

Someone's got to do the job 
Someone's got to be the clown who's creating the sound and makes the world go round 
  
I'm a topstar,rock star,shooting star,falling star,hero and a sample success 
I got gold-plated toilet tissue 
Money never is an issue 
TV people call me as their guest (Scatting) 
 
I got low hangin' trousers all the way to the top 
All the things a home boy could ever be 
My life is so upgraded 
My ego's so inflated 
That I've become an X-rated fantasy (Yeah) 
 
Someone's got to be the hero 
Someone's got to do the job

I'm the Captain of Charisma and the Sultan of the Soul 
I'm looking I can set you all free 
Just look at me,it's plain to see 
It's obvious,you must agree 
 
I'm everything you'll ever want to be 
I take my name as serious as any popstar can 
I'm a leader and an icon and a revolution man 
I'm starring in a video I'm to hot to flop 
I'm the goal of every seeker and my ratings never drop 
  
Well I'm rising to the top and you can see I'm really hot 
And you know I'm everything I portray 
I'm so hip-slickin' cool and so charismic as a rule 
That I don't take the time to finish what I say 
 
Popstar,lollipop,popsicle,hall of fame 
Look at me,I'm bigger than life 
I've got patent leather shoes and I never pay my booze 
And I don't sing the blues or take a wife 
 
Everthing you've heard me say so far is a joke 
An open mind and sense of humour is our only hope 
I want to say just one more thing before I move along 
I betcha really glad we're near the end on the song 
 
I leave you now,take a bow 
Hope you all agree 
A popstar isn't everything it's cracked up to be 
If I have to do anything it's what I want to say 
A pop is an explosion,all you've got is you today 
 
Someone's got to be the hero 
Someone's got to do the job 
Someone's got to do the business 
Someone's got to be the fool 
Someone's got to be the hero 
Someone's got to do the job 
Someone's got to be the clown who's creating the sound and makes the world go round

            <field name="lyrics">Your're sitting on a milk mornin' noon and night  
Fantisizin' the American dream 
You're lookin' pretty good and you've got yourself conviced 
That the nightmare isn't a s bad as it seems 
 
You try your best to hide yourself beneath your turned up collar 
And a plastic bag is all you've got to show 
And your books inside your shopping cart 
Is probably the best education you're ever gonna know (Hmm) 
 
The guy in the Mercedes is just hard on with the dollar 
Better grab it 'cause the signal's turnin' green 
And while you're at it put the jug behind the picket fence 
'Cause the copper's driving past you lookin' mean 
 
Institution,contribution,restitution,destitution  
Doesn't mean a thing to you now 
You're the freeway feature  
For your audience are driving by 
 
So maybe you should stand and take a bow 
Your living in desperation 
And you never have felt complete 
You live in anticipation 
 
Of another day on the street,sing with me 
(Scatting by Scatman John) 
You're sitting in the same spot 
You want to go home 
 
But there ain't no home but home on the range 
You've forgotten what you look like and it looks like you've forgotten 
That the look inside your eye is very strange 
Ain't nothing left to hide 
 
You're stripped of all your pride and all you feel inside 
Is a hole a mile wide  
You're the freedom desperado 
And the perfect living model  
 
Of a land that hasn't any good excuse 
Your living in desperation 
And you never have felt complete 
You live in anticipation 
 
Of another day on the street,sing with me 
(Scatting by Scatman John) 
Sittin' on your milkcrate, blanket wrapped around you 
I see you sitting day after day 
 
I really like to talk but I know if I approached you 
You'd probably get up and walk away 
You're wishin' that your home of the American dream  
Wasn't only smoke and exhaust  
 
I love you desperado and all I gotta say 
You let me know how much I really lost 
Your living in desperation 
And you never have felt complete 
 
You live in anticipation 
Of another day on the street,sing with me 
(Scatting by Scatman John)

I'm calling out from Scatland 
I'm calling out from Scatman's world 
If you wanna break free you better listen to me 
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy 
 
I'm calling out from Scatland 
I'm calling out from Scatman's world 
If you wanna break free you better listen to me 
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy 
 
Everybody's talkin' something very shockin' just to 
Keep on blockin' what they're feelin' inside  
But listen to me brother, you just keep on walkin' 'cause 
You and me and sister ain't got nothin' to hide 
 
Scatman, fat man, black and white and brown man 
Tell me 'bout the colour of your soul 
If part of your solution isn't ending the pollution 
Then I don't want to hear your stories told 
I want to welcome you to Scatman's world 
 
I'm calling out from Scatland 
I'm calling out from Scatman's world 
If you wanna break free you better listen to me 
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy  
 
Everyone's born to compete as he chooses 
But how can someone win if winning means that someone loses 
I sit and see and wonder what it's like to be in touch 
No wonder all my brothers and my sisters need a crutch 
 
I want to be a human being not a human doing 
I couldn't keep that pace up if I tried 
The source of my intention really isn't crime prevention 
My intention is prevention of the lie, yeah 
Welcome to the Scatman's world 
 
I'm calling out from Scatland 
I'm calling out from Scatman's world 
If you wanna break free you better listen to me 
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy 
 
I'm calling out from Scatland 
I'm calling out from Scatman's world 
If you wanna break free you better listen to me 
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy 
Listen to me 
 
I'm calling out from Scatland 
I'm calling out from Scatman's world 
If you wanna break free you better listen to me 
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy</field>

Here it is. 
Make a turn around, 
Make a U-turn now. 
 
Hey you! 
If anybody's home, I'm trying to get through 
With a story for you. 
There's a monster out there and it really 
Doesn't care what you say what you do 
If you're young or you're grey. 
Hey you! 
You can take it from me. 
I was talking that talk 'til I was 43. 
I was walking in a web that was to thick 
To shed, and it was only by degrees that I 
Was brought to my knees. 
Justification was my mode of operation, 
Looking good number one on my list. 
Trapped in a circle of a merry-go-round, 
I couldn't get up getting down. 
The things that I was doing was all I ever known, 
I didn't know that I was driven by delusion to the 
Bone. 
You want to hear the greatest story ever told? 
There ain't a greater feeling than the healing 
Of your soul. 
Baby, I'm not here to sell you but you need someone 
To tell you like it is. 
Like it is. 
Like it is. 
I don't wanna be a preacher 
But you really need a teacher, here it is. 
Here it is. 
Here it is. 
 
Hey You! 
Don't beat yourself up, be gentle with yourself 
'cause there ain't nobody else, and it isn't 
Your fault and I know it seems bleak, 
And you're only in this u-turn 'til you meet defeat. 
 
Hey You! 
You can take it from me, there's more going down 
Than you and I can ever see. 
There's a tale being told and the water's all 
Around, there's a brand new day. Get the heck out of 
Your way. 
 
I never let you tell me that I wanted to hear, 
When you said it like it was, it never got to 
My ears. 
 
My behavior underneath was completely insane. 
Kept playing those games with a saturated brain. 
I never thought I had to go as far as I did, 
I had to leave home and abandon a kid. 
You want to hear the greatest story ever told? 
There ain't a greater feeling than the healing 
Of your soul. 
 
Baby, I'm not here to sell you but you need someone 
To tell you like it is. 
Like it is. 
Like it is. 
 
I don't wanna be a preacher 
But you really need a teacher, here it is. 
Here it is. 
Here it is. 
Make a turn around, make a u-turn now. 
 
Baby, I'm not here to sell you but you need someone 
To tell you like it is. 
Make a U-turn, make about face, make a turn around, 
Make a turn around, make a u-turn now. 
I don't wanna be a preacher 
But you really need a teacher, here it is. 
Here it is. 
Here it is. 
Make a turn around, make a u-turn now. 
 
Hey You! 
 
Make a U-turn, make about face, make a turn around, 
Make a turn around, make a u-turn now. 
 
Make a turn around, make a u-turn now. 
 
Here it is. 
Here it is.

            <field name="lyrics">I've looked everywhere, and I never really found 
Somebody like you who was wholesome and sound 
Where both of us knew we could see with closed eyes 
Where neither of us had the need to tell each other lies 
 
Nothing really mattered much as long as we're together 
We can change with the seasons, no matter what the weather 
Where we could be in harmony, together every day 
Knowing when we're young and old that we could always say 
 
I'll always want you by my side 
To give you what you've been denied 
I need you to know I want you 
 
I can feel you 
I can see you 
I will let you 
Touch me 
 
I can hear you 
When you call me 
When you say you 
Love me 
 
Work days, holidays, every day's a good day 
Everything the way we know it's gotta be 
Accepting you without the need to change the way you are 
Alone, together, checking out the stars 
 
Knowing we could leave, but neither of us ever would 
Both of us together through the sad and the good 
Totally devoted as lovers and friends 
And suddenly we realize that love never ends 
 
I'll always want you by my side 
To give you what you've been denied 
I need you to know I want you 
 
I can feel you 
I can see you 
I will let you 
Touch me 
 
I can hear you 
When you call me 
When you say you 
Love me  
 
I can feel you 
I can see you 
I will let you 
Touch me 
 
I can hear you 
When you call me 
When you say you 
Love me  
 
I can feel you 
I can see you 
I will let you 
Touch me (for all my life) 
 
I can hear you 
When you call me 
When you say you 
Love me  
 
(I can feel you) I can feel you 
(I can see you) I can see you 
I will let you 
Touch me 
 
I can hear you

Incredible how you can 
See right through me 
 
Freddie Mercury 
When you hear a sound 
That you just can't place 
Feel somethin' move 
That you just can't trace 
When something sits 
On the end of your bed 
Don't turn around 
When you hear me tread 
 
I'm the invisible man 
I'm the invisible man 
Incredible how you can 
See right through me 
I'm the invisible man 
I'm the invisible man 
It's criminal how I can 
See right through you 
 
John Deacon 
And I'm in your room 
And I'm in your bed 
And I'm in your life 
And I'm in your head 
Like C.I.A. 
Or the F.B.I. 
You'll never get close 
Never take me alive 
 
I'm the invisible man 
I'm the invisible man 
Incredible how you can 
See right through me 
I'm the invisible man 
I'm the invisible man 
It's criminal how I can 
See right through you 
Hah, hah, hah, hello 
Hah, hah, hah, o.k. 
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello 
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or girl 
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl 
So I make my mark from the edge of the world 
From the edge of the world 
From the edge of the world 
 
Brian May - Brian May 
 
Now I'm on your track 
And I'm in your mind 
And I'm on your back 
But don't look behind 
I'm your meanest thought 
I'm your darkest fear 
But I'll never get caught 
You can't shake me, shake me dear 
 
I'm the invisible man 
I'm the invisible man 
Incredible how you can 
See right through me 
Watch me now 
I'm the invisible man 
I'm the invisible man 
It's criminal how I can 
See right through you 
Look at me, look at me 
R-R-R-R-Roger Taylor 
Shake me, shake me, shake me dear 
Sh-shake 
Shake 
Fun

            <field name="lyrics">Has anybody ever been to Lebanon? 
Does anybody really care to go, at all? 
Anybody want to go to Lebanon 
Where you can read the writings on the wall? 
 
Do the caravans still ride across the sand 
Or is the season causing everything sacred to fall? 
Do the sages sing their chant throughout the land 
Or has their song been silenced over the centuries, to all? 
 
Does the sun still kiss the earth in Lebanon? 
Does the moonlight still reflect the sand at night? 
Can a prophet still come out of Lebanon 
Or has the thirst for profit changed the times? 
 
Do Phoenecian spirits dance across the sand? 
Do the cedar trees still standing next to the ocean still grow? 
Do the sages sing their chant throughout the land 
Or has their song been silenced? 
 
Does the temple still exist in Lebanon 
Or have the winds of time been blowing hard, for all? 
Does the mosque still sing the hymn of Lebanon 
Reciting old inscriptions from the wall? 
 
Do the caravans now crawl across the sand 
And is the season causing everyone sacred to cry? 
Can the people of the land still hear the call 
Or has the song been silenced over the centuries, to all?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Imagine a land of love 
Where people have time to care 
Where everybody's equal 
And we all tell the truth 
 
If you're wondering where this magical place is 
You don't have to look too far 
You'll find it between your deepest dreams and warmest wishes 
 
The society of Scatland is composed of 
Very loving caring people who have 
Never even heard of political corruption 
Class distinction, war and all the 
Other stuff that goes on in the world of earth people. 
Everyone is equal in Scatland. 
Everyone is equal. Everyone is equal. 
 
We've got to believe in love, That's all there ever will be 
That's all there's ever been, For you and me. 
 
I wonder if you're wondering where Scatland is? 
It isn't far away. I'll take you there now. 
Just close your eyes, make a wish, give yourself a hug. 
You're half-way there, just love yourself, love yourself 
And a dream will come true. You'll find yourslf in Scatland 
And suddenly discover that the person from Scatland is you. 
 
The people of Scatland speak in Scatish 
Scatish is a language not quite like a leprechaun 
It sounds like a language of the people of earth 
Who speak in a tongue of their own. 
You're all from Scatland. Hatred and resentment? 
Well that's unheard of,  
It's unheard of. 
 
We've got to believe in love 
We've got to believe in love 
 
This is a brand new day know what I say, 
Love is understanding. 
Believe me believe me believe me. 
 
We've got to believe in love 
(Scatting by Scatman John) 
 
I want to thank you all for joining 
In celebration of the world of 
Scatland, goodnight</field>

Oxy like concerts, always my bread first 
GetMine my nickname, O-X and cocaine 
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame 
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul 
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting 
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-by's at bedtime 
Get down, I earn mine, so one loss they can't sign 
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed 
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils 
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan 
'Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay 
 
So now we 'bout to break the bank, money be on my mind 
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like la-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do

My time to show out, finally the illest Crip 
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete 
Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef 
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence 
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide 
After dark, where the bangers get caught 
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court 
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real 
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that 
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack 
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap 
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks 
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch I had them things wrapped 
Astro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app 
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill 
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel 
Good grades and skipped school, this life gon' catch up soon 
Sure 'nough that shit did, 20 year old kid 
Got off my behind, write me some sweet lines 
'Cause one day my story gon' pay

Tell Kendrick move from the throne, I came for it 
I hope this fucking hit arrange for it, cause Goddamn 
 
What you talkin' 'bout if it ain't 'bout the money? 
Neck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey 
Rain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money 
On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy 
 
Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills 
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal 
Love how I'm doing, long way from grooving 
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving 
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy 
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space 
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day 
I let y'all fucks parlay, you wonder why I'm straight 
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row 
Bow down her tempo, I don't know her info 
Threw up my peace sign, go rare with mignon

You stay on wet, you a stormy shower 
Mind fuck you girl, undress you we can fuck for hours 
Day and night, no rubbers we love this, no covers 
Freak you with my tongue, you also go down where I'm hung 
Open up, a chapter begun, we can build like a factory hun

Solar eclipse as soon as I cum, soon as we cum 
? 
We cruise, you done won my heart over, how can we lose 
From a fantasy to real life, you I choose 
Came a long way from fuckin' friends we was due 
Just me and you, ooh, just me and you 
Never scared of commitment, see you my boo 
We can get ghost, get lost, and the bond is true 
Flying through the city, clouds, ? 
Saying vows, fuck around and have a child

Break me down and build me up again 
Love me 'til the sun comes up and then 
We can fuck and fuck and fuck again

Deepthroat, seven or eleven, she's a double gulp 
My pistol drawn, her boyfriend got me paranoid

Little boy now, dream little boy, dream 
Coke go in the pot, arm and hammer body 
A$AP.Rocky, the one that I could get it 
Onion in the pocket like a booty on a midget 
Diamond on my rollie, teach a nigga how to fridge it 
Looking at the time, been winning for a minute 
See my neck co-defendant, what's the problem? 
Seen the souls long gone before I got them 
He was there before I shot him, it's the reaper

Blue on campus know it happened 
Tell me more about it in the gutter 
Where it started with the cripping 
Then the bloods done got it brackin' (Suwoo) 
 
I'm just an Eastside nigga 
Where them niggas say ''show you what it be like, nigga'' 
Roll 'em up, light 'em up like a street light, nigga 
Follow me, I can show you what these streets like, nigga 
Handle bars, ever swing, guns blow like dusty wings 
Spend a band, push his wig back whenever revolvers spin 
Toe tag 'em, floss flagging like it's all good 
Tell niggas tee off like Tiger Woods

Lord please forgive me for all my sins 
Yeah, nigga wake up to the same shit everyday, homie 
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
No rules, right 
 
Washing my sins off in hell's water 
Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em 
Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me? 
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
 
Uh, four corners, cat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch 
High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet 
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more 
Trapping trying to make it out this obstacle 
Life on the edge, hell a block away 
Pretty Snow White turned eight today 
Selling that base, no Dr. Dre 
Uh, guess who in the building? 
Bucket hat with a strap like the pilgrim uh 
Kneeling down with some questions to address like 
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best? 
The 10 commandments, I can mark five checks 
But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats 
Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex 
Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet 
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests from the cop raid 
All can relate, from the streets to the wall from niggas to compadres 
When the sun go down, I'm predictin' a heatwave, forecast your whole body 
Heat on, room full of homi's, I just pray that the Lord got me 
 
Uh but if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
Mic check, mic check, mic check, (La la, la la, la low, la la, la la low) 
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
 
Aim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance 
Kill mine, kill yours, make it even 
Soul need saving, Mr. Preacher 
I know I only come around when it's Easter 
Funerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time 
When I'm in jail or when my card declined 
Uh, will you answer me? 
Take me out of Hell and make plans for me? 
Misery loves company, ain't a surprise 
It was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive 
But we would never make it out alive 
Shit we living to die, oxymoron 
Hope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive 
Running through the ally, hope the bullet don't collide 
Car window shattered, glass on my right side 
Dogs bark in the backyard, rootin' for me 
Out of shape belly, courtesy of 40 
Spoiled only child, baby boy Jody 
Same jacket on from back in the day 
Praying that the Lord come and take me away 
 
Uh but if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
Mic check, mic check, mic check, (La la, la la, la low, la la, la la low) 
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
 
Ey yo tuna fish sandwiches bread, dry snaking 
Black Lincoln, burgundy Mac, I clap a king-pin 
Caught me in the airport gust that I was thinkin' 
On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances 
Yeah, money is the issue, I diss you 
It's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol 
'Cause I'm a suit case king 
Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin 
No wage bet, we stay winning, play it again, yo 
Put the bone in your jaw, now say it again 
Round knife, fork, under the tents, coming to rents 
Get out the way or let the shotty dispense 
Revenge killers who make the events iller 
This is more realer, snatch you right up out of the Benz 
The Wu wheelers who huddle up, coupes knows the truth 
You know the woopty-woop, solo or group I kill niggas</field>

Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 
Check the forecast, it's Wavy Q, I should make the news 
My fortune said that I'll be pimping you and your pussy juice 
Super sweet, sell a trick a treat, hope your lips in shape 
Cause you worked your feet as you stroll them streets, beeper checking 
Hope no cops arresting, girl, I told you them narcs be pressing 
Better act you a pedestrian and don't mention my name 
My pimping is game, cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain 
Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling 
On 51st and Figg, grew up about ten minutes from the real Ricky 
Where the shoelaces is orange with H hats like we from Houston 
Condoms in hoes' purses with baby wipes for they coochie 
You's a ho that's selling booty, no need to be acting bougie 
Bitch, I give your ass a noogie and a chicken nugget 
And make you watch me at the movies, I'm panoramic 
My filming be rated pimping, my mink dragging 
With two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it 
 
Will you sell that pussy for me? 
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
Will you sell that pussy for me? 
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 
Hut one, hut two 
Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me) 
Will you sell that pussy for me? 
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 
Hut one, hut two 
Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me) 
Will you sell that pussy for me? 
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 
Uh-huh, yeah, watch me go Black Forest ham 
A new school player laced with the old gift gab 
And don't let your Shark Week mouth override your Green Goldfish ass 
So for every ho you clown, I'mma crown two 
And anything good hurts and I cried 
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my mothafuckin' face 
Or I choose to not do this around you 
See ho you like a brain aneurysm 
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em 
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs 
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom 
Yeah, P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play 
And the hard head that make a soft ass played out 
Will forgive and forget yesterday 
Now get 'em, Q, a pimp on foot, go to sleep, call us, wake up to a Cadillac 
Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid 
So you know what? Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world 
P, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing 
But Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho 
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too 
Cause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane 
Pimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid 
Red to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier 
To put a watermelon through the eye of a needle 
This is done by choice, not by force 
I ain't asking, I'm telling you 
 
Will you sell that pussy for me? 
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
Will you sell that pussy for me? 
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 
Hut one, hut two 
Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me) 
Will you sell that pussy for me? 
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 
Hut one, hut two

Can I show you this world, baby? 
Ain't no rules to this life, darling 
 
You know Q gon' drop that funky shit 
You know Q gon' spit that real 
How you not like me? How you not love me? 
How you hide your feelings? 
You been hooked from the jump 
It's the first of the month 
We be good for the week 
Won't last for the day, just right for the night 
So right for your life 
Let the truth be told, let it crush your goals 
But I can heal your soul like: 
I could make you feel good through your skin, baby 
I'm the blood in your heart when it pump, baby 
I'ma be down with you 'til we turn eighty, and I know 
Your family got so much to say, baby 
I'm the thing that make pain go away, baby 
When I'm warm and you sick to your tongue, baby, and I know 
 
I know, I know, I know, I know

Ain't no rules to this night, darling (No rules to this night, but you) 
Can I show you this world, baby? 
Ain't no rules to this night, darling (I know, I know, I know) 
Things kinda blurry 
As I focus my frame to truly adore you babe (Truly adore me, that you adore me I know)

            <field name="lyrics">I got that work, fuck Labor Day, just bought a gun 
Fuck punching in, throwing rocks, no hopscotch 
Bet my 9 milli hit the right spot 
Bang, last night it was a dream 
This morning a fantasy 
Back when the only fan I had was a fiend 
Meet me by the Acura cause the cops like 
To get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea 
But it's cool I've been catching on to they formula 
See I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo' 
Then rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo 
The bad guy never once been a hoes hero 
He get zero, I said nada 
Bitch pass the cama (Uh, yeah) 
How'd it feel to be a real nigga? (I'm a product of a real nigga) 
La-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga) 
Fuck with one of my real niggas 
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball) 
How'd it feel to be a real nigga? 
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball) 
How'd it feel to be a real nigga (My whole life I've been a real nigga) 
La-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga) 
Fuck with one of my real niggas 
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball) 
How'd it feel to be a real nigga? 
 
I done jumped off my ass 
Hit the lick and barely pass but I quickly got to balling 
2012 ain't really happen 
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning 
Had roaches in my cereal 
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him 
 
But, every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga 
But, click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga) 
But, meet Glock clock familia (Boom) 
 
Find a nigga realer than me, my socks stink 
Eat so much pussy that my mustache pink 
Strapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt 
Gangsta lean help, hoodie on backwards with the eyes cut out 
My hate felt, my .45 elder, poetry's deep 
I never fail ya, Schoolboy bust flame 
Orange-yellow, higher than Margiela's 
Since a young nigga I admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal 
From his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout 
Think about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday he still get a hit 
Whether jacking radio's or sucking dick 
Sell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips 
'Cause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much 
To get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work 
Unless we rewind and answer my church 
Times getting harder than my dick on a growth spurt 
Around the same time all you niggas was on purp 
My sober ass was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck freeze 
Give me the keys, extra Frito's, chili and cheese 
Thew some Baby Lucas in his eyes before I leave 
The cops'll never get the leak, grandma taught me well 
And my uncle gun was the accessories, 211 sipping plus a robbery 
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome 
 
I done jumped off my ass 
Hit the lick and barely pass but I quickly got to balling 
2012 ain't really happen 
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning 
Had roaches in my cereal

But, every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga 
But, click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga) 
But, meet Glock clock familia (Boom) 
 
Grandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more 
She always got me things that we couldn't afford 
The new J's and Tommy Hill in my drawers 
Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war 
We wasn't thinking of getting money then 
Nor did I wonder why my uncle done sold his Benz 
'Cause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down 
I also notice moms be locking doors when he around 
But anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us 
My bike is missing, grandma light a hotter chick every month 
My uncle's nuts, he used to give me Whisky to piss in cups 
Knocking on the door telling me to hurry up, he in a rush 
I gave it to him then got my ass whipped for doing it 
Moms used to tell me like "Nigga, know who you dealing with" 
Them was the good days 'til I was raised the older ways 
Rat-Tone my niggas' brother showed me my first K 
I was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back, he called us over like "Hey" 
Yak, yak, yak, yak! We like "Damn, nigga" 
Then again, yak, yak! We like "Damn, nigga" 
Hearing him say 'cause turned us to a fan, nigga 
Later on he got locked so know we're taking his fades 
Continue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page 
Gangbanging was a ritual and grandma would help 
She should've never left her gun on the shelf 
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome 
 
I done jumped off my ass 
Hit the lick and barely pass but I quickly got to balling 
2012 ain't really happen 
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning

I hear you call my name 
And it feels like home 
 
When you call my name it's like a little prayer 
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there 
In the midnight hour I can feel your power 
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there 
 
I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing 
I have no choice, I hear your voice 
Feels like flying 
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling 
Out of the sky, I close my eyes 
Heaven help me 
 
When you call my name it's like a little prayer 
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there 
In the midnight hour I can feel your power 
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there 
 
Like a child you whisper softly to me 
You're in control just like a child 
Now I'm dancing 
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning 
You're here with me, it's like a dream 
Let the choir sing 
 
When you call my name it's like a little prayer 
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there 
In the midnight hour I can feel your power 
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there 
 
When you call my name it's like a little prayer 
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there 
In the midnight hour I can feel a power 
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there 
 
Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone 
I hear you call my name 
And it feels like home 
 
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there 
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery 
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem 
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there 
 
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there 
It's like a dream to me 
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there 
It's like a dream to me 
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there 
It's like a dream to me 
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there 
It's like a dream to me 
 
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there 
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery 
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem 
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there 
 
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there 
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery 
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem 
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door 
Sirens gettin' loud when the bodies hit the floor 
Why you look confused motherfucker? This is war 
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga 
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga, uh

As this G shit begin, put this product placement on your chin 
The realest nigga breathing, y'all pretend 
Real crippy since I hopped off the swing 
With my strap, that's my peace offering (Yo, yo, yo, yeah uh yeah ooh) 
Five shots get rung out, five bodies falling 
Come put your lights out, I spark your apartment 
Deadline my clothing, don't fuck with Pink Dolphin 
Strap on his hairline, his forehead gets softened 
Send extras through his chest bones, shit, he don't need that coffin 
Most niggas would've run away, but me I'm out here walking 
Bucket hat with my shades on, my wardrobe look awesome 
Now nah, I ain't no dolphin, fuck rhyming, I'm cripping 
Niggas rap about what I'm living, all this false claiming, I'm marring 
Doing drive-by's I ain't steering, white Peter Rose, I ain't tearin' 
Fuck your bitch, in front of your chil'ren 
See your whip side of my building, yeah 
Put my dick and nuts in her mouth, bust in her hair 
I'm very rare, got my trigger on top of my underwear 
Bitch, I'm everywhere and over there 
You die here, let of a pair (Yak yak!)

Cocaine my hero, you ain't you ain't Figg Side gettin' Deebo'd 
Always asking for the burner like, young niggas still free load 
Heart big as my ego, don't fly 'round my signal 
I'll rearrange your dino, crippy my house shoes 
Blue rag disciples, murder, I'm liable, you get the Eiffel 
Aim out the eyeball, I'm getting violent, I got the stripe once 
Won't get the stripe twice, you niggas half price 
Which means you half off, I'm going Adolf 
I'm smoking bath salt through sherm sticks, burn this, ooh 
Knock knock through the condo's, Schoolboy from the fa' do's 
But who was spanked to you unranked, you can fuck around and get that chin bank'd 
Grew lining, Crip walk the whole mile 
Do belts, still my pants down, Chuck Taylors, Cortez's, Hush Puppies 
My glock ya fuck buddy, make money, take money 
Earn crack money, drug money, bail money 
Heard they got life for me, but how they got life for me? 
When they took that from me, since I had my nose runny 
I was out past sunny, had the strap by my tummy 
You can go and ask mommy, grab a body bag, haumie, yeah

Still rollin' in the six dont fuck with the Bugatti 
Come up in this motherfucker looking for a bitch 
Probably sucked on my dick then you kissed her on the lips 
The intrical, South Central Sentinel 
Get roped and choked, poetical tentacles stretch (Haha) 
Get roped and choked and rope-a-dope'd 
Extra overdose of the okie doke 
Get a nigga smoked, I ain't no joke 
Tired of this bullshit and everything y'all talk about, they walked 'em in 
I walked 'em out, they talked 'em in, I chalked 'em out 
And I cock back that ox and pow, pow, pow, pow 
Walk inside, pussy popping, top is popping off 
Papadopulos neighborhood, roll with 60 bars 
Ghettotropolis, squeezing pussy like octopuses 
Show me where the money at, show me where the kush is 
Next time you see me I'll probably be in the bushes 
This is the reasons why I won't be fucking with pussies like you 
Me, Tyler and Schoolboy Q, we tote 'em

See I've been in the studio just trying to get to you baby 
All night laying verses though I'd rather lay with you baby 
Bra and panties matching, nail and toes, you walk kinda lady 
Angel out of Heaven, such a goddess have a nigga prayin' 
 
I'm just sitting in the studio just trying to get to you baby

You need a real nigga shorty so come in 
Throw that pussy shorty, see I think you and me can make it 
This little verse to get you naked 
See your heart ain't meant for breaking 
Cupid's never been mistaken 
See, I been caught up in the moment 
Shit, my type ain't quite her type 
But now this gangsta nigga on it 
She can twist my weed and hit the 'yac 
I can hit your type without the hat 
I put that pussy on the map 
I see qualities in a bad girl, I know that ass you got 
Come with attitude and your swag girl, you ain't wrong girl 
Just when that door knock lose your thong girl 
'Cause you girl, 'cause you girl, girl ('Cause you girl, girl)

Can I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playin'? 
Put my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation 
Na-na-na-na la-nla-la-la, you get what I'm sayin' 
No methaphors, nothing like that 
I'm keeping it straight to the point with you

Drop your pants to your knees, girl I'm capital G 
 
Might pull up in my bucket 
This nine holds a good dozen 
Might slide up in your cousin 
Just made a mill and still thuggin' 
Niggas banged on me, but they should of shot me 
See, I hit the corner then spot him, got him 
Court date, but I skipped the bail 
Rather wig myself before I sit in jail 
Need a gang of weed and a pint of lean 
Got a hat say Figg on my gangsta tip 
Don't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch 
I'm apocalypse to your politics 
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost 
I can pay your bills with this coke 
Need an extra band for this smoke 
I can see for miles with this scope nigga 
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer 
Misses Piggy want her Biggie back 
Rock cremation then called it crack 
I'mma keep on eating till my ankles fat 
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map 
Push my penis in between her lap 
Put my semen all down her throat 
'Till Tito kilos come off that boat

Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow 
Speeding through the yellow lights 
She want Versace belt like it's a mistletoe 
I put everything gold for yellow rice, graduated from hella ice 
If I stand on my bank roll (Stand on your bank roll) 
Nigga, I'd be scared of heights 
And I'd be dodging the po'lice 
When I was poor with no lights, when I was poor with potential 
Watch my flow in four inches, oh lord she in Christians 
All gold but my vintage, pull it out and she kiss it 
All gold on my wrists's, God can judge no convincing 
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted 
Moving my whip down the boulevard 
Word round town I was selling hard 
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo 
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low 
I may say "que pasa" with the pesos 
Promethazine, codeine, caseloads (Tru!) 
And when I pull up to the valet 
You know I got the strippers on payroll, uh! 
 
This the shit that they want

Tell me where are you from?

She gon' pop in them heels, she must heard of my deal 
She gon' roll on them pills, just don't grab on my hat 
This that shit that's Iraq, this that make you climax 
This that shit you just bought, this that Q go damn hard 
This that car that won't park, pedal to the floor, it won't stop 
And just when you thought it won't drop, Oxymoron in stores 
Come in kids, lock the door, knock-knock-knock, hit the floor 
Need my bread off the top, could buy anything off the lot 
This that steel, not the grill, get them slugs off for real 
This that crow with the jail, we go in, smoke the L's 
She love my mic, rock the bell, leave that punani killed 
All them hoes want the Q, spit that truth, make the loot 
Expensive whips we hotbox, spent 2 bills on my socks 
This that make you cockblock, this that make me pop shot 
This that filthy convo, this that must be Figueroa 
 
This the shit that they want

I'm gangsta, Crip, my poppa was a bitch 
Left me where hopeless don't exist 
And every neighbor got a fence 
With bars and windows, my mom's slavin' for the rent 
Throwin' dices, GT dyno pool 
Where you hang, we shootin' 
You slip, we stiffin' 
Creative Crippin', uh 
Bitches stoppin' traffic 
This the type of shit that make the MAC a classic 
Reason I'm a pussy magnet 
She learned to carry package 
Been the best at rappin', uh 
Am I this Vegas? 
Your favorite rapper broke, he don't get this paper 
But claim he got a kilo, been born in '93 though 
He tryna fool the people 
Man

The loc is on you, mothafucka 
I warned you, it's karma 
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma 
 
Ain't nothin' changed but the change 
Let's put our brains away from gangs 
Crips and Bloods the old and new slaves 
Shit we even changed our names 
Trying something, new shame while we bang 
But yo, y'all ain't hearin' me 
My homie facin' life, told me that my pride my biggest enemy 
But you keep your eyes in that dark 
Your mind, it greys your heart 
I wrote these rhymes days apart 
Most of us caught before we can expand our thoughts 
How your grandmother see your corpse? 
How your big homie make your life a book? 
Left you for dead cause he ain't need you, right 
But I'm gon' fade him, right 
Let's put the rags down and raise our kids 
Let's put the guns down and blaze a spliff 
Let's do it now, ain't no buts or ifs 
It took a Blood to get me Pringle chips 
You can learn to fly or take the ladder 
Real nigga shit, all lives matter, both sides

I'm down to flatline a nigga, never been soft 
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all 
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all 
I was thirteen with my mothafuckin' heat, y'all 
Nigga caught cases tryna take your fuckin' screen off 
I could put your fuckin' life on the recall, uh, yeah 
Lookin' for the bitches with the ass 
Got an ice chain 'cause a nigga gettin' cash 
Three different pagers blowin' up because I'm crackin' 
Tryna turn a dollar to a million, ho, what's happenin'? 
O-orange laces, for my shoestrings 
Pistol on me, dunk this in her g-string 
Ridin' in my mothafuckin' Coupe-Ville 
Hoover with my mothafuckin' locs, steel 
Fig side niggas keep a dope fiend 
Ghetto bird, hit a kil', I ghetto hoop dreams 
Tryna strike me out before I finish school 
I was just a square nigga 'til I took my 52, oh, yeah, ayy 
 
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all 
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all 
We love, we go 
We rise, we go 
Our pride, we show 
We love, we go 
 
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all 
Tryna get this mothafuckin' weed off 
Gang injunctions tell me where we can't go 
Shoot me in my back because my afro 
Heard I got a stripe on my record then it's true 
Cops effin' at my record, never told 'em what I knew 
I was in my nigga car garage, yeah, I'm tryna shoot 
I was out here sellin' dope at 14, what it do? 
I was out here fuckin' hoes at 14, what it do? 
I was ditchin' class, fifth grade, yeah, I'm Groovy Q 
Ain't no biggy when the small nigga rob, gimme loot 
Pop a nigga on his mom's porch, kill his brother too 
Nigga lost his first fade nine years after school 
Nigga tryna get the Js, blue Chucks sick as flu 
Runnin' from the crash unit like my name was State Farm 
On my nigga's handlebars tryna get our groove on, yeah

Never, ever ever get caught tellin' on my niggas 
I'm a gangbanger, deadbeat father and drug dealer 
When the money and fame gone, tell me who stayin' with you 
Runnin' from God's creation 
Shakin' these broken hands and meetin' with blank faces 
Snake eyes keepin' my back achin' 
Dirty habits of rappin' and bein' savage 
Still hangin' with niggas that can't do nothin' but cause damage 
Guess I'm bein' a real nigga like I'm 'posed to be 
But bein' real never once bought the groceries and 
Top told me keep rappin', you'll make it hopefully 
And hope was all that I needed, dreamin' myself to work 
This workin' affair was better than bullet holes in my shirt 
The demons hate when you make it and stay alive 
They'd rather see me down under than see me fly 
Lord have mercy! 
 
Lord have mercy 
Please Heaven's mercy 
Lord have mercy 
Please Heaven's mercy 
 
They say I was a wanted man, a wanted man 
Runnin' with my gun in hand, gun in hand 
They don't wanna see the wanted man, the wanted man 
Comin' through with the gun in hand, the gun in hand 
Damn

The block stay hot 
World keep spinnin' 
 
Thank God for the game 
My TV screen off the chain 
My bitch, she off the chain 
I came from the grain 
The sidewalk chalk 
The block stay hot 
Paranoid, the cop that keep my gear in park 
Pull me out the car to give me black thought 
But fuck it, this shit's all kinda player 
This shit my mama flavor 
This that raised by your granny, pistols and Now and Laters 
Your pops was way too busy, missin' your mom's labor 
Grew up just like your daddy 
To baggin' baggies in alleys 
To where the streets is your family 
Gettin' blurred by the same cop 
Go to jail for a year and come home 
Two of your niggas dropped 
You know how that feelin' feel 
What to feel when it's gettin' real 
More bullets to go around 
Come jump in this water, nigga 
You still with your mama livin' 
30 with no ambition 
Your kid got no pot to piss in 
You sayin' some nigga fake 
You're selfish and sad, nigga 
You're lame 
And go 
You hatin' on another man's success 
Because the nigga blessed and wouldn't let you finesse 
You got the game all twisted 
You're leechin' worse than these ladies 
Your inner nigga ain't aging 
Reason the hood stay shady 
 
Who you do when you want? 
Boy think you got this 
No one here, on your own 
Stuck in the same spot 
What do you do? What do you do? 
Hoes ain't callin' like you want 
Only ones you got passed 
No one here, on your own 
Stuck in the same spot 
What do you do? What do you do? 
 
Hoes ain't callin' 
The cocaine rock 
World keep spinnin' 
The block stay hot 
 
Really with it forreal 
We fuckin' hoes forreal 
Gettin' paper forreal, nigga 
I play for the bills, nigga 
I really sold pills 
Smokin' weed for my ills 
Breakin' weed in my whip 
Just got an ounce on a bitch 
Still our motive be commas 
And still my life isn't promised 
Still nervous as drivers 
You see them lights get behind us 
They pull me out for my priors 
Won't let me freeze 'fore they fire 
You say that footage a liar 
They want my flow in the dryer 
I'm at the top aimin' higher 
My lawyers stay on retainer 
When white folks point the finger 
Place my neck on that hanger 
Shit, no wonder we riot 
Niggas still killin' niggas 
Child support killin' niggas 
Cops enslavin' us niggas 
Little girls killin' mothers 
They treat their kid like a brotha 
Fathers stuck with them lifers 
Kept it real with his niggas 
But left his kid for the sucks 
Shit no wonder we bang 
Damn shame, mane, some things will never change 
 
Who you do when you want? 
Boy think you got this 
No one here, on your own 
Stuck in the same spot 
What do you do? What do you do? 
Hoes ain't callin' like you want 
Only ones you got passed 
No one here, on your own 
Stuck in the same spot

'Cause if I got 'em I'mma kill 'em, I ain't playin' with 'em 
I'm from the bottom, that's the top of the town 
We on the boulder so they clip us up for knockin' 'em down 
My burner tucked, I learned from Chuck so I ain't turnin' it down 
Get to bussin', know you bluffed it, nigga 
If that bitch can't make me rich then ain't no need in fuckin' with her 
Turn around and fuck her sister 
Heard that bitch, got EBT 
Long Beach ain't seen shit like me 
Since Tracy D and DPG I went and got a burner 
On the day they murdered Baby D 
I'm in that Benz with Lil Boy 
So lil boy don't play with me 
 
I'm ridin' cycs through Hoover Street, my knuckles full of teeth 
Try to creep on me, you're dyin' in your homie's seat 
Keepin' my gun in reach 
Filet the beef, clip reach from Fig side to Norfolk Beach 
In a stolen Expedition, in your hood 'cause you the mission 
Been a mathematician, load nine, subtracted eight 
I'm keepin' one for just in case, don't cover face but I ain't trippin'

Ghetto nigga out the sunroof, hey, four keys bitch please 
Straight ballin' like a bitch 
Flossin' in the mind, stuntin' like the first, shufflin' the work 
Uh, I done came from the dirt 
Now the engine make the tire go skrrt 
Used to sleep with roaches cracky uncle and all 
Now a hundred thousand just a hour involved 
So easy how I make a mill' flip 
Snoop ain't the only rich Crip nigga 
From sleepin' on Tops couch to multiple bank accounts 
To havin' me a mall for a house 
Like, they tried to slim my chances as kid though 
They always said I'd never make it big though

Straight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky

Put that rental on the interstate

Momma bought me something for the bitch 
Bruh I go through some things you gotta witness 
Stomach get to mumblin' at night 
Watchin' every car that drive by, lookin' every driver in the eye 
52nd enterprise, marchin' in these chucks like they boots 
Money make a pussy get the juice 
Money make the copper give a pass 
Money make me cop a bigger roof 
Money got me skippin' every class 
Tryna kill 'em for the summer 
The teachers ain't teachin' the judge taught us numbers 
We was raised by single mothers 
Pop won't tuck us under covers 
Through the streets we learned colors 
Hiding from the reaper tryna' dodge the cage 
This shit I've done to rhyme on this stage 
I went from king of the the corner 
To breaking down weed on my diploma 
Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 
Picture me rollin' 
Straight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky 
Straight ballin' like a bitch 
Picture me rollin' 
I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high 
Yeah, so high

            <field name="lyrics">Oh, we might die for this shit, nigga 
Uh, might go down for this shit, nigga 
Gang, gang bangin' that crip shit 
 
Niggas said cuz in the first grade 
In the shade where the cops can't see us 
Eighteen, tryna dodge the cage 
It was cool 'til that gang sweep 
Now I'm in back of a van 
And my wrists got a band 
Got a number for a name 
No name on the visa, no card get accepted 
Now I'm forced to a man 
Murder raps, where you from? 
Put the nigga on his pockets 
Watch the cos, they be watchin' 
County news for the hustle 
County spread for the muscle 
Couple marks on my knuckles 
Puttin' niggas on bunk status 
Shoulda been with the bitch ass 
Now he on a mattress that we bench press 
Pc, get the fruit loops 
Keep tellin' on niggas 
Why I fuck with that nigga? 
Nigga made bail but I'm still at rage 
Should I thank god for the hell I raised? 
Cause the nigga that snitch is gonna feel that grave 
Like, ain't nothin' to a locc, huh? 
Went missin' to his folks, I ain't in, I ain't know, huh? 
They ain't show up to the court, huh? 
But then charges gotta go, huh? 
A young nigga back on fig 
H-crown on wig 
Shoe strings say where I'm from 
On probation and got my gun 
Other side goin' for that thumb 
Motherfucker, I'm gangbanging 
 
Nigga I'm blue'd up, blue chucks 
Blue tee, nigga I keep it g 
Nigga, in the streets is where I be 
I'm up like breakfast while niggas sleep 
Me and floyd posted on fig 
Getting it in and movin' it out 
Getting it in and movin' it out 
I'm holdin' the heat, he's watchin' the block 
I'm watchin' for cops, I'm holdin' these rocks 
Fiends keep comin', this shit don't stop 
When it's war time, niggas get popped 
We might die for this shit off tops 
My nigga gonna ride for this crip, no lie 
But I ain't dead, yeah, nigga, thank god 
Money got niggas lookin' at me all odd 
Punk ass niggas better go get a job 
Run up on me wrong, bitch, nigga get popped 
I'm gon' ride for this shit, on crip 
A nigga gon' die for this shit then trip 
4/5th extendo, with fifty in the clip 
Tf by my side, he stupid with this shit 
Q in the ride grippin' on the fifth 
Run up on me wrong 
My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, I'm gang banging 
 
Uh, might go down for this check, nigga 
Uh, I might die for this set, nigga 
I ain't trippin nigga, I ain't slippin' 
Niggas lyin' sayin' I ain't crippin' 
Back to back, me and tiny smack 
I said back to back, straight cups of 'gnac 
Niggas ask, what he signed for? 
I got an eight ball, I got a rondo 
I got an ak when that bitch spray 
It's like pullin' strings on a lawnmower 
Last time I seen jail, nigga 
I was cell livin', getting mail in it 
I ain't even talkin' mail, nigga 
Pay-pals for the cell, nigga 
Hit the streets and cause hell, huh? 
School of hard knocks, fuck yale, huh? 
See me and traffic like a orca nigga 
And the black and whites love whale watch 
Front line like mailboxes 
5-12, that's the numbers on it 
May first, may deuce, may twelfth, members only 
.45, no numbers on it 
Scratched down, I'm strapped down 
Might go down for this shit 
If I don't then I'm racked down 
Rank up there with shaq crown 
I got a benji button like brad pitt 
I press that, I'm gettin' rich 
I might go down for this shit 
 
We might die for this shit nigga 
Might go down for this shit nigga 
Gang, gang bangin' that crip shit 
We might die for this shit nigga 
Might go down for this shit nigga 
Gang, gang bangin' that crip shit 
We might die for this shit nigga 
Might go down for this shit nigga

I'll trade the noise for a piece of divine 
Uh! 
 
This that "Fuck the blogs" 
The afterbell, we hang in halls 
Underage, smokin' weed and alcohol 
Grandma sweeped shells out the driveway 
One of the homies got slayed so we bang at the King parade 
I can take you spots where gangsters walk 
Where real damus and locs, Boyz N the Hood wasn't even close 
Where the girls' kitten show, hit the dope and the pussy soaked 
Now she get you for your change, Captain Save-A-Hoe, mane 
I ain't been right since out the cervix 
I know a M can make it perfect 
It came through more than the one I worship 
You I never lie, the truth be told, the dope, it gettin' sold 
He got the runny nose 
Summertime, we don't trust niggas in winter clothes 
I swear the hood low, as the burner get rolls I follow the city codes 
My money short 
Missin' them days of honey oats 
Dollar bills in mama's coat 
Cartoons and bubble soap 
This be the realest shit I wrote 
This be that ride that hunnid spoke 
Red and blue from head to toe 
 
Who needs a mothafuckin' friend? 
You see them mothafuckin' rims 
Met the devil in disguise 
Look through my mothafuckin' eyes 
 
Look at my eyes, look at my block 
Look at my shit, cold 
All of these lies, true to my life 
Word to my pen so 
Take what you want, get what you like 
Open that window 
Ain't that shit raw 
Ain't it? That shit raw 
Look through my mothafuckin' eyes 
Vision impaired by the high 
No cares on my mind 
Couple dares, that is fine 
 
This shit from 'round the back house 
More baggies bagged and that roach 
In granny's plastic suede couch 
Best play cat and that mouse 
A minor pitchin' in major 
Stay servin' dope but we cater 
Take you back to my Sega 
Slammin' bones on that table 
Runnin' errands for grams, the paramedics at Tam's 
Forced to grow to a man 
Before L.A. had them Rams 
Went to school for the bitches, where scorin' drugs was the goal 
Lungs black as a crow, got banned from every hood store 
My haters came for the better and money came for the loads 
Concrete where we rose, you wasn't built from this mold 
Fucked up the game with many flow 
I've been a loc since Henry O 
I'm ten toes, you movie role 
I do this shit for lifers way before 
Jehri curls, cut Dickies and sherm smoke 
Got so many bodies the world knows, shit 
Don't worry 'bout no witness, your homies go under oath 
But our dreams were big, homie 
The world done flipped on me, took my soul then clicked on me 
 
Who needs a mothafuckin' friend? 
You see my mothafuckin' rims 
Met the devil in disguise 
Look through my mothafuckin' eyes 
 
Look at my eyes, look at my block 
Look at my shit, cold 
All of these lies, true to my life 
Word to my pen so 
Take what you want, get what you like 
Open that window 
Ain't that shit raw 
Ain't it? That shit raw 
Look through my mothafuckin' eyes 
Vision impaired by the high 
No cares on my mind 
Couple dares, that is fine 
 
My picture was in full frame 
But my vision had distort 
My memory is okay 
But my feelings on point 
I could be here all day if you let me go, go, go, go 
Oh Lord! 
You don't know the half of what I had to hold, hold, hold, hold 
No Lord! 
I see faces at my window 
My patience growin' short 
I had no one to lend on 
That's why that chip is so cold 
Kinda like the cool king on my fallen bros, bros, bros, bros 
Oh Lord! 
Guess that's my curtain call, my last go 
Said isn't this shit what you wanted to see? 
Ain't this shit what you wanted to see?</field>

I don't feel a thing 
You got the right one, hey, 2 step 
Can I rock with ya? Can I smoke with ya? 
 
Tryna give you an upgrade 
Cherry bottles to your shapes 
Take my debit and go cray 
Spend, spend every dollar, all way 
Turn your closet to a driveway 
Your old nigga was the old days 
Broke times in a broke place 
Teary eyed with the pout face 
You can get it how you want it, my love 
Small shoppin', hope a hundred thousand enough 
Benz, Benz, want the rims on the truck 
Girl you livin' a no, stay in the goat 
Whatever you want 
 
Hey! Cribbo in the Hills 
Table full of bills 
Dollar dollar bills 
Whatever you want 
I can make it real 
We, we can split a mil' 
Prolly sellin' pills 
Dollar dollar bills 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you, you, you, you, you, you 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
(West coast, Cali love, whatever you want) 
Whatever you want 
 
Good weed and pain pills 
Big boy, we bringin' in big mills 
Every dollar dollar bill caught wheels 
Crib in the Hills if you call us, Net, chill 
Fly around the world, girl you livin' or not? 
We used to run from the cops, now we buyin' the blocks 
Started ballin' like I said I would 
Came up in the game I love 
If you backed it you must get cuffed 
So cold with the cobra love 
Now I'm never in the hood enough 
Had to get up off my ass to get it 
Want it, pick it, tag, clip it, yeah 
 
West coast, Cali love, you can have it all 
Palm trees, bomb weed, whatever you want 
Middle age millionaire, you can have it all 
Sleeve gold, bankroll, whatever you want 
Whatever you want 
 
Hey! Cribbo in the Hills 
Table full of bills 
Dollar dollar bills 
Whatever you want 
I can make it real 
We, we can split a mil'

Whatever you, you, you, you, you, you 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou

Whatever you want 
 
I don't need your money, honey 
I just want your love 
Make it, tasty, nasty, crazy 
Give it all you got 
Diamonds last forever, baby 
Look at what we got 
I don't want your money, darling 
I just want your love 
Diamonds last forever, baby 
Look at what we got 
I don't want your money, darling 
I just want your love</field>

Broke then fix your pockets, all I do is profit 
 
Quarter million, switchin' lanes, that part 
Bet my bitch move the same old thing, that part

Ayy I'm still tryna make that plate 
Rich or poor nigga, pick your fate 
Style on top of style, nigga 
Five years I've been rich, nigga 
Drove Bimmers down Fig, nigga 
Pushed Porsche's down Broadway 
I've been divin' in different hoes, nigga

Wifey gonna kill me, she the female OJ 
Y'all don't feel me, man this ain't okay 
Four Seasons, take a shower, new clothes, I'm reloaded 
Rich nigga, still eatin' catfish 
That bitch ain't really bad, that's a catfish 
If I walk up out of Saks Fifth 
Have the paparazzi doin' back-flips 
If I lay you down on the mattress 
Blow the back out 'til you backless 
Thick, we already established 
She just got 'em done, bra-strapless 
Yeah! Okay

Kill everybody, fuck an AK 
Sell narcotics and step my dollars up to Bill Gates 
Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off 
Punk ass cops, them crackers want us with our black off 
Thug life nigga since '96 I wanted to gang bang 
Few years later I'm really from it 
We were still kids 
Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty till the shell break 
Fuck my image I need to drop 
I need to, blank face 
Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keeping two ways 
Sell narcotics, I'm slanging diamonds with your pack then 
Stack large commas, you with your riders with your backbone 
Can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin 
Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on 
All bad bitches they wanna fuck me with the cap gone 
Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' till all the weed blown 
Wait long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone 
Y'all don't hear me, I want the money right 
Ugh, Groovy Tony, no face killer 
I see the money right, ugh 
Yeah, I'm blank face 
 
Clear everything out the safe 
Crack the pig bank 
Robbin' your kids too 
My heart an igloo 
The devil in all blue 
Die now go to heaven or bring 'em through 
Lot of brown 'round here 
Got that white girl for you 
And she swimming in fire water, could be double digits 
Pistol through your Civic 
Most die before they hear it 
Turn a nigga to a spirit 
Drive slow, oh, hey 
Hit the curb with shattered mirrors 
Look around now you're hellbound 
Boogie down, bullshit I won't allow 
Slang a bird every hou' 
Smack a nigga with the heat 
Contradicting, now you peace 
Leave you triple six laying in defeat 
Can you dig it? 
Struck a match, they won't finish 
Drop a nigga off, get a nigga whipped 
Squeezing fingertips, aye 
 
Blank face, Tre 8 
Kill everybody, fuck an AK
