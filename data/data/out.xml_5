            <field name="lyrics">We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same 
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain 
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go 
She couldn't scream while I held her close 
I swore I'd never let her go 
Tell me what you wanna know 
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on 
There ain't no motive for this crime 
Jenny was a friend of mine 
So come on, oh come on, oh come on, woah 
I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time 
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright 
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth 
She couldn't scream while I held her close 
I swore I'd never let her go 
Tell me what you wanna know 
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on 
And then you whisper in my ear 
I know what you're doing here 
So come on, oh come on, oh come on 
There ain't no motive for this crime 
Jenny was a friend of mine 
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on, woah.</field>

Thinks her life's in danger 
No one gives a damn about her hair 
It's lonely down on track street 
She used to go by Jackie 
The cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers 
Take a number where the blood just barely dried 
Wait for something better 
No one behind you 
Watching your shadows 
This feeling won't go 
Crooked wheels keep tuning 
Children, are you learning 
Acclimatize, but don't you lose the plot 
A history of blisters 
Your brothers and your sisters 
Somewhere in the pages we forgot 
Take a number Jackie 
Where the blood just barely dried 
You know I'm on your side 
Wait for something better 
No one behind you 
Watching your shadows 
You gotta be stronger than the story 
Don't let it blind you 
Rivers of shadow 
This feeling wont go 
And the sky is full of dreams 
But you don't know how to fly 
I don't have a simple answer 
But I know that I could answer 
Something better 
This feeling won't go 
Wait for it (x4)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Be still and go on to bed 
Nobody knows what lies ahead 
And life is short, to say the least 
We're in the belly of the beast 
Be still, wild and young 
Long may your innocence reign, 
Like shells on the shore 
And may your limits be unknown 
And may your efforts be your own 
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore 
Don't break character, you've got a lot of heart 
Is this real or just a dream? 
Rise up like the sun, 
Labour 'til the work is done 
Be still, one day you'll leave 
Fearlessness on your sleeve 
And when you come back 
Tell me, what did you see? 
Was there something out there for me? 
Be still, close your eyes 
Soon enough you'll be on your own 
Steady and straight 
And if they drag you through the mud, 
It doesn't change what's in your blood 
(Over rock, over chain(over chain), over trap, over plain) 
When they knock you down 
Don't break character, you've got a lot of heart 
Is this real or just a dream? 
Be still 
Be still 
Be still 
Be still 
Over rock and chain 
Over sunset plain 
Over trap and snare 
When you're in too deep 
In your wildest dream 
In your made up scheme 
When they knock you down 
Don't break character, you've got so much heart 
Is this real or just a dream? 
Oh, rise up like the sun and labour 'til the work is done 
Rise up like the sun and labour 'til the work is 
Rise up like the sun and labour 'til the work is done</field>

We took a back road, 
we're gonna look at the stars 
We took a back road in my car 
Down to the ocean, 
it's only water and sand 
And in the ocean, we'll hold hands 
But I don't really like you 
Apologetic and dressed in the best 
but on a heartbeat glide 
Without an answer, the thunder speaks from the sky 
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry 
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry 
Don't you wanna come with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones? 
It's only natural 
A cinematic vision ensued like the holiest dream 
It's someone's calling? 
An angel whispers my name 
but the message relayed is the same: 
"Wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine." 
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind 
I always hear them when the dead 
of night comes calling to save me from this fight 
But they can never wrong this right 
Don't you wanna come with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones? 
It's only natural. 
Don't you wanna swim with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin? 
It's only natural. 
Never had a lover, 
never had soul. 
Never had a good time, 
Never got cold. 
Don't you wanna come with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones? 
It's only natural 
Don't you wanna swim with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin? 
It's only natural 
Don't you wanna come with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones? 
It's only natural 
Come and take a swim with me. 
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin? 
It's only natural.

You walk around like a ghost 
Your star spangled heart 
Took a train for the coast 
When you shine you're a hill top mansion 
So how'd ya lose the light? 
Was it blown by the wind? 
In the still of the night 
Up against the wall 
Up against the wall 
There's something dying on the street 
When they knock you down 
You're gonna get back on your feet 
(But you can't stop now) 
I always saw you as a kind of keeper 
Mother to a child 
But your boys have grown soft 
And your girls have gone wild 
From the blue ranch to the black hills 
To the redwood sky 
The season may pass 
But the dream doesn't die 
Now don't you drop the ball 
Up against the wall 
There's something dying on the street 
When they knock you down 
You're gonna get back on your feet 
(But you can't stop now) 
When they break your heart 
And when they called you soft 
In the morn remember what I said 
Boy you was Battle Born 
(But you can't stop now) 
You was Battle Born 
When the night falls on the land 
Are you haunted by the sound? 
It's gonna take more than a hand 
To turn this thing around 
But you need it underneath 
Rescue, set me free! 
Up against the wall 
Up against the wall 
There's something dying on the street 
Up against the wall 
When they knock you down 
You're gonna get back on your feet 
(But you can't stop now) 
Did they break your heart? 
And did they call you soft? 
In the morn remember what I said 
Boy you was battle born 
(But you can't stop now) 
Come on show your face 
Come on give us one more spark 
Sing a song of fire 
Unless you fall into the dark 
You never win 
You never lose 
You can never shine if you never prove 
The rising tide 
The undertow 
The venom and 
The overflow 
Turn away 
The open home</field>

but I don't really mind and it's starting to get to me 
Nobody ever pulls the seams round here, 
but I don't really mind and it's starting to get to me 
I've got this energy beneath my feet 
like something underground's gonna come up and carry me, 
I've got this sentimental heart that beats 
but I don't really mind [and] it's starting to get to me 
Now.."Why do you waste my time?" 
Is the answer to the question on your mind 
And I'm sick of all my judges 
so scared of what they'll find 
But I know that I can make it 
As long as somebody takes me home, 
every now and then... 
Oh, have you ever seen the lights? 
Have you ever seen the lights? 
I took the shuttle on a shock-wave ride, 
where the people on the pen pull trigger for accolade 
I took a bullet, I looked inside 
Running through my veins 
An American masquerade 
I still remember Grandma Dixie's way, 
I never really known anybody to die before 
Red white and blue upon a birthday cake, 
And my brother, he was born on the fourth of the July...and that's all 
"So why do you waste my time?" 
Is the answer to the question on your mind 
And I'm sick of all my judges, 
so scared of letting me shine 
But I know that I can make it, 
as long as somebody takes me home... 
Wooooooo! 
(every now and then) [x2] 
[You know] I see London, I see Sam's Town 
holds my hand and let's my hair down 
Rolls that world right off my shoulder 
I see London, I see Sam's Town

No, I can get by myself 
I don't need time, I don't know why

I scrambled online and I know that I

But I can get by in the meantime 
By myself 
Woo!

Probable to say 
Sleeping in, a lazy afternoon 
A danger to the doubters, they assume 
I don't need time, I don't need time 
No, I can get by myself

Just another white trash county kiss 
In '61, long brown hair, foolish eyes 
He looks just like you'd want him to 
Some kind of slick chrome American Prince 
A blue jean serenade, and moon river, what you do to me 
I don't believe you 
Saw Cinderella in a party dress 
But she was looking for a nightgown 
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands 
He's getting ready for the showdown 
I saw the minute that I turned away 
I got my money on a palm tonight 
Change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on 
fire 
She says she always knew he'd come around 
And the decades disappear like sinking ships 
But we persevere, God gives us hope 
But we still fear what we don't know 
The mind is poison 
Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized 
Drawbridges closing 
Saw Cinderella in a party dress 
But she was looking for a nightgown 
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands 
He's getting ready for the showdown 
I saw the ending when they turned the page 
I took my money and I ran away 
Straight to the valley of the great divide 
Out where the dreams are high 
Out here, the wind don't blow 
Out here, the good girls die 
And the sky won't snow 
Out here, the birds don't sing 
Out here, the fields don't grow 
Out here, the bell don't ring 
Out here, the bell don't ring 
Out here, the good girls die 
Now Cinderella, don't you go to sleep 
It's such a bitter form of refuge 
Oh don't you know, the kingdom's under siege 
And everybody needs you 
Is there still magic in the midnight sun 
Or did you leave it back in 61? 
In the cadence of a young man's eyes 
I wouldn't dream so high</field>

The robots awake to find that they've been taped down 
Wondering when they break through these chains 
But little boys have action toys for brains 
I'm living proof, it can last a long time, now the girls up 
The street are innocent and sweet while their all in bed 
They got their makeup and dreams of wonderland 
Sprinkled inside their heads soon they will change 
But tonight Hollywood hills can never seem so strange 
Their mothers pray it will last a long time 
I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow 
I wanna relearn what I already know 
Just let me take flight dressed in red 
Through the night on a great big sled 
I wanna wish you merry Christmas 
Ho, ho, ho 
Now the boys are all grown up 
And there working their fingers to the bone 
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend 
You know they still can't be alone 
I've been raking my brain 
With thoughts of peace and love 
How on earth did we get so mixed up 
I pray to God, it don't last a long time 
I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow 
I wanna relearn what I already know 
Just let me take flight dressed in red 
Through the night on a great big sled 
I hear the sound of bells 
There's something on the roof 
I wonder what this night will bring 
I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow 
I wanna relearn what I already know 
Just let me take flight dressed in red 
Through the night on a great big sled

Come on, show me where it hurts 
Maybe I can heal it 
Your feelings are your own 
Now you keep 'em under lock and key 
You got me drivin' through the streets 
For an answer to the mystery 
The world's still weak on Charleston Avenue 
Outside that vacant Starlight Motel I see you 
Laughing with your girlfriends 
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind 
It was a matter of time 
There's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface 
Just walkin' through the front door makes me nervous 
It's creepin' up the floorboards, got me wondering where I stand 
I cannot put out the fire, I got a book of matches in my hand 
When we first met, headstrong and filled with doubt 
Made just enough hustling tables that summer to take you out 
I was fallin' back on forever when you told me about your heart 
You laid it on the line 
Laughing with your girlfriends 
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind 
(You laid it on the line) 
It was just a matter, it was a matter of time 
We found ourselves a place 
We belong in it forever 
Ain't that what it's all about 
Make the promise and keep it 
Come hell or high water 
We'd figure it out 
It was the night, it was the moon 
It was the green grass in the garden 
The victory and the sin 
I know you're weary, look at me 
Flailin' in the corner 
Here's the towel 
Go on, throw it in 
It was a matter of time 
Can't you see that it's tearing me up inside? 
Look what's laying at our feet 
That's the wreckage of broken dreams 
And burned out hells 
And it's here on our street</field>

I see trouble on the way 
I see earthquakes and lightnin? 
I see bad times today 
Don't go around tonight 
Well, it's bound to take your life 
There's a bad moon on the rise 
I hear hurricanes blowing 
I know the end is coming soon 
I fear rivers over flowing 
I hear the voice of rage and ruin 
Don't go around tonight 
Well, it's bound to take your life 
There's a bad moon on the rise 
I hope you got your things together 
I hope you are quite prepared to die 
Looks like we're in for nasty weather 
One eye is taken for an eye 
Don't go around tonight 
Well, it's bound to take your life 
There's a bad moon on the rise 
Don't go around tonight 
Well, it's bound to take your life

            <field name="lyrics">Lost faith in the human spirit 
You walk around like a ghost 
Your star spangled heart 
Took a train for the coast 
When you shine you're a hill top mansion 
So how'd ya lose the light? 
Was it blown by the wind? 
In the still of the night 
Up against the wall 
Up against the wall 
There's something dying on the street 
When they knock you down 
You're gonna get back on your feet 
(But you can't stop now) 
I always saw you as a kind of keeper 
Mother to a child 
But your boys have grown soft 
And your girls have gone wild 
From the blue ranch to the black hills 
To the redwood sky 
The season may pass 
But the dream doesn't die 
Now don't you drop the ball 
Up against the wall 
There's something dying on the street 
When they knock you down 
You're gonna get back on your feet 
(But you can't stop now) 
When they break your heart 
And when they called you soft 
In the morn remember what I said 
Boy you was Battle Born 
(But you can't stop now) 
You was Battle Born 
When the night falls on the land 
Are you haunted by the sound? 
It's gonna take more than a hand 
To turn this thing around 
But you need it underneath 
Rescue, set me free! 
Up against the wall 
Up against the wall 
There's something dying on the street 
Up against the wall 
When they knock you down 
You're gonna get back on your feet 
(But you can't stop now) 
Did they break your heart? 
And did they call you soft? 
In the morn remember what I said 
Boy you was battle born 
(But you can't stop now) 
Come on show your face 
Come on give us one more spark 
Sing a song of fire 
Unless you fall into the dark 
You never win 
You never lose 
You can never shine if you never prove 
The rising tide 
The undertow 
The venom and 
The overflow 
Turn away 
The open home</field>

Nobody knows what lies ahead 
And life is short, to say the least 
We're in the belly of the beast 
Be still, wild and young 
Long may your innocence reign, 
Like shells on the shore 
And may your limits be unknown 
And may your efforts be your own 
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore 
Don't break character, you've got a lot of heart 
Is this real or just a dream? 
Rise up like the sun, 
Labour 'til the work is done 
Be still, one day you'll leave 
Fearlessness on your sleeve 
And when you come back 
Tell me, what did you see? 
Was there something out there for me? 
Be still, close your eyes 
Soon enough you'll be on your own 
Steady and straight 
And if they drag you through the mud, 
It doesn't change what's in your blood 
(Over rock, over chain(over chain), over trap, over plain) 
When they knock you down 
Don't break character, you've got a lot of heart 
Is this real or just a dream? 
Be still 
Be still 
Be still 
Be still 
Over rock and chain 
Over sunset plain 
Over trap and snare 
When you're in too deep 
In your wildest dream 
In your made up scheme 
When they knock you down 
Don't break character, you've got so much heart 
Is this real or just a dream? 
Oh, rise up like the sun and labour 'til the work is done 
Rise up like the sun and labour 'til the work is 
Rise up like the sun and labour 'til the work is done</field>

Under your Monet, baby 
Remember the arch of roses 
Right above your couch 
Forget what they said in Soho 
Leave the oh-no's out 
Yes, there is an old cliche 
Under your Monet, baby 
You left the station now to the floor 
With speculation, what was it for? 
In that old hallway 
Moses, why don't you say 
You've been away for a long time 
Believe me, Natalie 
This is your last chance 
To find a go-go 
Forget what they said in Soho 
And walk away 
If my dreams for us can't get you through 
Just one more day 
It's alright by me 
God help me somehow 
There's no time for survival left 
The time is now... 
Cause this might be your last chance

You say it's hard enough to live 
It's not so bad, it's not so bad 
How do you know that you're right? 
I awoke on the roadside 
In the land of the free ride 
And I can't pull it any longer 
The sun is beating down my neck 
So I ran with the devil 
Left a trail of excuses 
Like a stone on the water 
The elements decide my fate 
Watch it go..."bling" 
When I offer you survival 
You say it's hard enough to live 
Don't tell me that it's over 
Poor and tired 
But more than this 
How do you know that you're right? 
If you're not nervous anymore 
It's not so bad, it's not so bad 
I feel my vision slipping in and out of focus 
But I'm pushing on for that horizon 
I'm pushing on 
Now I've got the blowing wind against my face 
So you sling rocks at the rip tide 
Am I wrong or am I right? 
I hit the bottom with a "huh!" 
(??) Quite strange 
I get my glory in the desert rain 
Watch it go..."bling" 
When I offer you survival 
You say it's hard enough to live 
And I'll tell you when it's over 
Shut up poor and tired 
But more than this 
How do you know that you're right? 
If you're not nervous anymore 
It's not so bad, it's not so bad... 
Higher and higher 
We're gonna take it 
Down to the wire 
We're gonna make it 
Out of the fire 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
We're gonna take it 
Down to the wire 
We're gonna make it 
Out of the fire 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
We're gonna take it 
Down to the wire 
We're gonna make it out 
Whoa-oh-oh Higher and higher 
It ain't hard to hold 
When it shines like gold

We took a back road, 
we're gonna look at the stars 
We took a back road in my car 
Down to the ocean, 
it's only water and sand 
And in the ocean, we'll hold hands 
But I don't really like you 
Apologetic and dressed in the best 
but on a heartbeat glide 
Without an answer, the thunder speaks from the sky 
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry 
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry 
Don't you wanna come with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones? 
It's only natural 
A cinematic vision ensued like the holiest dream 
It's someone's calling? 
An angel whispers my name 
but the message relayed is the same: 
"Wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine." 
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind 
I always hear them when the dead 
of night comes calling to save me from this fight 
But they can never wrong this right 
Don't you wanna come with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones? 
It's only natural. 
Don't you wanna swim with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin? 
It's only natural. 
Never had a lover, 
never had soul. 
Never had a good time, 
Never got cold. 
Don't you wanna come with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones? 
It's only natural 
Don't you wanna swim with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin? 
It's only natural 
Don't you wanna come with me? 
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones? 
It's only natural 
Come and take a swim with me. 
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin? 
It's only natural.

In this town. 
Silent night, for a change. 
Brand new year, 
Coming up ahead. 
You know its been so long, 
Since I rang one in? 
I close my eyes, 
Think about the path I took. 
Just when I think these times, 
Have gotten the best of me. 
I can see my mother in the kitchen. 
My father on the floor, 
Watching television. 
It's a wonderful life. 
Cinnamon candles burning. 
Snowball fights outside. 
Smile below each nose and above each chin. 
Stomp my boots before I go back in. 
I wasted my wishes, 
On Saturday nights. 
Boy what I would give, 
For just one more. 
I soften my heart, 
Shocked the world. 
Do you hear my voice? 
Do you know my name? 
Light my way, 
Lift my head. 
Light my way, 
I can see my mother in the kitchen. 
My father on the floor, 
Watching television. 
It's a wonderful life. 
Cinnamon candles burning. 
Snowball fights outside. 
Smile below each nose and above each chin. 
Family all together. 
Presents piled high. 
Frost on all the windows, 
What a wonderful night. 
Cinnamon candles burning. 
Snowball fights outside. 
Smile below each nose and above each chin. 
So happy they found me, 
Love was all around me. 
Stomp my boots before I go back in.</field>

Like any other day 
Must have gave the wrong impression 
Don't you understand where I belong? 
Well I'm not the one 
Stand again 
They say nothing comes for free 
And that's the truth 
Been livin' in a fantasy 
Slip and slide a head-trip heaven 
Self denial's such a wonderful and powerful thing 
Well I'm not the one 
The morning dove sings 
With two broken wings 
Carry me home 
I'm not afraid 
The stars in my eyes 
Were shimmerin' lights 
Carry me home 
Don't let me fade away 
Stop the press 
The kid's light is growin' dim 
It took a month long slide 
And the world came cavin' in 
When you self desruct 
You wind up looking for a glimmer of hope 
But the writing's on the wall 
I'm not the one 
The morning dove sings 
With two broken wings 
Carry me home 
I'm not afraid 
The stars in my eyes 
Were shimmering lights 
Carry me home 
Don't let me fade 
Just how thick is your skin? 
Just how sharp are your teeth? 
Oh-ohh-oh 
You've got a lot to learn 
Is there somewhere else 
That I can win? 
Is there something else 
To start over again? 
From the summit's edge 
To the cutting room floor 
I will be afraid no more 
The morning dove sings 
With two broken wings 
Carry me home 
I'm not afraid 
The stars in my eyes 
Were shimmering lights 
Carry me home 
Don't let me fade 
Carry me home 
Carry me

While I ignore, that we both felt like this 
Before it starts to show 
So if I had a chance 
Would you let me know 
Why aren't you shaking 
Step back in time 
Graciously taking 
Oh you're too kind 
And if the answer is no 
Can I change your mind 
We're all the same 
And love is blind 
The sun is gone 
Before it shines

Warm beach from palm December afternoon 
You close your eyes, another year blows by 
Somewhere in the wind, just another life 
My parents sent a Christmas card and then it's true 
We understand you're staying and we're proud of you 
There's a well-rehearsed disinterest in the atmosphere 
I don't know if that's what this time gave me 
Or if it lead me here 
And I played so many parts 
I don't know which one's really me 
Don't know if I can take 
Another Christmas in L 
A 
Another pitcher of Sangria 
In an empty beach café 
Another Christmas in L 
A 
Hold me tighter Carmelita 
I don't know how long I can stay 
Left a girl behind in my old man's truck 
Sometimes I wonder where she ended up 
Maybe she got married, had a couple of kids 
Who do you think you're fooling man? 
Of course she did 
I'm walking in that tennis bar 
Try and talk with Harry Bean 
I don't know if I can take 
Another Christmas in L 
A 
Another casting call on Thursday 
For a job that doesn't pay 
Another Christmas in L 
A 
Another burnout in a tank top 
It seems your basket is the case 
A fat protagonist in flip flops 
With an extensive resume 
From Echo Park to Catalina 
Dreaming of a white Christmas 
The one I used to know 
Tree tops glisten, children listen 
To sleigh bells in the snow 
Another Christmas in L

Already caught in a trap 
His angel's kiss was a joke 
And she is not coming back 
Because heaven sends and heaven takes 
Crashing cars in his brain 
Keep him tied up to a dream 
And only she can set him free 
And then he says to me 
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now 
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now 
Yeah she's got a criminal mind 
He's got a reason to pray 
His life is under the gun 
He's got to hold every day 
Now he just wants to wake up 
Yeah, just to prove it's a dream 
Cause she's an angel for sure 
But that remains to be seen 
Because heaven sends and heaven takes 
Crashing cars in his brain 
Keep him tied up to a dream 
And only she can set him free

Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now 
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now 
Stupid on the streets of London 
James Dean in the rain 
Without her it's not the same 
The same, the same, but it's alright 
Because heaven sends and heaven takes 
Crashing cars in his brain 
Keep him tied up to a dream

That can come down on you 
The expectation can be great 
If you should ever tire 
Or if you should require 
Sudden simple twist of fate 
Don't hide away, there's something to be said 
For pushing through 
We never ride on horses that discourage you 
If you should fall upon hard times 
If you should lose your way 
There is a place, here in this house 
That you can stay 
If you should find romance 
Go on and take that chance 
Before the strategies begin 
Deadlines and commitments 
Every morning, in the evening 
They can suck you in 
Boy don't I know it 
This offer won't be standing 
All you gotta do is call 
Don't be afraid to knock on the door 
If you should fall upon hard times 
If you should lose your way 
There is a place, here in this house

Deadlines and commitments

There is a place, here in this house

Catch you darling 
I'll be waiting 
I am on your side

All you gotta do is call 
Don't be afraid to knock on the door 
If you should fall upon hard times

            <field name="lyrics">Hey kid 
I'm getting tired 
Of all this 
Running around 
I think I'm going down 
Oh yeah 
Don't you think it's time 
Time we reconciled 
Maybe we could 
Talk a while 
Santa had a change of heart 
Santa had a change of heart 
Santa had a change of heart 
Santa had a change of heart 
A change of heart 
A change of heart 
And we know it wasn't easy 
You've been after me a long while 
A pathological display 
Now take a moment to imagine 
My dismay 
When I heard you had a heart change 
I was sceptical at first 
'Til you've seen it for yourself 
I guess you just expect the worst 
Crooked nose and bloodshot eyes 
Iron will for telling lies 
Cheap sit smile and one inch fuse 
You hurt me Santa and I'm confused 
Pretty girls, Christmas lights 
Mistletoe, holy nights 
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud 
Yeah, I hear you on the bomb shell 
I was taken back myself 
And I'd like to make it alright 
So I called the elves 
We hashed up a little, guess what 
Your nice status was renewed 
Just tell Santa what you want 
I'm gonna make your dreams come true 
Red Porsche 944 like Jake 
In "Sixteen Candles" for goodness sake 
And a couple more you might have missed 
Like a shiny Rolex on my wrist and 
Pretty girls, Christmas lights 
Mistletoe, holy nights 
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud 
Too many people in black robes posing as judges 
They should turn that mirror around 
Too many people weighed down by frivolous grudges 
When will we look to leave the past behind 
And you know it's nice to see you wrapped up 
See how far you've come 
There's something to be said for being present 
Not just getting one 
So pass the gravy and tap your toes 
And don't mind Ol' Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
Crooked nose and bloodshot eyes 
Iron will for telling lies 
If you've got squabble in your skin 
Just take that turkey and trade it in for 
Pretty girls, Christmas lights 
Mistletoe, holy nights 
All I ever really wanted was 
Pretty girls, Christmas lights 
Mistletoe, holy nights 
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud 
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud</field>

I've been waiting on you 
That's funny kid 
Because I've been coming for you 
Oh Santa 
I've been killing just for fun 
Well the party's over kid 
Because I 
Because I got a bullet in my gun 
A bullet in your what? 
Don't shoot me Santa Claus 
I've been a clean living boy 
I promise you 
Did every little thing you asked me to 
I can't believe the things I'm going through 
Don't shoot me Santa Claus 
Well no one else around believes me 
But the children on the block they tease me 
I couldn’t let them off that easy 
Oh Santa 
It's been a real hard year 
There just ain't no gettin' around this 
Life is hard 
But look at me 
I turned out alright 
Hey Santa 
Why don't we talk about it? 
Work it out 
Believe me 
This ain't what I wanted 
I love all you kids, you know that 
Hell, I remember when you were just 10 years old 
Playing out there in the desert 
Just waiting for a sip of that sweet Mojave rain 
In the sweet Mojave rain 
The boy was on his own 
Don't shoot me Santa Claus 
I've been a clean living boy 
I promise you 
Did every little thing you asked me to 
I can't believe the things I'm going through 
Hey Santa Claus 
Well no one else around believes me 
But the children on the block they tease me 
I couldn’t let them off that easy 
They had it coming 
So why can’t you see? 
I couldn't turn my cheek no longer 
The sun is going down and Christmas is near 
Just look the other way and I’ll disappear forever 
Woo! 
Don't shoot me Santa Claus 
Well no one else around believes me 
But the children on the street they tease me 
I couldn't let them off that easy 
Believe me 
Santa

            <field name="lyrics">I've gone through life white-knuckled 
In the moments that left me behind 
Refusing to heed the yield 
I penetrate the forcefields and the blind 
They say I'll adjust 
God knows I must 
But I'm not sure how 
This natural selection 
Picked me out to be 
A dark horse running in a fantasy 
Flesh and bone! 
And I'm running out of time 
Flesh and bone! 
Somewhere outside that finish line 
I square up and break through the chains 
And I hit like a raging bull 
Anointed by the blood 
I take the reigns 
Cut from the cloth 
Of the flag that bears the name 
Battle born 
And they'll call me the contender 
They'll listen for the bell 
With my face flashing crimson 
From the fires of hell 
What are you afraid of? 
And what are you made of? 
Flesh and bone! 
And I'm running out of time 
Flesh and bone! 
And what are you made of? 
Flesh and bone! 
And I'm turning on the dime 
Flesh and bone! 
This could decay (decay, decay, decay) 
This could decay 
Like the valley below 
Defences are down 
Stakes are high 
(Let's get out the crowd for a face of compassion) 
The fairytale end 
(To face out the journey to force us no more) 
The staggering blow 
(You'll find the truth in the roots of desire) 
You lead with your chin 
(Sitting in your corner, just a compass and the sun) 
This could be real 
Simple 
And what are you made of? 
Flesh and bone! 
And I'm running out of time 
Flesh and bone! 
What are you made of? 
He places forward 
Trading his blindness 
For the glow of love 
And time is raging 
Need to raise your game 
And ya always had it 
But you never knew 
So boots and saddles 
Get on your feet 
There's no surrender 
Because there's no retreat 
The bells absolve him 
And there's more starting and 
We are the descendants 
Of giant men</field>

For reasons unknown. 
I caught my stride, I flew and flied. 
I know if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my 
mind. 
But my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to. 
And my eyes, they don't see you no more. 
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to 
And my eyes don't recognize you no more. 
For reasons unknown; for reasons unknown. 
There was an open chair. 
We sat down in, the open chair. 
I said if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my mind. 
But my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to. 
And my eyes, they don't see you no more. 
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to, 
And my eyes don't recognize you at all. 
For reasons unknown; for reasons unknown. 
I said my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to; 
and my eyes don't recognize you no more. 
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to;

Forget about what I said 
Forget about what I said, I'm older now and I know you hear me. 
Forget about what I said 
Stay up late tonight 
And turn off your phone. 
Well you were selfish too 
But you were never all alone. 
In those ugly pink apartments with the hustlers and the kids 
Mapping out some retribution 
Do we have to go through this? 
Forget about what I said

Forget about what I said 
Forget about what I said, I'm older now and I know you hear me.

All of the stars are wandering round tonight 
We used to try them on (sometimes I hear you) 
And sometimes I hear you 
The galaxy sings your song 
And tonight I sing along

There's people always dying, trying to keep 'em alive 
His body's decomposing in containers tonight 
In an abandoned building where 
A squatter's made a mural of a Mexican girl 
With fifteen cans of spray paint and a chemical swirl 
She's standing in the ashes at the end of the world 
Four winds blowing through her hair 
But when great Satan's gone, the whore of Babylon 
She just can't sustain the pressure where it's placed, she caves 
The Bible's blind, the Torah's deaf, the Qu'ran's mute 
If you burn them all together, you get close to the truth still 
They are pouring over Sanskrit on the Ivy League moons 
While shadows lengthen in the sun 
Cast all the school and meditation built to soften the times 
And hold us at the center while the spiral unwinds 
It's knocking over fences, crossing property lines 
Four winds, cry until it comes 
And it's the sum of man, slouching towards Bethlehem 
A heart just can't contain all of that empty space 
It breaks, it breaks, it breaks 
Well, I went back, I rent a Cadillac, a company jet 
Like a newly orphaned refugee, retracing my steps 
All the way to Cassadaga to commune with the dead 
They said, "You'd better look alive" 
And I was off to old Dakota where a genocide sleeps 
In the black hills, the bad lands, the calloused east 
I buried my ballast, I made my peace 
With four winds, leveling the pines 
But when great Satan's gone, the whore of Babylon 
She just can't remain with all that outer space 
She breaks, she breaks, she caves, she caves</field>

You had it easy man you chose the hard way 
Walk that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt

Should I pass over the side and cross? 
You may wonder what the trouble cost 
That don't matter now life goes on 
Hallelujah the troubles gone 
No sense in holding grudges in this 32 years 
These are things I must learn to practice while I live

This temporary flesh and bone 
And know that it's over now 
I feel my fading mind begin to roam 
Every time you fall, and every time you try 
Every foolish dream, and every compromise 
Every word you spoke, and everything you said 
Everything you left me, rambles in my head 
And there's nothing I can say 
There's nothing I can do now 
And there's nothing I can say 
There's nothing I can do now 
Up above the world, so high

Everybody's watching, and everybody cry 
Stay, don't leave me, the stars can wait for 
Your sign, don't signal now

I saw a lovely senorita looking back at me 
named Guadalupe 
With big brown eyes 
oh what did you do this time? 
Made my excuses and a bee-line for the bedroom door 
she was begging and pleading 
screaming "Por favor, mi cumpleaños! Stay with me, baby it's cold outside" 
We are living in a difficult time 
We've been walking down a difficult line 
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time 
Cumpleaños feliz! 
Happy Birthday, Guadalupe! 
Our time will come 
We both hold on 
She gave me coffee and tortillas to console my head 
prepared the slippers on my feet before she made our bed 
and blew the candles from my favorite cake 
and we kiss beneath the mistletoe 
And I pulled her body close to mine 
I had just one chance 
I whispered "Baby will you marry me for just one dance!" 
Infatuation 
The things you say 
I got scared and I left that night 
'Cause we are living in a difficult time 
We've been walking down a difficult line 
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time 
Cumpleaños feliz! 
Happy Birthday, Guadalupe! 
Deck the halls with rosaries 
Wish upon a Christmas tree 
Silent night please come to me 
Bearing gifts from my.. 
My mexican angel 
At night I wake up cold and lonely 
bursting at the seams 
She haunts the early morning hours of December dreams 
my Guadalupe 
with big brown eyes 
I wanna break this spell tonight 
'Cause we are living in a difficult time 
And we've been walking down a difficult line 
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time 
Cumpleaños feliz! 
Happy Birthday, Guadalupe! 
Happy Birthday, Guadalupe!</field>

Ohh I just need one, to get through to you 
I just need one more 
Have all the songs been written? 
Have all your needs been met? 
Have all these years been worth it? 
Or am I the great regret? 
Has every ship gone sailing? 
Has every heart gone blue? 
Have all the songs been written? 
Oh I just need one, to get through to you 
Oh I just need one more, to get through to you 
I can't take back, what I've done wrong 
And I just need one more 
When the train returns to the rails 
When the ship is back in the harbor 
I will make you happy again 
I can see a life, I believe it

I just need one more, to get through to you

            <field name="lyrics">Looking out my window an angel in robe appeared 
And nearly pulled me apart 
A million miles of freedom 
A million miles of road 
But I still don't know where to start 
She wrote her number down 
She gave it to me 
They had to scrape me off the floor 
In this transient town 
Waiters and dealers trying to get their foot in the door 
That night I called her, she said 
Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life 
I've been trying to find my place in the world 
(I said to her) 
Baby, baby, babe I got all night 
To listen to the heart of a girl 
I can see the time dripping down the clock 
We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain 
It's the one that knows us when our heads are down 
It reminds us of the place from where we came 
Where we came 
Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life 
I've been trying to find my place in this world 
Baby, baby, babe I got all night 
To listen to the heart of a girl 
What happened here? What is this world? 
It's too far from the heart of a girl 
Ripping the heart from the drop of a pearl 
I'm on the shore waiting for the heart of a girl 
Any door Knock on one 
Standing still, time is raging 
Staring down the mouth of 100,000 guns 
You're still here, you're still here 
I believe that we never have to be alone 
Yes I believe it's just around the bend 
You can hold it in, or you can scream it on the microphone 
There is no end 
There is no end 
Deep in the night, I feel a presence 
Of something that was long ago, told to me 
There is a hand guiding the river 
The river to wide open sea 
And deep in my heart, in any game, 
On any mountain, no I'm not afraid 
Standing on stone, you stand beside me 
And honor the plans that were made</field>

I remember when you were mine 
Just to reach you 
Baby, I'd stand in line 
There's another world 
We're living in 
Tonight 
There's another heart 
That's fading in 
The light 
Don't want your picture 
On my cell phone 
I want you here with me 
I don't want your memory 
In my head, no 
I want you here with me 
Spent the summer 
Just layin' out in the sun 
Time seems to move so slowly 
When you're taking it as it comes 
(Taking it as it comes) 
Maybe we were just too young 
(Maybe we were just too young) 
Your body was tan and your hair was long 
You showed me your smile and my cares were gone 
Falling in love filled my soul with fright 
You said "Come on babe, it'll be alright" 
Must have been a fool till the bitter end 
Now I hold on to hope 
That I'll have you back again 
I'd bargain and 
I'd fight 
But there's another world 
You're living in 
Tonight 
Don't want your picture 
On my cell phone 
I want you here with me 
I don't want your memory 
In my head, no 
I want you here with me 
Well, I saw you in a restaurant 
The other day 
And instead of walking towards you 
I ran away 
(Ran away) 
And I'll keep on waiting for you 
For you to come around 
Come around and say 
I don't want your picture 
On my cell phone 
I want you here with me 
Don't need those memories 
In my head, no 
I want you here with me 
(Here with me)</field>

I can't stay, much longer

I can't stay, very far 
I can't stay, much longer

There is a majesty at my doorstep 
And there is a little boy in her arms 
Now we'll parade around without game plans 
Obligations, or alarm

I'm writing you a letter 
I'm sure you've got it all figured out 
Things haven't been easy 
Between me and you 
I guess that there are things that you can't undo 
Maybe I was naughty once but now I'm nice 
Boy you made the list 
You know I checked it twice 
Well guess what 
You're still on it! 
Hahaha! 
And I feel it in my bones 
And I feel it in my bones 
Nights have been restless 
Pillows and sheets 
Bet you got it all figured out 
I sweat like a snowman 
Out in the sun 
Dreaming that there ain't nowhere to run to, baby 
Nowhere to hide 
Hey, Kringle! 
You mean to say when you were young 
You never got wild? 
Kid, don't you get it? 
I'm gonna make an example out of you 
For every mother's child 
And I feel it in my bones 
I'm coming for you 
And I feel it in my bones 
Silver bells and reins 
Tinsel holly 
What happened to the rose red cheeks 
Chimney, big bag presents and all 
Fat and jolly 
Tinsel holly 
And I feel it in my bones 
And I feel it in my bones 
And I feel it in my bones 
Merry Christmas! 
And I feel it in my bones 
Merry Christmas!</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Some time ago at Santa's place 
Up in the old North pole 
There lived a lump of anthracite 
Whose parents called him Joel 
Joel, Joel, the lump of coal 
Happy as a lump can be 
He just wants to keep Santa warm 
And make the elves cosy 
But Santa Claus had other plans 
For Joel one fateful day 
"Joel, you're just the lump I need 
Come join me on my sleigh" 
Joel, Joel, the lump of coal 
Heart leapt up with joy 
"I'll soon be Santa's present to 
A lucky girl or boy 
We'll laugh and play together 
And we'll hold each other tight 
Snuggle under clean white sheets 
When we go to sleep at night" 
Then Santa's elves all laughed at Joel 
"You're in for a surprise 
You're not a special Christmas gift 
You're just a booby prize 
What kid would ever want you? 
You're filthy as can be 
And now you have to go and live 
With one who's been naughty" 
That made keep 
Poor Joel crying in electricy 
You pollute the air 
With CO2 and Mercury 
Joel, Joel, the lump of coal 
Fell down upon his knees 
"I don't want to live with a naughty kid 
Don't make me, Santa, please" 
But Santa laughed his jolly laugh 
"Ho ho, you stupid lump 
You're just the thing to teach this brat 
That Santa ain't no chump, ho ho ho" 
So off they flew and before he knew 
Joel was in a sack 
He cried and yelled to Santa Claus 
"Why don't we just go back? " 
And then came Christmas morning 
And much to Joel's surprise 
He saw a boy with the saddest face 
And tears were in his eyes 
(Tears were in his eyes) 
He picked Joel up, he held him 
He said "You can be my friend" 
(Be my next best friend) 
"I would have liked some presents but 
You're what Santa chose to send" 
(Santa chose to send) 
"It's true I've been a naughty boy 
And maybe that's a sin" 
(Maybe that's a sin) 
"But if this is how Santa treats the kids 
I'm just glad that I'm not him" 
Joel, Joel, the lump of coal 
Knew what he must do 
He said "Now I know the reason why 
I got sent to you" 
Because when a person hurts inside 
It turns him hard and cruel 
But I know how to make your pain 
Into a precious jewel 
So take me in your hand, young man 
And squeeze with all your might 
Let's turn your pain and anger into 
Something that shines bright" 
And Joel, Joel, the lump of coal 
He gave his life away 
So one good naughty little boy 
Had a diamond on Christmas day</field>

Are you bad at dealing with the fame, Joseph 
There?s a pale moonshine above you 
Do you see both sides, do they shove you around 
Is the touchstone forcing you to hide, Joseph 
Are the rumours eating you alive, Joseph 
When the holy night is upon you 
Will you do what?s right, the position is yours 
From the temple walls to the New York night 
Our decisions rest on a child 
When she took her stand did she hold your hand 
Will your faith stand still or run away 
Run away 
When they've driven you so far 
That you think you're gonna drop 
Do you wish you were back there at the carpenter shop 
With the plane and the lathe 
The work never drove you mad 
You're a maker, a creator 
Not just somebody's dad 
From the temple walls to the New York night 
Our decisions rest on a man 
When I take the stand 
When I take the stand 
Will he hold my hand 
Will my faith stand still or run away 
And the desert 
It's a hell of a place to find heaven 
Forty years lost in the wilderness looking for God 
And you climb to the top of the mountain 
Looking down on the city where you were born 
On the years since you left 
Gave you time to sit back and reflect 
Better you than me 
Better you than me 
Better you than me 
Yes 
Well the holy night is upon you 
Do you see both sides, do they shove you around 
Better you than me

Better you than me

Stranded on the freeway burning with desire 
She was on the sidewalk looking for a night light 
We talked about the real things 
And drove into the fire 
Headlights on the highway 
The desert wind is howling 
Rattlesnakes and romance 
Is filling with the rain 
Candy apple red dress 
Bleeding when she kissed me 
Heaven in a ragtop 
Take away my pain 
When your chips are down 
When your highs are low 
Joyride 
Move across the night 
Like a separate wind 
Pulled up to a motel 
"Vacancy" was buzzing 
Pink and dirty neon 
Settle on the hood 
Wrap your arms around me 
Come a little closer 
Stumble in the twilight 
And fell onto the floor 
Loving Mona Lisa 
Dreaming of the free world 
Lipstick on the nightstand 
And demons at the door 
When your chips are down 
When your highs are low 
Joyride 
Move across the night 
Like a separate wind 
When your hopes and dreams 
Lose the will to go 
Joyride 
Reaching for the light 
Knowing we can't win 
There`s something in the distance 
A glorious existence 
A simple celebration 
A place you've never been before 
Tell me that you wanna go 
Reaching for the light 
knowing we can't win 
When your chips are down 
When your highs are low 
Joyride 
All your hopes and dreams 
All you need to know 
Joyride</field>

I can feel the cracks in my spirit 
They're starting to bust 
Drive by your house, nobody's home 
I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone 
All my friends say I should move on 
She's just another girl 
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard 
And all my friends say it wasn't meant to be 
And it's a great big world 
She's just another girl 
Another girl 
I went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip 
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip 
I can't believe you're out there flying with somebody else 
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye 
I got an invitation but I didn't reply 
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves 
And give him all of my love 
All of my friends say I should move on 
She's just another girl 
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard 
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be 
And it's a great big world 
And she's just another girl 
I could be reeling them in, left and right 
Something's got a hold on me, tonight 
Well maybe all of my friends should confront 
The fact that I don't want another girl 
All of my friends say I should move on 
All of my friends say 
All of my friends say 
All of my friends say 
She's just another girl 
Now why can't I sleep at night 
And why don't the moon look right 
It sailed off but the TV's on 
And it's a great big world 
She's just another girl 
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard 
She's just another girl

It's just the old man in me 
Washing his truck at the Sinclair station 
In the land of the free (Ooh) 
His mother, Adeline's family, came on a ship 
Cut coal and planted a seed 
Down in them drift mines of Pennsylvania 
In the land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free 
In the land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free 
In the land of the free 
(I'm standing crying) 
When I go out in my car, I don't think twice 
But if you're the wrong color skin 
(I'm standing, crying) 
You grow up looking over both your shoulders 
In the land of the free 
And we got more people locked up than the rest of the world 
Right here in red, white and blue 
(I'm standing, crying) 
Incarceration's become big business 
It's harvest time out on the avenue 
Land of the free, land of the free 
In the land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free 
Move on there's nothing to see 
Land of the free, land of the free 
In the land of the free 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh 
I'm standing crying (Oh-oh-oh-oh) 
I'm standing crying (Oh-oh-oh-oh) 
So how many daughters, tell me, how many sons 
Do we have to have to put in the ground 
Before we just break down and face it 
We got a problem with guns? (Oh-oh-oh-oh) 
In the land of the free 
Down at the border, they're gonna put up a wall 
Concrete and Rebar Steel beams 
(I'm standing crying) 
High enough to keep all those filthy hands off 
Of our hopes and our dreams 
(I'm standing crying) 
People who just want the same things we do 
In the land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free 
In the land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free 
In the land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free 
Land of the free, land of the free

Falling over myself, the televisions on,

Before you say goodbye 
Leave the bourbon on the shelf. 
And I'll drink it by myself. 
And I love you endlessly, 
darling don't you see I'm not satisfied 
until I hold you tight. 
Give me one more chance tonight 
and I swear I'll make it right. 
But you ain't got time for this 
and that wreckin' bell is ringin' 
and I'm not satisfied 
until I hold you 
Jennifer, tell me where I stand 
and who's that other boy holdin' your hand? 
Oh, Jennifer, you know I've always tried. 
Before you say goodbye 
Leave the bourbon on the shelf. 
And I'll drink it by myself. 
And I never liked your hair or those people that you lie with

Fill their heads with rumors of impending doom

Console me in my darkest hour

I wonder what you've got conspired 
I'm sure it dons a consolation prize 
I ain't in no hurry, you go run and tell your friends 
I'm losing touch 
Fill the night with stories, the legend grows 
Of how you got lost, but you made your way back home 
You sold your soul like a Roman Vagabond, yeah 
I heard you found a wishing well 
In the city 
Console me in my darkest hour 
And you throw me down 
I ain't in no hurry, you go run and tell your friends 
I'm losing touch 
Fill your crown with rumors 
Impending doom

You sold your soul, like a Roman Vagabond 
And about how you got lost, but you made your way back home 
You went and sold your soul, an allegiance dead and gone

I know there's a hope 
There's too many people trying to help me cope 
You got a real short skirt 
I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah yeah 
We were just in time 
Let me take a little more off your mind 
There's something in my head 
Somewhere in the back said 
We were just a good thing 
We were such a good thing 
Make it go away without a word 
But promise me you'll stay 
And face this things i have heard 
Oh, make it go away! 
I drive faster, boy 
I drive faster, boy 
Oh, crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl 
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls 
I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier 
Of stars in atmosphere 
And watch her disappear 
Into the midnight show. 
Oh faster, faster, faster. 
Oh no no no no no.

Well baby you can keep a secret

Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be 
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes 
I never was a quitter 
Oblivious to schoolgirls' lies 
When I look back on those neon lights 
The leather seats, the passage rite 
I feel the heat, I see the light 
Miss Atomic Bomb 
Making out, we've got the radio on 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone 
Racing shadows under moonlight 
Through the desert on a hot night 
And for a second there we'd won 
Yeah, we were innocent and young 
Cast out of the night, well you've got a foolish heart 
So you took your place 
But the fall from grace was the hardest part 
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back 
You run for cover 
But you can't escape the second attack 
Your soul was innocent 
She kissed him and she painted it black 
You should have seen your little face 
Burnin' for love 
Holdin on' for your life 
All that I wanted was a little touch 
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no 
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time 
Miss Atomic Bomb 
Making out we've got the radio on 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

We're taking chances on a hot night 
And for a second there we'd won 
Yeah we were innocent and young 
The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear 
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear 
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here 
Sweat on my skin 
And this love that I've cradled 
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb) 
But I'm standing here and you 're too late 
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate 
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back 
(It's so cruel) 
You run for cover 
But you can't escape the second attack 
(and you turn your back, you're so) 
Your soul was innocent 
she kissed him and she painted it black 
(On a losing game) 
You should have seen your little face 
Burning for love 
(Miss Atomic Bomb) 
Holdin' on for your life 
But you can't survive 
(All that I wanted was a little touch) 
When you want it all 
(A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much) 
There's another side

In the back, uh huh, I can't crack 
We're on top 
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh 
I can't fake, we're on top 
We're on top 
We bring the bump to the grind, uh huh 
I don't mind, we're on top 
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh 
I can't fake, we're on top 
We're on top 
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight 
So get your eyes off my bride tonight 
Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight 
It's like a cigarette in the mouth 
Or a handshake in the doorway 
I look at you and smile because I'm fine 
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight 
So get your eyes off my bride tonight 
Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight 
It's like a cigarette in the mouth 
Or a handshake in the doorway 
I look at you and smile because I'm fine</field>

I can lose my temper 
You can put up walls

It's like we're going blind 
Take the needle off the record 
I can't stand another chorus 
About Juliet's control 
Over mystified mankind 
But I can't get you out of my mind 
To get you out of my bed 
To get you out of my heart 
And my head 
(oh we're falling) 
(oh we're falling) 
I stormed the gates of Graceland 
To make you realize 
Went back with Springsteen 
You turned and rolled your eyes 
So I told you about Mccartney 
And that's a heavy name to drop 
You say you don't need confirmation 
But I don't know if I can stop 
Cause I can't get you out of my mind 
To get you out of my bed 
To get you out of my heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[verse 1] 
There's no one on the radar 
No creature in the grove 
No reason to be hateful 
Life is a treasure trove 
[chorus] 
And peace of mind is easy 
To find when the time is right 
Come away, come away, come away, come here 
Come, I'm callin', come 
[verse 2] 
We'll take a ship to cairo 
We'll find the gods, I'm told 
I heard the sun is blinding 
I hear the streets are gold 
We'll build a bridge to eden 
And then we'll burn it down 
We'll never leave, we'll never die 
We'll never turn around 
[chorus] 
Well peace of mind is easy to find 
When the time is right 
So come away, come away 
Come away, come here 
Come, I'm callin', come 
[bridge] 
Peace of mind, peace of mind 
When the time is right 
(when the time is right) 
When the time is right 
(when the time is right) 
Come away, come away, come away, come here 
Come, I'm callin', come 
Come away, come away, come away, come here 
Come, I'm callin', come 
[chorus] 
And peace of mind is easy to find 
When the time is right 
So come away, come away 
Come away, come here 
Come, I'm callin', come 
[verse 3] 
It's rattling my bones now 
It's rushing though my veins 
Everything we know is purpose 
There's no need to stay in chains 
You've got to learn to let go 
Just let go and I'll let it be 
And every fighter goes down 
Just slow down and turn the cheek 
[chorus] 
Because peace of mind 
Is easy to find when the time is right 
So come away, come away 
Come away, come here 
Come, I'm callin', come 
[outro] 
Peace of mind is easy to find 
When the time is right 
So come away, come away 
Come away, come here 
Come, I'm callin', come</field>

            <field name="lyrics">She's a pillar by the day, a fire by the night 
She's a famous architect, like Frank Lloyd Wright 
When it comes to tightrope walkin', she's world renowned 
Her elegance and charm are worthy of praise 
And I heard she used to throw for the Oakland A's 
She works 268 hours a week, I've yet to meet her match 
A marvel of modern science 
She's a natural born pioneer 
I can't make up my mind, 
Should I put her on display or hide her? 
I'm gonna be her prize fighter 
I know that she's out of my league 
I'm gonna be her prize fighter 
My uniform has been decreed 
She's a daughter of the gods, got a lot of clout 
If she's ever in a bind, I'll get her out 
And sometimes I have these nightmares, in the middle of the day 
Where a hay-makin' gypsy steals her away 
There ain't no doubt about it 
I'm a slave to her shade of love 
One day her majesty the Queen, unprovoked and unforeseen 
Is gonna fly her over to England, put that sword on her shoulder, 
And knight her! 
I'm gonna be her prize fighter 
No label's gonna change where she's from 
I'm gonna be her prize fighter 
And I'm dancin' to the beat of her drum 
She's always on my side, rich or poor 
And she's with me all the way to the Golden Door 
My lioness, my pièce de résistance 
My only way 
I'm gonna drive me an El Dorado 
The colour of her marbly eyes 
With twin bullet tail lights 
And plates that we desire 
I'm gonna be her prize fighter 
Though the weather may be foul 
I'm gonna be her prize fighter 
Though the wind and the wolves may howl 
(Prize fighter) 
Through the sunshine, through the rain 
I'm gonna be her prize fighter

Just tryin' to keep it in line 
You say you want to move on and 
You say I'm falling behind 
Can you read my mind? 
Can you read my mind? 
I never really gave up on 
Breakin' out of this two-star town 
I got the green light 
I got a little fight 
I'm going to turn this thing around 
Can you read my mind? 
Can you read my mind? 
The good old days 
The honest man 
The restless heart 
A promised land 
A subtle kiss 
That no one sees 
A broken wrist 
The big trapeize 
Oh well I don't mind 
If you don't mind 
'cause I don't shine 
If you don't shine 
Before you go 
Can you read my mind? 
It's funy how you just break down 
Waitin' on some sign 
I pull up to the front of your driveway 
The magic soakin' my spine 
Can you read my mind? 
Can you read my mind? 
The teenage queen 
The loaded gun 
The drop dead dream 
The chosen one 
A southern drawl (?) 
A world unseen 
A city wall 
And a trampoline 
Well I don't mind 
If you don't mind 
Coz I don't shine 
If you don't shine 
Before you jump 
Tell me what you find 
When you read my mind 
Slippin in my faith 
Until I fall 
You never returned that call 
Woman, open the door 
Don't let it stay 
I want to breathe that fire again 
She said 
"I don't mind 
If you don't mind 
Coz I don't shine 
If you don't shine" 
Put your back on me 
Put your back on me 
Put your back on me 
The stars are blazing 
Like rebel diamonds 
Cut out of the sun 
Can you read my mind?</field>

It doesn't matter cos 
You get what you want through and through 
And if you shatter everything that we've got 
Will you call me on occasion 
If you like it or not 
Oh no 
So turn it up, take me down from the wall 
Doesn't matter cos 
You get what you want after all 
And now you've shattered everything that we had 
And you call me on occasion 
Just to see how I am 
I'm hanging in 
But now time teaches me to pretend 
It doesn't matter cos 
You get what you want in the end 
And now you've shattered everything 
He looks a bit like me 
Replaceable 
It's cynical 
Call me useless, just you wait 
Put me down and call it fate 
Broken bridges, wasting me 
So just stand beside your man 
The boy ain't wrong 
Act like I never turned you on 
All I do is cry 
Cos you will find you're all alone 
You call me on the telephone 
Who'd have thought that you'd regret 
All those evil thing you said 
And now as friends we say goodbye 
I think there's something in my eye 
Replaceable 
It's cynical 
Call me useless, just you wait 
Put me down and call it fate 
Broken bridges, wasting me 
So just stand beside your man 
The boy ain't wrong 
Act like I never turned you on 
All I do is cry 
And you watched me die at least a thousand times 
But it's great to hear you're doing fine 
Tonight, too late to fight 
But you got inside this mighty head of mine 
Now time goes by 
You knew you would 
You knew you would

Laying everybody low, with a love song that he made 
Finds a street light, steps out of the shade 
Says something like, 'You and me babe, how about it?' 
Juliet says, 'Hey it's Romeo, 
you nearly gave me a heartattack' 
He's underneath the window, she's singing, 
'Hey now, my boyfriend's back 
You shouldn't come around here, 
singing up to people like that' 
Anyway, what you gonna do about it? 
Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start, 
And I bet, then you exploded into my heart, 
And I forget, I forget, the movie song 
When you gonna realize, 
it was just that the time was wrong,Juliet? 
Come up on different streets, 
they both were streets of shame, 
Both dirty, both mean, yes, 
and the dream was just the same, 
And I dreamed your dream for you, 
and now your dream is real 
How can you look at me 
as if I was just another one of your deals? 
When you can fall for chains of silver, 
you can fall for chains of gold 
You can fall for pretty strangers 
and the promises they hold 
You promised me everything, 
you promised me thick and thin, yeah 
Now you just say, 
'Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him' 
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry 
You said I love you like the stars above, 
I'll love you till I die 
There's a place for us, you know the movie song 
When you gonna realize, 
it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet? 
I can't do the talks, like they talk on the TV 
And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be 
I can't do everything, but I'll do anything for you 
I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you 
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be 
All I do is keep the beat, and bad company 
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme 
Juliet I'd do the stars with you, anytime 
Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry 
You said I love you like the stars above, 
I'll love you till I die 
There's a place for us, you know the movie song 
When you gonna realize, 
it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet? 
And a love struck Romeo, sings the streets a serenade, 
Laying everybody low, with a love song that he made 
Finds a convenient street light, steps out of the shade 
Says something like, 'You and me babe, how about it?'

But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore 
Yes it's true I'm not the man I used to be 
Oh Ruby, I still need some company 
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralised 
And won't settle needs of a woman your age, Ruby I realise 
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around 
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town 
She's leaving now cuz I've just heard the slammming of the door 
The way I know, I've heard it slam a hundred times before 
But if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground

Are your excuses any better than your senator's? 
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side 
He did her dirty but no-one died 
I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night 
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song 
He motioned me to the sky 
I heard heaven and thunder cry 
Run for cover 
Run while you can, baby, don't look back 
You gotta run for cover 
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man 
You know you're not the only one 
And don't look back, just run for cover 
What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology? 
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology 
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us 
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous 
I saw my mother on the street last night 
All pretty and strong, singing 'the road is long' 
I said 'Momma I know you've tried' 
But she fell on her knees and cried 
Run for cover 
Run while you can, baby, don't look back 
You gotta run for cover 
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man 
I know you're not the only one 
And don't look back, just run for cover 
And there was nothing she wouldn't give 
Just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams 
She's running, she's running 
Just to trust him 
He got a big smile, he's fake news 
Just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose 
Run for cover 
Run while you can, baby, don't look back

Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man

A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand 
I've been on a trail for a little while 
And that was the night that she broke down 
And held my hand 
The teenage rush, she said: 
Ain't we all just runaways? 
'Cuz we got time 
But that ain't much 
We can't wait 'till tomorrow 
You gotta know that this is real, baby 
Why you wanna fight it? 
It's the one thing you can choose 
We got engaged on a Friday night 
I swore on the head of our unborn child 
That I could take care of the three of us 
But I got the tendency to slip 
When the nights get wild 
It's in my blood 
She said she might just run away to somewhere else 
Some place good 
We can't wait 'till tomorrow 
You gotta know that this is real, baby

I knew it when I met you 
I'm not gonna let you run away 
I knew it when I held you 
I wasn't letting go 
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams 
Hold each other 'till the morning light 
We used to laugh now we only fight 
Baby, are you lonesome now? 
At night I come home after they go to sleep 
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt this house 
There's a picture of us on our wedding day 
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls 
We can't wait 'till tomorrow 
Now we're caught up in the appeal 
Baby, why you wanna hide it? 
It's the last thing on my mind 
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive 
And we're all just runaways

Can't keep my mind off of every little wrong

Hey, I won't blame you baby

I hope you understand 
That steadily reminds you 
Of who I really am 
This city's always breathing 
I wish that it would die 
The cracks and the bachelors 
The fever for the velvet rope 
The money from my mother's men 
I'm not like her, you're not like them

Is the answer to the question on your mind

As long as somebody takes me home, 
every now and then... 
Oh, have you ever seen the lights? 
Have you ever seen the lights? 
I took the shuttle on a shock-wave ride, 
where the people on the pen pull trigger for accolade 
I took a bullet, I looked inside 
Running through my veins 
An American masquerade 
I still remember Grandma Dixie's way, 
I never really known anybody to die before 
Red white and blue upon a birthday cake, 
And my brother, he was born on the fourth of the July...and that's all 
"So why do you waste my time?" 
Is the answer to the question on your mind

waiting for you 
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, 
searching for you 
I was moving through the silence without motion, 
waiting for you 
In a room without a window in the corner I found truth 
In the shadowplay acting out your own death, 
knowing no more 
As the assassins all grouped in four lines, 
dancing on the floor 
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies made a move to connect 
I could only stare in disbelief 
as the crowds all left 
I did everything, everything I wanted to 
I let them use you for their own ends 
To the center of the city in the night, waiting for you 
To the center of the city in the night, waiting for you</field>

The suffering of fools 
To find our way home 
To break in these bones

Give me a moment, some kind of mysterious 
Give me a shot at the night 
Give me a moment, some kind of mysterious 
Once in a lifetime 
The breaking of the roof 
To find that our home 
Has long been a throne 
Draw me a life line 
Cause honey I got nothing to lose 
Once in a lifetime 
Once in a lifetime 
Once in a lifetime 
Give me a shot at the night 
Give me a moment, some kind of mysterious 
Give me a shot at the night 
Give me a moment, some kind of mysterious 
Give me a shot at the night 
Look at my reflection in the mirror 
Underneath the power of the light 
Give me a shot at the night 
Give me a shot at the night 
Give me a shot at the night 
I feel like I'm losing the fight 
Give me a moment, some kind of mysterious 
Give me a shot at the night 
Give me a shot at the night 
Give me a moment, some kind of mysterious 
Give me a shot at the night

Ha 
I gotta tell ya 
I'll make it better 
But I know there's somethin' I needed to say 
When I was out, though 
Maybe you were better alone 
I know i'll make it home 
She told me sweet thing 
Run a labour 
In your shoes 
Touch me til I follow in love 
I wanna help her 
Maybe we were better alone 
I wanna show you how 
And then we walked out 
Make it made now 
I said I want it but I never alone 
I wanna show you 
Maybe we were somethin' uncool 
I wanna make you sing 
Uh uh oh 
Uh uh oh

In the house that I grew up in

Down the same streets that I did

Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game 
I'm breaking my back just to know your name 
But heaven ain't close in a place like this 
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss 
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this 
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this 
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight 
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight 
Well somebody told me 
You had a boyfriend 
Who looked like a girlfriend 
That I had in February of last year 
It's not confidential 
I've got potential 
Ready? Let's roll onto something new 
Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you 
I'm ready, let's roll onto something new

            <field name="lyrics">It started with a low light 
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed 
And then they took my blood type 
They left a strange impression in my head 
You know that I was hopin' 
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind 
But when they cut me open 
I guess I changed my mind 
And you know I might 
Have just flown too far from the floor this time 
'Cause they're calling me by my name 
And the zipping white light beams 
disregarding bombs and satellites 
That was the turning point, 
That was one lonely night 
The star maker says it ain't so bad 
The dream maker's gonna make you mad 
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down 
It's all in your mind" 
Well, now I'm back at home and- 
I'm looking forward to this life I live 
You know it's gonna haunt me 
So hesitation to this life I give 
You think you might cross over 
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea; 
You better look it over 
Before you make that leap! 
And you know I'm fine 
But I hear those voices at night sometimes 
They justify my claim 
And the public don't dwell on my transmission 
Cause it wasn't televised 
But it was the turning point 
Oh what a lonely night 
The star maker says it ain't so bad 
The dream maker's gonna make you mad 
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down! 
It's all in your mind" 
The star maker says it ain't so bad 
The dream maker's gonna make you mad 
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down 
It's all in your mind" 
My global position systems are vocally addressed 
They say the Nile used to run from East to West 
They say the Nile used to run from East to West 
I'm fine 
But I hear those voices at night 
Sometimes 
The star maker says it ain't so bad 
The dream maker's gonna make you mad 
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down 
It's all in your mind" 
The star maker says it ain't so bad 
The dream maker's gonna make you mad 
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down 
It's all in your mind" 
It's all in my mind 
It's all in my mind 
It's all in my mind 
It's all in my mind 
It's all in my mind 
It's all in my mind</field>

Get this weight off my shoulders 
I've carried it well 
Loose these shackles of pressure 
Shake me out of these chains 
Lead me not to temptation 
Hold my hand harder 
Ease my mind 
Roll down the smoke screen 
And open the sky 
Let me fly 
Then I need a release from 
This troublesome mind 
Fix my feet 
When they're stumbling 
And well you know it hurts sometimes 
You know it's going to bleed sometimes 
Dig me out from this thorn tree 
Help me bury my shame 
Keep my eyes from the fire 
They can't handle the flame 
Grace cut out from my brothers 
When most of them fell 
I carry it well 
Let me fly 
Then I need a release from 
This troublesome mind 
Fix my feet 
When they're stumbling 
I guess you know it hurts sometimes 
You know it's going to bleed sometimes 
Now hold on 
I'm not looking for sweet talk 
I'm looking for time 
Top a tower and sleep walk 
Brother, cause it hurts sometimes 
You know it's going to bleed sometimes 
Hold on 
You know it's going to hurt sometimes 
When you call me 
Hold on (x3) 
I'm gonna climb that symphony home 
And make it mine 
Let it's resonance 
Light my way 
See, all these pessimistic sufferers 
Tend to drag me down 
So I could use this to shelter

Soul Sister won't you take a ride in his car 
Late to call 
When you wanted to be all 
Baby baby don't be so shy 
Rock children hold your heads up high 
In the night while I try 
And tell the ballad of Valentine 
You got it bad, but you know it's true 
I caught up with a friend in Dallas 
We took a trip to New Orleans 
Those black-eyed ladies 
Won't say they're sorry 
We finally caught a train to Memphis 
Where everybody talks the same 
Those blue suede babies 
All know my name 
And I said hold tight 
Can't you see that it's hurting me 
But I've got the buzz 
Like Marlon Brando 
Michael Valentine, can't we unite? 
We ended up in North Dakota 
Although my heart's in Mexico 
(spanish language) My munecita 
Abren Tus Ojos 
With your new suit, and your black tie 
Hold on, you're just a gambling man, all proper like 
I broke to the right and I caught your eye 
Shut your mouth and wave goodbye 
Tonight, I ain't gonna let you rain on this parade 
And I said hold tight 
Can't you see that it's hurting me 
But I've got the buzz 
Like Marlon Brando 
Straight faced with misery tonight 
And I will not lie when I say I ain't cold no more 
But I've got the buzz 
Like Greta Garbo 
Walking forward to the sun 
And I've got a coattail left to ride 
Well uh oh

As Jesus sat at meat in the house 
Behold, many publicans and sinners came 
And sat down with him and his disciples 
And when the Pharisees saw this 
They said unto his disciples 
Why eateth your Master 
With publicans and senators? 
But when Jesus heard that 
He said unto them 
They that be whole need not a physician 
But they that are sick 
I walked into town 
With a message for my old man 
I've got the last two chapters of Matthew 
In my hand 
Steve painting houses while Bobby went 
And gone insane 
They buried my sister 
But daddy he stayed the same 
Follow the sun out of the night 
Brother, just lean into the light 
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight 
Brother, just lean into the light 
His hands still shake 
When the ponies break out on the track 
(Here comes the calling) 
His feet still quick 
When they say they want their money back 
(Here comes the calling) 
But Daddy did you think 
That you could outrun the Holy Ghost? 
(Here comes the calling) 
Lie, cheat, steal 
Hope they fix it all up in post 
The book will be open 
In front of the judge 
Unquenchable fire 
Or keys to the kingdom 
Follow the sun out of the night 
Brother, just lean into the light 
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight 
Brother, just lean into the light 
The road to the kingdom's burnin' bright 
Brother, just lean into the light 
You heard that the master was traveling through 
But what would you do if he walked in the room? 
Make for the left, or break for the right? 
Brother, just lean in 
Brother, just lean into the light 
Follow the sun out of the night 
Brother, just lean into the light 
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight 
Brother, just lean into the light 
The road to the kingdom's burnin' bright 
Brother, just lean into the light

            <field name="lyrics">Way out in North Nevada, where the Trukee's waters flow 
Where the cattle are "a-browzin'' and the Spanish ponies grow 
Where the Norther comes whistlin' from beyond the Neutral strip 
And the prairie dogs are sneezin' as if they had "the Grip" 
Where the coyotes come a-howlin' round the ranches after dark 
And the blue-birds are singin' to the lovely "medder lark" 
Where the big horns are grazin' and the lonely plovers call 
It was there that I attended "The Cowboys' Christmas Ball" 
The boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles 
The ladies "kinder scatterin'" had gathered in for miles 
The room was togged out gorgeous with mistletoe and shawls 
And candles flickered frescoes around the airy walls 
The "wimmin folks" looked lovely, the boys looked kinder treed 
Till their leader commenced yellin': "Hey, fellers, let's stampede" 
The music started sighin' and a-wailin' through the hall 
As a kind of introduction to "The Cowboys' Christmas Ball" 
The leader was a fellow that came from Swenson's Ranch 
They called him "Windy Billy," from "little Dead-man's Branch" 
His rig was "kinder keerless," big spurs and high-heeled boots 
He had the reputation that comes when "fellers shoots" 
His voice was like the bugle upon the mountain's height 
His feet were animated, an' a mighty movin' sight 
When he commenced to holler, "Neow, fellers, stake yer pen! 
Lock horns to all them heifers, an' russle 'em like men 
Saloot yer lovely critters; neow swing an' let 'em go 
Climb the grape vine round 'em, all hands do-ce-do! 
And Mavericks, jine the round-up, jest skip her waterfall" 
Huh! hit wuz gittin' happy, "The Cowboys' Christmas Ball!" 
Don't tell me 'bout cotillions, or germans 
No sir 'ee! 
That whirl at Carson City just takes the cake with me 
I'm sick of lazy shufflin's, of them I've had my fill 
Give me a fronteer breakdown, backed up by Wild Bill 
McAllister ain't nowhere! when Windy leads the show 
I've seen 'em both in harness, an' so I sorter know 
Oh, Bill, I sha'n't forget yer, and I'll oftentimes recall 
That lively-gaited sworray, "The Cowboys' Christmas Ball" 
Oh, Bill, I sha'n't forget yer, and I'll oftentimes recall

When it comes to Friday, I always earn 
Don't try to teach me, I got nothing to learn 
'Cause baby I'm gifted 
You see what I mean? 
Usda certified lean 
I'm the man, come round 
No-no-nothing can break

Are plated with gold 
Your heart's the right place 
But you traveled down the wrong road 
Like so many before you 
The gates open wide 
Here come the rising tide 
Let's go out tonight 
There's a mystery underneath the neon light 
Before life and the dream collide 
Cause the truth gonna come and cut me open wide 
And you can't escape the rising of the tide 
Keep up your appearance 
You're joining the choir 
With everybody singing out Glory, Hallelujah 
The time came for your solo 
But there was nowhere to hide 
Here come the rising tide 
And the company you keep 
Well, they plan your crucifixion as we speak 
So baby, 'till life and the dream collide 
There's gonna be a mystery underneath those neon lights 
If you can't decide for just who's on your side 
You and I escape the rising of the tide 
Can you tell me how was I deceived or in denial? 
I was there in the back of the room when you touched the fire 
With your pitchfork tongue 
You licked your lips and lied 
We're never gonna know how hard you cried 
When you petitioned and your access was denied 
'Till the venom in your veins is satisfied 
'Till you suffocate and swallow down your pride 
Where you can't escape (you can't escape) 
Where you can't escape (you can't escape) 
Where you can't escape the rising of the tide</field>

I carried the weight of our last fight 
Elvis singing "Don't be cruel" 
And I wonder if you feel it too 
It's like we're going under 
Somewhere outside the lonely esmeralda county line 
The question of my heart came to my mind 
If I go on 
With you by my side 
Can it be 
The way it was 
When we met 
Did you forget all about those golden nights? 
Maybe a thief stole your heart 
Or maybe we just drifted apart 
I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield 
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield 
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust 
That paradise is buried in the dust 
If I go on 
With you by my side 
Can it be 
The way it was 
When we met 
Did you forget all about those golden nights? 
All of our plans have fallen through 
Sometimes a dream, it don't come true 
Darling! Darling! 
(If we go on, can it be?) 
Can it be 
The way it was? 
When we met 
Did you forget all about them golden nights? 
If I go on 
With you by my side 
Can it be 
The way it was? 
My heart is true 
Girl, it's just you 
I'm thinking of 
Can it be the way it was? 
Maybe a thief stole your heart</field>

I feel myself get tired

Down 
There's no next time around 
A storm wasted its water on me 
And my heart was free 
I guess it's the world that we live in 
It's not too late for that 
This is the world that we live in

Take a number where the blood just barely dried 
Wait for something better 
No one behind you 
Watching your shadows 
This feeling won't go 
Crooked wheels keep tuning 
Children, are you learning 
Acclimatize, but don't you lose the plot 
A history of blisters 
Your brothers and your sisters 
Somewhere in the pages we forgot 
Take a number Jackie 
Where the blood just barely dried 
You know I'm on your side 
Wait for something better 
No one behind you 
Watching your shadows 
You gotta be stronger than the story 
Don't let it blind you 
Rivers of shadow 
This feeling wont go 
And the sky is full of dreams 
But you don't know how to fly 
I don't have a simple answer 
But I know that I could answer 
Something better 
This feeling won't go

On the beautiful ground 
I heard a story from the man in red 
He said the leaves are falling down 
Such a beautiful sound so 
I think you better go ahead 
But you always hold your head up high 
Cause it\'s a long, long, long way down 
This town was meant for passing through 
But it ain\'t nothing new 
Now go and show them 
That the world stayed round 
But it\'s a long, long, long way down 
You better run for the hills before they burn 
Listen to the sound of the world 
And watch it turn 
I just want to show you what I know 
And catch you when the current lets you go 
Or should I just get along with myself 
I never did get along with everybody else 
I\'ve been trying hard to do what\'s right 
But you know I could stay here all night 
And watch the clouds fall from the sky 
This river is wild 
This river is wild 
Run for the hills before they burn 
Listen to the sound of the world 
Watch it turn 
But shake a little 
Sometimes I\'m nervous when I talk 
I shake a little 
Sometimes i hate the line I walk 
I just want to show you what I know 
And catch you when the current lets you go 
Or should I just get along with myself 
I never did get along with everybody else 
Ive been trying hard to do whats right 
But you know I could stay here all night 
And watch the clouds fall 
From the sky 
Because this river is wild 
God speed you boy 
This river is wild 
Now Adam\'s taking bombs 
And he\'s stuck on his mom 
Because that bitch 
Keeps trying to make him pray 
He\'s with the hippie in the park 
Coming over the dark 
Just trying to get some of that little girl play 
You better run for the hills before they burn 
Listen to the sound of the world 
But watch it turn 
I just want to show you what I know 
And catch you when the current lets you go 
Or should I get along with myself 
I never did get along with everybody else 
I\'ve been trying hard to do whats right 
But you know I could stay here all night 
And watch the clouds fall from the sky 
And pay this hell in me tonight 
Because this river is wild 
God speed you boy 
This river is wild 
God speed you boy 
This river is wild 
Now the cards are everywhere face in dust 
The fairground 
I don\'t think I ever seen so many headlights 
But there\'s something pulling me 
The circus and the crew 
Well they\'re just passing through 
Making sure the merry still goes round 
But it\'s a long, long, long way down</field>

You say this life has given you nothing 
You got another thing coming

Tidal wave come rushing over me 
He'll get a warning sign to keep his distance 
From her old man, from her old man 
Now the story of forbidden love 
Has gotta make a stand 
So in the middle of the early morning 
They'll slip away, slip away 
And we know they'll do their best 
Somewhere in the golden west 
Oh yeah, and we'll watch them drive 
They're so alive

Wedding bells they begin easy 
Live it down, baby don't talk that much, 
Baby knows, but baby don't tease me. 
In the park we could go walking, 
Drowned in the dark or we could go sailing 
On the sea 
Always here, always on time 
Close call, was it love or was it just easy 
Money talks when people need shoes and socks, 
Steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me 
I was just sipping on something sweet 
I don't need political process 
I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door 
I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more 
See, I was thinking I lost my mind 
But it's been getting to me all this time 
And it don''t stop dragging me down 
Silently reflection turns my world to stone 
Patiently correction leaves us all alone 
And sometimes I'm a travel man 
But tonight this engine's failing 
I still hear the children playing 
Kick the can, kick the can, skip and blackjack 
Steal a car and ring a round-rosey 
Rock and roll, Candy Land, boogeyman 
Run away and give me your sneakers 
Acid rain, when Abel looked up at Cain 
We began the weeping and wailing 
A hurried high from pestilence, pills and pride, 
It is a shame, we could have gone sailing 
But heaven knows, 
Heaven knows everything 
Tranquilize 
I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door 
I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more 
See, I was thinking that I lost my mind

Silently reflection turns my world to stone 
Patiently correction leaves us all alone 
And sometimes I'm a travel man 
But tonight this engine's failing 
I still hear the children playing 
Dead beat dancers come to us and stay 
'Cause I don't care where you've been 
And I don't care what you've seen 
We're the ones who still believe 
And we're looking for a page 
In that lifeless book of hope 
Where a dream might help you cope 
With the Bushes and the bombs

I hear my mother calling my name 
I still come running but I ain't the same 
You can change the channel 
Take the phone off the hook 
Avoid the headline but you'll never grow up baby if you don't look 
When I saw him go down 
Felt like somebody lied 
I had to hold my breath till the coast was clear 
When I saw him go down 
Felt like somebody lied 
I had to close my eyes just to stop the tears 
You're used to winning, how did it feel? 
Did you hear the screaming? It was unreal 
What did they pay you? What did it cost? 
How long did it take you to know that you lost? 
You can hit the shower 
Fill the place up with steam 
And close the curtains 
But when you woke up, man, it wasn't no dream 
When I saw him go down 
Felt like somebody lied 
I had to hold my breath till the coast was clear 
When I saw him go down 
Felt like somebody lied 
I had to close my eyes, close my eyes 
Just to stop the tears 
Looking out the window out on the street 
My boy and his mother and I think of me 
I'm feeling the slip again, I don't wanna fall 
You said it was nothing 
But maybe you're wrong 
'Cause when I saw him go down 
Felt like somebody lied 
I had to hold my breath till the coast was clear 
When I saw him go down

You bury your treasure where it can't be found

The B*** is Back and Fleetwood Mac 
Take That, Bon Jovi 
And Green Day, I said some shit 
But that was the old me 
U2, Oasis, The Foos 
The Eagles, Madonna and Muse 
Metallica, Viva La Vida, AC DC, GnR 
George Michael stay away from cars 
'66 the winning team, Freddy Mercurie and Queen 
I can still hear Freddie sing 
Day oh 
Day oh 
Day oh 
Day oh 
After tonight you gonna put 
Another name in that list 
Mr 
Brightside had you scratching your heads 
When you heard we were from Vegas? 
But you were positive it was Sheffield or Camden 
But that didn't matter 
The seed was planted 
You took us in like your own 
Now we're bound by tradition 
My how we've grown 
From Dave's apartment to Wembley 
Singing 
I got a soul but I'm not a soldier 
Da da da da da 
And the decade disappeared like a sinking ship 
But we persevere, God give us hope 
But we still fear what we don't know 
The devil's water and the good old days 
Ain't we all just runaways? 
Day oh 
Day oh 
Day oh 
Day oh 
Day oh 
Day oh 
Day oh 
Day oh</field>

Many years from now 
Will you still be sending me a Valentine 
Birthday greetings bottle of wine? 
If I'd been out till quarter to three 
Would you lock the door? 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me 
When i'm sixty-four? 
You'll be older too 
And if you say the word 
I could stay with you 
I could be handy, mending a fuse 
When your lights have gone 
You can knit a sweater by the fireside 
Sunday mornings go for a ride 
Doing the garden, digging the weeds 
Who could ask for more? 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me 
When I'm sixty-four 
Every summer we can rent a cottage 
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear 
We shall scrimp and save 
Grandchildren on your knee 
Vera, Chuck and Dave 
Send me a postcard, drop me a line 
Stating point of view 
Indicate precisely what you mean to say 
Your's sincerely wasting away 
Give me your answer, fill in a form 
Mine for evermore 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me 
When I'm sixty-four?</field>

Waiting on some beautiful boy 
To save you from your old ways 
You play forgiveness 
Watch it now- here he comes 
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus 
But he talks like a gentlemen 
Like you imagined when you were young 
Can we climb this mountain 
I don't know 
Higher now than ever before 
I know we can make it if we take it slow 
Let's take it easy 
Easy now, watch it go 
We're burning down the highway skyline 
On the back of a hurricane that started turning 
When you were young 
When you were young 
And sometimes you close your eyes and see the place where you 
Used to live 
When you were young 
They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet 
You don't have to drink right now 
But you can dip your feet 
Every once in a little while 
You sit there in your heartache 
Waiting on some beautiful boy 
To save you from your old ways 
You play forgiveness 
Watch it now- here he comes 
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus

Like you imagined when you were young 
When you were young 
I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus 
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus

Without a good friend or no sunshine 
I know i want to buy hope,

Take me to the place where they run and play. 
My baby is gone, you might have a chance. 
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance. 
They hug in silence, 
As the sun sets. 
On their empty street, 
Their suspicions where they rise and hide. 
And then who sweeps them off she doesn't leave. 
She walks inside him, 
Pours a strong one. 
Put her mind at ease. 
It's the calm before another storm. 
And the friendship’s from the whiskey to the keys. 
Take me to the place where the white boys dance. 
Take me to the place where they run and play. 
My baby is gone, you might have a chance.

Her heart is racing. 
She phones a friend to say: 
I'm in an awful place. 
That fool’s been messin' round on me 
I've seen it in his eyes and on his face 
Hold on a minute. 
You're talking crazy. 
Don't be that jealous girl. 
Just telephone you need an hour or two. 
Cause we're gonna go and change somebodies word. 
Take me to the place where the white boys dance. 
Take me to the place where they run and play.

Back up your mind, there is a call

All this time

White demon, where's your selfish kiss? 
White demon sorrow will arrange 
Let's not forget about the fear 
Black invitation to this place that cannot change 
While strangely holy, come for a rain 
(darling) 
White demon, widen your heart's scope 
White demon, who let your friends go? 
White demon, widen your heart's scope 
White demon, who let your friends go? 
Let us be in love 
(let us be in love) 
Let's do old and grey 
(let's do old and grey) 
I won't make you cry 
(I won't make you cry) 
I will never stray 
(I will never stray) 
I will do my part

But you ain't got nothing I never had 
So let's take it slow 
Who let you go? Who let you go? 
Who let you go? Who let you go? 
Someone must have loved you 
Not the way that I do... 
You're missing what I'm trying to say 
Ain't nothing getting in my way 
So tell me that's fantastic 
And promise me, you'll always sigh 
I find it so romantic 
When you look into my beautiful eyes 
And lose control 
Who let you go? Who let you go? 
Who let you go? Who let you go? 
Who let you go? Who let you go? 
Who let you go? Who let you go? 
I don't know what it means 
But I've been wondering 
Who let you go?

It makes me wanna say...

            <field name="lyrics">There's a plane and I am flying. 
There's a mountain waiting for me. 
Oh these years have been so trying, 
I don't know if I can use them. 
Am I strong enough to be the one? 
Will I live to have some children? 
Help me get down, I can make it. 
Help me get down. 
Help me get down, I can make it. 
Help me get down. 
If I only knew the answer, I wouldn't be bothering you. 
Father, help me get down, I can make it. 
Help me get down. 
Help me get down, I can make it 
Help me get down. 
If I only knew the answer, and if all our days are numbered, 
Then why do I keep counting? 
My sugar's sweet, and so obtainable. 
This behavior's so unexplainable. 
The days just slip and slide like they always did. 
The trouble is my head won't let me forget. 
I took one last good look around. 
(So many unusual sounds.) 
I gotta get my feet on the ground. 
Help me get down, I can make it. 
Ahhh  
. 
Help me get down, I can make it. 
Help me get down. 
Help me get down, I can make it. 
Help me get down. 
If I only knew the answer, 
I wouldn't be bothering you. 
Father, help me get down, I can make it. 
Help me get down. 
Help me get down, I can make it. 
Help me get down. 
If I only knew the answer, and if all our days are numbered  
. 
Would you help me get down? 
If I only knew the answer. 
If I change my way of living, 
And if I pave my streets with good times, 
Will the mountain keep on giving? 
And if all of our days are numbered, 
Then why do I keep counting?</field>

And then siphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself? 
Then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me so 
Why don't you find out for yourself? 
Sick down to my heart 
Well that's just the way it goes 
Some men here, 
They know the full extent of your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say: 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself? 
Then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass 
Backseats come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And what do you do? 
Well, you just sit there 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many, many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes</field>

I'll crush every doubt and every fear 
Clothesline the shame and you will answer to the rain 
Wonderful wonderful, wonderful wonderful

Don't stress, don't stress 
No one knows what goes on in our heads (our heads) 
We are invisible to the rest (the rest) 
They don't know nothing 'bout what we have (we have) 
'Cause everyone's living in black and white 
But we see each other in a different light 
Infra-red! 
I know that you're burning out for me 
Fire in your bloodstream 
Moving through you at light-speed 
I see you, I see you 
In infra-red! 
The key to the light in the way you move 
Like nobody else is in the room 
I see you, I see you 
It's okay, okay 
They won't understand us anyway, no 
You and I are on a different wave 
So, doesn't even matter what they say (no) 
'Cause everyone's living in black and white 
But we see each other in a different light 
Infra-red! 
I know that you're burning out for me 
Fire in your bloodstream 
Moving through you at light-speed 
I see you, I see you 
In infra-red! 
The key to the light in the way you move 
Like nobody else is in the room 
I see you, I see you 
'Cause everyone's living in black and white 
But we see each other in a different light 
That's why I look at you like I do 
Like nobody else is even in the room 
(We see each other in a different light) 
Infra-red! 
I know that you're burning out for me 
Fire in your bloodstream 
Moving through you at light-speed 
I see you, I see you 
In infra-red! 
The key to the light in the way you move 
Like nobody else is in the room 
If you fall into me, I fall into you 
I see you, I see you</field>

Run away 
Run away 
I only wanna disappear 
Far from here 
Away from everyone 
Before I come undone 
The time has come 
The time has come 
So here I go 
Left right left 
Right left wrong 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I just keep moving on 
Moving on 
Moving on 
I've been thinking about it 
Too much doubt in 
All of these feelings 
Too many reasons to run 
The time has come 
The time has come 
So here I go 
Left right left 
Right left wrong 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I just keep moving on 
Left right left 
Right left wrong 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I just keep moving on 
I put my head down keep running away from it 
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this 
I need to get away before it pulls me here 
And I'm never ever getting close to anyone again 
I put my head down keep running away from it 
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this 
I need to get away before it pulls me here 
I'm never ever getting close to anyone again 
And I don't even know where I'm going to 
But I don't want any motherfuckin' part of you 
I've been waiting for this moment for way too long 
I don't know where I'm going but I just keep moving on 
Left right left 
Right left wrong 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I just keep moving on

I hear it all, trying to fall asleep 
When all the loved around you is dying 
How do you stay so strong? 
How did you hide it all for so long? 
How can I take the pain away? 
How can I save 
A fallen angel, in the dark 
Never thought you'd fall so far 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
Fallen angel 
You do it all for my own protection 
You make me feel like I'll be okay 
Still I have so many questions 
How do you stay so strong? 
How did you hide it all for so long? 
How can I take the pain away? 
How can I save 
A fallen angel, in the dark 
Never thought you'd fall so far 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
Fallen angel, just let go 
You don't have to be alone 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
I was right beside you 
When you went to hell and back again 
I was right beside you 
When you went to hell and back again 
And I, I can save, a fallen angel 
A fallen angel, in the dark 
Never thought you'd fall so far 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
Fallen angel, just let go 
You don't have to be alone 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight

Living in a shell with no soul, since you've gone away 
Living in a world so cold, counting the days

Do you ever look deep down inside 
Staring at yourself, paralyzed

You always thought that I left myself open, 
But you didn`t know that I was already broken, 
I told myself that it wouldn`t be so bad, 
Your pulled it away and took everything I had.

I wish I knew what it was like 
To care about what's right or wrong 
I wish someone could help me find 
Find a place where I belong, but 
I am machine 
I never sleep 
I keep my eyes wide open 
I am machine 
A part of me 
Wishes I could just feel something 
I am machine 
I never sleep 
Until I fix what's broken 
I am machine 
A part of me 
Wishes I could just feel something 
It wasn't supposed to be this way 
We were meant to feel the pain 
I don't like what I am becoming 
Wish I could just feel something 
I am machine 
I never sleep 
I keep my eyes wide open 
I am machine 
A part of me 
Wishes I could just feel something 
I am machine 
I never sleep 
Until I fix what's broken 
I am machine 
A part of me 
Wishes I could just feel something</field>

I'll be coming home 
Just to be alone 
'Cause I know you're not there 
And I know that you don't care 
I can hardly wait to leave this place 
No matter how hard I try 
You're never satisfied 
This is not a home, I think I'm 
Better off alone 
You always disappear 
Even when you're here 
This is not my home, I think 
I'm better off alone 
Home, home, this house is not a... 
Home, home, this house is not a... 
Home 
By the time you come home 
I'm already stoned 
You turn off the tv 
And you scream at me 
I can hardly wait 
Until you get off my case 
No matter how hard I try 
You're never satisfied 
This is not a home 
I think I'm better off alone 
You always disappear 
Even when you're here 
This is not my home 
I think I'm better off alone 
 
Home, home, 
This house is not a... 
Home, home 
This house is not a home 
 
Oh I wish I would've met you 
But now it's a little slow 
What you could have taugh me 
I would save some face 
You'd fight and you're right but they're all just too strong 
They'd stick in your face and let you smell what they considered wrong 
That's why I say hey man nice, nice shot 
What a good shot man (x2) 
A man 
Has gun 
Hey man 
Have fun 
Nice shot (x2) 
Detroit michigaaaaan 
Nice shot Man 
What a good shooooot maaaaaaan.... 
 
- What? Oh I know.. 
What? You gotta be kidding man! You know.. 
you know I tried right? At least gimme that, that I tried! Sometimes.. 
maybe... 
- No! No you don't try! You sit around here on your lazy ass, you don't do a fucking thing around here! 
- Oh I know I'm better.. 
I know I can be.. 
I know I'm better.. 
I know.. 
I know.. 
I know.. 
I'M BETTER OFF ALONE 
No matter how hard I try 
You're never satisfied 
This is not a home 
I think I'm better off alone 
You always disappear 
Even when you're here 
This is not my home

I'm not always hiding 
Come all the way down 
And watch me burn 
I won't let it show that 
I'm not always flying 
So on the way down 
I'll watch you burn 
So let me know just how to take this 
'Cause you're way too cold 
Now show me how before it breaks me 
Did you come here to watch me? watch me burn 
I'll let it show that 
I'm not always hiding 
Come all the way down 
And watch me burn 
I won't let it show that 
I'm not always flying 
So on the way down

Noooooo,

You're wicked with the clutch 
Happened so fast and it hurt so much 
You're a car crash, and I can't look away 
I should've known by now 
I'm still not afraid 
I'll do it to myself though it's what I never what I say 
You're a car crash, and I can't look away 
All I see is shattered glass and red lights passing 
my life flashing 
Heading for the same disaster 
Faster and faster and faster 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
Stop at the red light 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
You're a car crash, and I can't look away 
I came along for the ride 
You're wicked with the clutch 
Happened so fast and it hurt so much 
You're a car crash, and I can't look away

Heading for the same disaster 
Faster and faster and faster 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
The red light 
Stop at the red light 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
You're just like a car crash, and I can't look away 
From the headlights, the red lights 
Stop at the red light 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
You're just like a car crash, and I can't look away

And all I see is shattered glass and red lights passing

Is a chalk outline 
I've been cold 
In the crypt 
But not as cold as the words 
Across your lips 
You'll be sorry baby 
Someday 
When you reach across the bed 
Where my body used to lay 
You left me here 
Like a chalk outline 
On the sidewalk 
Waiting for the rain to

I only ever see you on wednesdays

I'm going off the deep end 
I miss the way it used to be

            <field name="lyrics">Baby, innocent one day gonna be decadent. 
Prom queen, Miss America, in the backseat, in a pair of cuffs. 
Sixteen little runaways from the five-o, it got away. 
From a small town with no scene, 
Looking for a shot on the big street. 
Expectations, 
Go to hell. 
Expectations, 
Go to hell. 
Not so innocent, on the street hustling. 
Never be Miss America in the backseat of a stolen car. 
Crashing with a deadbeat, living large on a love seat. 
In a small town, no scene, 
Turns out it was nothing but a pipe dream. 
Expectations, 
Go to hell. 
Expectations, 
Go to hell. 
Rich girl, wannabe, 
Bought a quick pick for the lottery. 
Watching TV with her boyfriend, 
Fell asleep, left the ticket on the nightstand. 
He stayed awake to see the ball drop, 
Turned it way down, she never woke up. 
Grabbed the keys to her car and the back lock, 
Threw a shot of Jack back, left with the jackpot. 
Expectations, 
Go to hell. 
(Prom queen, Miss America, in the backseat in America.) 
Expectations, 
Go to hell. 
(Never be Miss America in the backseat in America.)</field>

I hear it all, trying to fall asleep 
When all the loved around you is dying 
How do you stay so strong? 
How did you hide it all for so long? 
How can I take the pain away? 
How can I save 
A fallen angel, in the dark 
Never thought you'd fall so far 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
Fallen angel 
You do it all for my own protection 
You make me feel like I'll be okay 
Still I have so many questions 
How do you stay so strong? 
How did you hide it all for so long? 
How can I take the pain away? 
How can I save 
A fallen angel, in the dark 
Never thought you'd fall so far 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
Fallen angel, just let go 
You don't have to be alone 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
I was right beside you 
When you went to hell and back again 
I was right beside you 
When you went to hell and back again 
And I, I can save, a fallen angel 
A fallen angel, in the dark 
Never thought you'd fall so far 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
Fallen angel, just let go 
You don't have to be alone 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight

If you want to get out alive 
Oooh run for your life

Oooh run for your life 
This is my last time she said 
As she faded away 
It's hard to imagine 
But one day you'll end up like me 
Then she said 
If you want to get out alive 
Oooh run for your life

If you want to get out alive (If you want to get out alive) 
Oooh run for your life (Life)

Till I'm burning on the inside 
If I go I can only hope 
That I make it to the other side 
If you want to get out alive 
Oooh run for your life 
If you want to get out alive 
Oooh run for

Love is a feeling 
Give me what I wanted 
‘Cause I'm on fire 
Quench my desire 
Give me what I wanted 
Talk to me woman 
Give in to me 
Give in to me 
You always knew just how to make me cry 
And never did I ask you questions why 
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me 
Don't try to understand me 
‘Cause your words just are working off 
Love is a feeling 
Quench my desire 
Give me what I wanted 
Take me higher 
If love is a woman 
I don't wanna hear it 
Give in to me 
Give in to me 
You and your friends would love to hang me until 
When it's ok 
It's ok 
You won't be laughing girl when I'm not around 
I'll be ok

Get drunk and fucking fight 
Until the morning comes I'll

behind everyone lies somewhere 
You're taking it slowly but 
frankly I don't care 
about little things that mean so much 
a drop from the sky, 
a stonecold hand touch, 
everywhere I go isn't clean 
I can't dream 
And I hate it when he won't let you in 
And I wonder when you'll be back again 
It's like you said a while ago 
'Switch the shoes and you won't change' 
You're taking it slowly 
but frankly I don't care 
about petty things that mean so much 
a drop from the sky, 
a coldstone hand touch, 
and everywhere I go isn't clean 
I can't dream 
And you hate it when he won't let you in 
And I wonder if you'll be back again 
And I fly and I fly far away from here 
So goodbye, say goodbye, i'll fly away 
And I hate it when he won't let you in 
And I wonder when you'll be back again</field>

To find a place where I belong, but

Wishes I could just feel something 
I am machine

Until I fix what's broken 
I am machine

Taking it for granted 
The highs and lows of living 
To getting second chances

To care about what's right or wrong 
I wish someone could help me find 
Find a place where I belong, but

Passing out and falling down 
To greet a day 
When I can see two feet in front of me 
To be free of life 
If we can stand out in the rain 
It's a great old time 
For you to wonder why you are here 
To be free of life 
If we can stay 
It's not resolving 
In all these words 
The same 
Congruent 
And it's not the strong in 
In my man's hand 
That weighs 
Me down 
Strangely thought to all the things 
Passing out and falling down 
To greet a day 
When I can see two feet in front of me 
To be free of life 
If we can stand out in the rain 
There's a great old time 
For you to wonder why you are here 
To try to greet a greater life 
If we can stay 
Strange thought to mourn the flies 
Passing out and falling down 
To greet a day 
When I can see two feet in front of me 
To be free of life 
If we can stand out in the rain

I swear I never meant to let it die 
I just don't care about you anymore 
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try 
I just don't care about you anymore 
We had time on our side 
In the beginning we 
We had nothing to hide 
In the beginning you 
You blame me but 
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try

Cause life starts now. 
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow 
And you're so far down 
But you will survive it somehow because life starts now. 
I hate to see you fall down 
I'll pick you up off of the ground 
I've watched the weight of your world come down 
And now it`s your chance to move on 
Change the way you've lived for so long 
You find the strength you've had inside all along. 
Cause life starts now. 
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow 
And you're so far down 
But you will survive it somehow because life starts now. 
All this pain 
Take this life and make it yours. 
All this hate 
Take your heart and let it love again. 
You will survive it somehow. 
Life starts now. 
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow 
And you're so far down. 
Life starts now.

And you always knew that it wouldn`t be easy, 
To go back to start to see where it all began, 
Or end up at the bottom to watch how it all ends, 
You tried to lie and say I was everything, 
I remember when I said I'm nothing without you. 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you, 
Let me inside, 
Let me get close to you, 
Change your mind, 
I'll get lost if you want me to, 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you. 
You always thought that I left myself open, 
But you didn`t know that I was already broken, 
I told myself that it wouldn`t be so bad, 
Your pulled it away and took everything I had. 
You tried to lie and say I was everything, 
I remember when I said I'm nothing without you. 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you, 
Let me inside, 
Let me get close to you, 
Change your mind, 
I'll get lost if you want me to, 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you, 
In you. 
The pain of it all, 
The rise and the fall, 
I see it all in you, 
Now everyday, 
I find myself say, 
I want to get lost in you. 
Im nothing without you. 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you, 
Let me inside, 
Let me get close to you, 
Change your mind, 
I'll get lost if you want me to, 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you. 
A way to get lost in you.</field>

Is so much better than this 
I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess 
I'm sick of wondering 
Is it life or death? 
We are the ones 
We get knocked down 
We get back up and stand above the crowd 
We are one 
We are the ones 
We get knocked down 
We get back up and stand above the crowd 
We are one 
We stand above the crowd 
We stand above the crowd 
We stand above the crowd (Crowd) 
(We stand) We stand above the crowd 
We stand above the crowd (We Stand) 
We stand above the crowd 
(We are the ones) We stand above the crowd 
(We get knocked down get back up) We stand above the crowd 
(We are the ones) We stand above the crowd 
(We get knocked down get back up) We stand above the crowd 
We stand above the crowd 
We stand above the crowd 
We stand above the crowd</field>

Only come around when you know that I need it. 
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding, 
But you're the only one who brings out the demon. 
Like pills you make me righteous 
Like I can rise above it all 
Like pills you leave me lifeless 
Shaken in a bathroom stall 
Why you wanna do this? 
Don't want to see you in my fall... 
Leave me alone. 
I know how you're operating, 
Only come around when you know that I need it. 
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding, 
You're the only one who brings out the demon 
You bring it out. 
You bring it out. 
Like pills you grab a hold of me 
One hit just makes me want you more 
Until we're in a motel room 
Locked up behind closed doors 
Why you wanna do this? 
Don't want to see you in my fall 
Leave me alone 
I know how you're operating 
Only come around when you know that I need it 
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding 
You are the only one who brings out the demon 
You bring it out 
You bring it out 
You're doing it now 
You're doing it now 
You're doing it now 
It used to be... 
You brought out the best in me. 
Now it seems... 
You bring out the beast in me. 
I know how you're operating, 
Only come around when you know that I need it. 
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding, 
You are the only one who brings out the demon. 
You bring it out. 
(You bring it out.) 
You bring it out. 
(You bring it out.) 
You bring it out!

You made it 
You played it 
Your shit is overrated 
Your shit is over 
Used up and Jaded 
You're thinking way too slow 
So we're creating answers 
On our own 
We can't relate 
To what you think you know 
And you create 
The problems that will never 
Go away...

Run away 
Run away 
I only wanna disappear 
Far from here 
Away from everyone 
Before I come undone 
The time has come 
The time has come 
So here I go 
Left right left 
Right left wrong 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I just keep moving on 
Moving on 
Moving on 
I've been thinking about it 
Too much doubt in 
All of these feelings 
Too many reasons to run 
The time has come 
The time has come 
So here I go 
Left right left 
Right left wrong 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I just keep moving on 
Left right left 
Right left wrong 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I just keep moving on 
I put my head down keep running away from it 
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this 
I need to get away before it pulls me here 
And I'm never ever getting close to anyone again 
I put my head down keep running away from it 
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this 
I need to get away before it pulls me here 
I'm never ever getting close to anyone again 
And I don't even know where I'm going to 
But I don't want any motherfuckin' part of you 
I've been waiting for this moment for way too long 
I don't know where I'm going but I just keep moving on 
Left right left 
Right left wrong 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I just keep moving on 
Left right left 
Right left wrong 
I don't know where I'm going

I swear this time it won't turn out 
The same 'cause now i've got myself to blame 
And you'll know where we'll end up 
On the streets that is easy enough 
To find someone who looks down on you 
Why is it so hard to find someone

It's like I'm always 
getting blood on my hands 
All it takes is one and I'm gone 
And a thousand till the end 
How'd I wind up here again? 
You take me to the edge 
You push me to far 
You watch me slip away 
Holding on to hard 
Tell me why does everything 
That I love get taken away from me? 
Why does everything that 
I love get taken away? 
You take me to the edge 
You push me to far 
You watch me slip away 
Holding on to hard 
Tell me why does everything 
That I love get taken away from me? 
How come nothing ever lasts? 
It goes from good to bad to worse, so fast. 
All it takes is one and 
I'm gone and I can't erase the past 
How come nothing ever lasts? 
You take me to the edge 
You push me to far 
You watch me slip away 
Holding on to hard 
Tell me why does everything 
That I love get taken away from me? 
Why does everything

You take me to the edge 
You push me to far 
You watch me slip away 
Holding on to hard 
Tell me why does everything

Here I am alone again 
Alone again 
Here I am alone again 
How come nothing ever lasts? 
It goes from good to bad to worse so fast 
Tell me why does everything

Why does everything that I love get taken away? 
You take me to the edge.

You watch me slip away. 
Holding on to hard.

That changes in my chemistry 
The atmosphere, the way I breathe 
My automatic action is 
To close my eyes and wander in 
And wait until the madness ends 
Lost communication with the world outside 
I fall into my own, into the abyss 
Lost inside my head, I open up the door 
Step right off the ledge, into the abyss 
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say 
Am I already dead, into the abyss 
Looking through distorted eyes 
A mirror that I can't recognize 
No way out, no exit signs 
I try to make myself believe 
I'm only in a lucid dream 
It's like another world exists 
I wanna go back into the abyss 
Lost inside my head, I open up the door 
Step right off the ledge, into the abyss 
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say 
Am I already dead, into the abyss 
Lost communication with the world outside 
So much devastation in my world I hide 
I fall into my own, into the abyss 
Lost inside my head 
cracks across the floor 
Step right off the ledge 
Into the abyss 
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say 
Am I already dead, into the abyss</field>

Bleeding on the inside. 
I told you I was lost 
In the middle of my life. 
These times I stayed alive for you. 
These times I would have died for you. 
These times it didn't matter at all. 
Will you help me find the right way up 
Or let me take the wrong way down? 
Will you straight me out 
Or make me take the long way around? 
I took the low road in, 
I'll take the high road out. 
I'll do whatever it takes to be a mistake you can't live without. 
Standing in the dark 
I can see your shadow, 
You're the only light 
That's breaking through the window. 
These times I stayed alive for you. 
These times I would have died for you. 
These times it didn't matter at all. 
Will you help me find the right way up 
Or let me take the wrong way down?

I'll do whatever it takes to be a mistake you can't live without. 
I'm not gonna give it away, 
I couldn't let it go just to wake up someday. 
Gone, gone. 
The worst part is looking back and knowing that 
I was wrong. 
Will you help me find the right way up 
Or let me take the wrong way down? 
Will you straight me out 
Or make me take the long way around? 
I took the low road in,

            <field name="lyrics">Every day I'm just surviving 
Keep climbing the mountain 
Even when I feel like dying 
Keep climbing the mountain 
Another night I'm barely holding on 
One step away from being dead and gone 
In my life to die another day 
Is this life that I've been living? 
All that's meant for me? 
Every day I'm just surviving 
Keep climbing the mountain 
Even when I feel like dying 
Keep climbing the mountain 
Every time I think 
I'm over it 
I wake up in the bottom 
of it all again 
I'm still surviving 
Keep climbing 
keep climbing 
The mountain 
The higher I go the harder I fall 
So I don't look down 
I don't look back at all 
And when I wish 
it all would turn to black 
I try to see the light 
and push the darkness back 
Every day I'm just surviving 
Keep climbing the mountain 
Even when I feel like dying 
Keep climbing the mountain 
Every time I think 
I'm over it 
I wake up in the bottom 
of it all again 
I'm still surviving 
Keep climbing 
keep climbing 
The mountain 
So If I'm numb 
already too far gone 
And If I feel a pulsing 
I keep carry on 
When I'm lost 
and want to fade away 
I tell myself to live 
to die another day 
Every day I'm just surviving 
Keep climbing the mountain 
Even when I feel like dying 
Keep climbing the mountain 
Every time I think 
I'm over it 
I wake up in the bottom 
of it all again 
I'm still aliving 
Keep climbing 
keep climbing 
The mountain

Out on the street, all the people walk by 
Nobody cares who gets pushed aside 
As long as it's not gonna fuck with their own lives 
Yeah we're all a little guilty but the vanity 
Who we are and who we can't afford to be 
Trying so hard to get the attention 
Who's looking now is the burning question 
Somebody special has a van sticker family 
Somebody special took a trip last year 
Somebody special drives a Maserati 
Everyone's just trying to be somebody 
Everyone's just trying to be somebody 
Yeah we're all a little stunned by reality 
What it is and what it's never going to be 
Living everyday redundantly 
Sounds like textbook insanity 
Somebody special has a van sticker family 
Somebody special took a trip last year 
Somebody special drives a Maserati 
Everyone's just trying to be somebody 
Everyone's just trying to be somebody 
Somebody special is a gangster wannabe 
Somebody special turned a trick last year 
Somebody special loves the paparazzi 
Everyone's just trying to be somebody 
Is this the new real? 
(Is this the new real?) 
Is this the new real?

When nobody cares about each other, how they feel

Somebody special has a van sticker family 
Somebody special took a trip last year 
Somebody special drives a Maserati

Somebody special just lives in fear 
Somebody special is in love with molly 
Everyone's just trying to be somebody

'Cause you know I'm the only one who knows 
what you need 
You want me, to be guilty, to be the one who's wrong 
So easy to blame me, it's been that way for so long 
Go on, go on and hurt the one that you love 
Go on and make me the one 
that you wanna hate if it makes you feel better 
Go on, go on and give me the best that you've got 
Go on and make me the villain I'm not 
If it makes you feel better 
I know no one's ever been there for you 
And I know that you think I'm only gonna hurt you too 
So you accuse me that I'm guilty 
Like you want it all to go wrong 
So easy to blame me, it's been that way for so long 
Go on, go on and hurt the one that you love 
Go on and make me the one 
that you wanna hate if it makes you feel better 
Go on, go on and give me the best that you've got 
Go on and make me the villain I'm not 
If it makes you feel better 
I'd take the blame for you 
Carry the weight for you 
Tell me would you do the same for me? 
(I don't think so) 
Go on, go on and give me the best that you've got 
Go on and make me the villain I'm not 
If it makes you feel better 
Go on, go on and give me the best that you've got 
Go on and make me the villain I'm not 
If it makes you feel better 
I'd take the blame for you 
Carry the weight for you 
Tell me would you do the same for me?

Living with myself, nothing but lies 
I always thought I'd make it 
But never knew I'd let it get so bad 
Living with myself is all I have 
I feel numb 
I can't come to life 
I feel like I'm frozen in time 
Living in a world so cold, wasting away 
Living in a shell with no soul, since you've gone away 
Living in a world so cold, counting the days 
Since you've gone away, you've gone away. 
Do you ever feel me? 
Do you ever look deep down inside 
Staring at yourself, paralyzed 
I feel numb 
I can't come to life 
I feel like I'm frozen in time 
Living in a world so cold, wasting away 
Living in a shell with no soul, since you've gone away 
Living in a world so cold, counting the days 
Since you've gone away, you've gonne away from me 
I'm too young (I'm too young) 
To lose my soul 
I'm too young (I'm too young) 
To feel this old 
So alone (So alone) 
I'm left behind 
I feel like I'm losing my mind

Do you ever looked deep down inside 
Staring at your life, paralyzed)

When the moon is bleeding red 
Woke up stoned in the backseat 
From a dream where my teeth fell out 
Of my head 
Cut it up, cut it up, yeah 
Everybody's on something here 
My godsend chemical best friend 
Skeleton whispering in my ear 
Walk with me to the end 
Stare with me into the abyss 
Do you feel like letting go? 
I wonder how far down it is 
Nothing is fun 
Not like before 
You don't get me high anymore 
Used to take one 
Now it takes four 
You don't get me high anymore 
Runnin' through emergency rooms 
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans 
My handshake, cellophane, landscape 
Mannequin fakin' it the best that I can 
It's cadillac, cadillac red 
No hands on the steering wheel 
I'm crashing this save-a-ho puppet show 
Ufo obliterate the way that I feel 
Walk with me to the end 
Stare with me into the abyss 
Do you feel like letting go? 
I wonder how far down it is 
Nothing is fun 
Not like before 
You don't get me high anymore 
Used to take one 
Now it takes four 
You don't get me high anymore 
You don't get me high anymore 
You don't get me high anymore 
Walk with me to the end 
Stare with me into the abyss 
Do you feel like letting go? 
I wonder how far down it is 
Nothing is fun 
Not like before 
You don't get me high anymore 
Used to take one

You don't get me high anymore

Sorry I'm not there 
But all my favorite friends 
Vanished, in the air 
It's hard to fly when you can't even run 
Once I had the world, but now I've got no one 
 
If I needed someone to control me 
If I need someone to hold me down 
I would change my direction 
And save myself before I, 
If I needed someone to control me 
If I needed someone to push me around 
I would change my direction and save myself before I, drown 
 
Good morning day 
Sorry you're not here 
But all those times before 
Were never this unclear 
It's hard to walk when you can't even crawl 
Once I had this world, but now I've lost it all 
 
If I needed someone to control me 
If I need someone to hold me down 
I would change my direction 
And save myself before I 
If I needed someone to control me 
If I needed someone to push me around 
I would change my direction and save myself before I 
 
Drown, rolling faster then I'm breathing 
Drown, rolling faster then I'm breathing 
Drown, rolling faster then I'm breathing

I've done my share of waiting

So I wait for you to 
Take me all the way 
 
Seems you're wanting me to stay 
But my dreams would surely waste away 
I still have no where to go 
So I wait 
 
Push me under 
Pull me further 
Take me all the way 
Take me all the way 
 
Now it seems you're leaving 
But we've only just begun 
And you've still got nowhere left to go 
 
So I wait for you to 
Take me all the way 
 
Push me under 
Pull me further 
Take me all the way 
Take me all the way 
 
And I've been waiting so long 
 
So I wait for you to

Run for your life

As she faded away 
It's hard to imagine

Oh oh run for your life

That you're gone forever 
 
Now things are coming clear 
And I don't need you here 
And in this world around me 
I'm glad you disappeared 
So I'll stay out all night 
Get drunk and fucking fight 
Until the morning comes 
I'll forget about our life

I should have known it could be so much better

I've had enough 
You're selfish and sorry 
You'll never learn how to love 
As your world disassembles 
Better keep your head up 
 
Your name, your face 
Is all you have left now 
Betrayed, disgraced 
You've been erased 
 
So long, so long 
I have erased you 
So long, so long 
I've wanted to waste you 
So long, so long 
I have erased you 
I have escaped 
The bitter taste of you 
 
Just let me clear my head 
I think I've had too much 
You're so disappointing 
But you make good use of it 
As your world disassembles 
Better keep your head up 
 
Your name, your face 
Is all you have left now 
Betrayed, disgraced 
You've been erased 
 
So long, so long

You've been erased

Take it down to the basement 
You look around, 'round, 'round 
And we sit there in silence 
I watch you go down, down, down

Never though I was crazy

'Cause life starts now. 
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow 
And you're so far down 
But you will survive it somehow because life starts now. 
 
I hate to see you fall down 
I'll pick you up off of the ground 
I've watched the weight of your world come down 
And now it's your chance to move on 
Change the way you've lived for so long 
You find the strength you've had inside all along. 
 
'Cause life starts now. 
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow 
And you're so far down 
But you will survive it somehow because life starts now. 
 
All this pain 
Take this life and make it yours. 
All this hate 
Take your heart and let it love again. 
You will survive this somehow. 
 
Life starts now. 
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow, 
And you're so far down.

You tried to lie and say I was everything 
I remember when I said "I'm nothing without you" 
I'm nothing without you 
 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you 
Let me inside 
Let me get close to you 
Change your mind 
I'll get lost if you want me to 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you 
 
You always thought that I left myself open 
But you didn't know I was already broken 
I told myself that it wouldn't be so bad 
But pulling away it took everything I had

I remember when I said "I'm nothing without you"

Change your mind 
I'll get lost if you want me to 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you 
 
In you 
The pain of it all, the rise and the fall 
I see it all in you 
Now everyday I find myself say 
"I want to get lost in you" 
I'm nothing without you 
 
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you 
Let me inside 
Let me get close to you 
Change your mind 
I'll get lost if you want me to

Looking for a shot on the big screen

Go to hell

Go to hell 
 
Not so innocent 
On the street hustling 
Never be Miss America 
In the backseat of a Celica 
Crashing with a deadbeat 
Living large on a love seat 
In a small town, no scene 
Turns out it was a pipe dream 
 
Expectations 
Go to hell 
Expectations 
Go to hell 
 
Rich girl, wannabe 
Bought a quick dick from the lottery 
Watching TV with her boyfriend 
Fell asleep, left the ticket on the nightstand 
He stayed awake to see the ball drop 
Turned it way down, she never woke up 
Grabbed the keys to her car in the back lot 
Through a shot of Jack back, left with the jackpot

You know you need to find a way to get you through another day 
Let me be the one to numb you out 
Let me be the one to hold you 
Never gonna let you get away 
 
The shoulder you cry on 
The dust that you die on 
 
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer 
Love me 'til it's all over, over 
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on 
The dust that you die on 
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer 
 
I know what you want so desperately 
You know I'll give you one for free 
Forever you're coming back to me 
Now I'm gonna give you what you need 
'Cause I know what you feed on and what you lead on 
And what you lead on 
 
The shoulder you cry on 
The dust that you die on 
 
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer 
Love me 'til it's all over, over 
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on 
The dust that you die on 
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer 
 
Did you find the another killer? 
Did you find the another killer? 
 
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer 
Love me 'til it's all over, over 
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on 
The dust that you die on

Went wicked with the clutch 
Happened so fast and it hurt so much 
You're a car crash 
And I can't look away 
I should have known by now 
I'm still not afraid 
I do it to myself 
Knows what I never say 
You're a car crash 
And I can't look away 
 
All I see is shattered glass and 
Red lights passing 
My life flashing! 
Headed for the same disaster 
Faster and faster and faster 
 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
Stop at the red light 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
You're a car crash 
And I can't look away 
 
I came along for the ride 
Went wicked with the clutch 
Happened so fast and it hurt so much 
You're a car crash

Headed for the same disaster 
Faster and faster and faster 
 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
The red light 
Stop at the red light 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
You're just like a car crash 
And I can't look away 
From the headlights 
The red light 
Stop at the red light 
I couldn't stop at the red light 
You're just like a car crash 
And I can't look away! (Let's go for a ride!)

I hear it all, trying to fall asleep 
When all the love around you is dying 
 
How do you stay so strong? 
How did you hide it all for so long? 
How can I take the pain away? 
How can I save 
 
A fallen angel, in the dark 
Never thought you'd fall so far 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
Fallen angel 
 
You do it all for my own protection 
You make me feel like I'll be okay 
Still I have so many questions 
 
How do you stay so strong? 
How did you hide it all for so long? 
How can I take the pain away? 
How can I save, 
 
A fallen angel, in the dark 
Never thought you'd fall so far 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
Fallen angel, just let go 
You don't have to be alone 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
 
I was right beside you 
When you went to hell and back again 
I was right beside you 
When you went to hell and back again 
And I, I couldn't save, a fallen angel 
 
A fallen angel, in the dark 
Never thought you'd fall so far 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight 
Fallen angel, just let go 
You don't have to be alone 
Fallen angel, close your eyes 
I won't let you fall tonight

Until I fix what's broken

Taking it for granted

Find a place where I belong, but

Because I can't forget 
Back and forth through my mind 
Behind a cigarette 
And the message coming from my eyes 
Says leave it alone 
Don't want to hear about it 
Every single ones got a story to tell 
Everyone knows about it 
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell 
And if I catch it coming back my way 
I'm gonna serve it to you 
And that ain't what you want to hear, 
But thats what I'll do 
And the feeling coming from my bones 
Says find a home 
I'm going to Wichita 
Far from this opera for evermore 
I'm gonna work the straw 
Make the sweat drip out of every pore 
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding 
Right before the lord 
All the words are gonna bleed from me 
And I will think no more 
And the stains coming from my blood

back to school, ring the bell 
brand new shoes, walking blues 
climb the fence, books and pens 
I can tell that we're going to be friends 
Walk with me, Suzy Lee 
through the park and by the tree 
we will rest upon the ground 
and look at all the bugs we found 
then safely walk to school without a sound 
Well here we are, no one else 
we walked to school all by ourselves 
there's dirt on our uniforms 
from chasing all the ants and worms 
we clean up and now it's time to learn 
Numbers, letters, learn to spell 
nouns, and books, and show and tell 
at playtime we will throw the ball 
back to class, through the hall 
teacher marks our height 
against the wall 
And we don't notice any time pass 
we don't notice anything 
we sit side by side in every class 
teacher thinks that I sound funny 
but she likes the way you sing 
Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed 
when silly thoughts go through my head 
about the bugs and alphabet 
and when I wake tomorrow I'll bet 
that you and I will walk together again 
'cause I can tell that we're going to be friends</field>

"come and kiss me by the riverside, bobby says it's fine he don't consider it cheating" 
Red hair with a curl 
mellow roll for the flavor 
and the eyes for peeping 
can't keep away from the girl 
these two sides of my brain 
need to have a meeting 
can't think of anything to do 
my left brain knows that 
all love is fleeting 
she's just looking for something new

            <field name="lyrics">We started living in an old house 
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out 
It was a baby boy 
So we bought him a toy 
It was a ray gun 
And it was 1981 
We named him ‘Baby’ 
He had toothache 
He started crying 
It sounded like an earthquake 
It didn’t last long 
Because I stopped it 
I grabbed a rag doll 
And stuck some little pins in it 
Now we’re a family 
And we’re alright now 
We got money and a little place to fight now 
We don’t know you 
And we don’t owe you 
But if you see us around 
I got something else to show you 
Now it’s easy when you don’t know better 
You think it’s sleazy 
Then put it in a short letter 
We keep warm 
But there’s just something wrong when you 
Just feel like that you’re the hardest little button to button 
I had opinions 
That didn’t matter 
I had a brain 
That felt like pancake batter 
I got a backyard 
With nothing in it 
Except a stick 
A dog 
And a box with something in it 
The hardest button to button 
The hardest button to button 
The hardest button to button 
DA HA-DES BUH-EN TA BUH-EN, AAHHH OWWW

James Infirmary, 
See my baby there; 
She's stretched out on a long, white table, 
She's so sweet, so cold, so fair. 
Let her go, let her go, God bless her, 
Wherever she may be, 
She will search this wide world over, 
But she'll never find another sweet man like me. 
Now, when I die, bury me in my straight-leg britches, 
Put on a box-back coat and a stetson hat, 
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain, 
So you can let all the boys know I died standing pat. 
Folks, now that you have heard my story, 
Say, boy, hand me another shot of that booze; 
If anyone should ask you, 
Tell 'em I've got those St 
James Infirmary blues..</field>

You been using on pain pills 
Jack will you call me if you're able? 
I got your phone number written 
In the back of my bible 
Jack I think your pulling my leg 
And I think maybe I better ask Meg 
Meg do you think Jack really loves me? 
You know, I don't care because 
Jack really bugs me 
Why don't you ask him now? 
Well I would Meg 
I really just don't know how 
Just say 'Jack , do you adore me?' 
Well I would Holly but love really bores me 
Well I guess we should just be friends 
I'm just kidding Holly 
You know that I'll love you 'til the end 
Well it's true that we love one another 
I love Jack White like a little brother 
Well Holly I love you too but there's 
Just so much that I don't know about you 
Holly give me some of your English lovin' 
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven 
Why don't you go off and just love yourself 
If I did that Holly there won't be anything 
Left for anybody else 
Jack it's too bad about the way you look 
You know I gave that horse a carrot 
So he'd break your foot 
Will the two of you cut it out 
And tell 'em what it's really all about 
Well it's true that we love one another

And you'll be there when she finds someone new

Well you know 
You keep her in your pocket 
Where there's no way out now 
Put it in a safe a lock it

The smile on your face made her think she had the right one 
Then she thought she was sure 
By the way you two could have fun 
But now she might leave 
Like she's threatened before 
Grab hold of her fast 
Before her feet leave the floor 
And she's out the door 
'cause you want 
You keep her in your pocket 
Where there's no way out now 
Put it in a safe a lock it 
'cause it's home sweet home 
And in your own mind 
You know you're lucky just to know her 
And in the beginning all you wanted was to show her 
But now you're scared 
You think she's running away 
You search in your hand for something clever to say 
Don't go away 
'cause I want 
To keep you in my pocket 
Where there's no way out now 
Put it in a safe a lock it

And if theres one of these unavoidable laws 
It's that you just can't take the effect

Well you can't take the effect and make it the cause 
I didn't rob a bank because you made up the law 
Blame me for robbin' Peter, but don't you blame Paul 
Can't take the effect and make it the cause 
I ain't the reason that you gave me no reason 
to return your calls 
You built a house of cards 
and got shocked when you saw them fall 
Well I ain't sayin' I'm innocent, in fact the reverse 
But if you're headed to the grave 
you don't blame the hearse 
You're like a little girl yelling at her bother 
cause you lost his ball 
Well you keep blaming me for what you did 
but that ain't all 
The way you clean up a wreck 
is enough to give one pause 
Well you seem to forget just how this all started 
I'm reactin to you because you left me broken hearted 
See you just can't take the effect and make it the cause

Who'da thunk? 
Sittin' drunk on a wagon to Mexico 
Ahh well 
What a chump 
And my head 
Got a bump 
When I hit it on the radio 
Redhead señorita 
Lookin' dead 
Came and said 
"Need a bed?" 
En español 
I said 
"Gimme a drink of water, 
I'm gonna 'sing around the collar' 
And I don't need a microphone" 
Icky thump 
With the lump in my throat 
Grab my coat 
And I was freaking 
I was ready to go! 
And I swear 
Beside the hair 
She had one white eye 
One Black (NK) stare 
Lookin' up 
Lyin' there 
On the stand 
Beside her hair 
Was a candy cane 
Black rum, sugar cane 
Dry ice, something strange 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
White Americans, what? 
Nothing better to do? 
Why don't you kick yourself out 
You're an immigrant too 
Who's usin' who? 
What should we do? 
Well, you can't be a pimp 
And a prostitute too 
Icky thump 
Handcuffed to a bunk 
Robbed blind 
Looked around 
And there was nobody else 
Left alone 
I hit myself with a stone 
Went home and learned how 
To clean up after myself</field>

That are no longer there. 
I'm getting hard on myself, 
Sitting in my easy chair. 
Well there's three people 
In the mirror 
And I'm wondering 
Which one of them I should choose. 
But I can't keep from laughing 
Spitting out these three hundred m.p.h. 
Outpour blues. 
I'm breaking my teeth off 
Trying to bite my lip. 
There's all kinds of redheaded women 
That I ain't supposed to kiss. 
And it's that color which never fails 
To turn me blue. 
So I just swallow it, 
And hold on to it, 
And use it 
To scare the hell out of you. 
I have a woman that says 
"come and watch me bleed." 
And I'm wondering, just how I can do that 
And still give her everything that she needs. 
There's three people in my head that have the 
Answer and 
One of them's got to be you. 
But you're holding tight to it 
The answer 
Singing these three hundred m.p.h. 
Outpour blues. 
Put on gloves, a tight scarf 
And wrap up warm 
On this winter night. 
Every time you get defensive 
You're just looking for a fight. 
It's safe to say somebody out there's 
Got a problem with 
Almost anything you'll do. 
Well, next time they stab you 
Don't fight back 
Just play the victim, 
Instead of playing the fool. 
And the roads are covered with a million 
tiny molecules 
Of cigarette ashes 
And the school floors are covered 
With pieces of pencil eraser too. 
Sooner or later the ground's gonna be holding all 
Of my ashes too. 
And I can not help but wonder 
if after I'm gone 
Will I still have these 
300 m.p.h. 
finger breaking 
No answers 
Broken back 
Dirty cancer 
Bee stung 
And busted up 
Empty cup 
Torrential outpour blues 
One thing's for sure in that graveyard 
I'm gonna have the shiniest pair of shoes.</field>

come and sit with me and talk a while 
let me see your pretty little smile 
put your troubles in a little pile 
and I will sort them out for you 
lots of girls walk around in tears 
but that's not for you 
you've been looking all around for years 
for someone to tell your troubles to 
come and sit with me and talk a while 
let me see your pretty little smile 
put your troubles in a little pile

I think I'll marry you</field>

I would like to tell 
My problem is 
It's one you know too well 
It's one you know too well 
Me Suzy Lee 
The one i'm speaking of 
The question is 
Is she the one i love ? 
Is she the one i love ? 
(all right) 
Is she the one i love ? 
She'll send me flowers 
With her tears bored inside 
And you know what i'd do 
I would run and hide 
I would run and hide 
And the paper 
On it was my name 
With the question 
Do you feel the same ? 
Do you feel the same ? 
To end this tale 
The one i'm speaking of 
I wish i have an answer (but i just don't know) 
Is this really love ? 
Is this really love ? 
Is this really love ?</field>

Implanted in a pill?

To a well familiar name? 
Do you have a problem with this one 
If the results are the same?

Well strip the bark right off a tree 
And just hand it this way 
Don't even need a drink of water 
To make the headache go away 
Give me sugar pill 
And watch me just rattle 
Down the street

That are no longer there. 
I'm getting hard on myself, 
Sitting in my easy chair. 
Well there's three people 
In the mirror 
And I'm wondering 
Which one of them I should choose. 
But I can't keep from laughing 
Spitting out these three hundred m.p.h. 
Outpour blues. 
I'm breaking my teeth off 
Trying to bite my lip. 
There's all kinds of redheaded women 
That I ain't supposed to kiss. 
And it's that color which never fails 
To turn me blue. 
So I just swallow it, 
And hold on to it, 
And use it 
To scare the hell out of you. 
I have a woman that says 
"come and watch me bleed." 
And I'm wondering, just how I can do that 
And still give her everything that she needs. 
There's three people in my head that have the 
Answer and 
One of them's got to be you. 
But you're holding tight to it 
The answer 
Singing these three hundred m.p.h. 
Outpour blues. 
Put on gloves, a tight scarf 
And wrap up warm 
On this winter night. 
Every time you get defensive 
You're just looking for a fight. 
It's safe to say somebody out there's 
Got a problem with 
Almost anything you'll do. 
Well, next time they stab you 
Don't fight back 
Just play the victim, 
Instead of playing the fool. 
And the roads are covered with a million 
tiny molecules 
Of cigarette ashes 
And the school floors are covered 
With pieces of pencil eraser too. 
Sooner or later the ground's gonna be holding all 
Of my ashes too. 
And I can not help but wonder 
if after I'm gone 
Will I still have these 
300 m.p.h. 
finger breaking 
No answers 
Broken back 
Dirty cancer 
Bee stung 
And busted up 
Empty cup 
Torrential outpour blues 
One thing's for sure in that graveyard 
I'm gonna have the shiniest pair of shoes.</field>

She stumbled, start to slip and fall, teeter tottered on the top of patent leather shoes 
I happened to catch her and said, Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you maybe for you. 
now.. 
But not as shaky as I must have seemed, talkin' junk to forgive a little teenage dream 
And on the phone I could not compete but dumb luck fake confidence was getting weak 
And for a sec I thought I sounded sweet, but sure enough in a gruff faint voice I heard myself speak 
I could stay awhile, but sooner or later I'll break your smile 
And I can tell a joke, but one of these days I'm bound to choke 
And we could share a kiss 
But I feel like I can't go through with this 
And I bet we could build a home 
But I know the right thing for me to do 
Is to leave you alone. 
leave you alone now.. 
I'm beginning to like you, so you probably won't get what I'm going to do 
I'm walkin' away from you, it probably don't make much sense to you 
But I'm tryin' to save you, from all of the things that I'll probably say I'll do I probably do 
I could stay awhile, but sooner or later I'll break your smile 
And I can tell a joke, but one of these days I'm bound to choke 
And we might share a kiss 
But I feel like I can't go through with this

But I know the right thing for me to do 
Is to leave you alone leave you alone now 
You'll probably call me a fool and say I'm doing exactly what a coward would do 
And I'm beginning to like you, it's a shame what a lame way to live, but what can I do? 
I hope you appreciate what I do 
I'm a martyr for my love for you

But worth as much as a joke that no one is laughing at 
Can you believe some things are not 
Appealing and there's a spot 
On the ceiling of my childhood bedroom 
And can these dreams you can't imagine 
Will never match the vision 
That you had decided for me 
You are to take away from me 
Things that are mine and it's not your right 
Out that you'd wouldn't expect to find out 
Can it be that I don't want what you want? 
And the only thing I could care for 
Is a place in a home that is safe and warm 
Safe and warm, safe and warm, safe and warm 
Judge yourself if you feel the need 
Just let me known to be 
In search of the truth myself 
There is a drop of blood on the ground 
And it seems to me that it's not my kind 
And I can't be sure if it's yours or mine 
I am as ugly as I seem 
Worse than all your dreams 
Could ever make me 
Could ever make me 
Could ever make me

Made the woods around him ring 
And he charmed the heart of a lady 
Charmed the heart of a lady. 
"How old are you, my pretty little miss 
How old are you, my honey ?" 
She answered to him with a lovin' smile 
"I'll be sixteen come Sunday 
Be sixteen come Sunday". 
"Come and go with me, my pretty little miss 
Come and go with me, my honey 
Take you where the grass grows green

"Pull off, pull off them high - heeled shoes 
All made of Spanish leather 
Get behind me on my horse 
And we'll ride off together 
We'll both go off together". 
Well she pulled off them high - heeled shoes 
Made of Spanish Leather 
Got behind him on his horse 
And they rode off together 
They both rode off together. 
At night the boss came home 
Inquirring about his lady 
The servant spoke before she thought 
"She's been with Black Jack Davey 
Rode off with Black Jack Davey". 
"Well, saddle for me my coal - black stud 
He's speedier than the gray 
I rode all day and I'll ride all night 
And I'll overtake my lady 
I'll bring back my lady". 
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight 
Till he came to a river ragin' 
And there he spied his darlin' bride 
In the arms of Black Jack Davey 
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey. 
"Pull off, pull off them long blue gloves 
All made of the finest leather 
Give to me your lily - white hand 
And we'll go home together 
We'll both go home together". 
Well, she pulled off them long blue gloves 
All made of the finest leather 
Gave to him her lily - white hand 
And said goodbye forever 
Bid farewell forever. 
"Would you forsake your house and home 
Would you forsake your baby ? 
Would you forsake your husband too 
To go with Black Jack Davey 
Ride off with Black Jack Davey ?". 
"Well, I'll forsake my house and home 
And I'll forsake my baby 
I'll forsake my husband too 
For the love of Black Jack Davey 
Love my Black Jack Davey. 
Last night I slept in a feather bed 
Between my husband and baby 
Tonight I lay on the river banks 
In the arms of Black Jack Davey 
Love my Black Jack Davey".</field>

Hold it as tightly as I can and 
I will tell by their reaction if 
They're like me or if I am crazy 
When the lights of the city hit my 
Eyes on the plane looking out the window 
I am consumed by a comforting notion 
That you are there and 
I am welcome 
If our miles have added up to 
A giant pile of distance that we 
Cannot reach past, climb, or conquer 
Will you dig a 
Tunnel to me?

[Verse 2] 
Every move suspends an action 
Any attempt to engage will push away 
What you want becomes a magnet 
Opposing pulls 
Never meeting 
Can you combine a friend and mother? 
Can you blend a dad and brother? 
Must we have to pick one or the other? 
Will we know this or always wonder? 
(Always wonder) 
You can tell what you've done to me 
To be seen in hell from your place in a tree 
Always helping 
Ever loving 
But will you always 
Be above me

[Verse 3] 
I won't ignore nor will not forget 
The kindness that's been done to me 
You are the surest and safest bet that 
I could ask for 
So I'm asking 
Soon we will be side by side the 
Plane will land and the wings will glide 
The bags in hand and 
The car will drive 
Into you 
I will arrive

and got shocked when you saw them fall 
Well I ain't sayin' I'm innocent, in fact the reverse 
But if you're headed to the grave 
you don't blame the hearse 
You're like a little girl yelling at her bother 
cause you lost his ball 
Well you keep blaming me for what you did 
but that ain't all

is enough to give one pause

*Riff A* 
Fell in love with a girl 
fell in love once and almost completely 
she's in love with the world 
but sometimes these feelings 
can be so misleading 
*Riff B* 
she turns and says "are you alright?" 
I said "I must be fine cause my heart's still beating" 
She says "come and kiss me by the riverside,bobby says it's fine he don't consider it cheating" 
*Riff A* 
Red hair with a curl 
mellow roll for the flavor 
and the eyes for peeping 
can't keep away from the girl 
these two sides of my brain 
need to have a meeting 
*Riff B* 
can't think of anything to do 
my left brain knows that 
all love is fleeting 
she's just looking for something new 
and I said it once before 
but it bears repeating 
*end on chord A5*</field>

But the point that I have, I'll get to it 
And forever for her is over for me 
Forever, just the word that she said that means never 
To be with another together 
And with the weight of a feather it tore into me 
Then I knew it 
All the work that it took to get through it 
On the wings of a feather that flew it 
Fell onto my shoe it cut up into me 
Well, everybody's reaction is changing you 
But their love is only a fraction of what I can give to you 
So let's do it, just get on a plane and just do it 
Like the birds and the bees and get to it 
Just get out of town and forever be free 
Forever, I wonder we could stay together 
It could change if you want for the better 
Just turn down my shirt and lay down next to me 
I blew it 
And if I knew what to do, then I'd do it 
But the point that I have, I'll get to it 
And forever for her is over for me 
Forever, just the word that she said that means never

It could change if you want for the better 
Just tug at my shirt and lay down next to me</field>

Acetaminophen 
You see the medicine 
Oh girl 
Is there a way to find the cure for this 
Implanted in a pill? 
Is it just the name upon the bottle 
That determines if it will? 
Is the problem you're allergic 
To a well familiar name? 
Do you have a problem with this one 
If the results are the same? 
Acetaminophen

Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine

Girl, you have no faith in medicine 
Acetaminophen 
You see the medicine 
Oh girl 
Well strip the bark right off a tree 
And just hand it this way 
Don't even need a drink of water 
To make the headache go away 
Give me sugar pill 
And watch me just rattle 
Down the street 
Acetaminophen 
You see the medicine 
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine 
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine

I get in, start it up and I go 
It's not a vintage Cadillac 
But it always gets me there and back 
And it'll always be good to me 
Always be good to me 
Always be good to me 
Always be good to me 
I've got a beat up Silvertone amp 
I plug it in and it sounds like a champ 
It's not a Fender Tweed Deluxe 
It only cost me a couple o' bucks 
But it'll always sound good to me 
Always sound good to me 
Always sound good to me 
Always sound good to me 
Always sound good to me 
I've got a girlfriend, she's so true 
And no other kind of girl will do 
'Cause I've known lots of girls in the past 
And I knew none of their love would last 
But this one will always be true to me 
Always be true to me 
Always be true to me 
Always be true to me 
Always be good to me 
Always be good to me 
Always be good to me 
Always be good to me

            <field name="lyrics">I took my girl to go bowling downtown at the red door 
after an argument I started 
cause I thought she didn't like me anymore 
I can't help it sometimes I feel pitiful 
and of course she's so young and beautiful 
I bought us two glasses of coke 
that's her favorite and I wanted to make up for earlier 
but I dropped her glass and it broke 
so I just gave my glass to her 
she laughed and so did I in our lane 
and then she went to a vending machine 
to buy a candy cane 
but right next to that was a boy I knew 
with a spring in his hand 
playing a country pinball machine 
called 'stand by your man' 
I saw him talk to her 
but I stayed in my lane 
and played my game steady 
and was thinking of a day 
when I'd be too old to throw a ball this heavy 
but I guess I'm young now 
so it's easier to knock 'em all down 
then I looked and saw her say to him 
'you're really hittin' that ball around' 
and he's lookin' at her the way I did 
when I first met her 
I could see in his face 
white flowers 
and cups of coffee 
and love letters 
I was sorry to interrupt their game 
but I went and did it anyway 
I dropped my red bowling ball 
through the glass of his machine 
I said 'are you quick enough to hit this ball, mr 
clean?' 
I was scared to lose her 
so I couldn't help being mean 
and that ended both of our games 
I said I was sorry 
but my girl left with him just the same 
I thought how much I hate when love makes me act this way 
I was bent over a broken pinball machine 
in a bowling alley and I threw it all away 
well isn't it all just a big game?.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">We started living in an old house 
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out 
It was a baby boy 
So we bought him a toy 
It was a ray gun 
And it was 1981 
We named him Baby 
He had a toothache 
He started crying 
It sounded like an earthquake 
It didnt last long 
Because I stopped it 
I grabbed a rag doll 
And stuck some little pins in it 
Now were a family 
And were alright now 
We got money and a little place 
To fight now 
We dont know you 
And we dont owe you 
But if you see us around 
I got something else to show you 
Now its easy when you dont know better 
You think its sleazy? 
Then put it in a short letter 
We keep warm 
But theres just something wrong when you 
Just feel like youre the hardest little button 
To button 
I had opinions 
That didnt matter 
I had a brain 
That felt like pancake batter 
I got a backyard 
With nothing in it 
Except a stick 
A dog 
And a box with something in it.</field>

Well I want to try and hold my head up high 
In this busted-up pinto truck conversion between the broken concrete and the cloudy sky 
Well you have to make an effort with me 
Can you make it look like you're chauffeuring me 
There's enough gas to get us home now if we glide 
When we took this job I thought that you knew the deal 
I told the boss we had a Mercedes Benz but all we got in our yard is a steering wheel 
Well I can't borrow this tuxedo much longer 
Well we might have to cut and sell your long hair 
I don't mind you wearing a wig, but I won't steal 
Yeah well 
Honey, we can't afford to look this cheap 
We need to make it look like we're high class, so we'll haul ourself on, we can't be beat 
I can't help but wonder, this time next year, will we be drinking Dom Pérignon or reheated beer, well 
Honey, we can't afford to look this cheap 
We have to keep up appearances as long as we can 
There's too much to lose, our social status, well, our ice machine, and our ceiling fan 
And if they find out that we ain't real songwriters 
That we go Dutch on cigarette lighters 
We're gonna lose the pair of dice (paradise) that's in our hands 
Well, honey, we can't afford to look this cheap 
Got an image to live up to here 
In the best motel on Imposter Street 
While the Joneses are waltzing off to dinner 
We're gluing old lottery tickets together 
Trying to make us a winner 
Well, honey, we can't afford to look this cheap</field>

I was watching 
with one eye on the other side 
I had fifteen people telling me to move 
I got moving on my mind 
I found shelter 
In some thoughts turning wheels around 
I said 39 times that I love you 
to the beauty I had found 
Well its 1 2 3 4 
take the elevator 
at the hotel yorba 
I'll be glad to see you later 
all they got inside is vacancy 
I been thinking 
of a little place down by the lake 
they got a dirty little road leading up to the house 
I wonder how long it will take till we're alone 
sitting on the front porch of that home 
stomping our feet on the wooden boards 
never gonna worry about locking the door 
Well its 1 2 3 4 
take the elevator 
at the hotel yorba 
I'll be glad to see you later 
all they got inside is vacancy 
It might seem silly 
for me to think childish thoughts like these 
but i'm so tired of acting tough 
and i'm gonna to what i please 
lets get married 
in a big cathedral by a priest 
cause if i'm the man that you love the most 
you could say i do at least 
Well its 1 2 3 4 
take the elevator 
at the hotel yorba 
I'll be glad to see you later 
all they got inside is vacancy 
And its 4 5 6 7 
grab your umbrella 
grab hold of me 
cause I'm your favorite fella 
all they got inside is vacancy</field>

On the telephone 
I want to spin my little watch 
Right before your eyes 
You're the kind of girl a guy like me 
Could hypnotize 
And if this comes as a surprise 
Just think of all those guys 
Who would tell you lies 
I want to spin my little watch 
Right before your eyes 
I want to hold your little hand 
If I can be so bold 
And be your right hand man 
'til your hands get old 
And then when all the feeling's gone 
Just decide if you want to keep holding on 
I want to hold your little hand 
If I can be so bold 
If I can be so bold 
If I can be so bold.</field>

no harm will come of this

While my mother baked a little cake for you 
And even dreaded when you said goodbye 
What kind of cartwheels do I have to pull? 
What kind of joke should I lay on her now? 
Im inclined to go finish high school 
Just to make her notice that Im around 
Well nothing I come up with seems to work 
It feels like everything I say is a lie 
And never have I felt like such a jerk 
Im afraid to even open my eyes 
Because I really dont want her to judge me 
I want her to really know who I am 
And then, and only then will she love me 
Well at least that was the plan 
If ever a boy needed a holiday 
If ever a girl needed someone to hold 
I just hope I dont act the same way 
By the time that I get that old 
I never said I was the heir to a fortune 
I never claimed to have any looks 
But these kind of things must be important 
Because somebody ripped out my page 
In your telephone book 
I want to warm her heart.</field>

and I've thought about the many miles 
but I think it's time that I've gone away 
The fellings that you have for me 
have gone away it's plain to see 
and it looks to me 
that you're pulling away 
I'm gonna pick it up 
I'm gonna pick it up today 
I'm bound to pack it up 
I'm bound to pack it up 
and go away 
I find it hard to say to you 
that this is what I have to do 
but there is no way that I'm gonna stay 
there is so many things 
you need to know 
and I wanna tell you before I go 
but it's hard to think of just what to say 
I'm sorry to leave you all alone 
you're sitting silent by the phone 
but we've always known there would come a day 
The bus is warm and softly lit 
and a hundred people ride in it 
I guess I'm just another running away.</field>

all the manners that I've been taught 
have slowly died away 
but if I held the door open for you 
It wouldn't make your day 
You think that I care 
about me and only me 
when every single girl needs help 
climbing up a tree 
well I know it don't take much 
to satisfy me 
Maybe it's whatever's in my head 
that's distracting me 
but if i could find emotion 
to stimulate devotion 
well then you'd see 
Well I'm finding it hard to say 
that I need you twenty times a day 
I feel comfortable so baby why 
don't you feel the same? 
have a doctor come and visit us 
and tell us which one is sane 
Well I never said I wouldn't 
Throw my jacket in the mud for you 
but my father gave it to me so 
maybe I should carry you 
then you said 
"You almost dropped me" 
so then I did 
and I got mud on my shoes.</field>

And I miss being her son 
As crazy as I was I 
Guess I wasn't much of one 
Sometimes I miss her so much, 
I want to hop on the next jet 
And I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet 
And I love my sister 
Lord knows how I've missed her 
She loves me 
And she knows I won't forget 
And sometimes I get jealous 
Of all her little pets 
And I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet 
I roll over in bed 
Looking for someone to touch 
There's a girl that I know of 
But don't ask for much 
She's homely, and she's cranky 
And her hair's in a net 
And I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet 
I get my friend when I need one 
I need someone to be one 
I take anybody I can get 
And sometimes I wanna call you 
And I feel like a pet 
And I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet 
I go down to the river 
Filled with regret 
I go down and I wonder 
If there was any reason left 
I've just before my lungs could get wet 
I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet 
And I love my sister 
Lord knows how I've missed her 
She loves me 
And she knows I won't forget 
And sometimes I get jealous 
Of all her little pets 
And I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet

But you don’t know this 
Tell the truth 
You say I’m lying and I never really tell you the truth 
But your face is getting older 
So put your head on my shoulder 
Yeah, put your head on my shoulder 
Yesterday it hit me that I do all the little things 
That you do 
Except the same little things that you do are annoying 
They’re annoying as hell in fact 
It kinda struck a little bell in fact 
I like to keep my little shell intact 
And I’m slowly turning into you 
And I’m slowly turning into you 
Then something else came to mind 
That was the mirror 
It made everything clearer 
That you’re more beautiful compelling and stronger 
It didn’t take much longer 
Just for me to realize I love all the little things 
And the beauty that they’re gonna bring 
I dig your little laugh and I’m lovin’ your quick wit 
I even love it when you’re faking it 
And it might sound a little strange for me to say to you 
But I’m proud to be you 
And I’m slowly turning into you 
And I’m slowly turning into you 
And I’m slowly turning into you 
And I’m slowly turning into you</field>

Icky Thump 
Who'da thunk? 
Sittin' drunk on a wagon to Mexico 
Ahh well 
What a chump 
And my head 
Got a bump 
When I hit it on the radio 
Redhead señorita 
Lookin' dead 
Came and said 
"Need a bed?" 
En español 
I said 
"Gimme a drink of water, 
I'm gonna 'sing around the collar' 
And I don't need a microphone" 
Icky thump 
With the lump in my throat 
Grab my coat 
And I was freaking 
I was ready to go! 
And I swear 
Beside the hair 
She had one white eye 
One Black (NK) stare 
Lookin' up 
Lyin' there 
On the stand 
Beside her hair 
Was a candy cane 
Black rum, sugar cane 
Dry ice, something strange 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
White Americans, what? 
Nothing better to do? 
Why don't you kick yourself out 
You're an immigrant too 
Who's usin' who? 
What should we do? 
Well, you can't be a pimp 
And a prostitute too 
Icky thump 
Handcuffed to a bunk 
Robbed blind 
Looked around 
And there was nobody else 
Left alone 
I hit myself with a stone 
Went home and learned how 
To clean up after myself</field>

It ain't his fault for bein thoughtless 
It ain't his thought for bein shameless 
But it's my fault for bein famous

I had a sweet old lady walk up to me 
Wanted to get a photograph for her grandson to see 
And as the digital camera lit up the place 
She unloaded a chrome 45 in my face

Ain't her fault for bein toothless 
Ain't her fault for bein blameless

i think i'm all done lying 
nobody's sharing 
so i stop caring 
all alone and walking 
nobody's talking 
why can't you be nicer to me?

nobody's calling 
on the ground and laying 
nobody's praying

Well every highway that I go down 
Seems to be longer than the last one i knew about 
Oh Well 
And every girl that I walk around 
Seems to be more of an illusion than the last one that I found 
Oh Well 
And this old man in front of me 
Holding canes and ruby rings 
Is like containing an explosion when he sings 
But with every chance to set himself on fire 
He just ends up doing the same thing 
Well every beautiful think i come across 
Tells me to stop moving and shake this riddle off 
Oh Well 
And there was a time when all I wanted was my 
Ice cream colder, and a little cream soda 
Oh Well, Oh Well 
And a wooden box, and an alley full of rocks 
was all i had to care about 
Oh Well, Oh Well, Oh Well 
But now my mind is filled with rubber tires 
and forest fires 
an whether i'm a liar 
and lots of other situations where I don't know 
what to do at which time god screams to me 
"there's nothing left for me to tell you"

Can you scare me up a little bit of love?

The first woman that I met her 
I did not expect a specter

She looked into me so sweetly 
And we left the room discreetly 
No one else could know the secret of our love 
Little ghost, little ghost

Can you scare me up a little bit of love? 
I'm the only one that sees you,

Every morning I awoke 
And I see my little ghost 
Wond'rin' if it's really her that's lying there 
I lean to touch her and I whisper 
But not brave enough to kiss her 
When I held her I was really holding air 
Little ghost, little ghost

Can you scare me up a little bit of love? 
I'm the only one that sees you,

Though I try my best to keep it 
There really was no secret 
Must have looked like I was dancing with the wall

But because of my condition 
I fell in love with a little ghost and that was all 
Little ghost, little ghost 
One I'm scared of the most

I'm the only one that sees you, 
And I can't do much to please you

I went down to the station 
suitcase in my hand 
All the women runnin', cryin' 
Mr

Well there was three women 
yellow, brown and black 
take the mayor of Detroit to pick which one I like 
One of um had hamtramak yellow 
One of um Detroit brown 
But that southwest darkskin is sure to turn my damper down 
Why, ticket agent, ticket agent 
where did my baby go 
tell me what she looks like I'll tell you what road she's on 
Well she's a long tall mama 
mile and a half from the ground 
she's a tailor made mama and she ain't no hand me down 
Well I used to say married woman 
sweetest women ever born

you better leave married women alone 
take my advice, let married women, boy let um be 
cause their husband will grab ya, beat ya ragged as a cedar tree 
Well I got two woman

Your back is straight, your hair is smooth 
On the pillow where you lie.

No gratitude or love 
Your loyalty is not to me 
But to the stars above. 
One more cup of coffee for the road 
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go 
To the valley below. 
Your daddy he's an outlaw 
And a wanderer by trade 
He'll teach you how to pick and choose 
And how to throw the blade 
He oversees his kingdom 
So no stranger does intrude 
His voice it trembles as he calls out 
For another plate of food 
One more cup of coffee for the road, 
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go 
To the valley below 
Your sister sees the future 
Like your mama and yourself 
You've never learned to read or write 
There's no books upon your shelf. 
And your pleasure knows no limits 
Your voice is like a meadowlark 
But your heart is like an ocean 
Mysterious and dark

You think not telling is the same as not lying, don't you? 
Then I guess not feeling is the same as not crying to you 
You think not telling is the same as not lying, don't you? 
Then I guess not feeling is the same as not crying to you 
In the red, in the rain, in the rain 
In the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain 
In the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain 
In the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain 
If there is a lie, then there is a liar, too 
And if there is a sin, then there is a sinner, too 
And if there is a lie, then there is a liar, too 
And if there is a sin, then there is a sinner, too 
In the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain 
I'm in red, I'm in red, in the rain, in the rain 
In the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain 
I'm in red, I'm in red, in the rain, in the rain 
I'm in red, I'm in red, in the rain, in the rain 
Can't you hear me? can't you hear me calling your name, girl?</field>

I gotta have somewhere to go 
I call up tommy now 
I call him on the telephone 
Won't you wake up and come with me now 
I'm going to the pawn and loan 
Walking down thirty three 
Walking on thirty o 
Well what am i supposed to think 
I drop a nickel in the sink 
I love people like a brother now 
But i'm not gonna be their mother now 
What if someone walked up to me 
And like an apple cut right through me 
I'm not the one who's sinnin 
Screwdriver 
Now that you have heard my story now 
I've got a little ending to it now 
Whenever you go out alone 
Take a little dog a bone 
Think about your little sister 
Then you got to drive it home 
With a screwdriver 
I got a little feeling goin' now 
I got a little feeling goin' now.</field>

A seven nation army couldn't hold me back 
They're gonna rip it off 
Taking their time right behind my back 
And I'm talking to myself at night 
Because I can't forget 
Back and forth through my mind 
Behind a cigarette 
And the message coming from my eyes 
Says leave it alone 
Don't want to hear about it 
Every single ones got a story to tell 
Everyone knows about it 
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell 
And if I catch it coming back my way 
I'm gonna serve it to you 
And that ain't what you want to hear, 
But thats what I'll do 
And the feeling coming from my bones 
Says find a home 
I'm going to Wichita 
Far from this opera for evermore 
I'm gonna work the straw 
Make the sweat drip out of every pore 
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding 
Right before the lord 
All the words are gonna bleed from me 
And I will think no more 
And the stains coming from my blood 
Tell me go back home</field>

I don't break a couple rules

James Infirmary, 
See my baby there; 
She's stretched out on a long, white table, 
She's so sweet, so cold, so fair. 
Let her go, let her go, God bless her, 
Wherever she may be, 
She will search this wide world over, 
But she'll never find another sweet man like me. 
Now, when I die, bury me in my straight-leg britches, 
Put on a box-back coat and a stetson hat, 
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain, 
So you can let all the boys know I died standing pat. 
Folks, now that you have heard my story, 
Say, boy, hand me another shot of that booze; 
If anyone should ask you, 
Tell 'em I've got those St 
James Infirmary blues..</field>

Me Suzy Lee 
The one i'm speaking of 
The question is 
Is she the one i love ? 
Is she the one i love ? 
(all right) 
Is she the one i love ? 
She'll send me flowers 
With her tears bored inside 
And you know what i'd do 
I would run and hide 
I would run and hide 
And the paper 
On it was my name 
With the question 
Do you feel the same ? 
Do you feel the same ? 
To end this tale 
The one i'm speaking of 
I wish i have an answer (but i just don't know) 
Is this really love ? 
Is this really love ? 
Is this really love ?</field>

            <field name="lyrics">I was sitting there in a comfortable chair 
And that was all that I needed 
Then my friend offered me a drink for us to share 
And that was all that I needed 
Well, then I felt at ease 
But then I'm not too hard to please 
I guess you couldn't call me greedy 
Then I was shocked to look up 
And see rita hayworth there in a place so seedy 
She walked into the bar with her long, red, curly hair 
And that was all that I needed 
And I said to my friend, "good god, we're lucky men just to even see her" 
Take, take, take 
Take, take, take 
Take, take, take 
And I could not resist, I just had to get close to her 
And that was all that I needed 
I walked and loomed around her table for a while 
And that was all that I needed 
Then I said, "i hate to bug you, ma'am, but can I have your autograph?" 
And that was all that I needed 
She pressed her lips against a white piece of paper 
And that was all that I needed 
Then I saw what she wrote, my heart is in my mouth 
And that was all that I needed 
Then she handed it to me, and I think that she could see 
That that was all that I needed 
I started to walk away but then I remembered 'hey, I forgot to get a picture' 
So I asked her one more time, "could I have another favor?" 
That was all that I needed 
She was kind and posed with me 
Then I knew my friend would see my celebrity meeting 
Take, take, take 
Take, take, take 
Take, take, take 
She turned and said to me, "I need to go to sleep," 
And it seemed so mean 
It's almost as if she could not appreciate how cool I was being 
She said, "good night" and walked away 
And I didn't know what to say 
I just couldn't believe it 
Well, it's just not fair 
I want to get a piece of hair 
That was all that I needed 
Or maybe a kiss on the cheek 
I wouldn't wash it for a week 
That would be all that I needed 
But she didn't even care 
That I was even there 
What a horrible feeling</field>

Well I'm not a genius but maybe you'll remember this I never said I wanted to be a man 
Do, do, do! 
I get nervous when she comes around when she comes around when she comes around x4 
My mom is so caring she really got me staring at all the crazy little things she does for sure 
And I can't seem to think of another kind of love that a boy could ever get from anyone but her 
Do, do, do!

C'mon, you got it all wrong, man 
And if you think that our dance was all in the hips 
Oh well, then do the twist 
If you think holding hands is all in the fingers 
Grab hold of the soul where the memory lingers and 
Make sure to never do it with the fingers 
Cause I'll tell everyone in the world 
But he was thinking about the girl 
Ya, but he's thinking about the girl, oh 
A lot of people get confused and they bruise 
Real easy when it comes to love 
They start putting on their shoes and walking out 
And singing "boy, I think I had enough" 
Just because she makes you feel wrong 
She don't mean to be mean or hurt you on purpose, boy 
Take a tip and do yourself a little service 
Take a mountain turn it into a mole 
Just by playing a different role 
Ya, by playing a different role, oh 
The boat ya you know she's rockin' it 
And the truth well ya know there's no stoppin' it 
The boat ya you know she's still rockin' it 
The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it 
So what, somebody left you in a rut 
And wants to be the one who's in control 
But the feeling that you're under can really make you wonder 
How the hell she can be so cold 
So now you're mad, denying the truth 
And it's getting in the wisdom in the back of your tooth 
Ya need ta spit it out, in a telephone booth 
While ya call everyone that you know, and ask 'em 
Where do you think she goes 
Oh ya, where d'ya suppose she goes, oh 
The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it 
And the boat well ya know she's still rockin' it 
The boat ya you know she's still rockin' it 
And the truth ya you know there's no stoppin' it 
You recognize with your back in the back? 
That it's colder when she rocks the boat 
But it's the cause hittin on the Cardinal Laws? 
'bout the proper place to hang her coat 
So to you, the truth is still hidden 
And the soul plays the role of a lost little kitten but 
You should know that the dark is one kitten? 
She's been singing it all along 
But you were hearin' a different song 
Ya you were hearin' a different song 
But you were hearin' a different song</field>

My ma gave birth and we were checking it out 
It was a baby boy 
So we bought him a toy 
It was a ray gun 
And it was 1981 
We named him ‘Baby’ 
He had toothache 
He started crying 
It sounded like an earthquake 
It didn’t last long 
Because I stopped it 
I grabbed a rag doll 
And stuck some little pins in it 
Now we’re a family 
And we’re alright now 
We got money and a little place to fight now 
We don’t know you 
And we don’t owe you 
But if you see us around 
I got something else to show you 
Now it’s easy when you don’t know better 
You think it’s sleazy 
Then put it in a short letter 
We keep warm 
But there’s just something wrong when you 
Just feel like that you’re the hardest little button to button 
I had opinions 
That didn’t matter 
I had a brain 
That felt like pancake batter 
I got a backyard 
With nothing in it 
Except a stick 
A dog 
And a box with something in it

cause It can't be love 
for there is no true love 
It can't be love 
for there is no true love 
There is a man 
a certain man 
and for the poor you may be sure 
that he'll do all he can 
who is this one? 
who's favourite son? 
just by his action has the traction 
magnets on the run 
who likes to smoke 
enjoys a joke 
and wouldn't get a bit 
upset if he were really broke 
with wealth and fame 
he's still the same 
I'll bet you five you're not alive 
If you don't know his name 
You said the union forever 
You said the union forever 
You cried the union forever 
but that was untrue girl 
cause It can't be love 
for there is no true love 
It can't be love 
for there is no true love.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">There's no home for you here girl, go away 
There's no home for you here 
I'd like to think that all of this constant interaction 
Is just the kind of make you drive yourself away 
Each simple gesture done by me is counteracted 
And leaves me standing here with nothing else to say 
Completely baffled by a backward indication 
That an inspired word will come across your tongue 
Hands moving upward to propel the situation 
Have simply halted 
And now the conversation's done 
There's no home for you here girl, go away 
There's no home for you here 
I'm only waiting for the proper time to tell you 
That it's impossible to get along with you 
It's hard to look you in the face when we are talking 
So it helps to have a mirror in the room 
I've not been really looking forward to the performance 
But there's my cue and there's a question on your face 
Fortunately I have come across an answer 
Which is go away 
And do not leave a trace 
There's no home for you here girl, go away 
There's no home for you here 
Waking up for breakfast 
Burning matches 
Talking quietly 
Breaking baubles 
Throwing garbage 
Drinking soda 
Looking happy 
Taking pictures 
So completely stupid 
Just go away 
There's no home for you here girl, go away 
There's no home for you here.</field>

can't you people just leave her alone 
she never did nothing to hurt you 
so just leave her alone 
The motion of her tiny hands 
and the quiver of her bones below 
are the signs of a girl alone 
and tell you everything 
you need to know 
I can't explain it 
I feel it often 
everytime I see her face 
but the way you treat her 
fills me with rage and I 
want to tear apart the place 
You try to tell her what to do 
and all she does is stare at you 
her stare is louder than your voice 
because truth doesn't make a noise.</field>

back to school, ring the bell 
brand new shoes, walking blues 
climb the fence, books and pens 
I can tell that we're going to be friends 
Walk with me, Suzy Lee 
through the park and by the tree 
we will rest upon the ground 
and look at all the bugs we found 
then safely walk to school without a sound 
Well here we are, no one else 
we walked to school all by ourselves 
there's dirt on our uniforms 
from chasing all the ants and worms 
we clean up and now it's time to learn 
Numbers, letters, learn to spell 
nouns, and books, and show and tell 
at playtime we will throw the ball 
back to class, through the hall 
teacher marks our height 
against the wall 
And we don't notice any time pass 
we don't notice anything 
we sit side by side in every class 
teacher thinks that I sound funny 
but she likes the way you sing 
Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed 
when silly thoughts go through my head 
about the bugs and alphabet 
and when I wake tomorrow I'll bet 
that you and I will walk together again 
'cause I can tell that we're going to be friends</field>

All the dough I give you Holly 
You been using on pain pills 
Jack will you call me if you're able? 
I got your phone number written 
In the back of my bible 
Jack I think your pulling my leg 
And I think maybe I better ask Meg 
Meg do you think Jack really loves me? 
You know, I don't care because 
Jack really bugs me 
Why don't you ask him now? 
Well I would Meg 
I really just don't know how 
Just say 'Jack , do you adore me?' 
Well I would Holly but love really bores me 
Well I guess we should just be friends 
I'm just kidding Holly 
You know that I'll love you 'til the end 
Well it's true that we love one another 
I love Jack White like a little brother 
Well Holly I love you too but there's 
Just so much that I don't know about you 
Holly give me some of your English lovin' 
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven 
Why don't you go off and just love yourself 
If I did that Holly there won't be anything 
Left for anybody else 
Jack it's too bad about the way you look 
You know I gave that horse a carrot 
So he'd break your foot 
Will the two of you cut it out 
And tell 'em what it's really all about 
Well it's true that we love one another

Well, my nose keeps on bleeding 
'Cause it's rita I'm needing 
I better call out a meeting of the boys

My friends are all dying 
And death can't be lying 
It's the truth and it don't make a noise 
Oh Rita, oh Rita 
If you lived in mesita 
I would move you with the beat of a drum 
And this picture is proof 
That although you're aloof 
You had the shiniest tooth 'neath the sun 
Easy come, easy go 
Be a star of the show 
I'm giving up all I know to get more 
To get more 
Photograph the picture 
Young grunt pin-up scripture 
For locker-tagged memories of war 
A mirage, this garage 
And a photo montage 
And a finger massage from the host 
Good lord, good lord 
The one I adore 
And I cannot afford is a ghost 
Is a ghost 
Proto-social is the word 
And the word is the bird 
That flew through the herd in the snow 
In the snow 
Lemonade me, then grade me 
Then deliver my baby 
And if my friends all persuade me, I'll go 
Blink, blink at me Rita 
Don't you know I'm a bleeder? 
And I promised I wouldn't lead her on 
But she met me, then led me 
And I ate what was fed me

Some hotshots got money gonna pull my bail 
Soon as i get out, hit the ground 
Your southern can is worth a dollar a half a pound 
So there ain't no use in bringin no jive to me 
Your southern can is mine, talkin about it 
Your southern can belongs to me 
Ya might take it from the south, baby, hide it up north 
Understand ya can't rule me and be my boss 
Take it from the east and hide in the west 
But when i get ya momma your can'll see no rest 
So there ain't no use in bringin no jive to me 
Your southern can is mine, i'm screamin 
Your southern can belongs to me 
Now baby, ashes to ashes, sand to sand 
When i hit ya momma then ya feel my hand 
Give ya punch through that barbed wire fence 
When i hit ya baby, ya know i make no sence 
So there ain't no use in bringin no jive to me 
Your southern can is mine, i know it 
Your southern can belongs to me 
Now look here woman, don't get hot 
I'm gettin me a brick outta my backyard

Your southern can is mine, i'm takin about it 
Your southern can belongs to me 
Well if i catch you momma down in the heart of town 
I'm gonna grab me a brick and tear your can on down 
So there ain't no use in bringin no jive to me 
Your southern can is mine, i know it 
Your southern can belongs to me 
You maybe get bed sick, 'cause you're graveyard bound 
I'm gonna make you moan like a graveyard hound

He ain't signed me but he proud of me 
I got some ideas that you gotta see 
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the odyssey 
They never seen a rapper practice modesty 
I never practice, I only perform 
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn 
I speak to god in public, I speak to god in public 
He keep my rhymes in couplets 
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans 
I used to dance to michael, I used to dance in high school 
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music 
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be 
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some hebru brantleys 
You must've missed the come up, I must be all I can be 
Call me mister mufasa, I had to master stampedes 
[hook: chance the rapper] 
I made it through, made it through, made it through 
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you 
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming 
(coming, coming, coming) 
So are you ready? 
Are you ready?

With her eyes, with her smile 
with her belt, with her hands, with her money 
I am the thesis of her prayers 
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers 
Only ones she love as much as me 
is Jesus Christ and Taylor 
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma 
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma 
Mine's is hand made, pan fried, sun dried 
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide 
Praying with her hands tied 
president of my fan club, saying to her 
Something told me I should bring my butt to church 
You gotta move it slowly 
Take and eat my body like it's holy 
I've been waiting for you for the whole week 
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy 
You gotta move it slowly 
Take and eat my body like it's holy

Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain 
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain 
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain 
I come to church for the candy 
your peppermints is the truth 
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you 
You look so good with that hat on 
had to match with the shoes 
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew 
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate 
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place 
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent 
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent 
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired 
Singin his praises daily basis so I gotta try it 
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain 
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute 
let me take my butt to church 
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain 
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain 
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain 
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain 
You gotta move it slowly

You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too 
Your big brother foot work 
Your play sister Juke 
The rink was the place but in that space and time 
I was too young for you 
As you were for me 
To worry about Frooties and Chews 
Till I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute 
And realized what booties can do 
We gon' get it poppin' 
We gon' get it Jukin' 
We gon' throw a party 
We ain't gotta do shit 
You came with your best friend 
Came up with for the weekend 
Rolling with your parties 
So tell me what you thinkin' 
So we gon' have a juke jam 
So we gon' have a juke jam 
We can have a party, just listening to music 
Like we used to do 
I'll get close to you 
I remember you

We've got so much history baby, maybe 
Maybe you and I were meant to be 
Maybe I'm crazy 
We never rolled at the rink 
We would just go to the rink 
You ain't buy tokens no more 
You just hit roll at the rink 
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him 
But when they play Take You Down, Chris Brown 
I am him standing 
I mean it's just dancing 
It's harmless as fuck 
Then I put my waist through your hips 
And your legs and your arms just to harness you up 
Then we hit the floor 
All the kitties start skating 
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do 
When they grown and they dating 
We've got so much history baby, maybe 
Maybe you and I were meant to be 
Maybe I'm crazy 
Crazy about you 
We gon' get it poppin' 
We gon' get it Jukin' 
We gon' throw a party 
We ain't gotta do shit

Angels, na, na, na, na 
[verse 1: chance the rapper] 
I got my city doing front flips 
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship 
I guess that's why they call it where I stay 
Clean up the streets, so my daughter 
Can have somewhere to play 
I'm the blueprint to a real man 
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man 
I ain't goin' to hell or to hillman 
Igh, igh, igh, igh, for my real fans 
I got caught up with a little xan 
Can't stop me but it slow me though 
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though 
But every dj still play me though 
Damn man, I don't even need a radio 
And my new shit sound like a rodeo 
Got the old folks dancing the do-si-do 
'til they fuck around and sign me to ovo 
Ooh, I just might share my next one with keef 
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef 
This what it sound like when god split an atom with me 
I even had steve giving out apples for free 
[hook: saba] 
They was talking "woo woo this woo wap da bam" 
City so damn great, I feel like alexand' 
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion 
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded 
[post-hook: chance the rapper] 
Who is you? and who the fuck is you? and who is him? 
All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me 
Na, na, na, na I got angels 
I got angels 
[verse 2: chance the rapper] 
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade 
This for my day one, ten years, seven days 
A week, niggas never tired on they kevin gates 
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates 
It's too many young angels on the southside 
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside 
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown 
You gon' make me turn my bm to my housewife 
I just had a growth spurt 
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt 
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search 
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch 
Grandma say I'm kosher, momma say I'm culture 
Gci, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live 
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke 
Gci, 1-0-7-5, goin' live 
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[verse 1: chance the rapper] 
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom 
Don't believe in kings, believe in the kingdom 
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air 
Dying laughing with krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair 
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy 
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family 
He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest 
And gave donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath 
[hook: jamila woods chance the rapper] 
I'm gon' praise him, praise him 'til I'm gone

They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor 
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors 
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no twitter in heaven 
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' heaven 
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions 
Like my ex girl getting pregnant 
And her becoming my everything 
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs 
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled 
They want four minute songs 
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn 
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so nico grab you a horn 
Hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter 
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh! 
[bridge: byron cage chance the rapper] 
There are obstacles in life 
Many many trials and tribulations that come up 
But you got to realize and know 
That even jericho walls must fall 
Every wall must fall 
Fall jericho, fall

Wide eyed kids being kids 
Why did you stop? 
What did you do to your hair? 
Where did you go to end up right back here? 
When did you start to forget how to fly?

They ain't teaching taxes in school 
It don't even matter I was acting a fool 
But who would think the raps would turn into racks? 
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you 
Scars on my head, I'm the boy who lived 
The boy love playing when the boy too sick 
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help 
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself 
Last year got addicted to xans 
Started forgetting my name and started missing my chance 
La for four months end up leaving right back 
I'm in love with my city bitch I sleep in my hat 
I felt hog tied ever since my dog died

Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone 
I've been getting blocked just trying 
To make songs with friends 
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends 
I got to pray I got to pray, like hammer after “2 legit”

I cannot scrap the stupid shit 
I “stand up” like I'm ludacris

You'd think they drive an uber whip

[intro: eryn allen kane] 
The water may be deeper than it's ever been 
[verse 1: noname] 
Lord rain down on me so I can move on water 
Like children at the altar, like god inside my house 
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like mama 
You made a church out of feathers 
So when she fly to the father 
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid 
She gave my name away to your holy house 
She like my blessings in disguise 
She like her jesus mountain high 
So he can watch her lonely child 
I know my god 
I know my god seen his breaks and his edges 
Are jagged for giving that pain to his city in gold 
Like everything is everything 
Like all them days he prayed with me 
Like emptiness was tamed in me 
And all that was left was his love 
And all that was left was his love 
And all that was left was his love 
[chorus] 
Never, never drown 
The water may be deeper than it's ever been 
Never drown 
The water may be deeper than it's ever been 
Never drown 
[verse 2: kirk franklin] 
Never, never, never 
Chance let me in 
This thirst in my soul 
There's a thirst in my soul and tell me 
Where I stand I go 
Where 
For you 
Come on 
I may cry a river 
I may cry a thousand tears 
But you take each drop and you wash 
You wash me new 
Me new 
People sing 
This water is deep 
Yes 
This water is 
Yes and I need you to 
Jesus rescue me 
Come on, I need you to 
Take me to your mountain 
Hallelujah 
So someday chicago will be free 
Someday we'll all be free 
Be free

Wave 'round your head like a helicopter 
You ain't put enough weed in the blunt 
All you do is smoke tobacco 
Where the hell you get them from? 
Yeezus said he ain't make them 
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters 
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas 
My first tat was on my stomach 
Got a pocket full of money 
And a mind full of ideas 
Some of this shit may sound weird 
Inside of the maybach 
Look like it came out of ikea 
Run shit like diarrhea 
Big yacht, no pies there 
Aye, aye, captain

I got problems bigger than these boys 
My deposits, they be on steroids 
Lord, free the carter, niggas need the carter 
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like jesus carter 
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up 
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks 
I rolled up and let the smoke puff 
I lay down, told yah 
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff 
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns 
In the streets my face a coupon 
Her pussy too warm 
All these bitches come to do harm 
Just bought a new charm 
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm 
I'm uncle luke with the hoes 
Pretty bitches, centerfolds 
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes 
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase 
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race 
Fuck wrong with you? what you thinkin'? 
What you thought it was? 
I just popped five percocets and only caught a buzz 
And if that label try to stop me 
There gon' be some crazy weezy fans waitin' in the lobby 
Mula, baby

You gotta fight for your way

Magnify, magnify, lift it on high 
Spit it spotify to qualify a spot on his side 
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies 
Lullabies and alibis 
The book don't end with malachi 
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen 
'til one score and three years 
From the third when he doesn't 
My village raised 'em a child 
Come through the crib and it's bustin' 
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins 
Shabach barak, edify 
Electrify the enemy like hedwig till he petrified 
Any petty peter petigrew could get the pesticide 
79Th, 79th, I don't believe in science 
I believe in signs 
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs 
Color white collar crime 
Good god, the gift of freedom 
Hosanna santa invoked and woke up slaves 
From southampton to chatham manor 
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm james early 
The type of worship make jesus come back a day early 
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed 
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me 
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery 
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody 
Exalt, exalt, glorify 
Descend upon the earth with swords 
And fortify the borders where your shorties lie 
I used to hide from god 
Ducked down in the slums like "shh" 
[verse 2: jay electronica] 
I was lost in the jungle like simba after the death of mufasa 
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day 
But I spent my night time fighting tears back 
I prayed and prayed and left messages 
But never got no hear back, or so it seemed 
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream 
I build the ark to gently, gently 
Row my boat down noah's stream 
Sometimes the path I took to reach 
My petty goals was so extreme 
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine 
But you was always there 
When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line 
From a lofty height we wage war 
On the poltergeist with the exalted christ 
Spark the dark with the pulse of light 
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life 
I spit on the tidal it's tidal waves 
I spit on the apple and kill a worm 
A fire in cali will swallow a valley 
For every african village burned 
Jay elect would've never made it 
O' son of man, o' son of man 
Who was the angel in revelations with a foot 
On water and a foot on land? 
Who was the angel that rode a harley from 
The project to the house of parliament 
And opened the book in the devil's chamber 
And put the true name of the lord in it? 
Old jerusalem, new jerusalem 
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire 
They poisoned the scriptures 
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs 
It was all a lie 
Mystery babylon, tumbling down 
Satan's establishment crumbling down 
This is the year that I come for the crown 
Bury my enemies under the ground</field>

Wait one minute I told you 
Yeah, I would like to know you 
Yeah, you lucky like clovers 
Yeah, the clothes no good 
Mama I do it, your ass I pursue it 
Just look at me baby 
I came from the sewers 
They love all the slime ball 
Like they fuck all these cats on your slime dog 
I got me some rings like I'm bruce bowen 
I'm ballin' on you like I'm chris paul 
[hook: chance the rapper young thug] 
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste 
I swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste 
[verse 3: lil yachty] 
Am I the only one who really care about cover art 
Growing up I ain't have my brother cause he said 
The streets gave him a fresh start 
I ain't know what that mean 
I bumped heads with my dean 
Dropped out and hit the scene 
Now I'm stunting like bling 
Time and time again they told me no 
They told me I wouldn't go 
Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes 
Well, maybe that shit was my interest 
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist 
After 1night the folks thought I was finished 
I pin my name to the game like a seamstress 
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator 
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper 
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater 
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer 
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different 
New sound, new appearance 
Bitch it's boat from the 6 
Give a fuck about a bitch 
Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit 
[hook: chance the rapper young thug] 
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste

We just been smoking a bowl 
We just been smoking 
We just been smoking a bowl 
We just been smoking a bowl 
We just been 
We just been smoking a bowl 
We just been smoking a bowl 
We just been smoking a, we just 
What the fuck is going on? 
When did we buy a bowl? 
[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper] 
We just been smoking a bowl 
We don't got no time to roll 
I'm always out on the road 
She don't got time for a whole 
Little bit of time that we have 
We used to purchase a half 
There's gon' be no time to smoke 
I'm always throwing on clothes 
She always throwing a fit 
We don't got no time for no sex 
I just put milk in the bowl 
She don't be cooking at all 
She just put weed in the bowl 
She don't have time for herself 
She putting points on the board, yes 
You know she carry her own 
You know she carry a child 
She wake up at crack of dawn 
She don't be cracking a smile 
So when she packing the bowl 
I grab her, I tell her 
[Hook: Chance The Rapper] 
Let me crack this blunt 
Slow it down for a second 
Break it down, ooh 
She said, "let me lick this blunt" 
Slow it down for a second 
Break it down, ooh 
We deserve, we deserve 
We deserve, a smoke break 
We deserve, we deserve 
We deserve, a smoke break 
[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper] 
Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl 
We used to Netflix and roll 
I used to pass her the smoke 
She used to laugh at my jokes 
You pat my back when I choke 
Wish we were stuck in our ways 
We way too young to get old 
We stuck together like oowops 
We smoke to Fetty, sing ZooWap 
Traphouse 3, Guwop 
I shoulda knew when I grew up 
It would be no time at all 
We went from White Owls to Raws 
We went from joints to a bowl 
She need a second to breathe 
We need an actual smoke sesh 
[Hook: Chance The Rapper] 
Let me crack your back 
Slow it down for a second 
Take it down, ooh 
Let me run this back 
Slow it down for a minute 
You deserve, you deserve 
We deserve, we deserve 
We deserve, a smoke break 
We deserve, we deserve 
We deserve, a smoke break 
[Verse 3: Future] 
I don't have time to finesse 
I put some ice on your neck 
But I ain't holding you back 
I spend my time on the road 
Super ain't saving no hoes 
I don't have time to patrol 
Let me break these bales right down for a second 
When it touch down, ooh 
I got to lay back the roof 
I got to break the new rules 
She can't be taking no cost 
When she involved with a boss 
Please don't get lost in the sauce 
Please don't get lost in the sauce 
She been like this from the door 
Told me my mom was a whore 
I gave her percs for myself 
I give her a perc for esteem 
I'm tryna crown me a queen 
You hear the chains when they cling 
I take the molly its clean 
I push the whip with the wings 
I gotta be overseas 
I gotta be on the pedal 
I push it down to the floor 
I got designer galore 
I keep some Goyard and gars 
I smoke out all of my cars 
You smell the weed in the air 
You smell the smoke in the seats 
You went and had our child 
You didn't abandon the D 
You got me twisted at least 
You can 
[Hook: Chance The Rapper Future] 
Let me crack your back 
Let me rub you all over 
Take it down, ooh 
Let me make this blunt 
Make you dinner or somethin' 
You deserve, you deserve 
We deserve, we deserve 
We deserve, a smoke break 
We deserve, we deserve 
We deserve, a smoke break</field>

Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu*kfu*k you (Nah nah, no) 
I ain't no activist, I'm the protagonist 
I don't co-captain it, I fly solo like one cup in the cabinet 
The cab is the cabinet, they trust me at landing it 
They call me the advocate, they'll slide like the abacus 
Boy meets world, everybody been savages 
I just want to really know how much a drill shooter averages 
I'm not no nice guy I'm just a good guy 
The bad guys should really stay on my good side 
I smell my roses younger than the good die 
The Illuminati couldnt see me with they good eye 
They think they Heath Ledger scary, they just Jack Nichols 
I'm a sign to my city like the Bat-Signal 
Young chosen one, golden boy, De La Hoya 
It ain't too many me's, rest in peace to Verne Troyer 
I was younger then I seemed as a kid 
I mean my G17 18 in the head 
I mean I'm only 25 but I'm Motown 25 
Bet I get a statue in my hometown when I die 
And Rahm you done I'm expectin' resignation 
An open investigation on all of these paid vacations for murderers 
Fuck you, oh o-o-oh 
Fuck you, fu*k you

I don't get no paper I gotta sign at the bottom 
Still in my bag like the fries at the bottom 
And I can't do nothing right, they gon' always be at me 
I missed a Crain's interview, they tried leaking my addy 
I donate to the schools next, they call me a deadbeat daddy 
But Sun-Times gettin' that Rauner business 
I got a hit-list so long I don't know how to finish 
I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business 
Speaking of racist, fu*kyour microaggressions 
I'll make you fix your words like a typo suggestion 
Pat me on the back too hard and Pat'll ask for your job 
And in unrelated news, someone'll beat your ass at your job 
I'm the real deal 
Who taught all these rappers that a big deal's not a big deal? 
Inherited the earth, popped them wheelies on a big wheel 
My enemy lives in his mother's basement 
That's why my videos don't got no Baphomet product placement 
I'm a real one 
The honey is sweet, the apple's bitter 
They'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her 
And tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter 
I know the devil's a liar 
I know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters 
I know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return 
So I just hire a sitter 
I'm not no boss nigga, I'm a soldier 
Kingdom builder, man somebody shoulda told ya 
Fuck you 
Fuck you, fu-u-u-u-u-uck, fu*kfu*k you

Even better than I was the last time baby 
Oh oh oh oh ooh 
Yo we back 
I'm good, so good 
And we back and we back 
[verse 1] 
Rap's just make me anxious 
And acid made me crazy 
Them squares just made me looser 
And that wax just made me lazy 
And I still make this song 
And I'mma make another 
If you ever actually hit me 
Better watch out for my brother 
Better bet I'd take that deal 
Gotta watch out for my mother 
Get a watch with all that glitters 
Come in clutters, different colors 
Ben-a-baller, benford, butlers 
Chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter? 
Did a ton of drugs and did better 
Than all my alma mater 
Motherfucker money dance 
Hundreds zan, gallon lean 
Make a joke bout leno's hair 
Then piggy back on fallon's spleen 
Balancing on sporadicity 
And fucking pure joy 
Nightly searches for a bed 
And I just came off tour with troy 
But I can't complain 
I got some motherfucking bitches 
How many lab partners have 
I fucked since I got suspended? 
Mr 
bennett, you done did it 
You did it, you did it 
You did a good ass job 
You did a good ass job 
And I'm good

[verse 2] 
Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang 
Twerk, twerk, merge 
Swerve, dang, pick a lane 
Flip a bird; pigeon 
Plane, it's a word, it's a shame 
But god I'm good, swear I couldn't be better 
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames 
Keep a tab on my exes 
Keep some "x" on my tongue 
Keep my work out in texas 
That's just me flexing my lungs 
See them showing they teeth 
That's just them flapping they gums 
If they bite and I'm snapping 
Clap clap collapsing they lungs 
Call me chancelor the rapper 
Please say "the rapper" 
Magical word (poof) , please say 'kadabra 
Replay the replays; green bay, the packers 
Cremate your teammates 
And freebase the ashes 
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk till dawn 
It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch 
My stuff the fucking bomb 
I'm the motherfucking fucker 
Fuck a niggas fucking dumb 
This your favorite fucking album 
I ain't even fucking done 
I'm good! igh!

Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain 
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane 
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace 
Spineless bitches in backless dresses 
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless 
My weed seedless, my trees leafless 
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses 
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus 
Before I believed in not believing in 
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in 
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin 
My big homie died young; just turned older than him 
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always 
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways 
I trip to make the fall shorter 
Fall quarter was just a tall order 
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty 
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y 
And all my words just mean controversy 
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey? " 
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked 
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick 
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich 
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams 
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme 
Sometime the lies get millions of views 
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you? 
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view 
I think love is beautiful too 
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do 
For future hoopers dead from Rugers 
Shooting through the empty alley 
Could've threw him an alley-oop 
Helping him do good in school 
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya 
I still miss being a senior 
And performing at all those open mic events 
High schools, eyes closed seeing arenas 
And I still get jealous of Vic 
And Vic's still jealous of me 
But if you touch my brother 
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you 
And the rest of your team 
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler 
I only stop by to look through ya 
And I'm only getting greedier 
And I'm still Mr 
Youmedia 
And I still can't find Talent 
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck 
Mom still thinks I should go back to school 
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough 
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds 
And I still be asking God to show his face 
And I still be asking God to show his face 
I am a new man, I am sanctified 
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized 
I have been born again, I am the White Light

When I pull up outside, all night, no 
Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile 
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no 
Oh, now you wanna chill, oh, now you wanna build 
Oh, now you got the bill, that's cool though 
Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh 
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though 
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say 
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet 
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin? 
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride 
You just wanna talk about politics

Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat

I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic 
You should use your phone, call a uber 
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft 
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money 
No iou's or debit cards, I need cash money 
So back up, back up, I need space 
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race 
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now

This ain't no intro, this the entree 
Hit that intro with kanye and sound like andré 
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée 
She like music, she from houston like auntie yoncé 
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother 
If she ever find another, he better love her 
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it 
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh! 
It was a dream, you could not mess with the beam 
This is like this many rings 
Y'all know wha' mean? 
This for the kids of the king of all kings 
This is the holiest thing 
This is the beat that played under the word 
This is the sheep that ain't like what it herd

I get my word from the sermon 
I do not talk to the serpent 
That's the holistic discernment 
Daddy said I'm so determined 
Told me these goofies can't hurt me 
I just might make me some earl tea 
I was baptized like real early 
I might give satan a swirlie 
Wish I could tell you it's ready 
Tell you it's ready today 
They don't give nothing away 
You gotta fight for your way 
And that don't take nothing away 
Cause at the end of the day

Angels, na, na, na, na 
[verse 1: chance the rapper] 
I got my city doing front flips 
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship 
I guess that's why they call it where I stay 
Clean up the streets, so my daughter 
Can have somewhere to play 
I'm the blueprint to a real man 
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man 
I ain't goin' to hell or to hillman 
Igh, igh, igh, igh, for my real fans 
I got caught up with a little xan 
Can't stop me but it slow me though 
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though 
But every dj still play me though 
Damn man, I don't even need a radio 
And my new shit sound like a rodeo 
Got the old folks dancing the do-si-do 
'til they fuck around and sign me to ovo 
Ooh, I just might share my next one with keef 
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef 
This what it sound like when god split an atom with me 
I even had steve giving out apples for free 
[hook: saba] 
They was talking "woo woo this woo wap da bam" 
City so damn great, I feel like alexand' 
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion 
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded 
[post-hook: chance the rapper] 
Who is you? and who the fuck is you? and who is him? 
All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me 
Na, na, na, na I got angels 
I got angels 
[verse 2: chance the rapper] 
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade 
This for my day one, ten years, seven days 
A week, niggas never tired on they kevin gates 
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates 
It's too many young angels on the southside 
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside 
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown 
You gon' make me turn my bm to my housewife 
I just had a growth spurt 
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt 
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search 
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch 
Grandma say I'm kosher, momma say I'm culture 
Gci, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live 
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke 
Gci, 1-0-7-5, goin' live

I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs 
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled 
They want four minute songs 
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn 
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so nico grab you a horn 
Hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter 
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!

I speak of promised lands 
Soil as soft as momma's hands 
Running water, standing still 
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile 
Rice under black beans 
Walked into apple with cracked screens 
And told prophetic stories of freedom 
Found warmth in a black queen for when I get cold 
Like nat king, I'm doing the dad thing 
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood 
Make you remember how to smile good 
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label 
Pro-famous, I'm broadway joe namath 
Kanye's best prodigy 
He ain't signed me but he proud of me 
I got some ideas that you gotta see 
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the odyssey 
They never seen a rapper practice modesty 
I never practice, I only perform 
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn 
I speak to god in public, I speak to god in public 
He keep my rhymes in couplets 
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans 
I used to dance to michael, I used to dance in high school 
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music 
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be 
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some hebru brantleys 
You must've missed the come up, I must be all I can be 
Call me mister mufasa, I had to master stampedes

Okie dokie, alky, keep it lowkey like thor lil bro 
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour saudi 
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote 
If I sip any henny, my belly just might be outie 
Pull up inside a huggy, starsky and hutch a dougie

Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie 
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the higgs boson

I could still break your body down to five pieces 
like I did voltron 
Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a og 
Know me, I'm the obi-wan kenobi of the dope see 
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics 
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key 
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing 
If I don't know what I miss is 
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home 
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses 
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me 
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking 
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes 
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't cause I'm stanking

I used to be worse than worthless 
Now I'm worth hooks and verses 
I'm good like books in churches 
Harolds and Hooks and Churches 
Everything's Good 
See my name when you google search it 
Use a card when I make a purchase 
Everything's Good 
But I knew it was fly when I was just a caterpillar 
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla 
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin' 
And everything's good 
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin 
With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping 
Now I'm out working evenings birthdays even Tuesdays Wednesdays Thursdays weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events 
Damn it feel good to be a gangsta 
And it feel good for me to thank you 
Put money back in your bank account 
Off of songs I barely could think up 
Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up 
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound 
I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo 
Thanks Justin, lending them pencils 
Mr 
Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto 
The time I beat Chris on Nintendo 
Nanana hey hey, good intro 
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller 
Remember the first time you heard this dude and thought damn that's that nigga 
Everything's good</field>

The album feel like '92 
Then take that bomb for Heat, three-peat 
Chance, ho, I said, cruising on that Lsd 
Ask yourself about my deal 
You'll go batshit - "hell yeah, let's eat! " 
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words 
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard 
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack 
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies 'bout that bag

Young Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap 
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat 
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack 
Enforce the weed, I'm back to pack on hands 
With young Cletus to pat my back 
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right 
Just here to rap them songs 
Rag on my hair wrap, weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds 
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What? 
Well, I still bang with you 
Hang with you, sip drank with you 
As long as I can sang with you like 
Niggas please be focused - that 'Bino, you know this 
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6 
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your 'hood is so clit 
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit 
I'm a be that - Cg busy gettin', where the weed at? 
Bought your girl some new kneepads 
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag 
My stars, egad, she said: "this my favorite song" 
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot 
You blast this shit in Abercrombie 
When your work is finished 
Your mom won't play it in the car cause it's got cursing in it 
Your boy like: "I'm the one who showed you 
"he want his percentage 
Cause you were like 
"this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it? " 
Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake 
Why you laughing? Cause you Harlem Shake?

They ain't teaching taxes in school 
It don't even matter I was acting a fool 
But who would think the raps would turn into racks? 
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you 
Scars on my head, I'm the boy who lived 
The boy love playing when the boy too sick 
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help 
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself 
Last year got addicted to xans 
Started forgetting my name and started missing my chance 
La for four months end up leaving right back 
I'm in love with my city bitch I sleep in my hat 
I felt hog tied ever since my dog died 
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride 
I know he up there he just sit and he wait 
I'll be racing up the stairs I'mma get to the gate singing

Gimme the water, gimme the water 
I need the kind from space jam 
Get this money, get this budget, kok to day camp 
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end 
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends 
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on 
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone 
I've been getting blocked just trying 
To make songs with friends 
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends 
I got to pray I got to pray, like hammer after “2 legit” 
I got the power I could poke lucifer with crucifix 
I cannot scrap the stupid shit 
I “stand up” like I'm ludacris 
I know some folks that talk so much 
You'd think they drive an uber whip 
Damn, queen said why we in a queen bed 
I said it's yours don't worry little bean head 
I'm just here to catch my breath, I got a world tattoo 
She said cool just bring me some food

Part 2: drown 
[intro: eryn allen kane] 
The water may be deeper than it's ever been 
[verse 1: noname] 
Lord rain down on me so I can move on water 
Like children at the altar, like god inside my house 
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like mama 
You made a church out of feathers 
So when she fly to the father 
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid 
She gave my name away to your holy house 
She like my blessings in disguise 
She like her jesus mountain high 
So he can watch her lonely child 
I know my god 
I know my god seen his breaks and his edges 
Are jagged for giving that pain to his city in gold 
Like everything is everything 
Like all them days he prayed with me 
Like emptiness was tamed in me 
And all that was left was his love 
And all that was left was his love 
And all that was left was his love 
[chorus] 
Never, never drown 
The water may be deeper than it's ever been 
Never drown 
The water may be deeper than it's ever been 
Never drown 
[verse 2: kirk franklin] 
Never, never, never 
Chance let me in 
This thirst in my soul 
There's a thirst in my soul and tell me 
Where I stand I go 
Where 
For you 
Come on 
I may cry a river 
I may cry a thousand tears 
But you take each drop and you wash 
You wash me new 
Me new 
People sing 
This water is deep 
Yes 
This water is 
Yes and I need you to 
Jesus rescue me 
Come on, I need you to 
Take me to your mountain 
Hallelujah 
So someday chicago will be free 
Someday we'll all be free 
Be free

The water may be deeper than its ever been 
Never drown

Even better than I was the last time baby 
Oh oh oh oh ooh 
Yo we back 
I'm good, so good 
And we back and we back 
[verse 1] 
Rap's just make me anxious 
And acid made me crazy 
Them squares just made me looser 
And that wax just made me lazy 
And I still make this song 
And I'mma make another 
If you ever actually hit me 
Better watch out for my brother 
Better bet I'd take that deal 
Gotta watch out for my mother 
Get a watch with all that glitters 
Come in clutters, different colors 
Ben-a-baller, benford, butlers 
Chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter? 
Did a ton of drugs and did better 
Than all my alma mater 
Motherfucker money dance 
Hundreds zan, gallon lean 
Make a joke bout leno's hair 
Then piggy back on fallon's spleen 
Balancing on sporadicity 
And fucking pure joy 
Nightly searches for a bed 
And I just came off tour with troy 
But I can't complain 
I got some motherfucking bitches 
How many lab partners have 
I fucked since I got suspended? 
Mr 
bennett, you done did it 
You did it, you did it 
You did a good ass job 
You did a good ass job

Twerk, twerk, merge

Flip a bird; pigeon 
Plane, it's a word, it's a shame 
But god I'm good, swear I couldn't be better 
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames 
Keep a tab on my exes 
Keep some "x" on my tongue 
Keep my work out in texas 
That's just me flexing my lungs 
See them showing they teeth 
That's just them flapping they gums 
If they bite and I'm snapping 
Clap clap collapsing they lungs 
Call me chancelor the rapper 
Please say "the rapper" 
Magical word (poof) , please say 'kadabra 
Replay the replays; green bay, the packers 
Cremate your teammates 
And freebase the ashes 
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk till dawn 
It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch 
My stuff the fucking bomb 
I'm the motherfucking fucker 
Fuck a niggas fucking dumb 
This your favorite fucking album 
I ain't even fucking done

[verse 1: chance the rapper] 
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high 
Spit it spotify to qualify a spot on his side 
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies 
Lullabies and alibis 
The book don't end with malachi 
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen 
'til one score and three years 
From the third when he doesn't 
My village raised 'em a child 
Come through the crib and it's bustin' 
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins 
Shabach barak, edify 
Electrify the enemy like hedwig till he petrified 
Any petty peter petigrew could get the pesticide 
79Th, 79th, I don't believe in science 
I believe in signs 
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs 
Color white collar crime 
Good god, the gift of freedom 
Hosanna santa invoked and woke up slaves 
From southampton to chatham manor 
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm james early 
The type of worship make jesus come back a day early 
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed 
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me 
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery 
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody 
Exalt, exalt, glorify 
Descend upon the earth with swords 
And fortify the borders where your shorties lie 
I used to hide from god 
Ducked down in the slums like "shh" 
[verse 2: jay electronica] 
I was lost in the jungle like simba after the death of mufasa 
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day 
But I spent my night time fighting tears back 
I prayed and prayed and left messages 
But never got no hear back, or so it seemed 
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream 
I build the ark to gently, gently 
Row my boat down noah's stream 
Sometimes the path I took to reach 
My petty goals was so extreme 
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine 
But you was always there 
When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line 
From a lofty height we wage war 
On the poltergeist with the exalted christ 
Spark the dark with the pulse of light 
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life 
I spit on the tidal it's tidal waves 
I spit on the apple and kill a worm 
A fire in cali will swallow a valley 
For every african village burned 
Jay elect would've never made it 
O' son of man, o' son of man 
Who was the angel in revelations with a foot 
On water and a foot on land? 
Who was the angel that rode a harley from 
The project to the house of parliament 
And opened the book in the devil's chamber 
And put the true name of the lord in it? 
Old jerusalem, new jerusalem 
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire 
They poisoned the scriptures 
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs 
It was all a lie 
Mystery babylon, tumbling down 
Satan's establishment crumbling down 
This is the year that I come for the crown 
Bury my enemies under the ground</field>

I donate to the schools next, they call me a deadbeat daddy 
But Sun-Times gettin' that Rauner business

I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business 
Speaking of racist, fu*kyour microaggressions 
I'll make you fix your words like a typo suggestion 
Pat me on the back too hard and Pat'll ask for your job 
And in unrelated news, someone'll beat your ass at your job 
I'm the real deal 
Who taught all these rappers that a big deal's not a big deal? 
Inherited the earth, popped them wheelies on a big wheel 
My enemy lives in his mother's basement 
That's why my videos don't got no Baphomet product placement 
I'm a real one 
The honey is sweet, the apple's bitter 
They'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her 
And tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter 
I know the devil's a liar 
I know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters 
I know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return 
So I just hire a sitter

And then everybody wanna dip 
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth 
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth 
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits 
And the thirst just the worst it's the curse of the juice 
Juice, juice, juice, juice 
Yup

you used to know everything) 
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you 
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too 
Your big brother foot work 
Your play sister Juke 
The rink was the place but in that space and time 
I was too young for you 
As you were for me 
To worry about Frooties and Chews 
Till I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute 
And realized what booties can do 
We gon' get it poppin' 
We gon' get it Jukin' 
We gon' throw a party 
We ain't gotta do shit 
You came with your best friend 
Came up with for the weekend 
Rolling with your parties 
So tell me what you thinkin' 
So we gon' have a juke jam 
So we gon' have a juke jam 
We can have a party, just listening to music 
Like we used to do 
I'll get close to you 
I remember you 
You used to I remember you 
We've got so much history baby, maybe 
Maybe you and I were meant to be 
Maybe I'm crazy 
We never rolled at the rink 
We would just go to the rink 
You ain't buy tokens no more 
You just hit roll at the rink 
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him 
But when they play Take You Down, Chris Brown 
I am him standing 
I mean it's just dancing 
It's harmless as fuck 
Then I put my waist through your hips 
And your legs and your arms just to harness you up 
Then we hit the floor 
All the kitties start skating 
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do 
When they grown and they dating 
We've got so much history baby, maybe 
Maybe you and I were meant to be 
Maybe I'm crazy 
Crazy about you 
We gon' get it poppin' 
We gon' get it Jukin' 
We gon' throw a party 
We ain't gotta do shit 
You came with your best friend 
Who came up with for the weekend 
Rollin with the parties 
So tell me what you thinkin' 
So we gon' have a juke jam

I bumped heads with my dean 
Dropped out and hit the scene 
Now I'm stunting like bling 
Time and time again they told me no 
They told me I wouldn't go 
Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes 
Well, maybe that shit was my interest 
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist 
After 1night the folks thought I was finished 
I pin my name to the game like a seamstress 
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator 
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper 
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater 
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer 
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different

She don't got time for a whole 
Little bit of time that we have 
We used to purchase a half 
There's gon' be no time to smoke 
I'm always throwing on clothes 
She always throwing a fit 
We don't got no time for no sex 
I just put milk in the bowl 
She don't be cooking at all 
She just put weed in the bowl 
She don't have time for herself 
She putting points on the board, yes 
You know she carry her own 
You know she carry a child 
She wake up at crack of dawn 
She don't be cracking a smile 
So when she packing the bowl 
I grab her, I tell her

Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl 
We used to Netflix and roll 
I used to pass her the smoke 
She used to laugh at my jokes 
You pat my back when I choke 
Wish we were stuck in our ways 
We way too young to get old 
We stuck together like oowops 
We smoke to Fetty, sing ZooWap 
Traphouse 3, Guwop 
I shoulda knew when I grew up 
It would be no time at all 
We went from White Owls to Raws 
We went from joints to a bowl 
She need a second to breathe 
We need an actual smoke sesh

Slow it down for a second 
Take it down, ooh

I put some ice on your neck 
But I ain't holding you back

I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy 
You gotta move it slowly 
Take and eat my body like it's holy 
I've been waiting for you for the whole week 
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy 
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain 
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain 
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain 
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain 
I come to church for the candy 
your peppermints is the truth 
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you 
You look so good with that hat on 
had to match with the shoes 
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew 
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate 
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place 
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent 
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent 
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired 
Singin his praises daily basis so I gotta try it 
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain 
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute 
let me take my butt to church 
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain 
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain 
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain 
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain 
You gotta move it slowly 
Take and eat my body like it's holy 
I've been waiting for you for the whole week 
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy 
You gotta move it slowly 
Take and eat my body like it's holy 
I've been waiting for you for the whole week 
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy 
You gotta move it slowly 
Take and eat my body like it's holy 
I've been waiting for you for the whole week 
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy 
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain 
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain 
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain 
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Today I missed my workout, but it worked out 
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out 
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house 
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out 
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out 
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse 
I'ma my love on they mama, I hope it work out 
I hope it work out 
Luckily, my ex ugly 
I don't eat, so she can't get no lunch with me 
I don't reach, so she can't get in touch with me 
Can't be buds with me 
Don't know what to be 
She gon' cuss at me 
Told her "give it a rest, " so I keep custody 
Keep it all side-eyes and side-hugs with me 
I know that my girl's trust is a luxury 
I don't want my next album sounding all Usher-y 
But I must confess, I must confess 
For every single ex, I want the best 
I really wish you nothing but success 
I know it's gonna work out 
Doesn't it get dark, right before the sun peeks 
And bears his face? And doesn't it get so hard to breathe? 
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out 
With nothing left to give, with nothing left to say 
When no one says they're wrong, or sets the record straight 
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out 
That shit might hurt now, but I'm with her now 
Don't need closure now, just keep the shirt now 
Sorry you were led to believe 
Bunch of different stories that was never to be 
No you isn't ugly I just said it to be 
Funny we both know that you look better than me 
Sorry I started runnin' when you ran into me 
I'm just tryna be the kinda man I'ma be 
And I'm getting better gotta hand it to me 
Seem to always work out when you hand it to Jesus 
Today I missed my workout, but it worked out 
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out 
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house 
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out 
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out 
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse 
I'ma my love on they mama, I hope it work out 
I hope it work out 
I believe in long distance love, God that's above 
Bond that's so strong can't let y'all bald-headed 
Yeah, y'all interrupt, you all in a rush 
We all gon' meet up in the up, in the upper room 
If I run into em', I'll be ru-running to em' 
We could re-run the show, we could re-bump into 'em 
If we read the wrong one, we could re-jump the broom 
If we read the wrong one, baby we jump the groom 
I'm ready to be groomed 
I'm ready to assume, the position is filled 
I was ret since the womb 
I was not made for this, this was made for me 
And it's gonna work out 
Today I missed my workout, but it worked out 
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out 
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house 
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out 
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out 
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse 
I'ma my love on they mama, I hope it work out 
I hope it work out</field>

Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns 
Remember all the things that you and I did first? 
And now you're doing them with her 
Remember all the things that you and I did first? 
You got me, got me like this

And everywhere we went, come on!

Wa-want you, want you back 
Please, this ain't even jealousy 
She ain't got a thing on me 
Tryin' to rock with an ugly jeans, jeans, jeans 
You clearly didn't think this through 
If what I've been told is true 
You'll be crawling back like boo hoo hoo 
Remember all the things that you and I did first?

Remember all the things that you and I did first?

Cause best friends, best friends don't have to pretend 
You need a hand, and I'm right there right beside you 
You in the dark, I'll be the bright light to guide you 
'Member the times, times, times sneaking out the house 
All of the times, times, times that you had your doubts 
And don't forget all the trouble we got into 
We got something you can't undo, do 
Laughing so damn hard 
Crashed your dad's new car 
All the scars we share 
I promise, I swear 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
That you got a home for now and forever 
And if you get low, just call me whenever 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather 
And we'll never change, no matter the weather 
This is my oath to you 
I know I drive you crazy, hmm.. 
sometimes 
I know I call you lazy, and that's most times 
But you complete me, and that's no lie 
You are my tuxedo, and I'm your bow tie 
We're in the car, singin', singin', singin' our song 
Walk in the building, tear it down, like we're King Kong 
And in my eyes you could do, do no wrong 
You got a best friend sing, sing, sing along 
Laughing so damn hard 
Crashed your dad's new car 
All the scars we share 
I promise, I swear 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
That you got a home for now and forever 
And if you get low, just call me whenever 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather 
And we'll never change, no matter the weather 
This is my oath to you 
Ohhh.. 
I'll never let you go 
Ohhh.. 
Woah, this is my oath to you 
Ohhh.. 
Just thought that you should know 
Ohhh.. 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
That you got a home for now and forever 
And if you get low, just call me whenever 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather 
And we'll never change, no matter the weather 
This is my oath to you 
Ohhh... 
You should know, you should know, 
You should know, you should know, yeah. 
Ohhh.. 
Woah, this is my oath to you

Wherever you go just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather

For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
So stand up 
Show 'em how we do it 
Won't back down until I see your, hands up 
Tell 'em what the truth is 
Stand behind the music 
You gotta get behind 
Cross your heart, hope to die 
Splash a hype, dash a pretty that don't mean I'll buy 
Okay alright already, they getting money 
All the frauds, all the phonies, all the fakes, slow down 
It's a fast pace world, breathe 
Look my face in the mirror 
Say, "Who the heck am I?" 
Look me in the eye 
Is this conviction or addiction or a waste of time? 
Just name a genre 
Yeah I've tried it 
Been doin' this from 15 to life, yeah 
I need a break already 
I gotta find it 
And for the first time in my life, I'm doing my sh-t 
I, I, I, I wanna stand up in this block stop burning 
Girls getting crazed, looking naked, looking spaded 
Chew it up, make my teeth rot 
You think I'm talkin' to ya? 
I'm probably not, nah 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
When I was a little younger 
Lookin' for a label and a little clean danger 
Ellie had a taste for a new adventure 
Open every 'do not enter' 
Yeah I was tryin' hard to be somebody 
Be the cool kid at the party 
Lookin' at me laddy daddy, hottie hottie, hot tamale 
Stranger sizing up my body 
Told me I could be somebody 
Wait, someone stopped me, went home and I called my mommy 
I know I'm not that girl 
I still wanna be the leader of a free world 
Yeah I'm a big dreamer 
I'm a believer 
Just try to tell me no, I'm a go full steamer 
No, can't slow me down 
.. 
this down from the inside out 
Block by block from the bottom to the top 
I know just who I am 
And I know just who I'm not 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
So stand up, show 'em how we do it 
Won't back down until I see your hands up 
Tell 'em what the truth is

Yeah, stand up, come on let me see your 
Front row to the nose bleeders 
Hands up, if you really need it 
Stand behind the music

The future seemed so bright 
Even angels have their wicked schemes 
And you take that to new extremes 
But you'll always be my hero 
Even though you've lost your mind 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry 
But that's all right because 
I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
I can't tell you what it really is 
I can only tell you what it feels like 
And right now it´s a steel knife in my windpipe 
I can´t breathe but I still fight while I can fight 
As long as the wrong feels right it´s like I'm in 
flight 
Angels have their wicked schemes 
And you take that to new extremes 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry 
But that's all right because 
I love the way you lie

I'm getting weaker every day 
I carry the weight of you 
I carry the weight of you 
Lay down here 
Beside me in the shallow water 
Beside me when the sun is shining on us still 
Lay down here 
Beside me me in the hallowed water 
Beside me when the silver lining stays 
Until the sirens' calling 
We followed the sun down low 'till we hit the night 
And you hold me so tightly 
It's hard to breathe 
And I'm tired, I'm growing older 
I'm getting weaker every day

You deserve it 
Uh-huh

Baby, I've seen the chick you're with 
Wish that I never did 
Freaking perfect, and five foot ten 
Just wanna punch her lip 
Cause I know I've been wasting time 
Tryin'ta catch your eye 
Yeah I know that I've been so blind 
Thinking that I'm your type 
And now I'm at home, I'm all alone 
'Bout to pick up the telephone 
Got to call my genie so he knows, yeah 
I wish I was tall 
I wish I was fast 
I wish I could shop with a bag of cash 
Cause If I want you, I gotta have that 
(Come, come kiss me boy) 
I wish I had style, I wish I had flash 
I wish I woke up with a butt and a rack 
Cause If I want you, I gotta have that 
(Come, come kiss me boy) 
(uh-huh, yeah) 
Baby, I'm gonna keep it real 
Boy, you're the one I want 
I don't own any five inch heels, just got my Nikes on 
Never thought I was insecure 
Boy look at what you've done 
I don't know what to studied for 
Clearly you like 'em dumb 
And now I'm at home, I'm all alone 
'Bout to pick up the telephone 
Got to call my genie so he knows, yeah

Hey now don't you wanna do somethin' baby? 
With the roof gone 
Aston Martin look retarded like the coupe gone crazy 
I'm not sure what kind of fella you like 
But I can get you paradise 
Have it however you like 
I'm talking solitaire iced out 
Ring, watch, necklace 
Ain't no talking reckless 
Girl I'm certified respected girl 
You like to run your mouth 
Well you about to learn a lesson, girl 
Yeah you're the one 
But I'll replace you in a second girl 
And I ain't even trying to see you naked girl 
Wait, there I go exaggerate 
Clearly carried away 
But what I'm saying you could true that 
I wanna be wherever you at 
So you wishing you could kiss me 
Do you really wanna do that? 
Make a wish girl 
I wish I was tall 
I wish I was fast 
I wish I could shop with a bag of cash 
Cause If I want you, I gotta have that 
(Come, come kiss me boy) 
I wish I had style, I wish I had flash 
I wish I woke up with a butt and a rack 
Cause If I want you, I gotta have that

Explosive, you don't even know it, I want you to know it

You got this swag, you got this attitude 
Wanna hear you say my name 
'Cause you got me 
Flying with your love 
Shining with your love, riding with your love 
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love 
One hit with your love 
Can't quit with your love, so sick but so what 
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love 
Everybody wants what I got with you 
'Cause I'm standing on top with a killer view 
Inspired feeling like a million, I'm one in a million 
I'm one in a million, million, million 
I ain't even here I'm in outer space 
Like I'm Venus you're Mars in the milky way 
It's crazy, what you're doing to me, how you do it to me 
How you do it to me, to me, to me

I need somebody who can take care of this 
I'm loving what you do, cause I know you do it well 
You got your game tight, real smart I can tell 
Please don't play that usual game, (the usual game) 
The type to put out your flame 
I don't wanna shed a tear 
And I didn't wanna end up here 
Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down, 
I didn't wanna end up here 
Yeah I went through your phone and didn't like what I've seen 
You promised you'd be true you made a fool at of me 
My friends tried to warn me that I'd waste my time 
I saw your true colours almost lost my mind 
Looks like you do the same to all your other girls, 
Except you brought her flowers and you brought me pearls 
When you're going out tonight, I know you're seeing her again 
Saw your picture together, so now you're kissing all your friends 
Please don't play that usual game, (the usual game)

Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down,

Slipped right through your hands, now my heart is broken

            <field name="lyrics">What's wrong with the world mama? 
People living like aint got no mamas 
I think the whole worlds addicted to the drama 
Only attracted to the things that bring you trauma 
Overseas yeah we tryin to stop terrorism 
But we still got terrorists here livin 
In the USA the big CIA the Bloodz and the Crips and the KKK 
But if you only have love for your own race 
Then you only leave space to discriminate 
And to discriminate only generates hate 
And if you hatin you're bound to get irate 
Yeah madness is what you demonstrate 
And that's exactly how anger works and operates 
You gotta have love just to set it straight 
Take control of your mind and meditate 
Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father Father Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the love2x) 
It just ain't the same all ways have changed 
New days are strange is the world the insane? 
If love and peace so strong 
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong 
Nations dropping bombs 
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones 
With ongoing suffering 
As the youth die young 
So ask yourself is the loving really strong? 
So I can ask myself really what is going wrong 
With this world that we living in 
People keep on giving in 
Makin wrong decisions 
Only visions of them livin and 
Not respecting each other 
Deny thy brother 
The wars' going on but the reasons' undercover 
The truth is kept secret 
Swept under the rug 
If you never know truth 
Then you never know love 
Where's the love y'all?(I don't know) 
Where's the truth y'all?(I don't know) 
Where's the love y'all? 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father father father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the lovex2) 
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder 
As I'm getting older y'all people get colder 
Most of us only care about money makin 
Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction 
Wrong information always shown by the media 
Negative images is the main criteria 
Infecting their young minds faster than bacteria 
Kids wanna act like what the see in the cinema 
Whatever happened to the values of humanity 
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality 
Instead of spreading love, we're spreading anomosity 
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down 
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under 
I gotta keep my faith alive, until love is found 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father Father Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(fade)</field>

Don't wanna pick it up 
I'm so scared 
I'm gonna say too much 
I tip toe around your questions 
Why you gotta dig so deep? 
Tears fall 
And the glasses break 
Inside these walls 
The floor boards shake 
From outside 
It's alright 
Long as you looking from fifty feet 
I been trying, trying 
Hold my head up high 
I been lying, lying 
Keeping it all inside 
Trying not to trust you, yeah 
Take another leaf, I'm broke yeah, yeah? 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
A doll house is all that you could see 
But it's so far from my reality 
I got problems, I got issues 
Sometimes it's all too much for me 
Wrap it up with a pretty little bow 
But there are some things you can't sugarcoat 
Give it to you anyway 
Even though it won't taste so sweet 
I been trying, trying 
Hold my head up high 
I been lying, lying 
Keeping it all inside 
Maybe I could trust you, yeah 
Take another leaf, I'm broke yeah, yeah? 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Sick of all the fighting 
All the slamming of the doors 
The pain, the parents, too deep you know 
Step back, step back 
Can you see it through my eyes? 
I know, I know 
Maybe a surprise 
Don't wanna be perceived for something that I'm not 
Just wanna be accepted for the little that I got 
If you could see me now in my glass house 
Not ready to let you in 
Not ready to let you in 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me

Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me

Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Just doing my thing 
and I won't come down. 
I'm over the moon 
No silver spoon in my milky way 
When Simon told me I was trouble 
All I said is 'okay' 
Now let me turn my swag on 
And step up to the plate 
Then put London in my pocket 
Up, up, up and away 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
I wanna get so far that I see you soon 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
and I won't come down! 
I'm over the moon 
So watch your head 
Cuz I'm throwing rocks 
It feels like red bull gave me wings 
And I can't be stopped 
See I rhyme like a beast 
But I sing like a flower 
I feeling tall so tall like the Eiffel Tower 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
I wanna get so far that I see you 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
and I won't come down! 
Floating in space 
I love this place 
E.T's says Hey 
My mind's so clear 
This atmosphere 
I got no fear 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm Over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
And I won't come down 
I'm Over the moon, haha</field>

What if there's no forever? 
Would you kiss me goodnight? 
So that I could remember? 
Keep you frozen in time 
Like they do in the pictures 
And if I close my eyes 
Would I still think of patience? 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight? 
What if daddy was right? 
And I knew all the answers? 
But they could give me the world 
But that wouldn't matter 
And if the gates open wide, and make you an angel 
Two tears in my eyes, I'd save you're seat at the table 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?</field>

No need to try to be a hero

You've got a little bit of Tarzan 
Let it all out, yeah let it all out, my baby 
This ain't the thrill I've been chasing 
I wanna find out, I wanna find out my baby 
You're always so nice, I'm getting bored 
You say the right things, I'm getting bored 
And you always call first, I'm getting bored 
Yeah, I'm getting bored 
So sick of the good boys, I need wild boys 
Something unpredictable 
Go ahead be a caveman 
Give me all your dirty love 
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one 
Something unreliable 
Go ahead be a caveman 
Give me all your dirty love 
You wanna treat me like a lady 
Don't even try, no don't even try my baby 
Ain't gotta say that you need me 
Keep it inside, yeah keep it inside my baby 
I know I sound a little twisted 
But maybe I am or maybe I'm not but baby 
Playing the game is so addictive 
Don't want it to stop, don't want it to stop my baby 
You're always so nice, I'm getting bored 
You say the right things, I'm getting bored

Bad day you got seeing red 
Wanted to feel the sun on your back 
But it rained on your head instead 
But on the bright side 
Despite this hassle wet sand 
Makes for a better sand castle 
Inhale 
Exhale, just take a breath 
I know that things don't always happen like they should 
Gotta learn to roll with punches 
And just say it's all good 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching 
In the final round 
Fight your hardest, but lose 
It's like shouting out 
When nobody can hear you 
But when it's all said and done 
It's all good 
It's all good, it's all good! 
Woke up on the wrong side of bed 
Gotta get the work done 
And then some, gotta busy day ahead 
But on the bright side work hard, play harder 
Tomorrow's full of laughter 
Inhale 
Exhale, just take a breath 
I know that things don't happen as they should 
Gotta learn to roll with punches 
And just say it's all good 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching 
In the final round 
Fight your hardest, but lose 
It's like shouting out 
When nobody can hear you 
But when it's all said and done 
It's all good 
It's all good, it's all good! 
It's all good, it's all good 
It's all good 
It's all good! 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
They'll be bumps in the road 
Things will go out of control 
But you can't let it get you down 
When your rights just goes wrong 
Just often keep pushing on 
It's all good claim it here and now 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching 
In the final round 
Fight your hardest, but lose 
It's like shouting out 
When nobody can hear you 
But when it's all said and done 
It's all good 
It's all good, it's all good

'Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you 
It's a wicked game that you're making me play 
(making me play) 
Where I crawl back home as you're walking away 
(Hey, Hey) 
And it's all quite clear what you want me to say

For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
So stand up 
Show 'em how we do it 
Won't back down until I see your, hands up 
Tell 'em what the truth is 
Stand behind the music 
You gotta get behind 
Cross your heart, hope to die 
Splash a hype, dash a pretty that don't mean I'll buy 
Okay alright already, they getting money 
All the frauds, all the phonies, all the fakes, slow down 
It's a fast pace world, breathe 
Look my face in the mirror 
Say, "Who the heck am I?" 
Look me in the eye 
Is this conviction or addiction or a waste of time? 
Just name a genre 
Yeah I've tried it 
Been doin' this from 15 to life, yeah 
I need a break already 
I gotta find it 
And for the first time in my life, I'm doing my sh-t 
I, I, I, I wanna stand up in this block stop burning 
Girls getting crazed, looking naked, looking spaded 
Chew it up, make my teeth rot 
You think I'm talkin' to ya? 
I'm probably not, nah 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
When I was a little younger 
Lookin' for a label and a little clean danger 
Ellie had a taste for a new adventure 
Open every 'do not enter' 
Yeah I was tryin' hard to be somebody 
Be the cool kid at the party 
Lookin' at me laddy daddy, hottie hottie, hot tamale 
Stranger sizing up my body 
Told me I could be somebody 
Wait, someone stopped me, went home and I called my mommy 
I know I'm not that girl 
I still wanna be the leader of a free world 
Yeah I'm a big dreamer 
I'm a believer 
Just try to tell me no, I'm a go full steamer 
No, can't slow me down 
.. 
this down from the inside out 
Block by block from the bottom to the top 
I know just who I am 
And I know just who I'm not 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
So stand up, show 'em how we do it 
Won't back down until I see your hands up 
Tell 'em what the truth is 
Stand behind the music 
Yeah, stand up, come on let me see your 
Front row to the nose bleeders 
Hands up, if you really need it 
Stand behind the music 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long

If you don't whether the storm 
You'll get caught up in the wind 
If love is a war 
Then I'll be your soldier

You'll be my saviour

I'm holding on 
You're holding on

You look me deep in the eyes 
I can feel my heart racing now 
It's like you can read my mind 
When I struggle to scream it out 
Knock me down to the floor 
But I still want more 
And only time will tell 
You brought me back to life 
But only to kill me now 
If love is a war 
Then I'll be your soldier 
And if I fall 
You'll be my saviour

I keep dancin' on my own 
I'm just gonna dance all night 
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line 
Stilettos and broken bottles

Let it all out, yeah let it all out, my baby 
This ain't the thrill I've been chasing

So sick of the good boys, I need wild boys 
Something unpredictable 
Go ahead be a caveman 
Give me all your dirty love 
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one 
Something unreliable 
Go ahead be a caveman 
Give me all your dirty love 
You wanna treat me like a lady 
Don't even try, no don't even try my baby 
Ain't gotta say that you need me 
Keep it inside, yeah keep it inside my baby 
I know I sound a little twisted 
But maybe I am or maybe I'm not but baby 
Playing the game is so addictive 
Don't want it to stop, don't want it to stop my baby

Hide some aces up your sleeve 
Have you no idea that you're in deep? 
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week 
How many secrets can you keep? 
'Cause there's this tune I've found 
That makes me think of you somehow 
When I play it on repeat 
Until I fall asleep 
Spilling drinks on my settee 
(Do I wanna know?) 
If this feeling flows both ways 
(Sad to see you go) 
Sort of hoping that you'd stay 
(Baby we both know) 
That the nights were mainly made for saying things 
That you can't say tomorrow day 
Crawling back to you 
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? 
Cause I always do 
Baby, I'm too 
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new 
Now I've thought it through 
Crawling back to you 
So have you got the guts? 
Been wondering if your heart's still open 
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts 
Simmer down and pucker up 
I'm sorry to interrupt 
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying 
To kiss you 
I don't know if you 
Feel the same as I do 
But we could be together 
If you wanted to

There's no finding anything like this, common yo shining 
I know their watching me like they got no eyelids 
Kid in 'em like whatever it is, 
Are you ever gonna quit then you never live with this, I'm cold 
Got mc's that have Ben in the game 
For 10 years depressed and stressed thinkin I'm old 
I'm a deep guy and highly streetwise 
I always speak life just how it is I roll 
Nothing but slugs on the track

Could you be the devil, could you be an angel 
Your touch, magnetizing 
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing 
They say be afraid 
You're not like the others, futuristic lover 
Different dna, they don't understand you 
You're from a whole 'nother world 
A different dimension 
You open my eyes 
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light 
Kiss me, kiss me 
Infect me with your loving, fill me with your poison 
Take me, take me 
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction 
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign 
It's supernatural, extra-terrestrial 
You're so supersonic 
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your laser 
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic 
You're from a whole 'nother world 
A different dimension 
You open my eyes 
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light 
Kiss me, kiss me 
Infect me with your loving, fill me with your poison 
Take me, take me 
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction 
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign 
It's supernatural, extra-terrestrial 
This is transcendental, on another level 
Boy, you're my lucky star 
I wanna walk on your wavelength 
And be there when you vibrate 
For you I'll risk it all 
Kiss me, kiss me 
Infect me with your loving 
fill me with your poison 
Take me, take me 
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction 
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign 
It's supernatural, extra-terrestrial 
Extra-terrestrial 
Extra-terrestrial 
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign 
It's supernatural, extra-terrestrial</field>

Loving what you do boy we ought to paint the town 
You can watch me get to it double roll and lean 
Make up your mind if your liking what you see 
Don't want no flowers, don't buy me no gifts 
I need somebody who can take care of this 
I'm loving what you do, cause I know you do it well 
You got your game tight, real smart I can tell 
Please don't play that usual game, (the usual game) 
The type to put out your flame 
I don't wanna shed a tear 
And I didn't wanna end up here 
Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down, 
I didn't wanna end up here 
Yeah I went through your phone and didn't like what I've seen 
You promised you'd be true you made a fool at of me 
My friends tried to warn me that I'd waste my time 
I saw your true colours almost lost my mind 
Looks like you do the same to all your other girls, 
Except you brought her flowers and you brought me pearls 
When you're going out tonight, I know you're seeing her again 
Saw your picture together, so now you're kissing all your friends 
Please don't play that usual game, (the usual game) 
The type to put out your flame 
I don't wanna shed a tear 
And I didn't wanna end up here 
Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down, 
I didn't wanna end up here 
If I don't leave right now, with my wounds still open 
Slipped right through your hands, now my heart is broken 
I'm moving on, yeah, yeah, I'm moving on, yeah, yeah 
I'm moving on, yeah, yeah, I'm moving on 
I don't wanna shed a tear 
And I didn't wanna end up here 
Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down, 
I didn't wanna end up here</field>

Take my hand 
Why are we 
Strangers when 
Our love's strong 
Why carry on without me? 
Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face 
It's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 
I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 
And everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face 
You're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby</field>

What if there's no forever? 
Would you kiss me goodnight? 
So that I could remember? 
Keep you frozen in time 
Like they do in the pictures 
And if I close my eyes 
Would I still think of patience? 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight? 
What if daddy was right? 
And I knew all the answers? 
But they could give me the world 
But that wouldn't matter 
And if the gates open wide, and make you an angel 
Two tears in my eyes, I'd save you're seat at the table 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?</field>

We doing stuff that we don't ever have to tell our moms 
Love the stuff we got it 
We got it all up in the room

[Busta Rhymes] 
Bullseye again 
I got 'em in a target, put 'em in a pocket, put 'em on a market 
That's the way we did 
You can see the way I walk and I talk 
Every time I show her what I got 
I'm sprung, I don't want to grow up, forever young 
Why I don't ever wanna leave you 
Better believe me, trust me, she is the one 
Gonna make all the people get up in the hard papers 
Wanna hear it that? Are we gonna dump like this? 
Leaning bend the body on the run 
And then they gotta turn and twist 
I guess it's time for pictures in my closet 
I can do this to the infinity 
We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Show everybody who runs this town 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way

So you think that you know me 
You're the only one who knows who I am 
I decided to let that I'm breaking 
All the chains on my throne imperfection 
Could it be that easy to let it all go? 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
Everything you think it's perfect 
Isn't always so 
Many times, many times 
I wouldn't let my feelings show 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
You know I'm just human, human, human after all 
You know I'm just human, human, human after all 
Slowly, slowly 
I'm okay in revealing 
Scars you see I wear them proud in the end 
I decided tonight that I'm wasting 
Too much thought on the art of perception 
Could it be that easy to let it all go? 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
Everything you think it's perfect 
Isn't always so 
Many times, many times 
I wouldn't let my feelings show 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
You know I'm just tired of the weight 
Of the world on my shoulders 
Baby you know I'm sick of always carrying it for you 
Used to be a superwoman now that's over, over 
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, baby, I'm a soldier 
Doesn't mean that I could be everything for you 
Used to be a superwoman now that's over, over 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
Everything you think it's perfect 
Isn't always so 
Many times, many times 
I wouldn't let my feelings show 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold

You know I'm just human, human, human after all</field>

Two hearts with accurate devotions 
OOh but what are feelings without emotions? 
I'm going in for the kill 
I'm doing it for a thrill 
I'm hoping you'll understand 
And not let go of my hand 
(x2) 
I hang my hopes out on the line 
OOh will they be ready for you in time? 
If you leave them out too long 
OOh they'll be withered by the sun 
Full stops and exclamation marks 
Ooh my words stumble before I start 
How far can you send emotions? 
Can this bridge cross the ocean? 
I'm going in for the kill 
I'm doing it for a thrill 
I'm hoping you'll understand 
And not let go of my hand

Bad day you got seeing red 
Wanted to feel the sun on your back 
But it rained on your head instead 
But on the bright side 
Despite this hassle wet sand 
Makes for a better sand castle 
Inhale 
Exhale, just take a breath 
I know that things don't always happen like they should 
Gotta learn to roll with punches 
And just say it's all good 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching 
In the final round 
Fight your hardest, but lose 
It's like shouting out 
When nobody can hear you 
But when it's all said and done 
It's all good 
It's all good, it's all good! 
Woke up on the wrong side of bed 
Gotta get the work done 
And then some, gotta busy day ahead 
But on the bright side work hard, play harder 
Tomorrow's full of laughter 
Inhale 
Exhale, just take a breath 
I know that things don't happen as they should 
Gotta learn to roll with punches 
And just say it's all good 
Cause it's like falling down

They'll be bumps in the road 
Things will go out of control 
But you can't let it get you down 
When your rights just goes wrong 
Just often keep pushing on 
It's all good claim it here and now 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching

Even though I'm wrong, just be mine 
Be my lover boy, be my spark 
Be my fire boy in the dark 
Even though I'm out in the night 
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine, boy 
Just be mine, just be mine 
Just be mine, just be mine, boy 
I want you like 
Uh uh uh uh ah ah ah ah 
Sometimes, I'm a crazy chick 
Doing things that'll make you sick 
But I get away with it 
I don't mean to hurt you but I do 
You say that I make you wait 
That's true 'cause I make you wait 
Just one of the things you hate 
I don't mean to hurt you but I do 
Be my buttercup, be my star 
Beat it like a drum, beat it hard 
Even though I'm out in the night 
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine 
Be my lover boy, be my spark 
Be my fire boy in the dark 
Even though I'm out in the night 
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine, boy 
Just be mine, just be mine 
Just be mine, just be mine, boy 
I want you like 
Uh uh uh uh ah ah ah ah 
I always messed up (I'm sorry) 
I really need you now (I'm sorry) 
I just can't help myself (So naughty) 
Uh uh uh, so naughty 
I always messed up (I'm sorry) 
I really need you now (I'm sorry)

Wild hearts making the mistakes 
Switched up, but we never face 
Get down, we don't play it safe

I don't make excuses when I lose my way

Don't wanna pick it up 
I'm so scared 
I'm gonna say too much 
I tip toe around your questions 
Why you gotta dig so deep? 
Tears fall 
And the glasses break 
Inside these walls 
The floor boards shake 
From outside 
It's alright 
Long as you looking from fifty feet 
I been trying, trying 
Hold my head up high 
I been lying, lying 
Keeping it all inside 
Trying not to trust you, yeah 
Take another leaf, I'm broke yeah, yeah? 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
A doll house is all that you could see 
But it's so far from my reality 
I got problems, I got issues 
Sometimes it's all too much for me 
Wrap it up with a pretty little bow 
But there are some things you can't sugarcoat 
Give it to you anyway 
Even though it won't taste so sweet 
I been trying, trying 
Hold my head up high 
I been lying, lying 
Keeping it all inside 
Maybe I could trust you, yeah 
Take another leaf, I'm broke yeah, yeah? 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Sick of all the fighting 
All the slamming of the doors 
The pain, the parents, too deep you know 
Step back, step back 
Can you see it through my eyes? 
I know, I know 
Maybe a surprise 
Don't wanna be perceived for something that I'm not 
Just wanna be accepted for the little that I got 
If you could see me now in my glass house 
Not ready to let you in 
Not ready to let you in 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me

The future seemed so bright 
Even angels have their wicked schemes 
And you take that to new extremes 
But you'll always be my hero 
Even though you've lost your mind 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry 
But that's all right because 
I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
I can't tell you what it really is 
I can only tell you what it feels like 
And right now it´s a steel knife in my windpipe 
I can´t breathe but I still fight while I can fight 
As long as the wrong feels right it´s like I'm in 
flight 
Angels have their wicked schemes 
And you take that to new extremes 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

So we dance, and we dance like you're just not there 
'Cause ew, what's wrong with you? 
No, the problem is not my attitude 
But you, ew, just not my type 
But the next time I won't be so polite 
'Cause hey, this could be great 
This could be crazy 
This could be the mother fucking party of the year 
Trying too hard, tryna be hot 
Trying to keep talking to us but we don't care 
Keep it all in your pants, boy 
Keep it all in your pants, boy 
This could be the mother fucking party of the year

That it ain't gonna work

Yeah, hello, goodbye 
Get a hold of yourself before I lose it 
Baby, laugh all you like

'Member the times, times, times sneaking out the house 
All of the times, times, times that you had your doubts

We got something you can't undo, do

Crashed your dad's new car 
All the scars we share 
I promise, I swear 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
That you got a home for now and forever 
And if you get low, just call me whenever 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather 
And we'll never change, no matter the weather 
This is my oath to you 
I know I drive you crazy, hmm.. 
sometimes 
I know I call you lazy, and that's most times 
But you complete me, and that's no lie 
You are my tuxedo, and I'm your bow tie 
We're in the car, singin', singin', singin' our song 
Walk in the building, tear it down, like we're King Kong

You got a best friend sing, sing, sing along

With my five star view 
I wanna get so far that I see you soon 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
and I won't come down! 
I'm over the moon 
So watch your head 
Cuz I'm throwing rocks 
It feels like red bull gave me wings 
And I can't be stopped 
See I rhyme like a beast 
But I sing like a flower 
I feeling tall so tall like the Eiffel Tower 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
I wanna get so far that I see you 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
and I won't come down! 
Floating in space 
I love this place 
E.T's says Hey 
My mind's so clear 
This atmosphere 
I got no fear 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm Over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
And I won't come down 
I'm Over the moon, haha</field>

Hands down in the dirt, don’t come clean

'Cause your momma never taught you nothing 
Call Pharell, 'cause you keep on “Fronting”

No playa boi can win my love 
It’s sweetness that I’m thinking of 
He gotta to lean with a gangsta stance 
He need to rock all the sickest brands 
And give me love, not a bad romance 
I’ll make a move, nothing left to chance 
So, don’t you mess with me 
Can’t touch me, liar, I’m fire 
You and all your tricks expired 
Your ride really needs new tires 
(Vruuuum, tires) 
You like my kicks? Let me kick ya 
Like a “Twilight” fan, Imma bite ya 
Turn around, let me Cee-Lo “Forget Ya”

Cut to the pushing, with your heart, and then she ran away 
I guess you shoulda known, I guess you shoulda known 
That I would talk, I would talk

You dont deserve to know the way I used to think about you 
Oh not anymore, oh not anymore 
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go 
Now if we meet out on the street I wont be running scared 
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air 
And make you understand, and make you understand 
You had your chance, had your chance

Would I still think of patience? 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight? 
What if daddy was right? 
And I knew all the answers? 
They could give me the world 
But that wouldn't matter 
If the gates opened wide, and made you an angel 
Through tears in my eyes 
I'd save your seat at the table 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?</field>

Lay down here

Until the sirens' calling 
We followed the sun down low 'till we hit the night

It's hard to breathe

Don't be insecure 
And tell the truth

How I was such a sad case,

Went to sleep a superhero,

No-body see how I'm acting 
You hurt me, you hurt me 
And no not phisically, 
Ain't got no bumps or bruisers 
To show people what you're doing to me 
I thought it would be 
Ok but you see, 
I heard everything you said

I knew that you'd turn out to be a sad case 
You said you could save me,

You've got me 
Using all my kung fu tricks, tricks 
Hit 'em with a round house kick to the tempo, 
1, 2, 3, 4, Hung-hi-ho, t.k.o., taekwondo, 
You know 
When you see that hand go chop 
Everything stops, 
The flow so hot, 
Like steam from a coffe pot 
Rush hour, no traffic, 
No jalei, just jackie, 
You're acted like you stayed behind 
Go re-up on your classics, 
You all fake all wanna be superman, 
Give Clark Kent back his glasses, man 
I hit you with a judo kick so fast, 
You look back like 'what happened?' 
I-I-I, don't wanna fi-I-ight,

Count that money, get your game up 
You're a hater, just let it go 
Swagger jagger, swagger jagger

            <field name="lyrics">Tell me what do you see in her 
Cause I've been living in sweet despair 
I don't really know what's in the cards of life 
All I really know is my tears won't dry tonight 
Love was hidden within your smoke 
Blinding lights and disheartened hope 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake, is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
Run away, don't need you anyway 
Although I wish you'd stay 
Go on put the knife in 
You've been foolish 
And I've been stupid 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake, is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
I hear voices inside my head 
Something's different inside this bed 
I don't really know what's in the cards of life 
All I really know is my tears won't dry tonight 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake, is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
Run away, don't need you anyway 
Although I wish you'd stay 
Go on put the knife in 
You've been foolish 
And I've been stupid 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
I'll be crying you'll be screaming 
I'll come crumbling down 
Just the of thought you and I 
Another face in the crowd 
I'd rather wake up in an empty house than this 
battle ground 
I'm on my own now, I'm on my own now 
You'll be sorry, I won't worry 
I'm Ok with it now 
Just remember what you did and how it didn't work out 
I'd rather wake up in an empty house than this 
battle ground 
You're on your own now, you're on your own now 
One mistake is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
One mistake, is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
Run away, don't need you anyway 
Although I wish you'd stay 
Go on put the knife in 
You've been foolish 
And I've been stupid 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in</field>

The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line 
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat 
My mother told me 
If I was goody 
That she would but me 
A rubber dolly 
My auntie told her 
I'd kissed a soldier 
Now she would buy me 
A rubber dolly 
Clap, clap 
And put in your father's hands 
And put in your father's hands 
Get your freak on, get your freak on 
Getchi, getchi, getchi, get that freak on 
Missy put that down, I'm a hottest round 
I tell your mother 
I'm a good now listen to me now 
I'm less than 20 rounds 
And if you want me better get to know 
Is she with me now, the piggy piggy bow 
I know you see the way I switch switch 
Switchy style, I love, the piggy jump around 
People get around 
My mother told me 
If I was goody

We used to be but now there's separation between 
You and me, baby I'm moving on to another girl 
That understands me more 
Takes in front of the place so you can see it all 
I remember the times when we used to bond 
But I never realized that you wanted to be mine 
So I gave her the ring instead of you 
Nickname too 
I can tell that you upset because it ain't you 
Met a new girl and I gave her my heart 
Not noticing that you wanted me from the very start 
You want me back, we can just be friends 
Or try this thing all over again 
C'mon! 
Boy you can say anything you wanna

We in the goon grade, goose with the sprite 
Loose sipping dreaming juice, wild for the night 
She wanna find out if the dog bites 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
We hitting the front row, all up in the street 
Brim when she say my name, last she a freak 
She wanna get down on the first night 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
I got them like 
Going down! 
I got these French chicks tryina French kiss in my ear 
They telling me like I'm 
Going down! 
'Cause when I rock and write 7 days a week 
I got 'em singing like

I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it

Now, we in the bar no charge getting drunk 
Hot ladies taking shots like it's Starbucks 
College girls they just wanna party all night 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
Alright, body shots, making a scene 
Straight A's over C's but she's taking a D 
And if I hit it once she'll be begging for it twice 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
I got 'em like 
Going down! 
These chicks tell me I'm the fresh prince 
If not, the next best since 
I'm the 
Going down! 
'Cause when I rock and write 7 days a week 
I got 'em singing like

I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
Go give me one for the money, two for the rhythm 
Three for these beautiful women that ever giving me attention 
Now that I made rapping my profession 
They undressing bodies looking like perfection it's a blessing 
I'm an east coast kid on a west coast life 
Drive on a quest like q tip and fife 
And would you bring a friend if I ask real nice? 
Oh baby, that's what I like

I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
You know I like it like this, I like it like that 
Like it from the front and like it from the back

            <field name="lyrics">What's wrong with the world mama? 
People living like aint got no mamas 
I think the whole worlds addicted to the drama 
Only attracted to the things that bring you trauma 
Overseas yeah we tryin to stop terrorism 
But we still got terrorists here livin 
In the USA the big CIA the Bloodz and the Crips and the KKK 
But if you only have love for your own race 
Then you only leave space to discriminate 
And to discriminate only generates hate 
And if you hatin you're bound to get irate 
Yeah madness is what you demonstrate 
And that's exactly how anger works and operates 
You gotta have love just to set it straight 
Take control of your mind and meditate 
Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father Father Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the love2x) 
It just ain't the same all ways have changed 
New days are strange is the world the insane? 
If love and peace so strong 
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong 
Nations dropping bombs 
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones 
With ongoing suffering 
As the youth die young 
So ask yourself is the loving really strong? 
So I can ask myself really what is going wrong 
With this world that we living in 
People keep on giving in 
Makin wrong decisions 
Only visions of them livin and 
Not respecting each other 
Deny thy brother 
The wars' going on but the reasons' undercover 
The truth is kept secret 
Swept under the rug 
If you never know truth 
Then you never know love 
Where's the love y'all?(I don't know) 
Where's the truth y'all?(I don't know) 
Where's the love y'all? 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father father father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the lovex2) 
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder 
As I'm getting older y'all people get colder 
Most of us only care about money makin 
Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction 
Wrong information always shown by the media 
Negative images is the main criteria 
Infecting their young minds faster than bacteria 
Kids wanna act like what the see in the cinema 
Whatever happened to the values of humanity 
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality 
Instead of spreading love, we're spreading anomosity 
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down 
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under 
I gotta keep my faith alive, until love is found 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father Father Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(fade)</field>

Explosive, you don't even know it, I want you to know it

You got this swag, you got this attitude 
Wanna hear you say my name 
'Cause you got me 
Flying with your love 
Shining with your love, riding with your love

One hit with your love 
Can't quit with your love, so sick but so what 
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love 
Everybody wants what I got with you 
'Cause I'm standing on top with a killer view 
Inspired feeling like a million, I'm one in a million 
I'm one in a million, million, million

Thought I needed to upgrade 
So I went and walked away way way 
Now, I see you've been hanging out 
With that other girl in town 
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns 
Remember all the things that you and I did first? 
And now you're doing them with her 
Remember all the things that you and I did first? 
You got me, got me like this 
And now you're taking her to every restaurant 
And everywhere we went, come on! 
And now you're taking her to every restaurant 
You got me, got me like this 
Boy you can say anything you wanna 
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya 
I want you back

Wa-want you, want you back

Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin' 
I want you back 
I want you back 
Wa-want you, want you back 
Please, this ain't even jealousy 
She ain't got a thing on me 
Tryin' to rock with an ugly jeans, jeans, jeans 
You clearly didn't think this through 
If what I've been told is true 
You'll be crawling back like boo hoo hoo 
Remember all the things that you and I did first? 
And now you're doing them with her 
Remember all the things that you and I did first?

Cause best friends, best friends don't have to pretend 
You need a hand, and I'm right there right beside you 
You in the dark, I'll be the bright light to guide you 
'Member the times, times, times sneaking out the house 
All of the times, times, times that you had your doubts 
And don't forget all the trouble we got into 
We got something you can't undo, do 
Laughing so damn hard 
Crashed your dad's new car 
All the scars we share 
I promise, I swear 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
That you got a home for now and forever 
And if you get low, just call me whenever 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather 
And we'll never change, no matter the weather 
This is my oath to you 
I know I drive you crazy, hmm.. 
sometimes 
I know I call you lazy, and that's most times 
But you complete me, and that's no lie 
You are my tuxedo, and I'm your bow tie 
We're in the car, singin', singin', singin' our song 
Walk in the building, tear it down, like we're King Kong 
And in my eyes you could do, do no wrong 
You got a best friend sing, sing, sing along 
Laughing so damn hard 
Crashed your dad's new car 
All the scars we share 
I promise, I swear 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
That you got a home for now and forever 
And if you get low, just call me whenever 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather 
And we'll never change, no matter the weather 
This is my oath to you 
Ohhh.. 
I'll never let you go 
Ohhh.. 
Woah, this is my oath to you 
Ohhh.. 
Just thought that you should know 
Ohhh.. 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
That you got a home for now and forever 
And if you get low, just call me whenever 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather 
And we'll never change, no matter the weather 
This is my oath to you 
Ohhh... 
You should know, you should know, 
You should know, you should know, yeah. 
Ohhh.. 
Woah, this is my oath to you 
Ohhh.. 
Wherever you go just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather 
Ohhh..

I keep dancin' on my own 
I'm just gonna dance all night 
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line

For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
So stand up 
Show 'em how we do it 
Won't back down until I see your, hands up 
Tell 'em what the truth is 
Stand behind the music 
You gotta get behind 
Cross your heart, hope to die 
Splash a hype, dash a pretty that don't mean I'll buy 
Okay alright already, they getting money 
All the frauds, all the phonies, all the fakes, slow down 
It's a fast pace world, breathe 
Look my face in the mirror 
Say, "Who the heck am I?" 
Look me in the eye 
Is this conviction or addiction or a waste of time? 
Just name a genre 
Yeah I've tried it 
Been doin' this from 15 to life, yeah 
I need a break already 
I gotta find it 
And for the first time in my life, I'm doing my sh-t 
I, I, I, I wanna stand up in this block stop burning 
Girls getting crazed, looking naked, looking spaded 
Chew it up, make my teeth rot 
You think I'm talkin' to ya? 
I'm probably not, nah 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
When I was a little younger 
Lookin' for a label and a little clean danger 
Ellie had a taste for a new adventure 
Open every 'do not enter' 
Yeah I was tryin' hard to be somebody 
Be the cool kid at the party 
Lookin' at me laddy daddy, hottie hottie, hot tamale 
Stranger sizing up my body 
Told me I could be somebody 
Wait, someone stopped me, went home and I called my mommy 
I know I'm not that girl 
I still wanna be the leader of a free world 
Yeah I'm a big dreamer 
I'm a believer 
Just try to tell me no, I'm a go full steamer 
No, can't slow me down 
.. 
this down from the inside out 
Block by block from the bottom to the top 
I know just who I am 
And I know just who I'm not 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
So stand up, show 'em how we do it 
Won't back down until I see your hands up 
Tell 'em what the truth is 
Stand behind the music 
Yeah, stand up, come on let me see your 
Front row to the nose bleeders 
Hands up, if you really need it 
Stand behind the music 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long

The future seemed so bright 
Even angels have their wicked schemes 
And you take that to new extremes 
But you'll always be my hero 
Even though you've lost your mind 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry 
But that's all right because 
I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
I can't tell you what it really is 
I can only tell you what it feels like 
And right now it´s a steel knife in my windpipe 
I can´t breathe but I still fight while I can fight 
As long as the wrong feels right it´s like I'm in 
flight 
Angels have their wicked schemes 
And you take that to new extremes 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts

And the wind is so icy, I am numb

With a thousand eyes on me 
I stumble on

I'm getting weaker every day 
I carry the weight of you 
I carry the weight of you 
Lay down here 
Beside me in the shallow water 
Beside me when the sun is shining on us still 
Lay down here 
Beside me me in the hallowed water 
Beside me when the silver lining stays 
Until the sirens' calling 
We followed the sun down low 'till we hit the night 
And you hold me so tightly 
It's hard to breathe 
And I'm tired, I'm growing older 
I'm getting weaker every day 
We follow the sun down low 
We follow the sun down low

Yeah, I'm tired 
I'm growing older 
I'm getting weaker every day 
I am drowning, and you're stealing 
Every breath, take me away and just

Beside me when the sun is shining on us still 
Lay down here 
Beside me me in the hallowed water

You deserve it 
Uh-huh

Baby, I've seen the chick you're with 
Wish that I never did 
Freaking perfect, and five foot ten 
Just wanna punch her lip 
Cause I know I've been wasting time 
Tryin'ta catch your eye 
Yeah I know that I've been so blind 
Thinking that I'm your type 
And now I'm at home, I'm all alone 
'Bout to pick up the telephone 
Got to call my genie so he knows, yeah 
I wish I was tall 
I wish I was fast 
I wish I could shop with a bag of cash 
Cause If I want you, I gotta have that 
(Come, come kiss me boy) 
I wish I had style, I wish I had flash 
I wish I woke up with a butt and a rack 
Cause If I want you, I gotta have that 
(Come, come kiss me boy) 
(uh-huh, yeah) 
Baby, I'm gonna keep it real 
Boy, you're the one I want 
I don't own any five inch heels, just got my Nikes on 
Never thought I was insecure 
Boy look at what you've done 
I don't know what to studied for 
Clearly you like 'em dumb 
And now I'm at home, I'm all alone 
'Bout to pick up the telephone 
Got to call my genie so he knows, yeah

Hey now don't you wanna do somethin' baby? 
With the roof gone 
Aston Martin look retarded like the coupe gone crazy 
I'm not sure what kind of fella you like 
But I can get you paradise 
Have it however you like 
I'm talking solitaire iced out 
Ring, watch, necklace 
Ain't no talking reckless 
Girl I'm certified respected girl 
You like to run your mouth 
Well you about to learn a lesson, girl 
Yeah you're the one 
But I'll replace you in a second girl 
And I ain't even trying to see you naked girl 
Wait, there I go exaggerate 
Clearly carried away 
But what I'm saying you could true that 
I wanna be wherever you at 
So you wishing you could kiss me 
Do you really wanna do that? 
Make a wish girl 
I wish I was tall 
I wish I was fast 
I wish I could shop with a bag of cash 
Cause If I want you, I gotta have that 
(Come, come kiss me boy) 
I wish I had style, I wish I had flash 
I wish I woke up with a butt and a rack 
Cause If I want you, I gotta have that

Can't quit with your love, so sick but so what 
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love 
Everybody wants what I got with you

Inspired feeling like a million, I'm one in a million

I need somebody who can take care of this 
I'm loving what you do, cause I know you do it well 
You got your game tight, real smart I can tell 
Please don't play that usual game, (the usual game) 
The type to put out your flame 
I don't wanna shed a tear 
And I didn't wanna end up here 
Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down, 
I didn't wanna end up here 
Yeah I went through your phone and didn't like what I've seen 
You promised you'd be true you made a fool at of me 
My friends tried to warn me that I'd waste my time 
I saw your true colours almost lost my mind 
Looks like you do the same to all your other girls, 
Except you brought her flowers and you brought me pearls 
When you're going out tonight, I know you're seeing her again 
Saw your picture together, so now you're kissing all your friends 
Please don't play that usual game, (the usual game) 
The type to put out your flame 
I don't wanna shed a tear 
And I didn't wanna end up here 
Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down, 
I didn't wanna end up here 
If I don't leave right now, with my wounds still open 
Slipped right through your hands, now my heart is broken

            <field name="lyrics">What's wrong with the world mama? 
People living like aint got no mamas 
I think the whole worlds addicted to the drama 
Only attracted to the things that bring you trauma 
Overseas yeah we tryin to stop terrorism 
But we still got terrorists here livin 
In the USA the big CIA the Bloodz and the Crips and the KKK 
But if you only have love for your own race 
Then you only leave space to discriminate 
And to discriminate only generates hate 
And if you hatin you're bound to get irate 
Yeah madness is what you demonstrate 
And that's exactly how anger works and operates 
You gotta have love just to set it straight 
Take control of your mind and meditate 
Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father Father Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the love2x) 
It just ain't the same all ways have changed 
New days are strange is the world the insane? 
If love and peace so strong 
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong 
Nations dropping bombs 
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones 
With ongoing suffering 
As the youth die young 
So ask yourself is the loving really strong? 
So I can ask myself really what is going wrong 
With this world that we living in 
People keep on giving in 
Makin wrong decisions 
Only visions of them livin and 
Not respecting each other 
Deny thy brother 
The wars' going on but the reasons' undercover 
The truth is kept secret 
Swept under the rug 
If you never know truth 
Then you never know love 
Where's the love y'all?(I don't know) 
Where's the truth y'all?(I don't know) 
Where's the love y'all? 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father father father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the lovex2) 
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder 
As I'm getting older y'all people get colder 
Most of us only care about money makin 
Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction 
Wrong information always shown by the media 
Negative images is the main criteria 
Infecting their young minds faster than bacteria 
Kids wanna act like what the see in the cinema 
Whatever happened to the values of humanity 
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality 
Instead of spreading love, we're spreading anomosity 
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down 
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under 
I gotta keep my faith alive, until love is found 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father Father Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(fade)</field>

Don't wanna pick it up 
I'm so scared 
I'm gonna say too much 
I tip toe around your questions 
Why you gotta dig so deep? 
Tears fall 
And the glasses break 
Inside these walls 
The floor boards shake 
From outside 
It's alright 
Long as you looking from fifty feet 
I been trying, trying 
Hold my head up high 
I been lying, lying 
Keeping it all inside 
Trying not to trust you, yeah 
Take another leaf, I'm broke yeah, yeah? 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
A doll house is all that you could see 
But it's so far from my reality 
I got problems, I got issues 
Sometimes it's all too much for me 
Wrap it up with a pretty little bow 
But there are some things you can't sugarcoat 
Give it to you anyway 
Even though it won't taste so sweet 
I been trying, trying 
Hold my head up high 
I been lying, lying 
Keeping it all inside 
Maybe I could trust you, yeah 
Take another leaf, I'm broke yeah, yeah? 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Sick of all the fighting 
All the slamming of the doors 
The pain, the parents, too deep you know 
Step back, step back 
Can you see it through my eyes? 
I know, I know 
Maybe a surprise 
Don't wanna be perceived for something that I'm not 
Just wanna be accepted for the little that I got 
If you could see me now in my glass house 
Not ready to let you in 
Not ready to let you in 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me</field>

Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Just doing my thing 
and I won't come down. 
I'm over the moon 
No silver spoon in my milky way 
When Simon told me I was trouble 
All I said is 'okay' 
Now let me turn my swag on 
And step up to the plate 
Then put London in my pocket 
Up, up, up and away 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
I wanna get so far that I see you soon 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
and I won't come down! 
I'm over the moon 
So watch your head 
Cuz I'm throwing rocks 
It feels like red bull gave me wings 
And I can't be stopped 
See I rhyme like a beast 
But I sing like a flower 
I feeling tall so tall like the Eiffel Tower 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
I wanna get so far that I see you 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
and I won't come down! 
Floating in space 
I love this place 
E.T's says Hey 
My mind's so clear 
This atmosphere 
I got no fear 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm Over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
And I won't come down 
I'm Over the moon, haha</field>

What if there's no forever? 
Would you kiss me goodnight? 
So that I could remember? 
Keep you frozen in time 
Like they do in the pictures 
And if I close my eyes 
Would I still think of patience? 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight? 
What if daddy was right? 
And I knew all the answers? 
But they could give me the world 
But that wouldn't matter 
And if the gates open wide, and make you an angel 
Two tears in my eyes, I'd save you're seat at the table 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?</field>

No need to try to be a hero 
I've had enough, yeah I've had enough my baby 
You've got a little bit of Tarzan 
Let it all out, yeah let it all out, my baby 
This ain't the thrill I've been chasing 
I wanna find out, I wanna find out my baby 
You're always so nice, I'm getting bored 
You say the right things, I'm getting bored 
And you always call first, I'm getting bored 
Yeah, I'm getting bored 
So sick of the good boys, I need wild boys 
Something unpredictable 
Go ahead be a caveman 
Give me all your dirty love 
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one 
Something unreliable 
Go ahead be a caveman 
Give me all your dirty love 
You wanna treat me like a lady 
Don't even try, no don't even try my baby 
Ain't gotta say that you need me 
Keep it inside, yeah keep it inside my baby 
I know I sound a little twisted 
But maybe I am or maybe I'm not but baby 
Playing the game is so addictive 
Don't want it to stop, don't want it to stop my baby 
You're always so nice, I'm getting bored 
You say the right things, I'm getting bored 
And you always call first, I'm getting bored 
Yeah, I'm getting bored

Bad day you got seeing red 
Wanted to feel the sun on your back 
But it rained on your head instead 
But on the bright side 
Despite this hassle wet sand 
Makes for a better sand castle 
Inhale 
Exhale, just take a breath 
I know that things don't always happen like they should 
Gotta learn to roll with punches 
And just say it's all good 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching 
In the final round 
Fight your hardest, but lose 
It's like shouting out 
When nobody can hear you 
But when it's all said and done 
It's all good 
It's all good, it's all good! 
Woke up on the wrong side of bed 
Gotta get the work done 
And then some, gotta busy day ahead 
But on the bright side work hard, play harder 
Tomorrow's full of laughter 
Inhale 
Exhale, just take a breath 
I know that things don't happen as they should 
Gotta learn to roll with punches 
And just say it's all good 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching 
In the final round 
Fight your hardest, but lose 
It's like shouting out 
When nobody can hear you 
But when it's all said and done 
It's all good 
It's all good, it's all good! 
It's all good, it's all good 
It's all good 
It's all good! 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
They'll be bumps in the road 
Things will go out of control 
But you can't let it get you down 
When your rights just goes wrong 
Just often keep pushing on 
It's all good claim it here and now 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching 
In the final round 
Fight your hardest, but lose 
It's like shouting out 
When nobody can hear you 
But when it's all said and done 
It's all good 
It's all good, it's all good 
It's all good

When you act all cool like you already knew

'Til your heart starts beating for that somebody new

Who get whatever they want 
And it's beautiful people like you 
Who suck the life right outta my heart

Who make me cry 
'Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you 
It's a wicked game that you're making me play 
(making me play) 
Where I crawl back home as you're walking away 
(Hey, Hey) 
And it's all quite clear what you want me to say 
(what you want me to say) 
But you'll be so long gone if I ask you to stay

            <field name="lyrics">No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
So stand up 
Show 'em how we do it 
Won't back down until I see your, hands up 
Tell 'em what the truth is 
Stand behind the music 
You gotta get behind 
Cross your heart, hope to die 
Splash a hype, dash a pretty that don't mean I'll buy 
Okay alright already, they getting money 
All the frauds, all the phonies, all the fakes, slow down 
It's a fast pace world, breathe 
Look my face in the mirror 
Say, "Who the heck am I?" 
Look me in the eye 
Is this conviction or addiction or a waste of time? 
Just name a genre 
Yeah I've tried it 
Been doin' this from 15 to life, yeah 
I need a break already 
I gotta find it 
And for the first time in my life, I'm doing my sh-t 
I, I, I, I wanna stand up in this block stop burning 
Girls getting crazed, looking naked, looking spaded 
Chew it up, make my teeth rot 
You think I'm talkin' to ya? 
I'm probably not, nah 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
When I was a little younger 
Lookin' for a label and a little clean danger 
Ellie had a taste for a new adventure 
Open every 'do not enter' 
Yeah I was tryin' hard to be somebody 
Be the cool kid at the party 
Lookin' at me laddy daddy, hottie hottie, hot tamale 
Stranger sizing up my body 
Told me I could be somebody 
Wait, someone stopped me, went home and I called my mommy 
I know I'm not that girl 
I still wanna be the leader of a free world 
Yeah I'm a big dreamer 
I'm a believer 
Just try to tell me no, I'm a go full steamer 
No, can't slow me down 
.. 
this down from the inside out 
Block by block from the bottom to the top 
I know just who I am 
And I know just who I'm not 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music 
All the fame, all the girls 
And all the money in this world 
They don't mean sh-t, better admit 
If you can't stand behind the music 
So stand up, show 'em how we do it 
Won't back down until I see your hands up 
Tell 'em what the truth is 
Stand behind the music 
Yeah, stand up, come on let me see your 
Front row to the nose bleeders 
Hands up, if you really need it 
Stand behind the music 
No you don't stand a chance 
For a second in my world 
The same old song, it won't last long 
If you can't stand behind the music</field>

If you don't whether the storm 
You'll get caught up in the wind 
If love is a war 
Then I'll be your soldier

You'll be my saviour

I'm holding on 
You're holding on

You look me deep in the eyes 
I can feel my heart racing now 
It's like you can read my mind 
When I struggle to scream it out 
Knock me down to the floor 
But I still want more 
And only time will tell 
You brought me back to life 
But only to kill me now 
If love is a war 
Then I'll be your soldier 
And if I fall 
You'll be my saviour

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her

I'm givin' it my all, but I'm not the girl you're 
takin' home 
I keep dancin' on my own 
I'm just gonna dance all night 
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line 
Stilettos and broken bottles 
I'm spinning around in circles 
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her 
I'm right over here, why can't you see me 
I'm givin' it my all, but I'm not the girl you're

So far away, but still so near 
The lights go on, the music dies 
But you don't see me, standing here 
I just came to say goodbye

No need to try to be a hero

You've got a little bit of Tarzan 
Let it all out, yeah let it all out, my baby 
This ain't the thrill I've been chasing 
I wanna find out, I wanna find out my baby 
You're always so nice, I'm getting bored 
You say the right things, I'm getting bored 
And you always call first, I'm getting bored 
Yeah, I'm getting bored 
So sick of the good boys, I need wild boys 
Something unpredictable 
Go ahead be a caveman 
Give me all your dirty love 
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one 
Something unreliable 
Go ahead be a caveman 
Give me all your dirty love 
You wanna treat me like a lady 
Don't even try, no don't even try my baby 
Ain't gotta say that you need me 
Keep it inside, yeah keep it inside my baby 
I know I sound a little twisted 
But maybe I am or maybe I'm not but baby 
Playing the game is so addictive 
Don't want it to stop, don't want it to stop my baby 
You're always so nice, I'm getting bored 
You say the right things, I'm getting bored

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide 
That sticks around like something in your teeth 
Hide some aces up your sleeve 
Have you no idea that you're in deep? 
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week 
How many secrets can you keep? 
'Cause there's this tune I've found 
That makes me think of you somehow 
When I play it on repeat 
Until I fall asleep 
Spilling drinks on my settee 
(Do I wanna know?) 
If this feeling flows both ways 
(Sad to see you go) 
Sort of hoping that you'd stay 
(Baby we both know) 
That the nights were mainly made for saying things 
That you can't say tomorrow day 
Crawling back to you 
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? 
Cause I always do 
Baby, I'm too 
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new 
Now I've thought it through 
Crawling back to you 
So have you got the guts? 
Been wondering if your heart's still open 
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts 
Simmer down and pucker up 
I'm sorry to interrupt 
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying 
To kiss you 
I don't know if you 
Feel the same as I do 
But we could be together 
If you wanted to 
(Do I wanna know?) 
If this feeling flows both ways

Sort of hoping that you'd stay

Might make it go down more easily

Gotta track, got X Factor prepared

Yo Cher I bet you talk to them liars 
Laugh in the hater's face, save your praises! 
We ain't got time for that, ain't got patience

Oh so grime-ish, gimme the beat I'm so violent 
The way I got the rhythm and beat 
There's no finding anything like this, common yo shining 
I know their watching me like they got no eyelids 
Kid in 'em like whatever it is, 
Are you ever gonna quit then you never live with this, I'm cold 
Got mc's that have Ben in the game 
For 10 years depressed and stressed thinkin I'm old 
I'm a deep guy and highly streetwise 
I always speak life just how it is I roll 
Nothing but slugs on the track 
Politics and cars ain't drugs on the track

Besides Cher, I might give her the wood like IKEA 
Imma relax like the wife's here, no

Let me get back to the music

Your touch, magnetizing

You're not like the others, futuristic lover 
Different dna, they don't understand you 
You're from a whole 'nother world

You open my eyes 
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light 
Kiss me, kiss me 
Infect me with your loving, fill me with your poison 
Take me, take me 
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction 
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign 
It's supernatural, extra-terrestrial 
You're so supersonic 
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your laser 
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic 
You're from a whole 'nother world

Infect me with your loving, fill me with your poison

Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign

Boy, you're my lucky star 
I wanna walk on your wavelength 
And be there when you vibrate 
For you I'll risk it all 
Kiss me, kiss me 
Infect me with your loving

Make up your mind if your liking what you see 
Don't want no flowers, don't buy me no gifts 
I need somebody who can take care of this 
I'm loving what you do, cause I know you do it well 
You got your game tight, real smart I can tell 
Please don't play that usual game, (the usual game) 
The type to put out your flame 
I don't wanna shed a tear 
And I didn't wanna end up here 
Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down, 
I didn't wanna end up here 
Yeah I went through your phone and didn't like what I've seen 
You promised you'd be true you made a fool at of me 
My friends tried to warn me that I'd waste my time 
I saw your true colours almost lost my mind 
Looks like you do the same to all your other girls, 
Except you brought her flowers and you brought me pearls 
When you're going out tonight, I know you're seeing her again 
Saw your picture together, so now you're kissing all your friends 
Please don't play that usual game, (the usual game) 
The type to put out your flame 
I don't wanna shed a tear 
And I didn't wanna end up here 
Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down, 
I didn't wanna end up here 
If I don't leave right now, with my wounds still open 
Slipped right through your hands, now my heart is broken 
I'm moving on, yeah, yeah, I'm moving on, yeah, yeah 
I'm moving on, yeah, yeah, I'm moving on 
I don't wanna shed a tear 
And I didn't wanna end up here 
Could you gimme that dust, did you through right round 
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down, 
I didn't wanna end up here</field>

Take my hand 
Why are we 
Strangers when 
Our love's strong 
Why carry on without me? 
Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face 
It's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 
I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 
And everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face 
You're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby</field>

What if there's no forever? 
Would you kiss me goodnight? 
So that I could remember? 
Keep you frozen in time 
Like they do in the pictures 
And if I close my eyes 
Would I still think of patience? 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight? 
What if daddy was right? 
And I knew all the answers? 
But they could give me the world 
But that wouldn't matter 
And if the gates open wide, and make you an angel 
Two tears in my eyes, I'd save you're seat at the table 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?</field>

We're gonna make this thing go blow, we're gonna system overload 
We're gonna be the generation that makes everything explode! 
And I when I say explode I don't mean that we using bombs 
We doing stuff that we don't ever have to tell our moms 
Love the stuff we got it 
We got it all up in the room 
Paper chasing, yeah we got it everything we want 
Somehow, some way 
We're gonna have it our way

[Busta Rhymes] 
Bullseye again 
I got 'em in a target, put 'em in a pocket, put 'em on a market 
That's the way we did 
You can see the way I walk and I talk 
Every time I show her what I got 
I'm sprung, I don't want to grow up, forever young 
Why I don't ever wanna leave you 
Better believe me, trust me, she is the one 
Gonna make all the people get up in the hard papers 
Wanna hear it that? Are we gonna dump like this? 
Leaning bend the body on the run 
And then they gotta turn and twist 
I guess it's time for pictures in my closet 
I can do this to the infinity 
We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Show everybody who runs this town 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way

So you think that you know me 
You're the only one who knows who I am 
I decided to let that I'm breaking 
All the chains on my throne imperfection 
Could it be that easy to let it all go? 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
Everything you think it's perfect 
Isn't always so 
Many times, many times 
I wouldn't let my feelings show 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
You know I'm just human, human, human after all 
You know I'm just human, human, human after all 
Slowly, slowly 
I'm okay in revealing 
Scars you see I wear them proud in the end 
I decided tonight that I'm wasting 
Too much thought on the art of perception 
Could it be that easy to let it all go? 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
Everything you think it's perfect 
Isn't always so 
Many times, many times 
I wouldn't let my feelings show 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
You know I'm just tired of the weight 
Of the world on my shoulders 
Baby you know I'm sick of always carrying it for you 
Used to be a superwoman now that's over, over 
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, baby, I'm a soldier 
Doesn't mean that I could be everything for you 
Used to be a superwoman now that's over, over 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold 
Everything you think it's perfect 
Isn't always so 
Many times, many times 
I wouldn't let my feelings show 
Everything you see that glitters 
Isn't always gold

You know I'm just human, human, human after all</field>

We get ever so hot 
OOh whether we like it or not 
They say we can love who we trust 
But what is love without lust? 
Two hearts with accurate devotions 
OOh but what are feelings without emotions? 
I'm going in for the kill 
I'm doing it for a thrill 
I'm hoping you'll understand 
And not let go of my hand 
(x2) 
I hang my hopes out on the line 
OOh will they be ready for you in time? 
If you leave them out too long 
OOh they'll be withered by the sun 
Full stops and exclamation marks 
Ooh my words stumble before I start 
How far can you send emotions? 
Can this bridge cross the ocean? 
I'm going in for the kill 
I'm doing it for a thrill 
I'm hoping you'll understand 
And not let go of my hand

Let's go to war 
To make peace 
Let's be cold 
To create heat

Bad day you got seeing red 
Wanted to feel the sun on your back 
But it rained on your head instead 
But on the bright side 
Despite this hassle wet sand 
Makes for a better sand castle 
Inhale 
Exhale, just take a breath 
I know that things don't always happen like they should 
Gotta learn to roll with punches 
And just say it's all good 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching 
In the final round 
Fight your hardest, but lose 
It's like shouting out 
When nobody can hear you 
But when it's all said and done 
It's all good 
It's all good, it's all good! 
Woke up on the wrong side of bed 
Gotta get the work done 
And then some, gotta busy day ahead 
But on the bright side work hard, play harder 
Tomorrow's full of laughter 
Inhale 
Exhale, just take a breath 
I know that things don't happen as they should 
Gotta learn to roll with punches 
And just say it's all good 
Cause it's like falling down

They'll be bumps in the road 
Things will go out of control 
But you can't let it get you down 
When your rights just goes wrong 
Just often keep pushing on 
It's all good claim it here and now 
Cause it's like falling down 
When everyone's watching

Hold tight, only just begun

Faced down, wake up somewhere new 
Spaced out, barely made it through 
Every time I get into, whatever we do 
Yeah, I'm with you 
So if you've had enough 
Brush your shoulders off 
And we can kick it til the night's had enough of us 
And if you didn't know, I should tell you so 
And now you know 
Don't matter what they say 
Cause we be killin it, killin it, killin it all the way, way 
Okay, yeah we be killin it, killin it, killin it all the way, way 
Rewind, where we started out 
Play back, all that we forgot 
You, me, all the shit we got 
Love it at the top, ready get hot 
Wild hearts making the mistakes 
Switched up, but we never face 
Get down, we don't play it safe

If you can't handle, get out of my way 
Don't know what's wrong but I feel okay 
I can't see heaven 'cause it's too far away 
But I kill my blessing every time I pray 
I don't make excuses when I lose my way 
Baby, come and get me some 
I just can't control myself 
I'm all fired up, I'm all fired up 
Touch me right, I will go off like a loaded gun

Watch out I'm a loaded gun 
You're burning rubber and 
I'm drinking Jake 
What a disaster, there's no turning back 
People look down, 
but I'm looking up 
It's my religion and I don't give a fuck

Don't wanna pick it up 
I'm so scared 
I'm gonna say too much 
I tip toe around your questions 
Why you gotta dig so deep? 
Tears fall 
And the glasses break 
Inside these walls 
The floor boards shake 
From outside 
It's alright 
Long as you looking from fifty feet 
I been trying, trying 
Hold my head up high 
I been lying, lying 
Keeping it all inside 
Trying not to trust you, yeah 
Take another leaf, I'm broke yeah, yeah? 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
A doll house is all that you could see 
But it's so far from my reality 
I got problems, I got issues 
Sometimes it's all too much for me 
Wrap it up with a pretty little bow 
But there are some things you can't sugarcoat 
Give it to you anyway 
Even though it won't taste so sweet 
I been trying, trying 
Hold my head up high 
I been lying, lying 
Keeping it all inside 
Maybe I could trust you, yeah 
Take another leaf, I'm broke yeah, yeah? 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me 
Sick of all the fighting 
All the slamming of the doors 
The pain, the parents, too deep you know 
Step back, step back 
Can you see it through my eyes? 
I know, I know 
Maybe a surprise 
Don't wanna be perceived for something that I'm not 
Just wanna be accepted for the little that I got 
If you could see me now in my glass house 
Not ready to let you in 
Not ready to let you in 
I'm done, I give up 
I don't wanna pretend no more 
That's it, so what? 
I've lost a friend before 
Gonna say it like it is 
No more wondering what if 
That ain't the way you oughta live 
Cause I don't want you to love me 
If you don't wanna love me for me

The future seemed so bright 
Even angels have their wicked schemes 
And you take that to new extremes 
But you'll always be my hero 
Even though you've lost your mind 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn 
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry 
But that's all right because 
I love the way you lie 
I love the way you lie 
I can't tell you what it really is 
I can only tell you what it feels like 
And right now it´s a steel knife in my windpipe 
I can´t breathe but I still fight while I can fight 
As long as the wrong feels right it´s like I'm in 
flight 
Angels have their wicked schemes 
And you take that to new extremes 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

So we dance, and we dance like you're just not there 
'Cause ew, what's wrong with you? 
No, the problem is not my attitude 
But you, ew, just not my type 
But the next time I won't be so polite 
'Cause hey, this could be great 
This could be crazy 
This could be the mother fucking party of the year 
Trying too hard, tryna be hot 
Trying to keep talking to us but we don't care 
Keep it all in your pants, boy 
Keep it all in your pants, boy 
This could be the mother fucking party of the year

That it ain't gonna work

Yeah, hello, goodbye 
Get a hold of yourself before I lose it 
Baby, laugh all you like

No, we don't need no instruments

All the scars we share

Wherever you go, just always remember 
That you got a home for now and forever 
And if you get low, just call me whenever 
This is my oath to you 
Wherever you go, just always remember 
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather 
And we'll never change, no matter the weather 
This is my oath to you 
I know I drive you crazy, hmm.. 
sometimes 
I know I call you lazy, and that's most times 
But you complete me, and that's no lie 
You are my tuxedo, and I'm your bow tie

Walk in the building, tear it down, like we're King Kong

Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Just doing my thing 
and I won't come down. 
I'm over the moon 
No silver spoon in my milky way 
When Simon told me I was trouble 
All I said is 'okay' 
Now let me turn my swag on 
And step up to the plate 
Then put London in my pocket 
Up, up, up and away 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
I wanna get so far that I see you soon 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
and I won't come down! 
I'm over the moon 
So watch your head 
Cuz I'm throwing rocks 
It feels like red bull gave me wings 
And I can't be stopped 
See I rhyme like a beast 
But I sing like a flower 
I feeling tall so tall like the Eiffel Tower 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
I wanna get so far that I see you 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
and I won't come down! 
Floating in space 
I love this place 
E.T's says Hey 
My mind's so clear 
This atmosphere 
I got no fear 
I've been chilling out on a star 
With my five star view 
Reaching to the jar for a dream come true 
I'm Over the moon 
Doing my thing, doing my thing 
And I can't get enough 
Life is feeling so good 
Cuz I keep moving up 
I'm over the moon 
Doing my thing 
And I won't come down 
I'm Over the moon, haha</field>

It’s sweetness that I’m thinking of 
Them boys always acting so mean 
Hands down in the dirt, don’t come clean 
Like a whole and a three letter donkey 
(Donkey) 
Ring the bell, let me teach you something 
'Cause your momma never taught you nothing 
Call Pharell, 'cause you keep on “Fronting” 
(Fronting) 
Listen up, turn it up 
Listen up, turn it up 
No playa boi can win my love 
It’s sweetness that I’m thinking of 
He gotta to lean with a gangsta stance 
He need to rock all the sickest brands 
And give me love, not a bad romance 
I’ll make a move, nothing left to chance 
So, don’t you mess with me 
Can’t touch me, liar, I’m fire 
You and all your tricks expired 
Your ride really needs new tires 
(Vruuuum, tires) 
You like my kicks? Let me kick ya 
Like a “Twilight” fan, Imma bite ya 
Turn around, let me Cee-Lo “Forget Ya” 
(Forget ya) 
Listen up, turn it up 
Listen up, turn it up 
No playa boi can win my love

If you want me looking your way 
Baby, gotta get real 
If you want me ready to play 
Imma have to feel 
If you want me looking your way

And brought it in my place 
Cut to the pushing, with your heart, and then she ran away 
I guess you shoulda known, I guess you shoulda known 
That I would talk, I would talk 
But even if the stars and moon collide 
I never want you back into my life

I cant believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you 
You dont deserve to know the way I used to think about you 
Oh not anymore, oh not anymore 
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go 
Now if we meet out on the street I wont be running scared 
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air 
And make you understand, and make you understand 
You had your chance, had your chance 
But even if the stars and moon collide

And if I close my eyes 
Would I still think of patience? 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight? 
What if daddy was right? 
And I knew all the answers? 
They could give me the world 
But that wouldn't matter 
If the gates opened wide, and made you an angel 
Through tears in my eyes 
I'd save your seat at the table 
Stay with me, don't disappear 
To tell the truth, I need you here 
I'm afraid, I can barely breath 
I need your words, to comfort me 
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?</field>

Beside me when the sun is shining on us still 
Lay down here 
Beside me me in the hallowed water 
Beside me when the silver lining stays 
Until the sirens' calling 
We followed the sun down low 'till we hit the night 
And you hold me so tightly 
It's hard to breathe 
And I'm tired, I'm growing older 
I'm getting weaker every day

Every breath, take me away and just

Oh-oh, woah-oh

Spent my last 20 bucks 
She paints the picture 
She paints the picture

Have to scrape off the brush 
She paints the picture, oh-oh 
Race the mind 
Don't be insecure 
And tell the truth 
'Cause sneaker kids don't quit 
Sneaker kids don't quit, oh-oh 
Race the stand on solid ground 
And when you're down 
you gotta go for them

Look in her eyes you can see her 
heartbreak

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why 
We feel how we feel inside 
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby, 
But I promise momma's gon' be alright

I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry 
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?

How I was such a sad case,

Went to sleep a superhero,

No-body see how I'm acting 
You hurt me, you hurt me 
And no not phisically, 
Ain't got no bumps or bruisers 
To show people what you're doing to me 
I thought it would be 
Ok but you see, 
I heard everything you said 
And I knew that, 
I knew that you'd turn out to be a sad case 
You said you could save me,

You've got me 
Using all my kung fu tricks, tricks 
Hit 'em with a round house kick to the tempo, 
1, 2, 3, 4, Hung-hi-ho, t.k.o., taekwondo, 
You know 
When you see that hand go chop 
Everything stops, 
The flow so hot, 
Like steam from a coffe pot 
Rush hour, no traffic, 
No jalei, just jackie, 
You're acted like you stayed behind 
Go re-up on your classics, 
You all fake all wanna be superman, 
Give Clark Kent back his glasses, man 
I hit you with a judo kick so fast, 
You look back like 'what happened?'

            <field name="lyrics">Tell me what do you see in her 
Cause I've been living in sweet despair 
I don't really know what's in the cards of life 
All I really know is my tears won't dry tonight 
Love was hidden within your smoke 
Blinding lights and disheartened hope 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake, is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
Run away, don't need you anyway 
Although I wish you'd stay 
Go on put the knife in 
You've been foolish 
And I've been stupid 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake, is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
I hear voices inside my head 
Something's different inside this bed 
I don't really know what's in the cards of life 
All I really know is my tears won't dry tonight 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake, is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
Run away, don't need you anyway 
Although I wish you'd stay 
Go on put the knife in 
You've been foolish 
And I've been stupid 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
I'll be crying you'll be screaming 
I'll come crumbling down 
Just the of thought you and I 
Another face in the crowd 
I'd rather wake up in an empty house than this 
battle ground 
I'm on my own now, I'm on my own now 
You'll be sorry, I won't worry 
I'm Ok with it now 
Just remember what you did and how it didn't work out 
I'd rather wake up in an empty house than this 
battle ground 
You're on your own now, you're on your own now 
One mistake is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
One mistake, is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in 
Run away, don't need you anyway 
Although I wish you'd stay 
Go on put the knife in 
You've been foolish 
And I've been stupid 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
One mistake is all it really takes 
To take my breath away 
Go on put the knife in</field>

The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line 
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat 
My mother told me 
If I was goody 
That she would but me 
A rubber dolly 
My auntie told her 
I'd kissed a soldier 
Now she would buy me 
A rubber dolly 
Clap, clap 
And put in your father's hands 
And put in your father's hands 
Get your freak on, get your freak on 
Getchi, getchi, getchi, get that freak on 
Missy put that down, I'm a hottest round 
I tell your mother 
I'm a good now listen to me now 
I'm less than 20 rounds 
And if you want me better get to know 
Is she with me now, the piggy piggy bow 
I know you see the way I switch switch 
Switchy style, I love, the piggy jump around 
People get around 
My mother told me 
If I was goody 
That she would but me 
A rubber dolly 
My auntie told her 
I'd kissed a soldier 
Now she would buy me 
A rubber dolly

We used to be but now there's separation between 
You and me, baby I'm moving on to another girl 
That understands me more 
Takes in front of the place so you can see it all 
I remember the times when we used to bond 
But I never realized that you wanted to be mine 
So I gave her the ring instead of you 
Nickname too 
I can tell that you upset because it ain't you 
Met a new girl and I gave her my heart 
Not noticing that you wanted me from the very start 
You want me back, we can just be friends 
Or try this thing all over again 
C'mon! 
Boy you can say anything you wanna 
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya

Oh baby, that's what I like 
We in the goon grade, goose with the sprite 
Loose sipping dreaming juice, wild for the night 
She wanna find out if the dog bites 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
We hitting the front row, all up in the street 
Brim when she say my name, last she a freak 
She wanna get down on the first night 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
I got them like 
Going down! 
I got these French chicks tryina French kiss in my ear 
They telling me like I'm 
Going down! 
'Cause when I rock and write 7 days a week 
I got 'em singing like 
(x2) 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
Now, we in the bar no charge getting drunk 
Hot ladies taking shots like it's Starbucks 
College girls they just wanna party all night 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
Alright, body shots, making a scene 
Straight A's over C's but she's taking a D 
And if I hit it once she'll be begging for it twice 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
I got 'em like 
Going down! 
These chicks tell me I'm the fresh prince 
If not, the next best since 
I'm the 
Going down! 
'Cause when I rock and write 7 days a week 
I got 'em singing like

I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
Go give me one for the money, two for the rhythm 
Three for these beautiful women that ever giving me attention 
Now that I made rapping my profession 
They undressing bodies looking like perfection it's a blessing 
I'm an east coast kid on a west coast life 
Drive on a quest like q tip and fife 
And would you bring a friend if I ask real nice? 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
(x2) 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it 
Oh baby, that's what I like 
You know I like it like this, I like it like that 
Like it from the front and like it from the back 
I like it like this, I like it like that 
I like it 
Oh baby, that's what I like

            <field name="lyrics">What's wrong with the world mama? 
People living like aint got no mamas 
I think the whole worlds addicted to the drama 
Only attracted to the things that bring you trauma 
Overseas yeah we tryin to stop terrorism 
But we still got terrorists here livin 
In the USA the big CIA the Bloodz and the Crips and the KKK 
But if you only have love for your own race 
Then you only leave space to discriminate 
And to discriminate only generates hate 
And if you hatin you're bound to get irate 
Yeah madness is what you demonstrate 
And that's exactly how anger works and operates 
You gotta have love just to set it straight 
Take control of your mind and meditate 
Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father Father Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the love2x) 
It just ain't the same all ways have changed 
New days are strange is the world the insane? 
If love and peace so strong 
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong 
Nations dropping bombs 
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones 
With ongoing suffering 
As the youth die young 
So ask yourself is the loving really strong? 
So I can ask myself really what is going wrong 
With this world that we living in 
People keep on giving in 
Makin wrong decisions 
Only visions of them livin and 
Not respecting each other 
Deny thy brother 
The wars' going on but the reasons' undercover 
The truth is kept secret 
Swept under the rug 
If you never know truth 
Then you never know love 
Where's the love y'all?(I don't know) 
Where's the truth y'all?(I don't know) 
Where's the love y'all? 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father father father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the lovex2) 
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder 
As I'm getting older y'all people get colder 
Most of us only care about money makin 
Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction 
Wrong information always shown by the media 
Negative images is the main criteria 
Infecting their young minds faster than bacteria 
Kids wanna act like what the see in the cinema 
Whatever happened to the values of humanity 
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality 
Instead of spreading love, we're spreading anomosity 
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down 
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under 
I gotta keep my faith alive, until love is found 
People killing people dying 
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Would you turn the other cheek? 
Father Father Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
Cause people got me got me questioning 
Where is the love?(fade)</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Baby you're the best cause you worked me out 
I keep building walls up but you tear 'em down 
I'm fighting 
I don't wanna like it but you know I like it 
But you know I like it, like it, like it 
Used to always think I was bullet-proof 
But you got an Ak and your blowing through 
Explosive, you don't even know it, I want you to know it 
I want you to know it, know it, know it 
All of them other boys can walk away 
They ain't even in the game 
'Cause they know that you own it 
You got this swag, you got this attitude 
Wanna hear you say my name 
'Cause you got me 
Flying with your love 
Shining with your love, riding with your love 
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love 
One hit with your love 
Can't quit with your love, so sick but so what 
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love 
Everybody wants what I got with you 
'Cause I'm standing on top with a killer view 
Inspired feeling like a million, I'm one in a million 
I'm one in a million, million, million 
I ain't even here I'm in outer space 
Like I'm Venus you're Mars in the milky way 
It's crazy, what you're doing to me, how you do it to me 
How you do it to me, to me, to me 
All of them other boys can walk away 
They ain't even in the game 
'Cause they know that you own it

The smell of your skin lingers on me now 
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown 
I need some shelter of my own protection baby 
Be with myself in center, clarity 
Peace, Serenity 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry 
The path that I'm walking, I must go alone 
I must take the baby steps til I'm full grown,full grown 
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending do they 
And I forseek the dark ahead if I stay 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Like a little school mate in the school yard 
We'll play jacks and uno cards 
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine 
Valentine 
Yes you can hold my hand if you want to 
'cause I wanna hold yours too 
We'll be playmates and lovers 
and share our secret worlds 
But it's time for me to go home 
It's getting late, dark outside 
I need to be with myself in center, clarity 
Peace, Serenity 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry

And they be lining down the block

And I wont change 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
[Chorus:] 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
[Verse:] 
Wear them gold and diamonds rings 
All them things don't mean a thing 
Chaperons and limousines 
Shopping for expensive things 
I be on the movie screens 
Magazines and boogie scenes 
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine 
I'm n queen, I'm no machine 
I still go to Taco Bell 
Drive thru , raw as Hell 
I don't care, I'm still real 
No matter how many records I sell 
After the show or after the grammys 
I like to go cool out with the family 
Sippin , reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang 
And now I'm in 
We flying the first class 
Up in the sky 
Poppin' champagne 
Livin' my life 
In the fast lane 
And I wont change 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
[Ludacris:] 
I'm talking Champagne wishes, caviar dreams 
You deserve nothing but all the finer things 
Now this whole world has no clue to do with us 
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us 
Brother gotta keep enough lettuce 
To support your shoe fetish 
Life styles so rich and famous 
Robin Leach will get jelous 
Half a million for the stones 
Taking trips from here to Rome 
So If you ain't got no money 
take yo'broke ass home 
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
I got problems up to here 
I've got people in my ear 
Telling me these crazy things 
That I don't want to know (fuck y'all) 
I've got money in the bank 
And I'd really like to thank 
All the fans, I'd like to thank 
Thank you really though 
Cuz I remember yesterday 
When I dream about the days 
When I'd rock on Mtv, that be really dope 
Damn, It's been a long road 
And the industry is cold 
I'm glad my daddy told me so 
he let his daugther know

Can't breath 
When you touch me, see 
Butterflies so crazy, mmm mmm 
Whoa now, think I'm goin down 
Friends don't know whats with me, mmm mmm 
You got me trippin, stumbling, flippin, fumbling 
Clumsy cuz I'm fallin in love 
You got me slippin, tumbling, sinking, fumbling 
Clumsy cuz I'm fallin in love 
So in love with you 
Can't help it 
The girl can't help it (repeat 3x) 
You know, this isn't the first time this has happened to me 
This love sick thing 
I like serious relationships and a 
A girl like me dont stay single for long 
Cuz everytime a boyfriend and I break up 
My world is crushed and I'm all alone 
The love bug crawls right back up and bites me and I'm back 
Can't help it 
The girl can't help it (repeat 3x) 
You got me trippin, stumbling, flippin, fumbling 
Clumsy cuz I'm fallin in love 
You got me slippin, tumbling, sinking, fumbling 
Clumsy cuz I'm fallin in love 
So in love with you 
so in love with you 
so in love with you</field>

Hey, Are you ready for this? 
You see...Fergie 
OK ! 
When I come to the clubs, step aside 
Pop the seeds, don't be hating me in the line 
V.I.P because you know I gotta shine 
I'm Fergie Ferg 
Give me love you long time 
All my girls get down on the floor 
Back to back drop it down real low 
I'm such a lady but I'm dancing like a ho 
Because you know what, I don't give a fuck 
So here we go! 
Refrão (x2): 
How come every time you come around 
My London London Bridge wanna go down 
Like London London London wanna go down 
Like London London London be going down 
Drinks start pouring 
And my speech start slowing 
Everybody start looking at you 
The Grey Goose got the girl feeling loose 
Now I wishing that I didn't wear these shoes 
It's like everytime I get up on the dude 
Papparazzi put my business in the news 
And I'm gonna get up out my face (oh, snap) 
Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace (oh, 
snap) 
My lips make you want to have a taste (oh, snap) 
You got that? I got the bass 
Refrão (x2): 
How come every time you come around 
My London London Bridge wanna go down 
Like London London London wanna go down 
Like London London London be going down 
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do 
Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right 
Fergie lovin' 'em long time 
My girls support right? 
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do 
Me like a bullet type you know they comin' right 
Fergie lovin' 'em long time 
My girls support right?

            <field name="lyrics">Every day when I wake up 
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup 
But it seems like I never finish 
It's always half full (or is it half empty?) 
Maybe it's my own superstition 
Or a kind of self protection 
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead? 
Still sittin' here 
Just watching the sun go down (down) , down, (down) , down 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
(Who really cares?) 
Every conversation gets me high on motivation 
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation (yeah) 
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable 
In the midst of all the madness (remember life's beautiful) 
Still I'm feeling restless 
Thinking I should rest less 
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore 
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times) 
In my heart I know, less is more (more) 
More (more) , more, more, more 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
It's time to take this out of my hands 
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end? 
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone 
Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
But then again this way I'll never know, never know 
Maybe I should go 
Go crazy, go insane, go for everything 
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching 
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili? 
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli 
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly 
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really? 
Really, really? Really really though? 
Really, really, really though? 
Feel the vibration of the higher ground 
Love always leads to the highest sound 
Many conversations, people makin' speculations 
As to my procrastination due to my revelations 
And then they get fugazi 
You call yourself a rider 
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti 
Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality 
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
Who cares anyway? 
You could go or you could stay 
You could go, you could stay</field>

So we gonna dance until we drop 
A little party never killed nobody 
Right here, right now is all we got 
Skip, parap-pap 
Islands, diamonds, trips around the world 
Don't mean a thing if I ain't your girl

Hahaha 
Glad that you made it, look around 
You don't see one person sitting down 
They got drinks in their hands 
And the room's a buzz 
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love 
Fake chit chat, the things they got 
Got a stout reputation of keeping it hot girl 
I'm the party of the year and my master plan 
Is to make you realize, I'm your man 
See the people get live 
Underneath the moonlight 
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi 
Hold on while I take this flick 
Speak easy 
Rocking the feathers I'm breezy 
Hope you can keep up boys 
Cause believe me, I'm the bees nees 
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart 
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes 
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart 
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes

Just one night all we got

Reminds me of childhood memories 
Where everything 
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
Now and then when I see her face 
She takes me away to that special place 
And if I stare too long 
I'll probably break down and cry 
Oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Sweet love of mine 
She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
As if they thought of rain 
I hate to look into those eyes 
And see an ounce of pain 
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
Where as a child I'd hide 
And pray for the thunder 
And the rain 
To quietly pass me by 
Oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And wait out your storm of words again 
Build a wall and put my armour on 
Escape the bullets, babe 
Silent stares to see who's giving in 
Who will be the first to break? 
Got that look on your face tonight 
What ya gonna say? 
But this girl is walking, walking (Yeah) 
And you start talking, talking (Uh-huh) 
'Cause baby we're about to blow 
(I'm 'bout to blow) 
Don't tell me things 
you'll be regretting (Yeah) 
'Cause I'm never gonna forget 'em (Nah) 
Tonight, we gotta let it go-o-o-o 
My heart is screaming out, leave me alone 
Just don't start, we'll work it out tomorrow 
We can kick and fight, stay up all damn night 
Thinking you and I are enemies (Woah) 
But these dark skies are gonna be clear (Shh) 
Just save it 'til morning 
Save it 'til morning (Ahh) 
All the sorry's, the apologies 
All the "You're not good enough's" 
All the careless words 
you throw on me 
It's hard to scrape them off 
Like a barnacle, they stick to me 
Like a zombie's eating my flesh 
So baby, think before you speak 
And take a deep breath 
But this girl is walking, walking (Yeah)

Just save it 'til morning 
Light from the dawn, bringing the calm 
Bringing the haze away out of the fog 
Moving the clouds, lifting the doubt 
Seeing it for what it really is now 
Love you a lot, you even more 
Why do you hurt the ones you love the most? 
Love you a lot, you even more 
Why do you hurt the ones you love the most? 
I won't be your punching bag 
Why did I put up with that? 
We gotta figure it out (Rhum) 
You don't want me to figure that out 
My heart is screaming out, leave me alone 
Just don't start, we'll work it out tomorrow 
We can kick and fight, stay up all damn night

That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
Let it go, get rolled, I just can't hold 
Back and forth 'cause I'm the girl with soul 
Ain't controlling effects, so what the heck 
Rock the discotheque 'cause this groove is up next 
Tease on the camera, freeze while I animate 
I'm no amateur, I'm a laminate 
I'ma assassinate all the imitates 
Then I'ma take a break, and meditate 
Hmm, let me think about it 
Put my little noodle on the problem, then I drink about it 
Drink a little, swig a little, sip a little, spill a little 
Feel a little loopy when I get a little tipsy 
Beez got me feeling like a gypsy 
Smoking on that hookah 
got me feeling like a hippie, trippy 
Gone for a minute and you missed me 
Now Fergie back with a bag full of tricksies 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know

Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
Yo, ayo, let it go, let's go 
I keep a bar like Esco 
I wanna ball, where the Nets go? 
I'm on stage, you can stand where the guests go 
Bitches is my sons, they don't wanna leave the nest tho 
They like, uh, where the ref go? 
I-I got these hoes scared to pass, I got that intercept flow 
I made a movie like Seth Rog 
And since I came in the game, they careers on death row 
Damn, I ain't see young Nicki in a week 
Five shows, made three millie in a week 
You are now looking at the the best, the elite 
Too bad you can't go and invest in critiques 
I'm thick and petite, tell 'em quick pick a seat 
I pull up in a Ghost, no sheets, trick or treat 
I know they on E, but I don't give a F, though 
Bad attitude, but my pussy is the best, though 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
Come get some, you little bums 
Dudes want the cake, but they can't get a crumb 
From the original, sexual 
Visual dope chick and all that good shit 
Charismatic when I'm at it 
When I, add it up, I'm mathematic, baby 
Top game, I'm out the attic 
There you have it, no dramatics, hold the static 
Pose for the camera, daddy, I'm vogueing 
Baby, I'm glamorous, and I'm folding 
Grammys and Amas, I'm holding 
Amazing the way I keep shit frozen 
Cool, that's true, got new shoes and a new attitude 
Got my hair did, got a new hairdo 
Come and see me at a venue near you 
I said watch me, I said watch me when I drop it 
Just watch and learn, baby, watch and learn, baby 
It's hot, it burns so I drop it 
Oh baby, watch me when I drop it 
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you? 
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you? 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready

When I roll down the window, let me know where you're 
Atlanta, North South kick it 'lac 
Texas grill, Cadillacs through Miami then back 
To London, Jamaica, then France 
The whole damn world took effect to Ferg 
Tell 'em 
Lay back, slow down 
Better represent when we come to your town 
So lay back, slow down 
Whatchu represent when we come to your town 
Say, get in with the business 
When I come from Kansas city 
Hit Manila til it's Xmas out to India 
I'll visit Puerto Rico 
It's exquisite then my people back to Venice

The LAPD be all over me 
Tryin' to ban me from my own bity 
But for no reason the cops just kill me 
Home of the Rodney King riots this shit been wild

I pop a bottle and all the models wanna fuck now

Or I could take you to the Blippers game

[Verse 1:] 
the devil comes and I try to stall and 
Soon my subconscious and conscious might start to 
brawl 
And I put up my walls 
And they begin to fall 
As this cunning demon takes me as it voodoo doll 
Darkness sets in as the horns start to grow 
Suddenly I become somebody i don´t know 
[Chorus:] 
whoa-what do I do? 
Ooh ooh ooh oh 
This body is a temple of doom 
Whoa-what can I say? 
To-ohh-ohh oh make all of this go away 
I got many different names, 
but 2u its all the same 
I be the crawlin in your skin, 
I be the reason 4 your sin 
I be the cunning in your charm, 
and I be the needle in your arm 
Call me once might let you got, 
call me twice and then 
IM gonna get ya 
[Verse 2:] 
mind playin tricks on me 
I´m paranoid, homie 
Nobody know what Im going through 
God, Im so lonely 
I know Im loosin it 
Im hearing...wispering 
Somebodys watching me,clockin me, 
hear my heart tickin 
Worshiping 2gods can get you in deep 
Crystal ball show you things 
you're not supposed to see 
[Chorus] 
you know I´m comin for ya, 
u know I´m gonna get ya</field>

Diamond on the neck, got a diamond on the ring 
Cash rules everything around me, cream 
Dolla, dolla bills all around me, me 
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast 
I didn't mean to roll up to the club in the ghost 
I didn't mean to pull out a bottle of the Mo 
Do the champagne shower spread, spraying on the clothes 
I didn't mean to hurt 'em, I didn't mean to kill 'em 
I didn't mean to make 10, 20, 100 million 
And ever since I made it, I been murdered on the ceiling 
I know why they be hatin', cause I be top-billing 
And now I'm cold, cool and cold, chilling like a villain 
They feeling my diamonds, the gold on my grillin 
I smile like I swallowed a jeweler 
I'm ill and I'm sick with the paper my bank keep on filling, uh 
What'cha gonna do when I step in the room? 
Betcha y'all ballers gonna rock to the tune 
Betcha y'all ballers gonna rock to the tune

Not, not a, not, not a damn thing, swimming in Lou 
Swimming in fashion, gotta stay cute 
I kill 'em if I show 'em my birthday suit 
I kill 'em when I roll up in my Merce' Coupe 
I don't mean to show off, I don't mean to floss 
I don't mean to be the head chick and the boss 
I didn't mean to buy up the whole damn bar 
I didn't mean to spend it like what, what it cost? 
I didn't mean to whip out the keys to the city 
I didn't mean to dress so fresh and pretty 
I'm talkin' 'bout my ladies 
Rub on your titties 
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties 
Ladies, rub on your booties 
Yeah, honey, I said it, rub on your booties 
Don't mean to hang with these ladies with booties 
We loud and we crazy like we in a movie 
What'cha gonna do when I step in the room?

Wish you could feel it 
You could never survive this burning 
Fever growing inside the shell 
That you call a body 
What have you done to us 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
You know when I'm lost and insecure 
You bring me down further 
I could never live up to perfect 
Just when I've had enough 
Your views change 
Love fills me up 
It's fire we're playing with 
And I'm like a moth attracted to the flame 
One day when you wake up missing me 
I hope you go insane 
Woah 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
And when they all act like crazy 
You will appreciate me 
Cause no one else will love you more 
And take the pain from your thoughts 
And when your world is falling 
Baby I'll let you crawl in 
When you can love me all the way 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Stone wick face on the outside 
Goddess soul on the inside 
I have cried you a thousand oceans 
Cold in every dimension 
This Vitruvian woman 
I can't stretch enough to be 
Everything to everyone, that's real 
And one day when you wake up missing me 
I hope you go insane, oh 
'Cause pain is love and love is pain 
'Cause pain is love and love is pain 
 
And when it hurts like crazy, you will 
appreciate me 
'Cause no one else will love you more 
And take the pain from your thoughts 
And when your world is falling 
Maybe I'll let you crawl in 
When you can love me all the way, oh

            <field name="lyrics">Baby, baby when you're looking deep into my eyes 
I know you're seeing past my make-up 
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry 
when her parents fought, tryin' to be strong 
You can see the hurt in me 
The cover ups so secretly 
and all that I aspire to be, you see,you see 
You know who I really am 
No entourage or caravan 
And do you even give a damn, about all that and tell me 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
I could be the one you want grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
So I dont mean to scare you now and push you away 
Cuz I'm not tryin' to rush anything 
But when I look into your eyes I'm not scared to say 
I sit near you, I'm in the picture too 
Like a happy family tree, we're together costantly 
This could be eventually, we'll see, we'll see 
But all that I have got to know is with me baby you will grow 
Through sun and rain and heavy snow 
Oh tell me so now, baby 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
(Will.I.Am rap verse) 
It's as simple as one and two, I'm in love with you 
And three and four, you're all I adore 
To the seven and height, see I've been making mistakes 
Cuz when you're on my mind, I just can't think straight 
Back to the five and six 
I'm all in the mix and I'm all into you 
Without the lipstick, without the L'Oreal 
You remain the same angel that I fell for, for real, for real 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
I'll give you all that I got 
Don't let aaah, yeah</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream 
Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems 
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day 
But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes 
I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold 
This classic story told, I left it in the cold 
Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you 
Each one unlocking more of the truth 
I finally stopped tripping on my youth 
I finally got lost inside of you 
I finally know I needed to grow 
And finally my mate has met my soul 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something strange and new is happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
I remember the beginning you already knew 
I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool 
Fronting like it didn't matter 
I just ran away, on another face 
Was lost in my own space 
Found what it's like to hurt selfishly 
Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe 
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place 
Stumbled through the mess that I have made 
Finally got out of my own way 
I've finally started living for today 
I finally know I needed to grow 
And finally my mate has met my soul 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something strange and new is happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
Finally, finally 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something beautiful is happening, happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
Ohhhhhhh, finally, finally, finally</field>

And that's when I spit on the bowl 
Now my head's exploding and your gun is loaded 
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll 
Well, it's a fine time looking for a wine time man 
And you said, "Baby, you ready to play?" 
Well, come right on this roller coaster 
'Cause it ain't over, it ain't over 
Now we're on this planet I'm in love 
With all your danger, danger 
We can live forever 
I can be your vacant angel, angel 
Beautiful dangerous 
(Beautiful, it's beautiful, beautiful) 
Now we're on this planet I'm in love 
With all your danger, danger 
We can live forever 
I can be your vacant angel, angel 
Beautiful dangerous 
Now we're on this planet I'm in love 
With all your danger, danger 
We can live forever 
I can be your vacant angel, angel 
Beautiful dangerous</field>

Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da 
(Verse 1:) 
Record sales are on the mark 
Cuz that's about the time the rumors start 
Where all the people talking out their ass 
Well, someone gotta school ya cause ya got no class 
Well I've paid my dues 
I'm a seasoned dame 
So why you gotta throw salt in my game 
You hide behind the computer screens 
So that you don't have to be seen 
How could a person be so mean 
(Chorus) 
Who are you and what do you do 
To make you think you are above me 
But have you walked in my shoes 
The pedestal 
You put yourself on 
Well since I'm breaking it down now 
It's gonna collapse and be gone-gone 
Gone-gone-gone 
Probably one of them tag a longs down 4 the free 
t-shirt 
Cuz you're a hanger on 
You think you got my figured out 
Never met me have no clue what I'm about 
Maybe I got things you wish you had 
You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad 
I work around the clock, 
So fill your smoth up with a sock 
And get you head up off your jock 
Tell me who you are and what your background is 
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this 
(Bridge:) 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, dum dum dum dum 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da 
Tell me who you are and what your background is 
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this 
You think I don't see you on the internet, 
I read it, don't think I won't forget 
(Chorus x2)</field>

Either you're mine or you're not 
Make up your mind, sweet baby 
Right here, right now's all we got 
A little party never killed nobody 
So we gonna dance until we drop 
A little party never killed nobody 
Right here, right now is all we got 
Skip, parap-pap 
Islands, diamonds, trips around the world 
Don't mean a thing if I ain't your girl 
A little party never killed nobody 
So we gonna dance until we drop

All we got-got, got, got-got, got, got-got 
God damn 
Skip, parap-pap 
Hahaha 
Glad that you made it, look around 
You don't see one person sitting down 
They got drinks in their hands 
And the room's a buzz 
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love 
Fake chit chat, the things they got 
Got a stout reputation of keeping it hot girl 
I'm the party of the year and my master plan 
Is to make you realize, I'm your man 
See the people get live 
Underneath the moonlight 
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi 
Hold on while I take this flick 
Speak easy 
Rocking the feathers I'm breezy 
Hope you can keep up boys 
Cause believe me, I'm the bees nees 
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart 
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes 
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart 
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes 
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh

'Bout time I talk to somebody, shrink my head 
A lot of promises broken things that were said 
And I can't get out of this bed 
Got bruises on my heart plenty scars on my mind 
Got blisters under the band-aid over my life 
Gonna rip it open and show the world what's there 
Lord knows I'm not perfect 
When everything around me starts to fall 
I rise up again to the call 
We're all just a little bit broken (yeah) 
We're all just a little bit hurt (yeah) 
We've all got wounds half open (yeah) 
We all can use a little work 
A little work 
A little work 
Gotta wait first of the month to pick up that check 
He bounced, and left, it was over never came back 
Had a lot of questions 'bout daddy after he left 
Now it's just momma and them kids, and she said 
I'll hold her down, don't you worry we'll find a way 
No matter how I'll make sure the bills get paid 
She gave it all and thank God their mouths got fed 
She prayed the cycle would end 
When everything around us starts to fall 
We rise up again to the call 
We're all just a little bit broken (yeah) 
We're all just a little bit hurt (yeah) 
We've all got wounds half open (yeah) 
We all can use a little work 
A little work 
A little work 
Sometimes when you feel like you need it 
They send in the medic 
But if it's your soul that is bleeding 
That slow drip won't help it, no 
It's time to get up to the front of the line 
The guards of the battle and straight for the mind 
Well, well, well, well 
There's nothing that's holding you down 
Stuck on the ground, far from the crown 
'Cause you are a warrior more than you know 
We're all just a little bit broken (yeah) 
We're all just a little bit hurt (yeah) 
We've all got wounds half open (yeah) 
We all can use a little work 
A little work (a little, a little)

Something wrong 
I hold my head 
MJ gone...our n-gga dead! 
I slapped my girl, she called the feds 
I did that time and spent that bread 
I'm heading home, I'm almost there 
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs 
To my surprise, a n-gga replacing me 
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university

Restraining order 
Can't see my daughter 
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order 
Public visitation 
We met at Borders 
Told her she take me back 
I'll be more supportive 
I made mistakes 
I bump my head 
Courts suck me dry 
I spent that bread 
She need a daddy 
Baby please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

I know you're seeing past my make-up 
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry 
when her parents fought, tryin' to be strong 
You can see the hurt in me 
The cover ups so secretly 
and all that I aspire to be, you see,you see 
You know who I really am 
No entourage or caravan 
And do you even give a damn, about all that and tell me 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
I could be the one you want grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
So I dont mean to scare you now and push you away 
Cuz I'm not tryin' to rush anything 
But when I look into your eyes I'm not scared to say 
I sit near you, I'm in the picture too 
Like a happy family tree, we're together costantly 
This could be eventually, we'll see, we'll see 
But all that I have got to know is with me baby you will grow 
Through sun and rain and heavy snow 
Oh tell me so now, baby 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
(Will.I.Am rap verse) 
It's as simple as one and two, I'm in love with you 
And three and four, you're all I adore 
To the seven and height, see I've been making mistakes 
Cuz when you're on my mind, I just can't think straight 
Back to the five and six 
I'm all in the mix and I'm all into you 
Without the lipstick, without the L'Oreal 
You remain the same angel that I fell for, for real, for real 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
I'll give you all that I got

I had to turn my heart away

You lying so low in the weeds

You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees 
Now, wouldn't you, Barracuda? Oh-oh-ohh 
Back over time we were all trying for free 
You met the porpoise in me, uh huh 
No right no wrong, selling a song - 
A name whisper game. 
And if the real thing don't do the trick 
You better make up something quick 
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn into the 
wick 
Ooh, Barracuda! Oh-oh-ohh...yeah 
"Sell me, sell you," the porpoise said 
Dive down deep down save my head 
You...I think that you got the blues, too. 
All that night and all the next, swam without looking 
back 
Made out for western pools - silly, silly fools! 
The real thing don't do the trick, no 
You better make up something quick 
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn into the

Because it is in your blood 
Be Italian

Take a chance and try to steal a fiery kiss 
Be Italian, be Italian 
When you hold me 
Don't just hold me but 
Hold this! 
Please be gentle, sentimental? 
Go ahead and try to give my cheek a pat 
But be daring and uncaring 
When you pinch me, try to pinch me where there's fat 
Be a singer, be a lover 
Pick the flower now before 
The chance is past 
Be Italian 
Be Italian 
Live today as if it may become your last</field>

No one wants to be defeated 
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight 
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right 
Just beat it, beat it, beat it 
No one wants to be defeated 
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight 
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right 
Just beat it, beat it, beat it

Mystery drenches my brain 
I wanna jump deep into your mouth 
'Cause something tells me it's gonna rain 
I hear the thunder thumping and my heart starts jumping 
And that's when I spit on the bowl 
Now my head's exploding and your gun is loaded 
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll 
Well, it's a fine time looking for a wine time man 
And you said, "Baby, you ready to play?" 
Well, come right on this roller coaster 
'Cause it ain't over, it ain't over 
Now we're on this planet I'm in love 
With all your danger, danger 
We can live forever 
I can be your vacant angel, angel 
Beautiful dangerous 
You like it smooth like Ray 
Savor the flavor, would you lie 
You can be sick, I'll be nasty 
'Cause sometimes it's more fun to fight 
I hear the thunder thumping and my heart starts jumping 
And that's when I spit on the bowl 
Now my head's exploding and your gun is loaded 
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll 
Well, it's a fine time looking for a wine time man 
And you said, "Baby, you ready to play?" 
Well, come right on this roller coaster 
'Cause it ain't over, it ain't over 
Now we're on this planet I'm in love 
With all your danger, danger 
We can live forever 
I can be your vacant angel, angel 
Beautiful dangerous 
(Beautiful, it's beautiful, beautiful) 
Now we're on this planet I'm in love 
With all your danger, danger 
We can live forever 
I can be your vacant angel, angel 
Beautiful dangerous 
Now we're on this planet I'm in love 
With all your danger, danger 
We can live forever 
I can be your vacant angel, angel

The smell of your skin lingers on me now 
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown 
I need some shelter of my own protection baby 
Be with myself in center, clarity 
Peace, Serenity 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry 
The path that I'm walking, I must go alone 
I must take the baby steps til I'm full grown,full grown 
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending do they 
And I forseek the dark ahead if I stay 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Like a little school mate in the school yard 
We'll play jacks and uno cards 
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine 
Valentine 
Yes you can hold my hand if you want to 
'cause I wanna hold yours too 
We'll be playmates and lovers 
and share our secret worlds 
But it's time for me to go home 
It's getting late, dark outside 
I need to be with myself in center, clarity 
Peace, Serenity 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry

They want my treasures 
So they get their pleasures from my photo 
You can see me (you can squeeze me) 
I ain't easy (I ain't sleazy) 
I got reasons why I tease 'em 
Boys just come and go like seasons 
Fergalicious, so delicious 
But I ain't promiscuous 
And if you was suspicious 
All that shit is ficticious 
I blow kisses that puts them boys on rock, rock 
And they be lining down the block 
Just to watch what I got 
It's so delicious 
It's hot, hot 
It's so delicious 
I put them boys on rock, rock

They want a taste of what I got

Always looking at me up and down

I ain't tryin' to round up drama little mama 
I don't wanna take your man 
And I know that I'm coming off just a little bit conceited 
And I keep on repeatin' how the boys want to eat it 
But I'm tryin' to tell 
That I can't be treated like clientele

            <field name="lyrics">Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream 
Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems 
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day 
But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes 
I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold 
This classic story told, I left it in the cold 
Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you 
Each one unlocking more of the truth 
I finally stopped tripping on my youth 
I finally got lost inside of you 
I finally know I needed to grow 
And finally my mate has met my soul 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something strange and new is happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
I remember the beginning you already knew 
I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool 
Fronting like it didn't matter 
I just ran away, on another face 
Was lost in my own space 
Found what it's like to hurt selfishly 
Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe 
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place 
Stumbled through the mess that I have made 
Finally got out of my own way 
I've finally started living for today 
I finally know I needed to grow 
And finally my mate has met my soul 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something strange and new is happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
Finally, finally 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something beautiful is happening, happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
Ohhhhhhh, finally, finally, finally</field>

Thats why I'm next on the booth 
D-d-d dance to the groove 
There is no 
There is no getting over you. 
Baby it feels so right 
To dance to the beat up night 
The heat between you and I retreat to the morning light 
We like to live like class 
And pour them shots up in the glass 
But there is no, there is no getting over you. 
I'm a party, and party and party and party...

Wear them gold and diamonds rings 
All them things don't mean a thing 
Chaperons and limousines 
Shopping for expensive things 
I be on the movie screens 
Magazines and boogie scenes 
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine 
I'm n queen, I'm no machine 
I still go to Taco Bell 
Drive thru , raw as Hell 
I don't care, I'm still real 
No matter how many records I sell 
After the show or after the grammys 
I like to go cool out with the family 
Sippin , reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang 
And now I'm in 
We flying the first class 
Up in the sky 
Poppin' champagne

I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us 
Brother gotta keep enough lettuce 
To support your shoe fetish

I got problems up to here 
I've got people in my ear 
Telling me these crazy things 
That I don't want to know (fuck y'all) 
I've got money in the bank 
And I'd really like to thank 
All the fans, I'd like to thank 
Thank you really though 
Cuz I remember yesterday 
When I dream about the days 
When I'd rock on Mtv, that be really dope 
Damn, It's been a long road 
And the industry is cold 
I'm glad my daddy told me so 
he let his daugther know

Who is this right here? She don't look like me 
I was sleeping with the demon every night in my bedroom 
I guess you are who you keep a reflection of me 
That I don't wanna be, no 
Oops, look what you made me do 
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you 
Table set for two, look what you made me prove 
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you 
Just like you 
Just like you 
I don't know if you remember what you did to me (Uh) 
'Cause I can't forget, I see it in my dreams 
I've been living in the nightmare 
All the shit you put me through (Yeah) 
Yeah, tried to break me to pieces 
A beast in my life that I don't really need, no 
Oops, look what you made me do 
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you 
Table set for two, look what you made me prove 
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you 
Just like you 
Gone girl, I don't ever wanna go back 
I thought it was forever, you should know that 
Haunted 'till I finally figure out your game, ayy 
Take a picture in your mind, that's a throwback 
Done twisting it up my life, you should roll that 
Don't be trippin' on my shadow as I walk away 
Oops, look what you made me do 
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you 
Table set for two, look what you made me prove 
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you

The heart is stronger than you think 
It's like it can go through anything 
And even when you think it can't it finds a way to 
still push on, though 
[Carrie] 
Sometimes you want to run away 
Ain't got the patience for the pain 
And if you don't believe it look into 
your heart the beat goes on 
[Rihanna] 
I'm tellin' you that 
Things get better 
Through whatever 
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up 
[Sheryl] 
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle 
[Beyoncé] 
You need to know 
[Refrão] 
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough 
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up 
Who are we to be 
questioning, wondering what is what 
Don't give up 
THROUGH IT ALL, JUST STAND UP 
[Fergie] 
It's like we all have better days 
Problems getting all up in your face 
[Leona] 
Just because you go through it 
[Fergie] 
Don't mean it got to take control, no 
[Leona] 
You ain't gotta find no hiding place 
[Keishia] 
Because the heart can beat the hate 
[Leona] 
Don't wanna let your mind keep playin' you 
[Keishia] 
And sayin' you can't go on

I'm tellin' you that

You can live your life 
[Rihanna/Carrie] 
Yeah 
[Mary] 
Let your heart be your guide 
[Rihanna/Carrie] 
Yeah yeah yeah 
[Mariah] 
And you will know that you're good if you trust in the

Everything will be alright, yeah 
Light up the dark, if you follow your heart

And it will get better

Let One Voice Emerge 
L.O.V.E 
Let your voice be heard 
Women together (l.o.v.e) 
Let One Voice Emerge 
Sisters, it's time, for sure 
To honor every sacrifice 
Of the brave ones who've gone before 
They've already ṗaid the price 
And everyone matters 
It might seem like a whisper 
Something no one else will hear

Truth grows louder and louder

Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of 
Shopping for labels, shopping for love 
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of 
I already know what my addiction is 
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love 
I shop for purses while I walk out the door 
Don't cry, buy a bag and then get over it 
And, I'm not concerned with all the politics (?) 
It's a lot of men I know I could find another one. 
Oughta know that I'm always happy 
When I walk out the store, store 
I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy, 
Nothing to be playing with 
I love him, hate him, kiss him, 
Just I'm trying to walk a mile in my kicks 
(Chorus) 
Love's like a runway but which one do I love more 
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior 
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for 
Let's stop chasing them boys and shop some more 
I know I might come off as negative 
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love 
Relationships are often so hard to tame 
A Prada dress has never broken my heart before 
And, ballin?s something that I?m fed up 
I'mma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing 
Cause I know that my credit card will help me put out the flames 
I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy, 
Nothing to be playing with 
I love him, hate him, kiss him, 
Just I'm trying to walk a mile in my kicks 
[Chorus] 
Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer 
things 
Men they come a dime a dozen, just give me them 
diamond rings 
I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach 
Fellas boast but they can't really handle my female approach 
Buying things is hard to say 
Rocking Christian Audigier, Manolo, Polo, taking 
photos in my Cartier 
So we can't go all the way, I know you might hate it but 
I'm a shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Every day when I wake up 
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup 
But it seems like I never finish 
It's always half full (or is it half empty?) 
Maybe it's my own superstition 
Or a kind of self protection 
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead? 
Still sittin' here 
Just watching the sun go down (down) , down, (down) , down 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
(Who really cares?) 
Every conversation gets me high on motivation 
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation (yeah) 
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable 
In the midst of all the madness (remember life's beautiful) 
Still I'm feeling restless 
Thinking I should rest less 
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore 
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times) 
In my heart I know, less is more (more) 
More (more) , more, more, more 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
It's time to take this out of my hands 
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end? 
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone 
Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
But then again this way I'll never know, never know 
Maybe I should go 
Go crazy, go insane, go for everything 
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching 
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili? 
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli 
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly 
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really? 
Really, really? Really really though? 
Really, really, really though? 
Feel the vibration of the higher ground 
Love always leads to the highest sound 
Many conversations, people makin' speculations 
As to my procrastination due to my revelations 
And then they get fugazi 
You call yourself a rider 
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti 
Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality 
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway?

Not, not a, not, not a damn thing, swimming in green 
Diamond on the neck, got a diamond on the ring 
Cash rules everything around me, cream 
Dolla, dolla bills all around me, me 
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast 
I didn't mean to roll up to the club in the ghost 
I didn't mean to pull out a bottle of the Mo 
Do the champagne shower spread, spraying on the clothes 
I didn't mean to hurt 'em, I didn't mean to kill 'em 
I didn't mean to make 10, 20, 100 million 
And ever since I made it, I been murdered on the ceiling 
I know why they be hatin', cause I be top-billing 
And now I'm cold, cool and cold, chilling like a villain 
They feeling my diamonds, the gold on my grillin 
I smile like I swallowed a jeweler 
I'm ill and I'm sick with the paper my bank keep on filling, uh 
What'cha gonna do when I step in the room? 
Betcha y'all ballers gonna rock to the tune 
Betcha y'all ballers gonna rock to the tune 
Get down to the beat and rock to the tune 
What'cha gonna do when I step in the place?

Roll up in the ghost, baby 
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' 
Not, not a, not, not a damn thing, swimming in Lou 
Swimming in fashion, gotta stay cute 
I kill 'em if I show 'em my birthday suit 
I kill 'em when I roll up in my Merce' Coupe 
I don't mean to show off, I don't mean to floss 
I don't mean to be the head chick and the boss 
I didn't mean to buy up the whole damn bar 
I didn't mean to spend it like what, what it cost? 
I didn't mean to whip out the keys to the city 
I didn't mean to dress so fresh and pretty 
I'm talkin' 'bout my ladies 
Rub on your titties 
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties 
Ladies, rub on your booties 
Yeah, honey, I said it, rub on your booties 
Don't mean to hang with these ladies with booties 
We loud and we crazy like we in a movie 
What'cha gonna do when I step in the room?

Get down to the beat and rock to the tune

Give me love you long time 
All my girls get down on the floor 
Back to back drop it down real low

Because you know what, I don't give a fuck 
So here we go! 
Refrão (x2): 
How come every time you come around 
My London London Bridge wanna go down 
Like London London London wanna go down 
Like London London London be going down 
Drinks start pouring 
And my speech start slowing 
Everybody start looking at you 
The Grey Goose got the girl feeling loose 
Now I wishing that I didn't wear these shoes 
It's like everytime I get up on the dude 
Papparazzi put my business in the news 
And I'm gonna get up out my face (oh, snap) 
Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace (oh, 
snap) 
My lips make you want to have a taste (oh, snap) 
You got that? I got the bass 
Refrão (x2): 
How come every time you come around 
My London London Bridge wanna go down

Don't know what day it is 
What's going on? 
Is this real? 
Oh no, no, no, no, no 
[Verse One] 
I woke up short of breath, 
But I've still got a long day ahead of me 
I don't know what day it is 
But tell me 'cuz I gotta know who to be 
Is that me up in the mirror? 
'Cuz I thought it was somebody else 
Well it's a realization, when you find out 
You don't even wanna look at yourself 
[Chorus] 
Where do I go? 
What do I do? 
Who do I turn to? 
I'm losing my ground 
Who am I now? 
Where does it end? 
How did it all begin? 
I'm losing my ground 
[Verse Two] 
Well, hit my feet, it time to hit the streets 
And get my life back together again 
Well, this place is all a masquerade 
So tell me where in line can I cut in? 
Downtown wandering aimlessly around 
Still don't know what I'm tryin' to find 
Well you could flash all the pretty lights 
In front of me, I still won't see the signs 
[Chorus] 
Where do I go? 
Who do I turn to? 
I'm losing my ground 
Who am I now? 
Where does it end? 
How did it all begin? 
I'm losing my ground 
I'm losing my 
I'm losing my 
I'm losing my ground 
Where do I go? 
What do I do? 
Why do I do this to myself? 
Why do I do? 
Why do I do? 
Why do I do? 
Don't wanna go back there 
Don't wanna go back there 
Where do I go? 
What do I do? 
Who do I turn to? 
I'm loosing my ground 
Who am I now? 
Where does it end? 
How did it all begin? 
I'm losing my ground 
Ground 
I'm losing my 
I'm losing my 
I'm losing my ground.</field>

When you're sick, 
I'll cook you chicken soup 
Just feed me, 
feed me the delicious lines

Me say three, call me your main bae 
'Cause baby I'm your ruca and your [?] 
You're my darling since it started 
We gonna run it, stay one hundred 
Keep it coming at this woman, creation 
So pass the dutchess and give me those eyes 
Pass the dutchie, got me hypnotized 
Your number one, I just wanna be your only love

I'm in love and love is blind 
I'm in love and love is blind, blind 
Love is blind, love is blind

Wish you could feel it 
You could never survive this burning 
Fever growing inside the shell 
That you call a body 
What have you done to us 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
You know when I'm lost and insecure 
You bring me down further 
I could never live up to perfect 
Just when I've had enough 
Your views change 
Love fills me up 
It's fire we're playing with 
And I'm like a moth attracted to the flame 
One day when you wake up missing me 
I hope you go insane 
Woah 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
And when they all act like crazy 
You will appreciate me 
Cause no one else will love you more 
And take the pain from your thoughts 
And when your world is falling 
Baby I'll let you crawl in 
When you can love me all the way 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Stone wick face on the outside 
Goddess soul on the inside 
I have cried you a thousand oceans 
Cold in every dimension 
This Vitruvian woman 
I can't stretch enough to be 
Everything to everyone, that's real 
And one day when you wake up missing me 
I hope you go insane, oh 
'Cause pain is love and love is pain 
'Cause pain is love and love is pain 
 
And when it hurts like crazy, you will 
appreciate me 
'Cause no one else will love you more 
And take the pain from your thoughts 
And when your world is falling 
Maybe I'll let you crawl in 
When you can love me all the way, oh

When I wear my mary jane's shoes 
Just like a child in underoos? 
From my heart 2 my soles 
I feel like I'm seven 
From my head 2 my toes 
It's like I'm in heaven, heaven 
Whoa my Mary Janes 
Whoa my Mary Janes 
Whoa my Mary Janes 
Whoa my Mary Janes 
When I wear my mary jane's shoes 
I enjoy to spin the ones and twos 
Music has another dimension 
And I can dance with a different perception

I am that fly girl 
Can't deny girl 
Nothin’ I won’t try once typa girl 
Well maybe not coke........Cuz’ I’m dope already! 
Lrics sharp like darts and cut like machetes, and I’m rockin’ the shit steady 
Like no doubt, the show sold out, 
They know how I rolled in when I roll out 
Black Eyed Pea, L- Y- T 
Slide through the door leave the track breezy its easy 
They used 2 tease me now they wanna be me 
Lytes in the building of course I’m back 
Get that booty stuck like a culdisak 
I’m the all knowing liek an almanac 
and though ya boy keep callin’ I ain’t callin’ em back! Uh Uh 
This is how we roll, when we mash out 
Its no time 4 tantrums 
I called Lyte so we could mash out 
I swooped her up and then we mashed out 
We stepped in the club 2 turn the party out 
I took sum clix and poked my ass out 
This is how we roll, when we mash out 
Its no time 4 tantrums 
On and on on on and on and 
On and on on on and on and

Fergie Ferg from tha burbs keepin shit flya then birds 
Conseirge vallet pullin’ rite up 2 tha curb 
I stepped in the door, I said it so listen 
Me and MC Lyte takin’ u out on a mission 
Like a space shuttle, me and my girls huddle 
Get back to the crib, bathtubs filled with bubbles 
Champange, cavior, for Hollywood rockstars, back on the road 
Limos with full bar 
F-E-R-G-I-E F-E-R to the G 
(Will.I.Am) 
Fergie Ferg rock hard most definatly on the M-I-C with L-Y-T 
I called Lyte so we could mash out 
I swooped her up and then we mashed out 
We stepped in the club 2 turn the party out

(Will.I.Am) 
To all the cool chickies 
Center stage on the mic 
We putting it on wax 
It's the NEW stuff 
4 and 3 and 2 and 1 
And when I'm on the mic 
The honeys come 
I shoot the shit without a gun 
The rhymes I rock are more than action 
Nothing but that, that satisfaction 
Action packed like actor Jackson 
Stand back, yeah here come the blastin' 
Blastin’ from no other than Will.i.Am 
This is how we roll, when we mash out 
Its no time 4 tantrums 
On and on on on and on and 
On and on on on and on and

But something's coming over me 
Thoughts of stirring up 
'Bout stirring up a drink or three 
I'm down to go, where the wind blows 
So come and follow 
Don't wanna leave ya babe 
Leave ya babe 
So please baby 
We could fly 
Up, up, up, up high 
Blue sky 
Up, up, up, up high 
Feel the high 
Come and take ride 
Above the stars we're going far

If you wanted to have a party 
Come on everybody put down your latte 
Throw your work aside and come to 
Paradise 
No frustration on this vacation 
This destination, this correlation 
No consalation, only sensation 
Paradise 
Where the water is so clear 
That you can see your feet 
Dropping coins 
In my nature by the coral reef 
In every natural treasures 
From mother nature 
We are so wealthy now, wealthy now 
Tell me now 
Say goodbye 
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye 
To all the tries 
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye 
Relax your mind 
Open up a wine 
And then explore 
I'll show you more

You can go search but you never could find, 
I promise you derrty I'm one of a kind. 
Mold is broken, the formulas mine. 
I killed the idea and destroyed the design. 
(Fergie) 
I was patiently waitin and takin my time 
Now that I'm here I'm gettin my shine. 
All of you haters can kiss a behind, 
specifically speakin I'm talkin bout mine. 
Don't need you to tell me, I know that I'm fine. 
I'm killin it baby so call it a crime. 
Yea you watch it I'm stealin my time

Record sales are on the mark 
Cuz that's about the time the rumors start 
Where all the people talking out their ass 
Well, someone gotta school ya cause ya got no class 
Well I've paid my dues 
I'm a seasoned dame 
So why you gotta throw salt in my game 
You hide behind the computer screens 
So that you don't have to be seen 
How could a person be so mean 
(Chorus) 
Who are you and what do you do 
To make you think you are above me 
But have you walked in my shoes 
The pedestal 
You put yourself on 
Well since I'm breaking it down now 
It's gonna collapse and be gone-gone 
Gone-gone-gone 
Probably one of them tag a longs down 4 the free 
t-shirt 
Cuz you're a hanger on 
You think you got my figured out 
Never met me have no clue what I'm about 
Maybe I got things you wish you had 
You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad 
I work around the clock, 
So fill your smoth up with a sock 
And get you head up off your jock 
Tell me who you are and what your background is 
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this 
(Bridge:) 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, dum dum dum dum 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da 
Tell me who you are and what your background is 
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this

Why do you hurt the ones you love the most? 
Love you a lot, you even more 
Why do you hurt the ones you love the most? 
I won't be your punching bag 
Why did I put up with that?

I hate to look into those eyes 
And see an ounce of pain 
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
Where as a child I'd hide 
And pray for the thunder 
And the rain 
To quietly pass me by 
Oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Sweet love of mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Uh, uh, uh, uh 
Sweet love of mine 
Where do we go 
Where do we go now 
Where do we go 
Where do we go

Your body is blowing my mind, 'cause

Got me catching feelings on my dance floor

Got me catching feelings on the dance floor 
All this tension that we can't control

Damn, I'm hoping that we take it home 
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor 
Ain't gonna lie, you got me open wide

We could get it started, make it radiant 
I'm gonna call you daddy when you make me sweat 
And you know like I know 
I'm getting you alone, I'm getting you alone 
And you know like I know 
I'm 'bout to take you home, I'm 'bout to take you home

Girl you got, uh! 
My honey baby, he's my man got me feel in love. 
Knows how to treat me like the man, we got real love. 
I make him lunch and he cook me dinner made with love. 
Desert exotic my body he'll heat it up. 
We go rendezvous in Paris, sipping till we got a thrill. 
Listen to Sergio Mendes on the stages of Brazil. 
Swimming Rio de Janeiro, have a cup of açaí. 
Love is everywhere cause' I know by the way he looks at me. 
'Cause the look of love is in your eyes, the look, your smile, can't desguise. 
The look of love, is saying much more than words could ever say. 
And when you look my way, it takes my breath away. 
Girl you got, got, the love, love, love (7x) 
Girl you got, uh! 
Go to a party with my man we got spicy love. 
Across the crowded room he startes at me full of love. 
Later I meet him in the bedroom making love. 
We keep it naughty our bodies will heat it up. 
Cause we like to keep the passion and we like to feel the fire. 
Dancing in Copacabana got us burning with desire. 
Sergio Mendes playing at the beach house, have juice's by the pool. 
The intensity that we have is just made to me and you. 
'Cause the look of love is in your eyes, the look, your smile, can't desguise. 
The look of love, is saying much more than words could ever say. 
And when you look my way, it takes my breath away. 
Love!.. 
Love!.. 
Love!.. 
Love! 
'Cause the look of love is in your eyes, the look, your smile, can't desguise. 
The look of love, is saying much more than words could ever say. 
And when you look my way, it takes my breath away.</field>

Always in time, but never line for dreams 
Head over heels when toe to toe 
This is the sound of my soul, this is the sound 
I know you love the way my love is (soundin') 
From over there you could feel my heart (poundin') 
Let me swim in your outermind (drownin) 
Forever I'll be upside down (frownin') 
I love you uptown, love ya (downtownin') 
You could be my women, and I could be ya main man 
And that`s why I sat down and wrote this poem 
Cuz I want the truth to be told 
Boy you know I know that is true 
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh I know this much is true 
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh I know this much is true 
Hey hey hey hey hey it's true

Hey hey hey hey hey it's true 
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue 
Dissolve the nerves that just begun 
Listening to Marvin (all night long) 
This is the sound of my soul, this is the sound 
Ya I like the way your soul sounds to me 
Ain't nobody do me the way you do me 
I got the stamina for L-O-V-E 
Whip out the camera let`s make a movie 
In the future we could look back at what we done did 
We'll be makin love til we like a hundred 
And that`s why I had to remix this song 
Cuz I want the truth to be told 
Boy you know I know that is true 
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh I know this much is true

[Verse 1:] 
its cold outside, why dont you come in 
I know, my walls are crumbling 
its late at night 
and lately Ive been alone 
but that could be changing 
what you do to me 
conjures up feelings 
I've never felt before 
and your company I adore 
so deliciously 
gold and burgundy 
sink into me I feel so warm 
[Chorus:] 
I feel you 
I taste you the smoothest as wine 
like velvet 
cant help it 
this loves divine 
[Verse 2:] 
the moon is full 
the stars are aligned 
I know, just look into my eyes 
its beautiful, 
your skin against mine 
I hope, you let your mind take flight 
under velvet skies 
lover we can fly away from the world 
let all of our love unfurl 
what a gorgeous ride 
you dont have to hide 
a thing from me, I am your girl 
[Chorus:] 
I feel you 
I taste you as wine 
the smoothest like velvet, cant help it 
this loves divine 
[Bridge:] 
Im ready to fell you 
slowly we escape 
our time we can take, we can take, we can take 
Im ready to fell you, fell you, fell you, fell you, 
fell you, feel feel 
[Chorus x2] 
I fell you 
I taste you 
the smoothest as wine 
like velvet 
cant help it 
this loves divine</field>

[Verse 1:] 
the devil comes and I try to stall and 
Soon my subconscious and conscious might start to 
brawl 
And I put up my walls 
And they begin to fall 
As this cunning demon takes me as it voodoo doll 
Darkness sets in as the horns start to grow 
Suddenly I become somebody i don´t know 
[Chorus:] 
whoa-what do I do? 
Ooh ooh ooh oh 
This body is a temple of doom 
Whoa-what can I say? 
To-ohh-ohh oh make all of this go away 
I got many different names, 
but 2u its all the same 
I be the crawlin in your skin, 
I be the reason 4 your sin 
I be the cunning in your charm, 
and I be the needle in your arm 
Call me once might let you got, 
call me twice and then 
IM gonna get ya 
[Verse 2:] 
mind playin tricks on me 
I´m paranoid, homie 
Nobody know what Im going through 
God, Im so lonely 
I know Im loosin it 
Im hearing...wispering 
Somebodys watching me,clockin me, 
hear my heart tickin 
Worshiping 2gods can get you in deep 
Crystal ball show you things 
you're not supposed to see 
[Chorus] 
you know I´m comin for ya, 
u know I´m gonna get ya</field>

[Verse 1:] 
Oh Well ah, why do I keep pulling out the roots of my hair? 
I'm picking at my face, it's obvious there's nothing there 
Why do I keep biting on the edge of my chin 
It feels so good to have a taste of what I'm crawling in. 
I got to go, I got to lead the way 
The chains of today, are pulling me 
Even though I thought things over in my head on If I'd stay, it's another ticket to your next game 
[Chorus:] 
Wake up, wake up, now 
Wake up, wake up 
I'll still be leaving you today now 
Shake up, shake up, now breakup breakup 
I know your little plans 
(I know your little plans) 
Would you see me, when you stop winning 
So Wake up, Wake up now, Wake up, Wake up, 
Cause I just got you back 
[Verse 2:] 
Why did you keep talking out two sides of your mouth 
You didn't think I'd hear from people, 
Hi your selling out 
What did you think, making your deals 
That I couldn't keep up 
Manipulative, Calculative, I bet you thought, 
I didn't know, I couldn't see, 
The spade displayed, your plan for using me 
You'd better bet your counterfiet, 
It's time to say good-night, 
It's another reason to say Good-bye, good-bye, Buhbye 
[Chorus] 
Wake up, wake up, now 
Wake up, wake up 
I'll still be leaving you today now 
Shake up, shake up, now breakup breakup 
I know your little plans 
(I know your little plans) 
Would you see me, when you stop winning 
So Wake up, Wake up now, Wake up, Wake up, 
Cause I just got you back

The Coffee is brewing now... 
That's for me pouring now ooh 
Eyes open now I see, 
All that you take from me-

Wake up, wake up now 
Wake up, wake up 
I'll still be leaving you today now 
Shake up, shake up, now breakup breakup

Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
Let it go, get rolled, I just can't hold 
Back and forth 'cause I'm the girl with soul 
Ain't controlling effects, so what the heck 
Rock the discotheque 'cause this groove is up next 
Tease on the camera, freeze while I animate 
I'm no amateur, I'm a laminate 
I'ma assassinate all the imitates 
Then I'ma take a break, and meditate 
Hmm, let me think about it 
Put my little noodle on the problem, then I drink about it 
Drink a little, swig a little, sip a little, spill a little 
Feel a little loopy when I get a little tipsy 
Beez got me feeling like a gypsy 
Smoking on that hookah 
got me feeling like a hippie, trippy 
Gone for a minute and you missed me 
Now Fergie back with a bag full of tricksies 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know

Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
Yo, ayo, let it go, let's go 
I keep a bar like Esco 
I wanna ball, where the Nets go? 
I'm on stage, you can stand where the guests go 
Bitches is my sons, they don't wanna leave the nest tho 
They like, uh, where the ref go? 
I-I got these hoes scared to pass, I got that intercept flow 
I made a movie like Seth Rog 
And since I came in the game, they careers on death row 
Damn, I ain't see young Nicki in a week 
Five shows, made three millie in a week 
You are now looking at the the best, the elite 
Too bad you can't go and invest in critiques 
I'm thick and petite, tell 'em quick pick a seat 
I pull up in a Ghost, no sheets, trick or treat 
I know they on E, but I don't give a F, though 
Bad attitude, but my pussy is the best, though 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
Come get some, you little bums 
Dudes want the cake, but they can't get a crumb 
From the original, sexual 
Visual dope chick and all that good shit 
Charismatic when I'm at it 
When I, add it up, I'm mathematic, baby 
Top game, I'm out the attic 
There you have it, no dramatics, hold the static 
Pose for the camera, daddy, I'm vogueing 
Baby, I'm glamorous, and I'm folding 
Grammys and Amas, I'm holding 
Amazing the way I keep shit frozen 
Cool, that's true, got new shoes and a new attitude 
Got my hair did, got a new hairdo 
Come and see me at a venue near you 
I said watch me, I said watch me when I drop it 
Just watch and learn, baby, watch and learn, baby 
It's hot, it burns so I drop it 
Oh baby, watch me when I drop it 
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you? 
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you? 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready

The smell of your skin lingers on me now 
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown 
I need some shelter of my own protection baby 
Be with myself in center, clarity 
Peace, Serenity 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry 
The path that I'm walking, I must go alone 
I must take the baby steps til I'm full grown,full grown 
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending do they 
And I forseek the dark ahead if I stay 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you

But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Like a little school mate in the school yard 
We'll play jacks and uno cards 
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine 
Valentine 
Yes you can hold my hand if you want to 
'cause I wanna hold yours too 
We'll be playmates and lovers 
and share our secret worlds 
But it's time for me to go home 
It's getting late, dark outside 
I need to be with myself in center, clarity 
Peace, Serenity 
I hope you know, I hope you know

And they be lining down the block 
Just to watch what I got

[Chorus:] 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
[Verse:] 
Wear them gold and diamonds rings 
All them things don't mean a thing 
Chaperons and limousines 
Shopping for expensive things 
I be on the movie screens 
Magazines and boogie scenes 
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine 
I'm n queen, I'm no machine 
I still go to Taco Bell 
Drive thru , raw as Hell 
I don't care, I'm still real 
No matter how many records I sell 
After the show or after the grammys 
I like to go cool out with the family 
Sippin , reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang 
And now I'm in 
We flying the first class 
Up in the sky 
Poppin' champagne 
Livin' my life 
In the fast lane 
And I wont change 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
[Ludacris:] 
I'm talking Champagne wishes, caviar dreams 
You deserve nothing but all the finer things 
Now this whole world has no clue to do with us 
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us 
Brother gotta keep enough lettuce 
To support your shoe fetish 
Life styles so rich and famous 
Robin Leach will get jelous 
Half a million for the stones 
Taking trips from here to Rome 
So If you ain't got no money 
take yo'broke ass home 
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
I got problems up to here 
I've got people in my ear 
Telling me these crazy things 
That I don't want to know (fuck y'all) 
I've got money in the bank 
And I'd really like to thank 
All the fans, I'd like to thank 
Thank you really though 
Cuz I remember yesterday 
When I dream about the days 
When I'd rock on Mtv, that be really dope 
Damn, It's been a long road 
And the industry is cold 
I'm glad my daddy told me so 
he let his daugther know

Pop the seeds, don't be hating me in the line 
V.I.P because you know I gotta shine 
I'm Fergie Ferg 
Give me love you long time 
All my girls get down on the floor 
Back to back drop it down real low 
I'm such a lady but I'm dancing like a ho 
Because you know what, I don't give a fuck 
So here we go! 
Refrão (x2): 
How come every time you come around 
My London London Bridge wanna go down 
Like London London London wanna go down 
Like London London London be going down 
Drinks start pouring 
And my speech start slowing 
Everybody start looking at you 
The Grey Goose got the girl feeling loose 
Now I wishing that I didn't wear these shoes 
It's like everytime I get up on the dude 
Papparazzi put my business in the news 
And I'm gonna get up out my face (oh, snap) 
Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace (oh, 
snap) 
My lips make you want to have a taste (oh, snap) 
You got that? I got the bass 
Refrão (x2): 
How come every time you come around 
My London London Bridge wanna go down 
Like London London London wanna go down 
Like London London London be going down 
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do 
Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right

Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup 
But it seems like I never finish 
It's always half full (or is it half empty?) 
Maybe it's my own superstition 
Or a kind of self protection 
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead? 
Still sittin' here 
Just watching the sun go down (down) , down, (down) , down 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
(Who really cares?) 
Every conversation gets me high on motivation 
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation (yeah) 
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable 
In the midst of all the madness (remember life's beautiful) 
Still I'm feeling restless 
Thinking I should rest less 
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore 
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times) 
In my heart I know, less is more (more) 
More (more) , more, more, more 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
It's time to take this out of my hands 
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end? 
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone 
Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
But then again this way I'll never know, never know 
Maybe I should go 
Go crazy, go insane, go for everything 
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching 
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili? 
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli 
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly 
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really? 
Really, really? Really really though? 
Really, really, really though? 
Feel the vibration of the higher ground 
Love always leads to the highest sound 
Many conversations, people makin' speculations 
As to my procrastination due to my revelations 
And then they get fugazi 
You call yourself a rider 
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti 
Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality 
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
Who cares anyway? 
You could go or you could stay 
You could go, you could stay</field>

Glad that you made it, look around 
You don't see one person sitting down 
They got drinks in their hands 
And the room's a buzz 
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love 
Fake chit chat, the things they got 
Got a stout reputation of keeping it hot girl 
I'm the party of the year and my master plan 
Is to make you realize, I'm your man 
See the people get live 
Underneath the moonlight 
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi 
Hold on while I take this flick 
Speak easy 
Rocking the feathers I'm breezy 
Hope you can keep up boys 
Cause believe me, I'm the bees nees 
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart 
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes 
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart 
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes

I'll probably break down and cry

And wait out your storm of words again 
Build a wall and put my armour on 
Escape the bullets, babe 
Silent stares to see who's giving in 
Who will be the first to break? 
Got that look on your face tonight 
What ya gonna say? 
But this girl is walking, walking (Yeah) 
And you start talking, talking (Uh-huh) 
'Cause baby we're about to blow 
(I'm 'bout to blow) 
Don't tell me things 
you'll be regretting (Yeah) 
'Cause I'm never gonna forget 'em (Nah) 
Tonight, we gotta let it go-o-o-o 
My heart is screaming out, leave me alone 
Just don't start, we'll work it out tomorrow 
We can kick and fight, stay up all damn night 
Thinking you and I are enemies (Woah) 
But these dark skies are gonna be clear (Shh) 
Just save it 'til morning 
Save it 'til morning (Ahh) 
All the sorry's, the apologies 
All the "You're not good enough's" 
All the careless words 
you throw on me 
It's hard to scrape them off 
Like a barnacle, they stick to me 
Like a zombie's eating my flesh 
So baby, think before you speak 
And take a deep breath 
But this girl is walking, walking (Yeah) 
And you start talking, talking (Uh-huh) 
'Cause baby we're about to blow 
(I'm 'bout to blow) 
Don't tell me things 
you'll be regretting (Yeah) 
'Cause I'm never gonna forget 'em (Nah) 
Tonight, we gotta let it go-o-o-o 
My heart is screaming out, leave me alone 
Just don't start, we'll work it out tomorrow 
We can kick and fight, stay up all damn night 
Thinking you and I are enemies (Woah) 
But these dark skies are gonna be clear (Shh) 
Just save it 'til morning 
Light from the dawn, bringing the calm 
Bringing the haze away out of the fog 
Moving the clouds, lifting the doubt 
Seeing it for what it really is now 
Love you a lot, you even more 
Why do you hurt the ones you love the most? 
Love you a lot, you even more 
Why do you hurt the ones you love the most? 
I won't be your punching bag 
Why did I put up with that? 
We gotta figure it out (Rhum) 
You don't want me to figure that out 
My heart is screaming out, leave me alone 
Just don't start, we'll work it out tomorrow 
We can kick and fight, stay up all damn night 
Thinking you and I are enemies (Woah) 
But these dark skies are gonna be clear (Shh)

Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
Let it go, get rolled, I just can't hold 
Back and forth 'cause I'm the girl with soul 
Ain't controlling effects, so what the heck 
Rock the discotheque 'cause this groove is up next 
Tease on the camera, freeze while I animate 
I'm no amateur, I'm a laminate 
I'ma assassinate all the imitates 
Then I'ma take a break, and meditate 
Hmm, let me think about it 
Put my little noodle on the problem, then I drink about it 
Drink a little, swig a little, sip a little, spill a little 
Feel a little loopy when I get a little tipsy 
Beez got me feeling like a gypsy 
Smoking on that hookah 
got me feeling like a hippie, trippy 
Gone for a minute and you missed me 
Now Fergie back with a bag full of tricksies 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
Yo, ayo, let it go, let's go 
I keep a bar like Esco 
I wanna ball, where the Nets go? 
I'm on stage, you can stand where the guests go 
Bitches is my sons, they don't wanna leave the nest tho 
They like, uh, where the ref go? 
I-I got these hoes scared to pass, I got that intercept flow 
I made a movie like Seth Rog 
And since I came in the game, they careers on death row 
Damn, I ain't see young Nicki in a week 
Five shows, made three millie in a week 
You are now looking at the the best, the elite 
Too bad you can't go and invest in critiques 
I'm thick and petite, tell 'em quick pick a seat 
I pull up in a Ghost, no sheets, trick or treat 
I know they on E, but I don't give a F, though 
Bad attitude, but my pussy is the best, though 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
Come get some, you little bums 
Dudes want the cake, but they can't get a crumb 
From the original, sexual 
Visual dope chick and all that good shit 
Charismatic when I'm at it 
When I, add it up, I'm mathematic, baby 
Top game, I'm out the attic 
There you have it, no dramatics, hold the static 
Pose for the camera, daddy, I'm vogueing 
Baby, I'm glamorous, and I'm folding 
Grammys and Amas, I'm holding 
Amazing the way I keep shit frozen 
Cool, that's true, got new shoes and a new attitude 
Got my hair did, got a new hairdo 
Come and see me at a venue near you 
I said watch me, I said watch me when I drop it 
Just watch and learn, baby, watch and learn, baby 
It's hot, it burns so I drop it 
Oh baby, watch me when I drop it 
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you? 
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you? 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready

This is how we do, this is how we do

[Verse 1:] 
the devil comes and I try to stall and 
Soon my subconscious and conscious might start to 
brawl 
And I put up my walls 
And they begin to fall 
As this cunning demon takes me as it voodoo doll 
Darkness sets in as the horns start to grow 
Suddenly I become somebody i don´t know 
[Chorus:] 
whoa-what do I do? 
Ooh ooh ooh oh 
This body is a temple of doom 
Whoa-what can I say? 
To-ohh-ohh oh make all of this go away 
I got many different names, 
but 2u its all the same 
I be the crawlin in your skin, 
I be the reason 4 your sin 
I be the cunning in your charm, 
and I be the needle in your arm 
Call me once might let you got, 
call me twice and then 
IM gonna get ya 
[Verse 2:] 
mind playin tricks on me 
I´m paranoid, homie 
Nobody know what Im going through 
God, Im so lonely 
I know Im loosin it 
Im hearing...wispering 
Somebodys watching me,clockin me, 
hear my heart tickin 
Worshiping 2gods can get you in deep 
Crystal ball show you things 
you're not supposed to see 
[Chorus] 
you know I´m comin for ya, 
u know I´m gonna get ya</field>

Not, not a, not, not a damn thing, swimming in green 
Diamond on the neck, got a diamond on the ring 
Cash rules everything around me, cream 
Dolla, dolla bills all around me, me 
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast 
I didn't mean to roll up to the club in the ghost 
I didn't mean to pull out a bottle of the Mo 
Do the champagne shower spread, spraying on the clothes 
I didn't mean to hurt 'em, I didn't mean to kill 'em 
I didn't mean to make 10, 20, 100 million 
And ever since I made it, I been murdered on the ceiling 
I know why they be hatin', cause I be top-billing 
And now I'm cold, cool and cold, chilling like a villain 
They feeling my diamonds, the gold on my grillin 
I smile like I swallowed a jeweler 
I'm ill and I'm sick with the paper my bank keep on filling, uh 
What'cha gonna do when I step in the room? 
Betcha y'all ballers gonna rock to the tune 
Betcha y'all ballers gonna rock to the tune

Not, not a, not, not a damn thing, swimming in Lou 
Swimming in fashion, gotta stay cute 
I kill 'em if I show 'em my birthday suit 
I kill 'em when I roll up in my Merce' Coupe 
I don't mean to show off, I don't mean to floss 
I don't mean to be the head chick and the boss 
I didn't mean to buy up the whole damn bar 
I didn't mean to spend it like what, what it cost? 
I didn't mean to whip out the keys to the city 
I didn't mean to dress so fresh and pretty 
I'm talkin' 'bout my ladies 
Rub on your titties 
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties 
Ladies, rub on your booties 
Yeah, honey, I said it, rub on your booties 
Don't mean to hang with these ladies with booties 
We loud and we crazy like we in a movie 
What'cha gonna do when I step in the room?

You could never survive this burning

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

I could never live up to perfect 
Just when I've had enough 
Your views change 
Love fills me up 
It's fire we're playing with 
And I'm like a moth attracted to the flame 
One day when you wake up missing me 
I hope you go insane 
Woah 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
And when they all act like crazy 
You will appreciate me 
Cause no one else will love you more 
And take the pain from your thoughts 
And when your world is falling 
Baby I'll let you crawl in 
When you can love me all the way 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Stone wick face on the outside 
Goddess soul on the inside 
I have cried you a thousand oceans 
Cold in every dimension 
This Vitruvian woman 
I can't stretch enough to be 
Everything to everyone, that's real 
And one day when you wake up missing me 
I hope you go insane, oh 
'Cause pain is love and love is pain 
'Cause pain is love and love is pain 
 
And when it hurts like crazy, you will 
appreciate me 
'Cause no one else will love you more 
And take the pain from your thoughts

            <field name="lyrics">Baby, baby when you're looking deep into my eyes 
I know you're seeing past my make-up 
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry 
when her parents fought, tryin' to be strong 
You can see the hurt in me 
The cover ups so secretly 
and all that I aspire to be, you see,you see 
You know who I really am 
No entourage or caravan 
And do you even give a damn, about all that and tell me 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
I could be the one you want grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
So I dont mean to scare you now and push you away 
Cuz I'm not tryin' to rush anything 
But when I look into your eyes I'm not scared to say 
I sit near you, I'm in the picture too 
Like a happy family tree, we're together costantly 
This could be eventually, we'll see, we'll see 
But all that I have got to know is with me baby you will grow 
Through sun and rain and heavy snow 
Oh tell me so now, baby 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
(Will.I.Am rap verse) 
It's as simple as one and two, I'm in love with you 
And three and four, you're all I adore 
To the seven and height, see I've been making mistakes 
Cuz when you're on my mind, I just can't think straight 
Back to the five and six 
I'm all in the mix and I'm all into you 
Without the lipstick, without the L'Oreal 
You remain the same angel that I fell for, for real, for real 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
I'll give you all that I got 
Don't let aaah, yeah</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream 
Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems 
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day 
But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes 
I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold 
This classic story told, I left it in the cold 
Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you 
Each one unlocking more of the truth 
I finally stopped tripping on my youth 
I finally got lost inside of you 
I finally know I needed to grow 
And finally my mate has met my soul 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something strange and new is happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
I remember the beginning you already knew 
I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool 
Fronting like it didn't matter 
I just ran away, on another face 
Was lost in my own space 
Found what it's like to hurt selfishly 
Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe 
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place 
Stumbled through the mess that I have made 
Finally got out of my own way 
I've finally started living for today 
I finally know I needed to grow 
And finally my mate has met my soul 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something strange and new is happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
Finally, finally 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something beautiful is happening, happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
Ohhhhhhh, finally, finally, finally</field>

To say it's complicated, understatement of the year 
Well maybe conflict made it a new flavor in your ear 
They know that I'm a problem, that's why everybody scared 
Whatever doesn't kill you, can make you an I'll-ionaire 
Just turn the headphones up 
Or make the windows roll up 
I make they hands go up 
When I show up and I blow it 'til I'm full up, wait, hold up 
Girl up in the mirror 
Only one I fear, uh 
You say you the realest 
I told you I'm the illest 
Sick

I'm moonwalking on marble floors 
Rick Ross, I'm just drippin' sauce 
Bitches see me and they all just wave 
Rolls Royce and we call this Wraith 
I fuck up money like I'm Escobar 
Ballin', ballin', Kobe Bryant, that boy living large 
No room for medium, that means you thinkin' small 
Ferrari, Fergie, switching gears, she rockin' with a boss 
I close my eyes, I must be telepathic 
Look over haters, tripling my assets 
It takes courage to accomplish these things 
Fergie's my queen, I'm the king 
Now come kiss on our rings

Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da 
(Verse 1:) 
Record sales are on the mark 
Cuz that's about the time the rumors start 
Where all the people talking out their ass 
Well, someone gotta school ya cause ya got no class 
Well I've paid my dues 
I'm a seasoned dame 
So why you gotta throw salt in my game 
You hide behind the computer screens 
So that you don't have to be seen 
How could a person be so mean 
(Chorus) 
Who are you and what do you do 
To make you think you are above me 
But have you walked in my shoes 
The pedestal 
You put yourself on 
Well since I'm breaking it down now 
It's gonna collapse and be gone-gone 
Gone-gone-gone 
Probably one of them tag a longs down 4 the free 
t-shirt 
Cuz you're a hanger on 
You think you got my figured out 
Never met me have no clue what I'm about 
Maybe I got things you wish you had 
You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad 
I work around the clock, 
So fill your smoth up with a sock 
And get you head up off your jock 
Tell me who you are and what your background is 
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this 
(Bridge:) 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, dum dum dum dum 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da 
Tell me who you are and what your background is 
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this 
You think I don't see you on the internet, 
I read it, don't think I won't forget

Glad that you made it, look around 
You don't see one person sitting down 
They got drinks in their hands 
And the room's a buzz 
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love 
Fake chit chat, the things they got 
Got a stout reputation of keeping it hot girl 
I'm the party of the year and my master plan 
Is to make you realize, I'm your man 
See the people get live 
Underneath the moonlight 
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi 
Hold on while I take this flick 
Speak easy 
Rocking the feathers I'm breezy 
Hope you can keep up boys 
Cause believe me, I'm the bees nees 
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart 
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes 
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh 
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart 
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh

And I can't get out of this bed 
Got bruises on my heart plenty scars on my mind 
Got blisters under the band-aid over my life 
Gonna rip it open and show the world what's there 
Lord knows I'm not perfect 
When everything around me starts to fall 
I rise up again to the call 
We're all just a little bit broken (yeah) 
We're all just a little bit hurt (yeah) 
We've all got wounds half open (yeah) 
We all can use a little work 
A little work 
A little work 
Gotta wait first of the month to pick up that check 
He bounced, and left, it was over never came back 
Had a lot of questions 'bout daddy after he left 
Now it's just momma and them kids, and she said 
I'll hold her down, don't you worry we'll find a way 
No matter how I'll make sure the bills get paid 
She gave it all and thank God their mouths got fed 
She prayed the cycle would end 
When everything around us starts to fall 
We rise up again to the call 
We're all just a little bit broken (yeah)

Sometimes when you feel like you need it 
They send in the medic 
But if it's your soul that is bleeding 
That slow drip won't help it, no 
It's time to get up to the front of the line 
The guards of the battle and straight for the mind 
Well, well, well, well 
There's nothing that's holding you down 
Stuck on the ground, far from the crown 
'Cause you are a warrior more than you know 
We're all just a little bit broken (yeah) 
We're all just a little bit hurt (yeah) 
We've all got wounds half open (yeah)

Want you to see all of the lights

            <field name="lyrics">Baby, baby when you're looking deep into my eyes 
I know you're seeing past my make-up 
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry 
when her parents fought, tryin' to be strong 
You can see the hurt in me 
The cover ups so secretly 
and all that I aspire to be, you see,you see 
You know who I really am 
No entourage or caravan 
And do you even give a damn, about all that and tell me 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
I could be the one you want grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
So I dont mean to scare you now and push you away 
Cuz I'm not tryin' to rush anything 
But when I look into your eyes I'm not scared to say 
I sit near you, I'm in the picture too 
Like a happy family tree, we're together costantly 
This could be eventually, we'll see, we'll see 
But all that I have got to know is with me baby you will grow 
Through sun and rain and heavy snow 
Oh tell me so now, baby 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
(Will.I.Am rap verse) 
It's as simple as one and two, I'm in love with you 
And three and four, you're all I adore 
To the seven and height, see I've been making mistakes 
Cuz when you're on my mind, I just can't think straight 
Back to the five and six 
I'm all in the mix and I'm all into you 
Without the lipstick, without the L'Oreal 
You remain the same angel that I fell for, for real, for real 
Would you love me if I didn't work out 
or I didn't change my natural hair? 
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby 
I'll give you all that I got 
I'll give you all that I got 
Don't let aaah, yeah</field>

I had to turn my heart away 
You smile like the sun - kisses for everyone 
And tails - it never fails! 
You lying so low in the weeds 
I bet you gonna ambush me 
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees 
Now, wouldn't you, Barracuda? Oh-oh-ohh 
Back over time we were all trying for free 
You met the porpoise in me, uh huh 
No right no wrong, selling a song - 
A name whisper game. 
And if the real thing don't do the trick 
You better make up something quick 
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn into the 
wick 
Ooh, Barracuda! Oh-oh-ohh...yeah 
"Sell me, sell you," the porpoise said 
Dive down deep down save my head 
You...I think that you got the blues, too. 
All that night and all the next, swam without looking 
back 
Made out for western pools - silly, silly fools! 
The real thing don't do the trick, no 
You better make up something quick 
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn into the 
wick 
Ohhh, Barra...barracuda! Yeah</field>

You want to know about love? 
Saraghina will tell you 
If you want to make a woman happy 
You rely on what you were born with 
Because it is in your blood 
Be Italian 
Be Italian 
Take a chance and try to steal a fiery kiss 
Be Italian, be Italian 
When you hold me 
Don't just hold me but 
Hold this! 
Please be gentle, sentimental? 
Go ahead and try to give my cheek a pat 
But be daring and uncaring 
When you pinch me, try to pinch me where there's fat 
Be a singer, be a lover 
Pick the flower now before 
The chance is past 
Be Italian 
Be Italian 
Live today as if it may become your last</field>

Mystery drenches my brain 
I wanna jump deep into your mouth 
'Cause something tells me it's gonna rain 
I hear the thunder thumping and my heart starts jumping 
And that's when I spit on the bowl 
Now my head's exploding and your gun is loaded 
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll 
Well, it's a fine time looking for a wine time man 
And you said, "Baby, you ready to play?" 
Well, come right on this roller coaster 
'Cause it ain't over, it ain't over 
Now we're on this planet I'm in love 
With all your danger, danger 
We can live forever 
I can be your vacant angel, angel 
Beautiful dangerous 
You like it smooth like Ray 
Savor the flavor, would you lie 
You can be sick, I'll be nasty 
'Cause sometimes it's more fun to fight 
I hear the thunder thumping and my heart starts jumping 
And that's when I spit on the bowl 
Now my head's exploding and your gun is loaded 
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll 
Well, it's a fine time looking for a wine time man

The smell of your skin lingers on me now 
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown 
I need some shelter of my own protection baby 
Be with myself in center, clarity 
Peace, Serenity 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry 
The path that I'm walking, I must go alone 
I must take the baby steps til I'm full grown,full grown 
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending do they 
And I forseek the dark ahead if I stay 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Like a little school mate in the school yard 
We'll play jacks and uno cards 
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine 
Valentine 
Yes you can hold my hand if you want to 
'cause I wanna hold yours too 
We'll be playmates and lovers 
and share our secret worlds 
But it's time for me to go home 
It's getting late, dark outside 
I need to be with myself in center, clarity 
Peace, Serenity 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
That this has nothing to do with you 
It's personal, myself and I 
We got some straightening out to do 
And I'm gonna miss you 
like a child misses their blanket 
But I've gotta get a move on with my life 
It's time to be a big girl now 
And big girls don't cry 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry, 
Don't cry

Très bien, merci et vous, et vous, et vous 
Et vous, et vous, et vous 
Enchanted, delighted to meet you, excited 
The people, the music, I want to consume it 
Too simple, this greeting, a ritual, a meeting 
The first time impression, your truest expression 
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would 
If I could live inside this dance, I would 
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would

This feeling, can't lose it, it's better to use it 
To find out, discover how we like each other 
The mystery, not knowing 
Why can't we be showing our secrets, the magic 
Let's reach out and grab it 
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would 
If I could live inside this dance, I would 
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would 
If I could live inside this dance, I would

So come and go my way, let's do this every day 
Happy is where I be, so take a ride with me 
So come and go my way, let's do this every day 
Happy is where I be, so take a ride with me 
New memories, new faces, applaud it, embrace it 
With kisses, "I love you's", below and above you 
The details, the levels make me want to revel 
Inside your perspective, I swear I'm objected 
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would 
If I could live inside this dance, I would

Wake me up in the morning 
Slow me down in the evening 
Give me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
Wake me up in the morning 
Slow me down in the evening 
Give me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
I'm so 3000 and great, they're so 2000 and hate 
They want me to fall and fail 
Hurry up and wait 
I'm a psycho on a beach, Norman Bates 
I'm on that Voli as wet 
as the five great lakes 
Break 
Five, six, seven, eight 
I'm something like a pimp 
when I put my words on the track 
(slap) 
Hustle, hustle, hard grind, I'm known for that (slap) 
Hustler business, man, and now he's a businessman 
That chill got more flips than a gymnast man 
Who is this man? Chick chick bang 
Wake me up in the morning 
Slow me down in the evening

Wake me up in the morning 
Slow me down in the evening 
Give me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
Let's get galactic, ultramatic, 
Space invader, dance floor operator, 
Supersonic elevator, next level upgrader 
Take you higher, modulator

Heartbeat going faster and faster 
I'm glad you make it last, make it last, yeah 
Heartbeat going faster and faster, baby 
Make it, make it last, make it last, now baby 
Wake me up in the morning

Listen up y'all cuz this is it

Fergalicious definition make the boys go loco 
They want my treasures 
So they get their pleasures from my photo 
You can see me (you can squeeze me)

Boys just come and go like seasons 
Fergalicious, so delicious 
But I ain't promiscuous 
And if you was suspicious, 
All that shit is ficticious 
I blow kisses that puts them boys on rock, rock 
And they be lining down the block 
Just to watch what I got 
(Chorus) 
It's so delicious

            <field name="lyrics">Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream 
Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems 
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day 
But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes 
I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold 
This classic story told, I left it in the cold 
Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you 
Each one unlocking more of the truth 
I finally stopped tripping on my youth 
I finally got lost inside of you 
I finally know I needed to grow 
And finally my mate has met my soul 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something strange and new is happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
I remember the beginning you already knew 
I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool 
Fronting like it didn't matter 
I just ran away, on another face 
Was lost in my own space 
Found what it's like to hurt selfishly 
Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe 
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place 
Stumbled through the mess that I have made 
Finally got out of my own way 
I've finally started living for today 
I finally know I needed to grow 
And finally my mate has met my soul 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something strange and new is happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
Finally, finally 
Finally 
Now my destiny can begin 
Though we'll have our differences 
Something beautiful is happening, happening 
Finally 
Now my life doesn't seem so bad 
Is the best that I've ever had 
Give my love to him finally 
Ohhhhhhh, finally, finally, finally</field>

Magazines and boogie scenes 
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine 
I'm n queen, I'm no machine 
I still go to Taco Bell 
Drive thru , raw as Hell 
I don't care, I'm still real 
No matter how many records I sell 
After the show or after the grammys 
I like to go cool out with the family 
Sippin , reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang 
And now I'm in 
We flying the first class 
Up in the sky 
Poppin' champagne 
Livin' my life 
In the fast lane 
And I wont change 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
[Ludacris:] 
I'm talking Champagne wishes, caviar dreams 
You deserve nothing but all the finer things 
Now this whole world has no clue to do with us 
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us 
Brother gotta keep enough lettuce 
To support your shoe fetish 
Life styles so rich and famous 
Robin Leach will get jelous 
Half a million for the stones 
Taking trips from here to Rome 
So If you ain't got no money 
take yo'broke ass home 
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S 
We flying the first class 
Up in the sky 
Poppin' champagne 
Livin' my life 
In the fast lane 
And I wont change 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
The glamorous 
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life) 
By the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy 
I got problems up to here 
I've got people in my ear 
Telling me these crazy things 
That I don't want to know (fuck y'all) 
I've got money in the bank 
And I'd really like to thank 
All the fans, I'd like to thank 
Thank you really though 
Cuz I remember yesterday 
When I dream about the days 
When I'd rock on Mtv, that be really dope 
Damn, It's been a long road 
And the industry is cold 
I'm glad my daddy told me so 
he let his daugther know

Dollars in the bank, gotta be frank 
Captain hook chicks quick

For my dividends for not seeing it coming

Done twisting it up my life, you should roll that 
Don't be trippin' on my shadow as I walk away

The heart is stronger than you think 
It's like it can go through anything 
And even when you think it can't it finds a way to 
still push on, though

Sometimes you want to run away 
Ain't got the patience for the pain 
And if you don't believe it look into 
your heart the beat goes on 
[Rihanna] 
I'm tellin' you that 
Things get better 
Through whatever 
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up 
[Sheryl] 
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle 
[Beyoncé] 
You need to know

If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough 
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up 
Who are we to be 
questioning, wondering what is what 
Don't give up 
THROUGH IT ALL, JUST STAND UP

It's like we all have better days 
Problems getting all up in your face

Just because you go through it

Don't mean it got to take control, no

You ain't gotta find no hiding place

Have you ever seen a gangsta nigga 
Make a billion dollars? 
Dre did it, he from L 
A so pop yo collar 
The LAPD be all over me 
Tryin' to ban me from my own bity 
But for no reason the cops just kill me 
Home of the Rodney King riots this shit been wild 
I hit the club and party like I scored a touchdown 
I pop a bottle and all the models wanna fuck now 
We jammin' on Pico, bustin' hoes on Sunset 
I could take you to Venice Beach and watch the sun set 
Or I could take you to the Blippers game

Remember that you have a say 
It's your one chance to channel your hopes 
Don't let this chance slip away 
Cause everyone matters 
It might seem like a whisper 
Something no one else will hear 
But if we're together 
Truth grows louder and louder 
Speak from your conscience, with nothing to fear 
L.O.V.E 
Let One Voice Emerge 
L.O.V.E 
Let your voice be heard 
Women together (l.o.v.e) 
Let One Voice Emerge 
Sisters, it's time, for sure 
To honor every sacrifice 
Of the brave ones who've gone before 
They've already ṗaid the price 
And everyone matters 
It might seem like a whisper 
Something no one else will hear 
But if we're together 
Truth grows louder and louder 
Speak from your conscience, with nothing to fear 
L.O.V.E 
Let one voice emerge 
L.O.V.E 
Let your voice be heard (2X) 
Cause everyone matters 
It might seem like a whisper 
When we're together 
Till you learn you can walk 
We can do better 
Truth goes louder notes in a core 
Notes in a core

Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of 
Shopping for labels, shopping for love 
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of 
I already know what my addiction is 
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love 
I shop for purses while I walk out the door 
Don't cry, buy a bag and then get over it 
And, I'm not concerned with all the politics (?) 
It's a lot of men I know I could find another one. 
Oughta know that I'm always happy 
When I walk out the store, store 
I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy, 
Nothing to be playing with 
I love him, hate him, kiss him, 
Just I'm trying to walk a mile in my kicks 
(Chorus) 
Love's like a runway but which one do I love more 
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior 
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for 
Let's stop chasing them boys and shop some more 
I know I might come off as negative 
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love 
Relationships are often so hard to tame 
A Prada dress has never broken my heart before 
And, ballin?s something that I?m fed up 
I'mma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing 
Cause I know that my credit card will help me put out the flames 
I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy, 
Nothing to be playing with 
I love him, hate him, kiss him, 
Just I'm trying to walk a mile in my kicks 
[Chorus] 
Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer 
things 
Men they come a dime a dozen, just give me them 
diamond rings 
I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach 
Fellas boast but they can't really handle my female approach 
Buying things is hard to say 
Rocking Christian Audigier, Manolo, Polo, taking 
photos in my Cartier 
So we can't go all the way, I know you might hate it but 
I'm a shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love</field>

Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup 
But it seems like I never finish 
It's always half full (or is it half empty?) 
Maybe it's my own superstition 
Or a kind of self protection 
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead? 
Still sittin' here 
Just watching the sun go down (down) , down, (down) , down 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
(Who really cares?) 
Every conversation gets me high on motivation 
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation (yeah) 
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable 
In the midst of all the madness (remember life's beautiful) 
Still I'm feeling restless 
Thinking I should rest less 
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore 
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times) 
In my heart I know, less is more (more) 
More (more) , more, more, more 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway? 
Life goes on with or without you 
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do? 
You could go or you could stay 
But who cares anyway? 
It's time to take this out of my hands 
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end? 
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone 
Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
But then again this way I'll never know, never know 
Maybe I should go 
Go crazy, go insane, go for everything 
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching 
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili? 
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli 
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly 
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really? 
Really, really? Really really though? 
Really, really, really though? 
Feel the vibration of the higher ground 
Love always leads to the highest sound 
Many conversations, people makin' speculations 
As to my procrastination due to my revelations 
And then they get fugazi 
You call yourself a rider 
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti 
Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality 
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari 
Life goes on with or without you 
It's up to you what you're gonna do 
You could go or you could stay 
Who cares anyway?

Dolla, dolla bills all around me, me 
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast 
I didn't mean to roll up to the club in the ghost 
I didn't mean to pull out a bottle of the Mo 
Do the champagne shower spread, spraying on the clothes 
I didn't mean to hurt 'em, I didn't mean to kill 'em 
I didn't mean to make 10, 20, 100 million 
And ever since I made it, I been murdered on the ceiling 
I know why they be hatin', cause I be top-billing 
And now I'm cold, cool and cold, chilling like a villain 
They feeling my diamonds, the gold on my grillin 
I smile like I swallowed a jeweler 
I'm ill and I'm sick with the paper my bank keep on filling, uh 
What'cha gonna do when I step in the room? 
Betcha y'all ballers gonna rock to the tune 
Betcha y'all ballers gonna rock to the tune

Not, not a, not, not a damn thing, swimming in Lou 
Swimming in fashion, gotta stay cute 
I kill 'em if I show 'em my birthday suit 
I kill 'em when I roll up in my Merce' Coupe 
I don't mean to show off, I don't mean to floss 
I don't mean to be the head chick and the boss 
I didn't mean to buy up the whole damn bar 
I didn't mean to spend it like what, what it cost? 
I didn't mean to whip out the keys to the city 
I didn't mean to dress so fresh and pretty 
I'm talkin' 'bout my ladies 
Rub on your titties 
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties 
Ladies, rub on your booties 
Yeah, honey, I said it, rub on your booties 
Don't mean to hang with these ladies with booties

V.I.P because you know I gotta shine 
I'm Fergie Ferg 
Give me love you long time 
All my girls get down on the floor 
Back to back drop it down real low 
I'm such a lady but I'm dancing like a ho 
Because you know what, I don't give a fuck 
So here we go! 
Refrão (x2): 
How come every time you come around 
My London London Bridge wanna go down 
Like London London London wanna go down 
Like London London London be going down 
Drinks start pouring 
And my speech start slowing 
Everybody start looking at you 
The Grey Goose got the girl feeling loose 
Now I wishing that I didn't wear these shoes 
It's like everytime I get up on the dude 
Papparazzi put my business in the news 
And I'm gonna get up out my face (oh, snap) 
Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace (oh, 
snap) 
My lips make you want to have a taste (oh, snap) 
You got that? I got the bass 
Refrão (x2): 
How come every time you come around 
My London London Bridge wanna go down 
Like London London London wanna go down 
Like London London London be going down 
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do 
Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right 
Fergie lovin' 'em long time 
My girls support right? 
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do

Don't know what day it is 
What's going on? 
Is this real? 
Oh no, no, no, no, no 
[Verse One] 
I woke up short of breath, 
But I've still got a long day ahead of me 
I don't know what day it is 
But tell me 'cuz I gotta know who to be 
Is that me up in the mirror? 
'Cuz I thought it was somebody else 
Well it's a realization, when you find out 
You don't even wanna look at yourself 
[Chorus] 
Where do I go? 
What do I do? 
Who do I turn to? 
I'm losing my ground 
Who am I now? 
Where does it end? 
How did it all begin? 
I'm losing my ground 
[Verse Two] 
Well, hit my feet, it time to hit the streets 
And get my life back together again 
Well, this place is all a masquerade 
So tell me where in line can I cut in? 
Downtown wandering aimlessly around 
Still don't know what I'm tryin' to find 
Well you could flash all the pretty lights 
In front of me, I still won't see the signs 
[Chorus] 
Where do I go? 
Who do I turn to? 
I'm losing my ground 
Who am I now? 
Where does it end? 
How did it all begin? 
I'm losing my ground 
I'm losing my 
I'm losing my 
I'm losing my ground 
Where do I go? 
What do I do? 
Why do I do this to myself? 
Why do I do? 
Why do I do? 
Why do I do? 
Don't wanna go back there 
Don't wanna go back there 
Where do I go? 
What do I do? 
Who do I turn to? 
I'm loosing my ground 
Who am I now? 
Where does it end? 
How did it all begin? 
I'm losing my ground 
Ground 
I'm losing my 
I'm losing my 
I'm losing my ground.</field>

Oh darling, tell me, pretty please 
Oh baby, baby, won't you tell me 
what I want to hear? 
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone 
'Bout those bitches, I don't wanna know 
They think they love you, 
fuck those other hoes 
They had you for a minute 
just tell them you belong to me 
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone 
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone 
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone 
Your number one, I just wanna be your only love 
To me, it's crystal clear, 
I'm in love and love is blind 
I'm in love and love is blind 
Cook you breakfast 
in my birthday suit 
When you're sick, 
I'll cook you chicken soup 
Just feed me, 
feed me the delicious lines 
I want to hear 
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone 
'Bout those bitches, I don't wanna know

Me say three, call me your main bae 
'Cause baby I'm your ruca and your [?] 
You're my darling since it started 
We gonna run it, stay one hundred 
Keep it coming at this woman, creation 
So pass the dutchess and give me those eyes 
Pass the dutchie, got me hypnotized 
Your number one, I just wanna be your only love

I'm in love and love is blind 
I'm in love and love is blind, blind 
Love is blind, love is blind

            <field name="lyrics">You don't know how it feels to be me 
Wish you could feel it 
You could never survive this burning 
Fever growing inside the shell 
That you call a body 
What have you done to us 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
You know when I'm lost and insecure 
You bring me down further 
I could never live up to perfect 
Just when I've had enough 
Your views change 
Love fills me up 
It's fire we're playing with 
And I'm like a moth attracted to the flame 
One day when you wake up missing me 
I hope you go insane 
Woah 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
And when they all act like crazy 
You will appreciate me 
Cause no one else will love you more 
And take the pain from your thoughts 
And when your world is falling 
Baby I'll let you crawl in 
When you can love me all the way 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Cause pain is love and love is pain 
Stone wick face on the outside 
Goddess soul on the inside 
I have cried you a thousand oceans 
Cold in every dimension 
This Vitruvian woman 
I can't stretch enough to be 
Everything to everyone, that's real 
And one day when you wake up missing me 
I hope you go insane, oh 
'Cause pain is love and love is pain 
'Cause pain is love and love is pain 
 
And when it hurts like crazy, you will 
appreciate me 
'Cause no one else will love you more 
And take the pain from your thoughts 
And when your world is falling 
Maybe I'll let you crawl in 
When you can love me all the way, oh

When I wear my mary jane's shoes 
Just like a child in underoos? 
From my heart 2 my soles 
I feel like I'm seven 
From my head 2 my toes 
It's like I'm in heaven, heaven 
Whoa my Mary Janes 
Whoa my Mary Janes 
Whoa my Mary Janes 
Whoa my Mary Janes 
When I wear my mary jane's shoes 
I enjoy to spin the ones and twos 
Music has another dimension 
And I can dance with a different perception

Nothin’ I won’t try once typa girl 
Well maybe not coke........Cuz’ I’m dope already! 
Lrics sharp like darts and cut like machetes, and I’m rockin’ the shit steady 
Like no doubt, the show sold out, 
They know how I rolled in when I roll out 
Black Eyed Pea, L- Y- T 
Slide through the door leave the track breezy its easy 
They used 2 tease me now they wanna be me 
Lytes in the building of course I’m back 
Get that booty stuck like a culdisak 
I’m the all knowing liek an almanac 
and though ya boy keep callin’ I ain’t callin’ em back! Uh Uh 
This is how we roll, when we mash out 
Its no time 4 tantrums 
I called Lyte so we could mash out 
I swooped her up and then we mashed out 
We stepped in the club 2 turn the party out 
I took sum clix and poked my ass out 
This is how we roll, when we mash out

Conseirge vallet pullin’ rite up 2 tha curb 
I stepped in the door, I said it so listen 
Me and MC Lyte takin’ u out on a mission 
Like a space shuttle, me and my girls huddle 
Get back to the crib, bathtubs filled with bubbles 
Champange, cavior, for Hollywood rockstars, back on the road 
Limos with full bar 
F-E-R-G-I-E F-E-R to the G

Fergie Ferg rock hard most definatly on the M-I-C with L-Y-T

To all the cool chickies 
Center stage on the mic 
We putting it on wax 
It's the NEW stuff 
4 and 3 and 2 and 1 
And when I'm on the mic 
The honeys come 
I shoot the shit without a gun 
The rhymes I rock are more than action 
Nothing but that, that satisfaction 
Action packed like actor Jackson 
Stand back, yeah here come the blastin' 
Blastin’ from no other than Will.i.Am 
This is how we roll, when we mash out 
Its no time 4 tantrums 
On and on on on and on and 
On and on on on and on and

I killed the idea and destroyed the design. 
(Fergie) 
I was patiently waitin and takin my time 
Now that I'm here I'm gettin my shine. 
All of you haters can kiss a behind, 
specifically speakin I'm talkin bout mine. 
Don't need you to tell me, I know that I'm fine. 
I'm killin it baby so call it a crime. 
Yea you watch it I'm stealin my time 
I told you before that big girls don't cry.

Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da 
(Verse 1:) 
Record sales are on the mark 
Cuz that's about the time the rumors start 
Where all the people talking out their ass 
Well, someone gotta school ya cause ya got no class 
Well I've paid my dues 
I'm a seasoned dame 
So why you gotta throw salt in my game 
You hide behind the computer screens 
So that you don't have to be seen 
How could a person be so mean 
(Chorus) 
Who are you and what do you do 
To make you think you are above me 
But have you walked in my shoes 
The pedestal 
You put yourself on 
Well since I'm breaking it down now 
It's gonna collapse and be gone-gone 
Gone-gone-gone 
Probably one of them tag a longs down 4 the free 
t-shirt 
Cuz you're a hanger on 
You think you got my figured out 
Never met me have no clue what I'm about 
Maybe I got things you wish you had 
You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad 
I work around the clock, 
So fill your smoth up with a sock 
And get you head up off your jock 
Tell me who you are and what your background is 
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this 
(Bridge:) 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, dum dum dum dum 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down 
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da 
Tell me who you are and what your background is 
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this 
You think I don't see you on the internet, 
I read it, don't think I won't forget

How it's so hard for me to just..call you 
It's like I have this felings, but 
Something just keeps...holding me back 
Speaking:

It's like my insecurities,my fears 
I just gotta know that you're gonna be there 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Singing: 
I feel you missing me 
I know you're missing me 
'Cause I've been missing you 
Baby it's true, yeah it's true,it's true 
I know you're wanting me

Build a wall and put my armour on

What ya gonna say? 
But this girl is walking, walking (Yeah)

Don't tell me things 
you'll be regretting (Yeah) 
'Cause I'm never gonna forget 'em (Nah) 
Tonight, we gotta let it go-o-o-o 
My heart is screaming out, leave me alone 
Just don't start, we'll work it out tomorrow 
We can kick and fight, stay up all damn night 
Thinking you and I are enemies (Woah) 
But these dark skies are gonna be clear (Shh) 
Just save it 'til morning

All the sorry's, the apologies 
All the "You're not good enough's" 
All the careless words

Light from the dawn, bringing the calm 
Bringing the haze away out of the fog 
Moving the clouds, lifting the doubt 
Seeing it for what it really is now 
Love you a lot, you even more 
Why do you hurt the ones you love the most? 
Love you a lot, you even more 
Why do you hurt the ones you love the most? 
I won't be your punching bag 
Why did I put up with that? 
We gotta figure it out (Rhum)

Reminds me of childhood memories 
Where everything 
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
Now and then when I see her face 
She takes me away to that special place 
And if I stare too long 
I'll probably break down and cry 
Oh, oh, oh 
Sweet child o' mine 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Sweet love of mine 
She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
As if they thought of rain 
I hate to look into those eyes 
And see an ounce of pain 
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
Where as a child I'd hide 
And pray for the thunder 
And the rain 
To quietly pass me by 
Oh, oh, oh

My honey baby, he's my man got me feel in love. 
Knows how to treat me like the man, we got real love. 
I make him lunch and he cook me dinner made with love. 
Desert exotic my body he'll heat it up. 
We go rendezvous in Paris, sipping till we got a thrill. 
Listen to Sergio Mendes on the stages of Brazil. 
Swimming Rio de Janeiro, have a cup of açaí. 
Love is everywhere cause' I know by the way he looks at me. 
'Cause the look of love is in your eyes, the look, your smile, can't desguise. 
The look of love, is saying much more than words could ever say. 
And when you look my way, it takes my breath away. 
Girl you got, got, the love, love, love (7x) 
Girl you got, uh! 
Go to a party with my man we got spicy love. 
Across the crowded room he startes at me full of love. 
Later I meet him in the bedroom making love. 
We keep it naughty our bodies will heat it up. 
Cause we like to keep the passion and we like to feel the fire. 
Dancing in Copacabana got us burning with desire. 
Sergio Mendes playing at the beach house, have juice's by the pool. 
The intensity that we have is just made to me and you. 
'Cause the look of love is in your eyes, the look, your smile, can't desguise. 
The look of love, is saying much more than words could ever say. 
And when you look my way, it takes my breath away. 
Love!.. 
Love!.. 
Love!.. 
Love! 
'Cause the look of love is in your eyes, the look, your smile, can't desguise. 
The look of love, is saying much more than words could ever say.

Ya I like the way your soul sounds to me 
Ain't nobody do me the way you do me

Whip out the camera let`s make a movie

We'll be makin love til we like a hundred 
And that`s why I had to remix this song

[Verse 1:] 
its cold outside, why dont you come in 
I know, my walls are crumbling 
its late at night 
and lately Ive been alone 
but that could be changing 
what you do to me 
conjures up feelings 
I've never felt before 
and your company I adore 
so deliciously 
gold and burgundy 
sink into me I feel so warm 
[Chorus:] 
I feel you 
I taste you the smoothest as wine 
like velvet 
cant help it 
this loves divine 
[Verse 2:] 
the moon is full 
the stars are aligned 
I know, just look into my eyes 
its beautiful, 
your skin against mine 
I hope, you let your mind take flight 
under velvet skies 
lover we can fly away from the world 
let all of our love unfurl 
what a gorgeous ride 
you dont have to hide 
a thing from me, I am your girl 
[Chorus:] 
I feel you 
I taste you as wine 
the smoothest like velvet, cant help it 
this loves divine 
[Bridge:] 
Im ready to fell you 
slowly we escape 
our time we can take, we can take, we can take 
Im ready to fell you, fell you, fell you, fell you, 
fell you, feel feel 
[Chorus x2] 
I fell you 
I taste you 
the smoothest as wine 
like velvet 
cant help it

the devil comes and I try to stall and 
Soon my subconscious and conscious might start to 
brawl 
And I put up my walls 
And they begin to fall 
As this cunning demon takes me as it voodoo doll 
Darkness sets in as the horns start to grow 
Suddenly I become somebody i don´t know 
[Chorus:] 
whoa-what do I do? 
Ooh ooh ooh oh 
This body is a temple of doom 
Whoa-what can I say? 
To-ohh-ohh oh make all of this go away 
I got many different names, 
but 2u its all the same 
I be the crawlin in your skin, 
I be the reason 4 your sin 
I be the cunning in your charm, 
and I be the needle in your arm 
Call me once might let you got, 
call me twice and then 
IM gonna get ya 
[Verse 2:] 
mind playin tricks on me 
I´m paranoid, homie 
Nobody know what Im going through 
God, Im so lonely 
I know Im loosin it 
Im hearing...wispering 
Somebodys watching me,clockin me, 
hear my heart tickin 
Worshiping 2gods can get you in deep 
Crystal ball show you things 
you're not supposed to see

Oh Well ah, why do I keep pulling out the roots of my hair? 
I'm picking at my face, it's obvious there's nothing there 
Why do I keep biting on the edge of my chin 
It feels so good to have a taste of what I'm crawling in. 
I got to go, I got to lead the way 
The chains of today, are pulling me 
Even though I thought things over in my head on If I'd stay, it's another ticket to your next game 
[Chorus:] 
Wake up, wake up, now 
Wake up, wake up 
I'll still be leaving you today now 
Shake up, shake up, now breakup breakup 
I know your little plans 
(I know your little plans) 
Would you see me, when you stop winning 
So Wake up, Wake up now, Wake up, Wake up, 
Cause I just got you back 
[Verse 2:] 
Why did you keep talking out two sides of your mouth 
You didn't think I'd hear from people, 
Hi your selling out 
What did you think, making your deals 
That I couldn't keep up 
Manipulative, Calculative, I bet you thought, 
I didn't know, I couldn't see, 
The spade displayed, your plan for using me 
You'd better bet your counterfiet, 
It's time to say good-night, 
It's another reason to say Good-bye, good-bye, Buhbye

Wake up, wake up, now 
Wake up, wake up 
I'll still be leaving you today now 
Shake up, shake up, now breakup breakup 
I know your little plans 
(I know your little plans) 
Would you see me, when you stop winning 
So Wake up, Wake up now, Wake up, Wake up, 
Cause I just got you back 
[Guitar] 
The Coffee is brewing now... 
That's for me pouring now ooh 
Eyes open now I see, 
All that you take from me- 
[Guitar] 
[Chorus] 
Wake up, wake up now 
Wake up, wake up 
I'll still be leaving you today now 
Shake up, shake up, now breakup breakup 
I know your little plans 
Would you see me, when you stop winning 
So Wake Up, Wake up now, Wake up, Wake up, 
I just got you back

So, never let me go 
I will be your journey 
And you will be my road 
Down the stormy path 
Love will never come to pass 
It will be an anchor 
Although the winds may blow 
[Pre-Chorus:] 
And through the depths of high and low 
Wherever you will go, I'll follow 
To the end, back again 
You know 
[Chorus:] 
Won't let you fall 
Fall out of love 
'Cause together we'll be holding on 
'Cause all we have is us 
Won't let you go 
Go away again 
Because life don't mean nothing at all 
If I don't have your love 
[Verse:] 
I will dry your tears 
Take away your fears 
Let me be your shelter 
Your heart is safe in here 
So beautiful and pure 
There's nothing I would not endure 
Oh, love as got me blinded 
I see it all so clear 
[Pre-Chorus (1x)] 
[Chorus (1x)] 
[Bridge:] 
I'm down for you for whatever 
Anything you going through 
What's mine is yours 
Every little thing 
I got you 
Even when winds will change 
Come smashing down and crashing on you

Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
Let it go, get rolled, I just can't hold 
Back and forth 'cause I'm the girl with soul 
Ain't controlling effects, so what the heck 
Rock the discotheque 'cause this groove is up next 
Tease on the camera, freeze while I animate 
I'm no amateur, I'm a laminate 
I'ma assassinate all the imitates 
Then I'ma take a break, and meditate 
Hmm, let me think about it 
Put my little noodle on the problem, then I drink about it 
Drink a little, swig a little, sip a little, spill a little 
Feel a little loopy when I get a little tipsy 
Beez got me feeling like a gypsy 
Smoking on that hookah 
got me feeling like a hippie, trippy 
Gone for a minute and you missed me 
Now Fergie back with a bag full of tricksies 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
Yo, ayo, let it go, let's go 
I keep a bar like Esco 
I wanna ball, where the Nets go? 
I'm on stage, you can stand where the guests go 
Bitches is my sons, they don't wanna leave the nest tho 
They like, uh, where the ref go? 
I-I got these hoes scared to pass, I got that intercept flow 
I made a movie like Seth Rog 
And since I came in the game, they careers on death row 
Damn, I ain't see young Nicki in a week 
Five shows, made three millie in a week 
You are now looking at the the best, the elite 
Too bad you can't go and invest in critiques 
I'm thick and petite, tell 'em quick pick a seat 
I pull up in a Ghost, no sheets, trick or treat 
I know they on E, but I don't give a F, though 
Bad attitude, but my pussy is the best, though 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
Come get some, you little bums 
Dudes want the cake, but they can't get a crumb 
From the original, sexual 
Visual dope chick and all that good shit 
Charismatic when I'm at it 
When I, add it up, I'm mathematic, baby 
Top game, I'm out the attic 
There you have it, no dramatics, hold the static 
Pose for the camera, daddy, I'm vogueing 
Baby, I'm glamorous, and I'm folding 
Grammys and Amas, I'm holding 
Amazing the way I keep shit frozen 
Cool, that's true, got new shoes and a new attitude 
Got my hair did, got a new hairdo 
Come and see me at a venue near you 
I said watch me, I said watch me when I drop it 
Just watch and learn, baby, watch and learn, baby 
It's hot, it burns so I drop it 
Oh baby, watch me when I drop it 
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you? 
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you? 
Life's a movie, let the camera roll 
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow 
That's right, baby, you already know 
You already know, hope you're ready 
Ready, steady, steady, rocking 
This is how we do, this is how we do 
This is how we do, this is how we do

Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain 
In Southern California, much like Arizona

they pour when I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
(Ooh, no, no, no) 
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (You know, know, know) 
I've been thinkin' 'bout you 
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya? 
Or do you not think so far ahead? 
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh) 
No, I don't like you, 
I just thought you were cool enough to kick it 
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho 
Since you think I don't love you, 
I just thought you were cute 
That's why I kiss you 
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though 
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you

'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh) 
Yes, of course 
I remember, how could I forget? 
How you feel? 
And though you were my first time 
A new feel 
It won't ever get old, not in my soul 
Not in my spirit, keep it alive 
We'll go down this road 
'Til it turns from color to black and white

Yeah, yeah oh 
Yeah, yeah yeah 
[verse 1: frank ocean] 
That's the way everyday goes 
Every time we have no control 
If the sky is pink and white 
If the ground is black and yellow 
It's the same way you showed me 
Nod my head, don't close my eyes 
Half way on a slow move 
It's the same way you showed me 
If you could fly then you'd feel south 
Up north's getting cold soon 
The way it is, we're on land 
So I'm someone to hold true 
Keep you cool in this good life 
Won't let you down when it's all ruined 
[hook: frank ocean] 
Just the same way you showed me, showed me 
You showed me love 
Glory from above 
Good glory, dear 
It's all downhill from here 
[verse 2: frank ocean] 
In the wake of a hurricane 
Dark skin of a summer shade 
Nose dive in the flood lines 
Tall tower, milk crate 
It's the same way you showed me 
Cannon ball off the porch side 
Older kids trying off the roof 
Just the same way you showed me (you showed) 
If you could die and come back to life 
Up for air from the swimming pool 
You kneel down to the dry land 
Kiss the earth that birthed you 
Gave you tools just to stay alive 
And make it up when the sun is ruined 
[hook: frank ocean] 
That's the same way you showed me, showed me 
You showed me love 
Glory from above 
Where god could fear 
It's all downhill from here 
[outro: frank ocean beyoncé] 
Real life, lamar woods, don king 
Michael jackson all this year 
(we've come) say what up to magic, just shoot 
Say what up to daddy 
Say what up to life, I found it 
And I know what you might want to know 
Run from me and your team 
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy) 
Give me somethin sweet 
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin

When you said you love me 
It started from nothing 
I had no chance to prepare 
I couldn't see you coming 
It started from nothing 
I could hate you now 
It's quite alright to hate me now 
When we both know that deep down 
The feeling still deep down is good 
 
If I could see through walls 
I could see you're faking 
If you could see my thoughts 
You would see our faces 
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then 
We didn't give a fuck back then 
I ain't a kid no more 
We'll never be those kids again 
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then 
Back then 
No matter what I did 
My waves wouldn't dip back then 
Everything sucked back then 
We were friends 
 
I thought that I was dreaming 
When you said you love me 
It started from nothing 
I had no chance to prepare 
I couldn't see you coming 
It started from nothing 
I could hate you now 
It's quite alright to hate me now 
When we both know that deep down 
The feeling still deep down is good 
 
In the halls of your hotel 
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell 
How much I meant to you 
Meant it sincere back then 
We had time to kill back then 
You ain't a kid no more 
We'll never be those kids again 
It's not the same, ivory's illegal 
Don't you remember? 
I broke your heart last week 
You'll probably feel better by the weekend 
Still remember, had you going crazy 
Scream my name 
The feeling deep down is good 
 
I thought that I was dreaming 
When you said you love me 
It started from nothing 
I had no chance to prepare 
I couldn't see you coming 
It started from nothing 
I could hate you now 
It's alright to hate me now 
When we both know that deep down 
The feeling still deep down is good 
 
All the things I didn't mean to say 
I didn't mean to do 
There were things you didn't need to say 
Didn't need to...need to 
I could dream all night 
Dream all night 
I could drive all night 
Drive all night 
Dreaming, dreamin'</field>

Round the city 
Round the clock 
Everybody needs you 
No you can't make everybody equal 
Although you got beaucoup family 
You don't even got nobody 
Being honest with you 
Breath till I evaporated 
My whole body see through 
Transportation, handmade 
And I know it better than most people 
I don't trust them anyways 
You can't break the law with them 
Get some pussy have a calm night 
Shooters killing left and right 
Working through your worst night 
If I get my money right 
You know I won't need you 
And I tell you, (biitch) 
I hope the sack is full up 
I'm fuckin', no I'm fucked up 
Spend it when I get that 
I ain't trying to keep you 
Can't keep up a conversation 
Can't nobody reach you 
Why your eyes well up 
Did you call me from a seance 
You are from a past life 
Hope you're doing well bruh

Always like the head first 
Signal coming in and out 
Hope you're doing well bruh

Every night fucks every day up 
Every day patches the night up 
On god you should match it, it's that ko 
No white lights til I fuck my 28th up 
In 1998 my family had that acura, oh 
The legend, kept at least 
Six discs in the changer 
Back when boswell and percy had it active 
Couple bishops in the city building mansions 
All the reverends 
Preaching self made millionaire status 
When we could only eat at shoneys on occasion 
After trina hit I had to transfer campus 
Your apartment out in houston's 
Where I waited 
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address 
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress 
Working on a way to make it outta texas 
Every night

Drop the baby off at home 
Before my night shift

            <field name="lyrics">Set the cheetahs on the loose 
There's a thief out on the move 
Underneath our legion's view 
They have taken Cleopatra 
Run run run, come back for my glory 
Bring her back to me 
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh 
The throne of our queen is empty 
We'll run to the future 
Shining like diamonds in a rocky world 
A rocky, rocky world 
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere 
As we march to rhythm 
On the palace floor 
Chandeliers inside the pyramid 
Tremble from the force 
Cymbals crash inside the pyramid 
Voices fill up the halls 
Set the cheetahs on the loose 
There's a thief out on the move 
Underneath our legion's view 
They have taken Cleopatra 
The jewel of Africa 
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious? 
How could you run off on me? 
How could you run off on us? 
You feel like God inside that gold 
I found you laying down with Samson 
And his full head of hair 
Found my black queen Cleopatra 
Bad dreams, Cleopatra 
Remove her 
Send the cheetahs to the tomb 
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom 
No more she lives no more serpent in her room 
No more it has killed Cleopatra 
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds 
Wake up to your girl for now, let's call her Cleopatra 
I watch you fix your hair 
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra 
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra 
Then your six-inch heels 
Catch her 
She's headed to the pyramid 
[Hook] 
She's working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Pimping in my convos 
Bubbles in my champagne 
Let it be some jazz playing 
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars 
Floor model TV with the VCR 
Got rubies in my damn chain 
Whip ain't got no gas tank 
But it still got woodgrain 
Got your girl working for me 
Hit the strip and my bills paid 
That keep my bills paid 
Hit the strip and my bills paid 
Keep a nigga bills paid 
[Hook] 
She's working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body 
Touch you in places only I know 
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater 
Can we make love before you go 
The way you say my name makes me feel like 
I'm that nigga 
But I'm still unemployed 
You say it's big but you take it 
Ride cowgirl 
But your love ain't free no more 
But your love ain't free no more

She's working at the pyramid tonight

Tell 'em it ain't likely

Must be on that white like Othello 
All you want is Nikes

Rip Trayvon, that nigga look just like me 
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo! 
That my little cousin, he got a little trade 
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid 
We out by the pool, some little mermaids 
Me and them gel 
Like twigs with them bangs 
Now that's a real mermaid 
You been holding your breath 
Weighted down 
Punk madre, punk papa 
He don't care for me 
But he cares for me 
And that's good enough 
We don't talk much or nothin' 
But when we talkin' about something 
We have good discussion 
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something 
That's good for us 
We'll let you guys prophesy 
We'll let you guys prophesy 
We gon' see the future first 
We'll let you guys prophesy 
We gon' see the future first 
Living so the last night feels like a past life 
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people 
Devil be possessin homies 
Demons try to body jump 
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke 
Acid on me like the rain 
Weed crumbles into glitter 
Rain, glitter 
We laid out on this wet floor 
Away turf, no Astro 
Mesmerized how the strobes glow 
Look at all the people feet dance 
I know that your nigga came with you 
But he ain't with you 
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains 
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans 
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose 
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades 
Feelin' 
I may be younger but I'll look after you 
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you 
When you're not here I'll save some for you 
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you 
I'll mean something to you 
I'll mean something to you 
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do 
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too</field>

Triple weight 
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl 
And I just wanna know

Boss ain't working you like this

Lost on a train, lost 
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace 
Hand me my triple weight 
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl 
Too weird to live, too rare to die 
No I don't really wish 
I don't wish the titties would show 
Nor have I ever 
Have I ever let you get caught?

Lost on a train, lost 
She's at a stove 
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope 
I promise she'll be 
Whipping meals up for a family of her own some day 
Nothing wrong 
(Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong) 
No nothing wrong with a lie 
Nothing wrong with another short plane ride

Pool side convo about your summer last night 
Oh yeah 
About your summer last night 
Ain't give you no play, mm 
Could I make it shine last night 
Could I make it shine, on it last night 
Last night 
Could we make it in? do we have time? 
[verse 1] 
I'll be the boyfriend 
In your wet dreams tonight 
Noses on a rare 
Little virgin wears the white 
You cut your hair 
But you used to live a blinded life 
Wish I was there 
Wish we had grown up on the same advice 
And our time was right 
[chorus] 
Keep a place for me, for me 
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing 
It's nothing, it's nothing 
Keep a place for me, for me 
[verse 2] 
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry 
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes 
I came to visit cause you see me like a ufo 
That's like never cause 
I made you use your self control 
And you made me lose my self control 
My self control

Keep a place for me, for me 
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing

Watch the clouds float, white ferrari 
Had a good time 
16: How was I supposed to know anything? 
I let you out at central 
I didn't care to state the plain 
Kept my mouth closed 
We're both so familiar 
White ferrari 
Close by me 
You will find 
You will find me 
Is this the slow body 
Left when I forgot to speak 
So I text to speech, lesser speeds 
Texas speed, yes 
Based takes it's toll on me 
Eventually, eventually, yes 
I only eventually, eventually, yes 
I care for you still and I will forever 
That was my part of the deal, honest 
We got so familiar 
Spending each day of the year, white ferrari 
Good times 
In this life, life 
In this life, life 
One too many years 
So taste what I lived on a facelift 
Mind over matter is magic 
I do magic 
If you think about it it's over 
In no time the best life 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension 
You say we're smaller 
And not worth the mention 
You're tired of movin', your body's achin' 
We could vacay, there's places to go 
Clearly this isn't all that there is 
Can't take what's been given 
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine 
I'm up and naked 
You dream of walls that hold us in prison 
It's just a scar 
At least that's what they call it 
And we're free to fall</field>

It's when I realized you talk too much

Many college students have gone to college 
And gotten hooked on drugs 
Marijuana, and alcohol 
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else 
Don't try to be someone else 
Be yourself and know that that's good enough 
Don't try to be someone else 
Don't try to be like someone else 
Don't try to act like someone else 
Be yourself 
Be secure with yourself 
Rely and trust upon your own decisions 
On your own beliefs 
You understand the things 
That I've taught you 
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs 
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana 
Because that stuff is highly addictive 
When people become weed-heads 
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid 
And unconcerned 
sluggish, lazy, stupid 
And unconcerned 
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? 
This is mom 
Unless you're taking it under doctor's 
Umm- control

Do not smoke marijuana 
Do not consume alcohol 
Do not get in the car with someone

Police think I'm of the underworld

How you looking up to me and talking down? 
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)

Put a zoom on that stick, Noé

Rolling when you ride, poppin' 
Rolling when you ride 
Ride the Rodman 
Got one that's straight acting 
Turn out like some dirty plastic (Ride) 
2016 burnt some discs 
2017 ideas playing off a Walkman 
This a cult not a clique on the net 
With a cup in a cup, Actavis 
That's a double edge, "issa knife"

Sleet snow grind for the wealth

You need a co-sign for your health 
I need that bitch to grind on my belt

No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale

Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills 
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools 
The water's blue, swallow the pill 
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like 
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high 
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free 
My TV ain't HD, that's too real 
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life 
The sweet life, sweet life 
Sweet life, sweet life 
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life 
Sweet life, the sweet life 
Sweetie pie 
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born 
The starshine always kept you warm 
So why see the world, when you got the beach 
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach 
The sweet life 
The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down 
Satelite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off 
Transmitting the waves 
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave 
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like 
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high 
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free, my tv ain't HD, that's too real 
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life 
A sweet life 
A sweet life, yeah 
A sweet life, a sweet life 
A sweet life 
Live and die in the life 
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born 
The starshine always kept you warm 
So why see the world, when you got the beach 
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach 
The sweet life 
Why see the world, when you got the beach? 
And the water, is exactly what I wanted 
It's everything I thought it would be 
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day 
This neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy 
The sunshine always kept you warm 
So why see the world, when you got the beach 
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach 
The sweet life</field>

This is joy, this is summer 
Keep alive, stay alive 
Got your medal on, we're alone 
Making sweet love, takin' time 
"look guys, jacksons! " 
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by 
That's a pretty long third gear in this car 
Glidin' on the five 
The deer run across, kill the headlights 
Pretty fucking 
Underneath moon light now 
Pretty fucking 
Sunrising, sand, comes a morning 
Haunting us with the beams 
So it ain't as far as it used to be 
It begins to blur, we get older (blur!) 
Summer's not as long as it used to be 
Everyday counts like crazy (smoke, hazy) 
Wanna get soaked? 
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat? 
We smell of californication 
Strike a pose 
Everything grows in the congo 
Everything grows 
Can you call when I call again 
[verse 2: frank ocean (kendrick lamar) ] 
On comes the evening 
Both seeking ends 
Peace in my hands worth twice than a friend 
And two limbs over shoulder, carry the way 
Because I'm stronger, congo is damned (smoke) 
In comes the morning (smoke) 
In comes the morning (haze)</field>

If I was being honest 
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day 
And not skip a meal I'm good 
I used to work on my feet 
For 7 dollars a hour 
Call my momma like momma 
I ain't making minimum wage momma 
I'm on momma 
I'm on 
Now I'm making 400, 600, 800k momma 
To stand on my feet momma 
Play these songs, it's therapy momma 
They paying me momma 
I should be paying them 
I should be paying y'all honest to god 
I'm just a guy I'm not a god 
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god 
But I'm not a god 
If I was I don't know 
Which heaven would have me momma 
Let me run this bitch 
I'ma run it into the ground momma 
The whole galaxy 
God damn, fuck these lames 
They don't want none 
Fuck these lames, they don't want none 
Fuck these niggas 
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none 
Fuck these niggas 
Fuck you niggas 
Fuck me if I hated on you

I'ma stick around 
I'm gon' let my nuts hang 
Nigga you got some just like me don't you? 
Or maybe not just like me 
You know I'm africano americano 
And even if you're half japanese 
Roots run deep 
Family tree, throw a big shadow, tech company 
Please gimme immortality 
I'm going rapidly 
Fading drastically 
Or pulled the zip down 
Wet your lips first 
Lick the tip now 
Smoke some'n 
Jamming to the rhythm it's a face to face 
Keep me high castrati 
Poonani fade the stress 
Bugatti left some stretch marks 
On that freeway 
They tryna find 2pac 
Don't let 'em find 2pac 
He evade the press 
He escape the stress 
La da da da da 
La da da da da

I'll keep quiet 
And let you run your phone bill up 
I know you love to talk 
I ain't on your schedule 
I ain't on no schedule 
I ain't had me a job since 2009 
I ain't on no sales floor 
You say I'm changing on you 
I feel like selena 
They wanna murder a nigga 
Murder me like selena 
You must ain't get the memo 
I don't cut bitches no more 
But your bitch my exception 
Come get her outta my four door 
I only got one four door 
Remember when I had that lexus no 
Our friendship don't go back that far 
Tyler slept on my sofa yeah 
Niggas go back that far 
I ain't smoked all year 
This the last song so 
I'm finna wipe that off 
Tolerance is so low 
Still smoke a whole 'gar 
Menage on my birthday 
Tap out on the first stroke 
Cause this ain't no work day 
She don't give head anyway 
'cause what niggas say 
That's what she tell her man 
What a difference distance makes 
Niggas want fight in the streets now 
Shit starting to make my head hurt 
Jay hit me on the email 
Said I oughta act my net worth 
Dog this is chess now 
Not fetch I ain't runnin for a nigga 
Ain't ran since track meet 
That's the only time I ran from a nigga 
You could change this track now 
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago 
Know and know

When I feel what I feel 
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so 
You may not be in the mood to learn 
What you think you know 
There are times when I find 
You wanna keep yourself from me 
When I don't have the strength 
I'm just a mirror of what I see 
[chorus] 
But at your best you are love 
You're a positive motivating 
Force within my life 
If you ever feel the need to wonder why 
Let me know, let me know 
(luhh) let me know 
[verse 2] 
When you feel what you feel 
It's hard for me to understand 
So many things have taken 
Place before this love affair began 
But if you feel more like I feel 
Confusion can give way to doubt 
For there are times 
When I fall short of what I say 
What I say I'm all about 
[chorus] 
But at your best you are love 
You're a positive motivating 
Force within my life 
If you ever feel the need to wonder why 
Let me know, let me know 
(luhh) let me know 
[bridge] 
(wait, waiting) 
Let me know 
You niggas goin' in 
Tell me what it is 
(fuck it) 
What it is, no need to make believe 
Look beyond your world 
Try to find, find a place for me 
[chorus] 
Cause when you're at your best 
You are love, you're a positive 
Motivating force within my life 
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why 
Let me know, let me know 
Let me know, know 
[outro] 
Stay at your best baby 
Let me know, let me know 
Gonna be somebody 
Oh I follow 
Oh and it's so cloudy 
I see the light 
Dance tonight 
A life I never knew 
Tell me what you need from me? 
Gas money? 
And I did what I needed to 
To become 
Hope the water's deep enough 
We've been here before 
First time is not the best time 
I ain't felt this way in years 
First I was rushing forward 
This time I'm waiting for the rush 
Infatuation's a rush 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Keep pushing on 
Never let it stop 
Oh I miss a beat 
Bind all of us to him 
I love the way you make me feel 
Me, you and, you and me 
I wake up in a week 
Wake me up in a week 
I won't sit still 
I won't sit still 
I'm getting used to it 
Yeah you're going to get used to it 
I love the way you make me feel</field>

Oh I know where love goes 
know where love goes, yeah 
If we colored our white walls pitch black 
Turn all the lights off and lay back 
We can make love with our bare hands 
We can make light out of thin air 
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well 
Dreams feel realer than right now 
But whatever you do don't let go 
My only nightmare is waking up alone 
Alone when your not mine 
And the room painted off white 
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you 
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life 
That's why I never sleep with my back to you 
When I lay it down, facing you 
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you) 
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you 
I don't think I'd notice though 
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you 
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you 
Laying under the covers that I stole 
From your side of the bed cause I got cold 
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery 
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed 
Stole your heart, and your pillows 
Whatever you do just don't go 
Baby, the worst jail is waking up 
Alone in the world when your not mine 
In a room painted off white 
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you 
When I'm looking in your eyes, I see my real life 
So I never sleep with my back to you 
When I lay it down, facing you 
I can feel my eyelids close (I never sleep with my back to you) 
And if the sun rises (back to you) behind you 
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you) 
Like a nightlight, like a teddy bear 
Like toddlers playing 
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children 
Oh oh oh, yeah yeah 
When I lay it down, facing you 
I can feel my eyelids close (I never sleep with my back to you) 
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you 
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you) 
When I lay it down, facing you 
I can feel my eyelids close (I never sleep with my back to you) 
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you 
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you)</field>

You're my shrink for the hour 
Leave the meter running 
It's rush hour 
So take the streets if you wanna 
Just outrun the demons, could you? 
He said "allahu akbar", I told him don't curse me 
"But boy you need prayer", I guess it couldn't hurt me 
If it brings me to my knees 
It's a bad religion 
This unrequited love 
To me it's nothing but 
A one-man cult 
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup 
I could never make him love me 
Never make him love me 
Love 
Love 
Taxi driver 
I swear I've got three lives 
Balanced on my head like steak knives 
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise 
I can't trust no one 
And you say "allahu akbar", I told him don't curse me 
"But boy you need prayer", I guess it couldn't hurt me 
If it brings me to my knees 
It's a bad religion 
It's a bad religion 
To be in love with someone 
Who could never love you 
I know 
Only bad religion 
Could have me feeling the way I do</field>

Many college students have gone to college 
And gotten hooked on drugs 
Marijuana, and alcohol 
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else 
Don't try to be someone else 
Be yourself and know that that's good enough 
Don't try to be someone else 
Don't try to be like someone else 
Don't try to act like someone else 
Be yourself 
Be secure with yourself 
Rely and trust upon your own decisions 
On your own beliefs 
You understand the things 
That I've taught you 
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs 
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana 
Because that stuff is highly addictive 
When people become weed-heads 
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid 
And unconcerned 
sluggish, lazy, stupid 
And unconcerned 
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? 
This is mom 
Unless you're taking it under doctor's 
Umm- control 
then it's regulated 
Do not smoke marijuana 
Do not consume alcohol 
Do not get in the car with someone 
Who is inebriated 
This is mom, call me, bye</field>

But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again

But he ain't swim with that blue whale 
I ain't swim with that ho neither 
Earl said that world real 
Sit back and watch the water 
Hope the monster dont wag his tale 
And send that big wave over while 
Im showin off my pirate girl 
To the baddies walkin by me 
Showin skin because its nothing 
My little brother servin? molly 
Because that bill due monday 
And my passports buried 
And my home town flooded 
With just a little bit of water 
But my shoes still muddy 
And if I ever have a daughter 
I wonder what I could call her? 
Nine months after I fuck on the beach 
I guess I call her karma 
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat 
Im kim but im ballin 
Just playin? but im serious 
Im witted and I?m wildin 
This life goes on man thats one thing about it 
This life goes on dawg thats one thing about it 
I?m feelin? what your sayin?, you?re trying to get around it 
But life goes on pimpin, the wise dont doubt it 
Stuck in the sky, first time upside down, on the whole ride 
And I wasn?t much into the type, that my bros like 
So I never really had no wife and that's alright 
Black women ain't go no man 
That's what she said to me, yah she did 
That you can date outside your race, I mean 
I ain't supposed to show my love 
Judge gotta like my case I mean 
Somebody please switch my plates 
Ship my car to rome 
5k on the wheels, still ain?t ridin chrome 
Back pack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal 
So let a relevant nigga do, what a relevant nigga feel 
Let a regular nigga judge 
Because his gavel fake and he regular still 
How that gravel taste? how you paid your medical bills? 
Sands white on my tan feet 
Coliseum in the back seat 
Straw hut where the beach be 
Like screen saver when your mac sleep 
Relaxing 
I ain?t racing no fuckin? rats 
Im relaxing 
And if its wrong to yah 
Well life goes on brother, that's one thing about it 
Life goes on my nigga one thing about it

And no one was around to hear it 
Baby, does it go boom? 
Does it go boom? 
If I have love for ya 
But you were never close enough to feel it 
Is my love any good? 
Is my love any good? 
Oh... 
But the distance ain't even a room away 
You're laying in the bed right next to me 
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us 
Some soundproof glass 
And some bars in the middle 
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you 
I'm conversing with bricks and steel 
A pile of bricks and steel 
And when I tap your shoulders 
You're cold as bricks and steel 
A pile of bricks and steel 
And how do I stay in love with you 
Ravish all the the leftovers and garbage 
Was it ever real 
If you were never here? 
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen 
Like a pile of bricks and steel... 
Bricks, bricks 
Steel, steel... 
I know you're somewhere in there... 
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer 
And start chiseling away, away... 
Chiseling away, away... 
Girl my phone bill is crazy 
The rate is sky high when I call ya 
But you only let it ring 
You only let it ring, no ohh... 
But the distance ain't even a room away 
You're laying in the bed right next to me 
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us 
Some soundproof glass 
And some bars in the middle 
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you

Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen 
Like a pile of bricks and steel 
Bricks, bricks 
Steel, steel... 
Stomp, stomp 
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall 
He don't hear a word I say at all 
I'm wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk... 
Oh, stomp, stomp 
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall and 
He don't hear a word I said ohh, ohhh ohhh... 
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you

Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus 
Daddy told you that I was dangerous 
But I couldn't stop hustling, Even if he asked me 
Fast forward now were grown-ups 
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush 
Our future could've been different 
But lets just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me 
But you knew me well, You knew I had a love on a different scale 
Heavy as the heavens, You could tell 
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still 
It takes a strong young man to survive out here 
Carrying the pieces of two hearts 
All the broken pieces of two hearts 
Use to have a backpack full of that work 
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt 
And the broken pieces of two hearts 
All the broken pieces of two hearts 
It's getting heavier...</field>

There's a couple things we need to talk about 
Will you get mad at me? Do you really mean what you say 
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't go your way 
Can we talk about it without the shouting 
I know we got issues, don't wanna loose you 
Can't let this thing fall apart 
Know it damn well that I got your heart 
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again 
Everybody has their arguments 
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it? 
But that don't mean we can't get over it 
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time 
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard 
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart 
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down 
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time 
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me 
For forgetting every little anniversary 
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat 
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this 
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect 
Girl no way to explain it, but I know we can make it 
I know we got issues, I don't wanna loose you 
Can't let this thing fall apart 
Know it damn well that I got your heart 
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again 
Everybody has their arguments 
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it? 
But that don't mean we can't get over it

But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart 
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down 
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time 
Girl, I love the things you do 
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you 
Like when you walk out the door, when your clothes hit the floor 
You were just about to break up, and now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah) 
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh whoa 
Girl just say yeah-ey-yeah 
Oh oh oh oh, let's make up yeah yeah ooh 
Everybody has their arguments 
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it? 
But that don't mean we can't get over it 
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time 
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard

My guy pretty like a girl 
And he got fight stories to tell 
I see both sides like Chanel 
See on both sides like Chanel 
Swimming laps through pool water 
Heated like I'm underworld 
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya 
Police think I'm of the underworld 
12 treat a nigga like he 12 
How you looking up to me and talking down? 
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man) 
God level I am the I am (whoa) 
Now film it with that drone cam 
In the pink like Killa Cam 
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé 
Up so close I'm on that kill 
Remote controller on your lower back 
Yes too good 
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull 
Rolling when you ride, poppin' 
Rolling when you ride 
Ride the Rodman 
Got one that's straight acting 
Turn out like some dirty plastic (Ride) 
2016 burnt some discs 
2017 ideas playing off a Walkman 
This a cult not a clique on the net 
With a cup in a cup, Actavis 
That's a double edge, "issa knife" 
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting 
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick 
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick 
Clips on clips like Mikey 
It's really all

See on both sides like Chanel

V both sides of the 12 
Steam both sides of the L 
Freeze smoke rings and they hail 
Sleet snow grind for the wealth 
Whole team diamonds is real 
Showed 'em how to shine by they selves 
You need a co-sign for your health 
I need that bitch to grind on my belt 
I know you need to try for my belt 
I know you seen it driving itself 
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale 
But it's stealth

I see both sides like Chanel

My pockets snug 
They can't hold my 7 
They banned my Visa 
My Amex and Mastercards 
I got new money 
And it's all cash 
I got new bags 
And they all collabs 
I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards 
Amazing the cash online unknown 
Blazing the dash counting money at home 
My pockets snug 
They can't hold my 7 
They banned my Visa

You don't know how little you matter 
Until you're all alone 
In the middle of Arkansas 
With a little rock left in that glass dick 
Used to date a blonde 
You used to hit it raw 
Cause she was and you are madly involved 
Madly involved

Hitting stones in glass homes 
You're smoking stones in abandoned homes 
You hit them stones and broke your home 
Crack rock crack rock 
Crack rock crack rock

You're shuckin and jiving 
Stealing and robbing 
To get the fixing that you're itching for 
Your family stopped inviting you to things 
Won't let you hold their infant 
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time 
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him) 
8 minutes ago it was all okay, yeah 
I wish the year was just missing one day 
I'm wishing I could forget it 
Cause it's still so hard to live with it 
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when 
I first met you 
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox 
under my bed 
And I swear, every conversation that I have 
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know 
Maybe if I board a plane, I could beat the sunrise 
Ready to grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks 
(those damn clocks) 
No, I don't wanna think about him 
I don't wanna dream about him 
I don't wanna talk about him 
I don't wanna call him 
This day doesn't even exist 
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day 
Wish it could have been tuesday, just not today 
Could have been wednesday, just not today, day 
I'm clicking my heels wishin' away the day 
Wishin' the day go away, day go away, today go away 
[verse 2] 
It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him) 
Walking down 42nd tryna clear my brain (no, oh) 
He packed his luggage and he left, 
but some of it still remains 
So for 24 hours I've been sitting here 
staring at his baggage in my space 
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when 
I first met you 
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox 
under my bed 
And I swear, every conversation that I have 
Someone brings up your name, just this one day 
I don't know 
Maybe if I board a plane, I could beat the sunrise 
Ready to grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks

No, I don't wanna think about him

Wish it could have been tuesday, just not today 
Could have been wednesday, just not today, day 
I'm clicking my heels wishin' away the day 
Wishin' the day go away, day go away, today go away 
[bridge] 
See I don't even wanna think about him 
Or dream about him 
Even just one day is one too long 
There ain't no sense in bringing it up 
or bringing memory round 
Cause ain't no getting back the love that's gone 
I won't be crying no more and how it unfolds 
The storm has passed and gone 
And I wish amnesia would stay 
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day

Dream dream dream 
Killer killer 
You said I'd never make it well I'm here 
You told me I should go and sleep off the dreams 
You promised I would stop having nightmares 
If I could do my best to just not believe 
Say I'm infatuated with my future 
Too in love with tomorrow 
And that tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved 
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home 
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies 
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies 
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me 
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me 
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me 
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer 
Villain with a dagger was chasing me 
I woke up and you were standing right there 
You kissed me and said that's just a bad one babe 
Then I asked you what's that in your hand 
You told me I'm infatuated with my future 
Too in love with tomorrow 
You say tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved 
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home 
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies 
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies 
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me 
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me 
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me 
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer 
I'm gon' sleep good as soon as you're gone 
But I can't dream good as long as long as 
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me 
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me 
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me 
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer 
Dream killer, dream killer killer 
Dream killer, dream killer killer 
Dream killer, dream killer killer

That October night 
The 29th, I almost lost my life 
Call myself being the hero 
Tryna guard your heart 
No matter how hard I fought 
It was over before it started 
I thought that we were.. 
On the same side of the battle, oh 
I'm on the front line of disaster now 
All make sense, I've put it together 
Guess what we have doesn't matter oh 
You have me dying 
Every night, just because 
You have me fighting 
Every night, to prove my love 
Cause we never get enough of fighting 
In the club, I'm dying for your love 
I don't know what you want 
You got me fighting 
Every night, to prove my love 
All I ever did was 
Just try to play my part. 
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of. 
But you let it go on 
And every time I see you with him 
I wanna crack his door 
Tell me that I'm wrong 
But I thought we were.. 
On the same side of the battle, oh 
I'm on the front line of disaster now 
All make sense, I've put it together 
Guess what we have doesn't matter oh 
You have me dying 
Every night, just because 
You have me fighting 
Every night, to prove my love 
Cause we never get enough of fighting 
In the club, I'm dying for your love 
I don't know what you want 
You got me fighting 
Every night, to prove my love 
You got me dying... 
fighting every night.. 
Dying... 
fighting every night. 
You have me dying 
Every night, just because 
You have me fighting 
Every night, to prove my love 
Cause we never get enough of fighting 
In the club, I'm dying for your love 
I don't know what you want 
You got me fighting 
Every night, to prove my love

They're telling boulder heavy lies 
Looks like all we've got is each other 
The truth is obsolete 
Remember when all I had was my mother 
She didn't compromise 
She could recognize 
Voodoo 
Our daughters and our sons 
Are just candles in the sun 
Voodoo 
Don't let him see divide 
Don't you let her see divide 
Voodoo 
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit 
He's got the whole wide world in his pants 
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band 
Then put the whole wide world on her hands 
She's got the whole wide world in her hands 
He's got the whole wide world in his hands 
There's somethin' about you 
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now 
You're special 
I wish you could see what I see 
She peels an orange for us in the morning 
She woke me up to give me half 
I can hear the children talk of ballin' 
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey 
You're a girl on this island 
I'm a boy from America 
My flight leaves tonight, but I don't think I'm going backwards 
I won't be going backwards 
[Hook] 
You're my golden girl 
You're the one I've chosen girl 
You're 24k 
You make it bright when it's grey 
You're my golden girl 
The sun has been kind to you 
You're 24k (Girl) 
But the sky's never grey (Never grey) 
Silent moments, meditative poses 
You break my focus, you make me laugh 
Two mopeds racing through the forest 
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path 
I'm my best on this island 
I'm a mess in America 
My flight left last night, but I know 
I'm not going back home, yeah 
I'm not going back home, no 
[Hook] 
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still? 
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven 
I'mma stay right here with you 
Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes, I've found my girl 
[Hook] 
[Tyler, The Creator] 
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L 
And that's for the females that can't spell, but 
Thanks for fucking with me 
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach 
You see, I want you to know that 
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak 
So that means that I don't want to go back 
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that 
Hand of yours, girl I'm a wreck in America 
Your face is the best 
cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck 
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it 
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton 
I free-fall off the hill again 
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan 
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring 
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green</field>

And I was together since 3 years 
And em, I was not even cheating on her or what 
And facebook arrived 
And she wanted me 
to accept her on facebook 
And I don't want it because 
I was like in front of her 
And she told me like "accept me on facebook" 
It was virtual, made no sense 
So I say "I'm in front of you 
I don't need to accept you on facebook" 
She started to be crazy 
She thoughts that because I didn't accept her 
She thought I was cheating 
She told me like, uh, it's over 
And I can't believe it 
It is crazy because I like her 
I'm in front of you, I'm every day 
Here in your house 
That's like jealousy 
Pure jealousy for nothing

I'm hitchhiking love 
Could you take me to the hills? 
I'm not heavy no, I promise 
I heard you could fly, could you try? 
We can drive for miles 'till no one can see but just you and me (ah) 
I'm spending too much time on the ground baby please show me how 
How you do it, and don't ever let me down 
Don't try to hide it 
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless 
Don't hide it 
It ain't a secret 
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly 
I know you go up, go up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly 
Oh I really ought to ask 
If I need a parachute or something 
Cause if you take me way up there 
I'll be scared to death of falling 
We can drive for miles 'till no one can see but just you and me (ah) 
I'm spending too much time on the ground baby please show me how 
How you do it, and don't ever let me down 
Don't try to hide it 
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless

I know you go up, go up 
I wanna go up, take me up

Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly 
Gravity's blowing up my phone don't wanna answer 
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah) 
Gravity's calling my phone I can't answer 
Ain't no service, way up here girl 
We're 25, 000 feet in the air baby 
If love was sky, damn right I'm falling 
Falling in love, but going up 
Don't try to hide it, cause I see your wings 
If that dress looks fabulous, don't hide it 
It ain't a secret 
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly 
I know you go up, you go up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly 
 
Show me how you do it, how you show me up

Everywhere I go its a media frenzy 
All they seem to care about is me Kim or Lindsey 
Is the story real? You don't even know 
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so

Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me

I can't lose focus, focus, focus 
I gotta get back to the money

To stand on my feet momma

What a difference distance makes 
Niggas want fight in the streets now

From a girl 
You should know 
She heard a noise 
Got a little scared 
Now you of all people should know 
She hates sleeping alone 
But stil you ain't home 
So since your no where to be found 
No trip bro imma hold her down 
I'm your girlfriends best friend 
Soon I'll be taking over 
I'm your girlfriends best friend 
You don't treat her like your supposed to 
With your wandering eyes 
All your cheating and lying 
Imma step up and do what I gotta 
As your girlfriends best friend 
Soon I'll be taking 
Soon-soon I'll be taking your spot 
Now I'm not hating 
On your situation 
But all I'm saying 
These chicks are crazy 
You've got a good girl 
Who's all about you 
It's gonna take you losing her 
For you to know what you really had 
On the spotlight 
But as soon as you drop the ball 
I'll be ready to pick up where you left off 
I'm your girlfriends best friend

Imma step up and do what I gotta

I'm hitchhiking love 
Could you take me to the hills 
I'm not heavy no, I promise 
I heard you could fly, could you try 
We can drive for miles till no one can see but just you and me (ah) 
I'm spending too much time on the ground baby please show me how 
How you do it, and don't ever let me down 
Don't try to hide it 
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless 
Don't hide it 
It ain't a secret 
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly 
I know you go up, go up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly 
Oh I really ought to ask 
If I need a parachute or something 
Cause if you take me way up there 
I'll be scared to death of falling 
We can drive for miles till no one can see but just you and me (ah) 
I'm spending too much time on the ground baby please show me how 
How you do it, and don't ever let me down 
Don't try to hide it 
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless 
Don't hide it 
It ain't a secret 
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly 
I know you go up, go up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly 
Gravity's blowing up my phone don't wanna answer 
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah) 
Gravity's calling my phone I can't answer 
Ain't no service, way up here girl 
We're 25, 000 feet in the air baby 
If love was sky, damn right I'm falling 
Falling in love, but going up 
Don't try to hide it, cause I see your wings 
If that dress looks fabulous, don't hide it 
It ain't a secret 
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly 
I know you go up, you go up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
I wanna go up, take me up 
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly 
Show me how you do it, how you show me up 
Show me how you do it, how you show me up 
Show me how you do it, how you show me up 
Show me what 
Show me what 
Show me what</field>

It sucks not having you here 
There ain’t a better way to say it 
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear 
Like a bottle of evian, you can see through me 
My ego ain’t here 
So many clever words and nice things that I could say 
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same 
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying 
And the best way to say it is to just say it 
I wanna run away from the words 
But I can’t run away from the world 
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying 
Girl, I love you, still 
I try to go some months without a call 
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all 
Maybe I could find something in the club 
Or something in the mall, mall, mall 
But them girls didn’t matter 
And this money ain’t distracting me much at all 
I know some clever words and nice things that I could say 
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same 
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying 
And the best way to say it is to just say it 
I wanna run away from the words 
But I can’t run away from the world 
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying 
Girl, I love you 
Girl I wanted to cry 
But I made it look easy (it ain’t easy) 
To hold it in and save face 
And it was harder to stay 
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy) 
To just get up and walk away 
Now I’m alone and the tears do fall 
Open my mouth and the words do fall 
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart 
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying 
And the best way to say it is to just say it 
I wanna run away from the words 
But I can’t run away from the world 
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying

Start a family tonight 
Big body murk, led lights

Tuberose and two lips 
On the boxes you ripped 
From the holes in your skin 
Hit the road and get rich 
Or stay home and get broke

When we both know that deep down 
The feeling still deep down is good 
 
If I could see through walls 
I could see you're faking 
If you could see my thoughts 
You would see our faces 
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then 
We didn't give a fuck back then 
I ain't a kid no more 
We'll never be those kids again 
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then 
Back then 
No matter what I did 
My waves wouldn't dip back then 
Everything sucked back then 
We were friends 
 
I thought that I was dreaming 
When you said you love me 
It started from nothing 
I had no chance to prepare 
I couldn't see you coming 
It started from nothing 
I could hate you now 
It's quite alright to hate me now 
When we both know that deep down 
The feeling still deep down is good 
 
In the halls of your hotel 
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell 
How much I meant to you 
Meant it sincere back then 
We had time to kill back then 
You ain't a kid no more 
We'll never be those kids again 
It's not the same, ivory's illegal 
Don't you remember? 
I broke your heart last week 
You'll probably feel better by the weekend 
Still remember, had you going crazy 
Scream my name

I thought that I was dreaming

I couldn't see you coming 
It started from nothing 
I could hate you now 
It's alright to hate me now 
When we both know that deep down 
The feeling still deep down is good 
 
All the things I didn't mean to say 
I didn't mean to do 
There were things you didn't need to say 
Didn't need to...need to

Dream all night 
I could drive all night 
Drive all night

Big full breasts on my baby 
(Yo we going to Florida) 
Triple weight 
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl 
And I just wanna know 
Why you ain't been going to work 
Boss ain't working you like this 
He can't take care of you like this 
Now you're lost 
Lost in the heat of it all 
Girl you know you're lost 
Lost in the thrill of it all 
Miami, Amsterdam 
Tokyo, Spain, lost 
Los Angeles, India 
Lost on a train, lost 
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace 
Hand me my triple weight 
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl 
Too weird to live, too rare to die 
No I don't really wish 
I don't wish the titties would show 
Nor have I ever 
Have I ever let you get caught? 
Now you're lost 
Lost in the heat of it all 
Girl you know you're lost 
Lost in the thrill of it all 
Miami, Amsterdam 
Tokyo, Spain, lost 
Los Angeles, India 
Lost on a train, lost 
She's at a stove 
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope 
I promise she'll be 
Whipping meals up for a family of her own some day 
Nothing wrong 
(Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong) 
No nothing wrong with a lie 
Nothing wrong with another short plane ride 
(Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong) 
Through the sky 
Up in the sky 
You and I 
Just you and I 
Now you're lost 
Lost in the heat of it all 
Girl you know you're lost 
Lost in the thrill of it all 
Miami, Amsterdam 
Tokyo, Spain, lost 
Los Angeles, India 
Lost on a train, lost 
Love lost? 
Love love 
Love lost? 
Love love 
Love lost 
Love love 
Love lost

Never look down 
Never let you see me down

From a memory alone 
I never forget a face 
Don't go plastic on me 
Nothing's set in stone 
You're not dipped in gold 
Dipped in gold 
You can't breathe if you're dipped in gold

After I'm done with them 
And I still got the same hope that I started with 
That you'll be in one of them 
My camera shed some tears since you left him 
With nothing, with nothing 
[Bridge:] 
How am I supposed to remember? 
I got the memories 
But memories fade, baby 
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl? 
When I'm older, and my mind is telling me to forget you 
What's gonna make me remember? 
[Chorus:] 
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures 
Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing 
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures 
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left 
They were part of our history, this story 
I was always taking pictures 
Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad 
Miss you so bad, miss you so 
We didn't make love 
We celebrated it's invention 
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images 
Tonight I came home they were just members in the fire 
Along with my heart dry, no, no, slow goodbye 
[Bridge:] 
How the hell am I supposed to remember? 
Tell me now, I got the memories 
But memories don't last... 
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby? 
When I'm older, and my mind's telling me to forget you 
What's gonna make me remember? 
[Chorus:] 
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures 
Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing 
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures 
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left 
They were part of our history, this story 
I was always taking pictures 
Cause I didn't wanna miss you 
The videos are rolling behind you 
The record of the love we had 
My Nikon wasn't fast enough 
To catch my heart break in half 
No smiles on my picture frame, no 
Just got them little basic ones that the pictures frames come with 
Models where them pictures, you know 
[Chorus:] 
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures 
Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing 
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures? 
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left

Mosh pits and bare chest 
Stage diving sky diver 
Spray the crowd with cold water 
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits 
I think I need a cold shower 
Cool waters 
African girl speaks in English accent 
Likes to fuck boys in bands 
Likes to watch Westerns 
And ride me without the hands 
Show me her passport 
She's on her own tour 
But you're beautiful to me 
Wave em high girl to the sky 
But you're beautiful to me 
Live in the clouds 
Wave em high girl to the sky 
But you're beautiful to me 
Life in the clouds 
Keep em high ya'll 
Beautiful stars 
In the sky

Monks in the mosh pit 
Stage diving Dalai Lama 
Feet covered in cut flowers 
They mosh for enlightenment 
Clean chakra, good karma 
One with the water 
Indian girl sleeps above the temple 
Planning a runaway, young at heart 
You found a boyfriend 
And now you wanna get away, get away 
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away 
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away 
Abhaya Mudra 
I never ask for much 
But please keep up lover 
We've got no choices left 
The running's fast 
Run run run run 
You're beautiful to me 
Run run run run you'd better run 
You mean so much to me 
[Verse 3] 
In my world 
We made it safely 
Even with your father's army trailing us 
We escaped him 
Even with his archer's bows at our backs 
What a great escape 
But theres a long way still in fact 
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds 
There's a monsoon that never ends 
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber 
To guide and protect us til the end 
We're in the clouds 
Wave em high now to the sky 
But you're beautiful to me 
Keep em high ya'll show you right 
But you're beautiful to me

Round the city 
Round the clock 
Everybody needs you 
No you can't make everybody equal 
Although you got beaucoup family 
You don't even got nobody 
Being honest with you 
Breath till I evaporated 
My whole body see through 
Transportation, handmade 
And I know it better than most people 
I don't trust them anyways 
You can't break the law with them 
Get some pussy have a calm night 
Shooters killing left and right 
Working through your worst night 
If I get my money right 
You know I won't need you 
And I tell you, (biitch) 
I hope the sack is full up 
I'm fuckin', no I'm fucked up 
Spend it when I get that 
I ain't trying to keep you 
Can't keep up a conversation 
Can't nobody reach you 
Why your eyes well up 
Did you call me from a seance 
You are from a past life 
Hope you're doing well bruh 
I been out here head first 
Always like the head first 
Signal coming in and out 
Hope you're doing well bruh 
Everybody needs you

Ain't no bitch in my body

Every night fucks every day up 
Every day patches the night up 
On god you should match it, it's that ko 
No white lights til I fuck my 28th up 
In 1998 my family had that acura, oh 
The legend, kept at least 
Six discs in the changer 
Back when boswell and percy had it active 
Couple bishops in the city building mansions 
All the reverends 
Preaching self made millionaire status 
When we could only eat at shoneys on occasion 
After trina hit I had to transfer campus 
Your apartment out in houston's 
Where I waited 
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address 
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress 
Working on a way to make it outta texas 
Every night

Drop the baby off at home 
Before my night shift 
You know I can't hear none 
Of that spend the night shit, kumbaya shit 
Want to see nirvana

Wanna feel that lovin' when you come by 
Fuck with me after my shift 
Know them boys wanna see me broke down 
Wanna see me bummed out

Punk madre, punk papa 
He don't care for me

We don't talk much or nothin'

Speaking of the, don't know what got into people 
Devil be possessin homies 
Demons try to body jump 
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke 
Acid on me like the rain 
Weed crumbles into glitter 
Rain, glitter 
We laid out on this wet floor 
Away turf, no Astro 
Mesmerized how the strobes glow 
Look at all the people feet dance 
I know that your nigga came with you 
But he ain't with you 
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains 
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans 
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose 
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades 
Feelin' 
I may be younger but I'll look after you 
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you 
When you're not here I'll save some for you 
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you

She said she wanna be dentist really badly 
She's in school paying 
For tuition doing porn in the valley 
At least you working 
But girl I can't feel my face 
What are we smoking anyway 
She said don't let the high go to waste 
But can you taste a little taste of 
Novocaine

Fuck me long

Pacing in the kitchen 
Cocaine for breakfast 
Yikes 
Bed full of women 
Flip on a tripod 
Little red light on shooting

Stanley Kubrick 
This is some visionary shit 
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut

You put me on a feeling I never had 
Never had never had 
And ever since 
I've been tryna get it back pick it up and put it back 
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus

Quite like what I found in you

Cause they don't make em like mamma no more 
Hug her and tell her that you love her 
That's good time spent 
And when you're outside running 
It's ok to ask where you're going 
So that you're never back where you started 
Wondering where time went 
And it's no pressure, man 
Cause you're special 
I know you wanna get big and strong quick 
But don't skip one second (orion) 
If I could buy back the years 
O-o-orion 
I would empty my pockets here (on everything) 
O-orion 
Make my regrets disappear 
O-o-orion 
Boy I'm jealous of you wilin' there 
But promise big bro one thing 
That you won't go wasting time

We once had things in common 
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator 
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (ice cold!) 
You out here flyin' high (high!) 
Go head, fly that thing! 
High! High! 
But fly alone 
[Verse 1] 
You always smokin' in the house 
What if my mother comes over? 
You can't get up and get a job 
Cause this little hustle's getting you by 
You're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known 
[Hook] 
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones 
She took me high, then she took me home 
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones 
[Verse 2] 
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again 
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober 
See there you go reachin' up your blouse and no I don't want a child 
But I ain't been touched in a while by the dealer 
And the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known 
[Hook] 
[Verse 3] 
In the sky up above, the birds 
I saw the sky like I never seen before 
You thought I was above you 
Above this in so many ways 
Buf if I got a condo on a cloud 
Then I guess you can stay at my place 
I'mma get one 
I need ya 
I admit it 
You're my Pilot Jones</field>

[verse 1: frank ocean] 
That's the way everyday goes 
Every time we have no control 
If the sky is pink and white 
If the ground is black and yellow 
It's the same way you showed me 
Nod my head, don't close my eyes 
Half way on a slow move 
It's the same way you showed me 
If you could fly then you'd feel south 
Up north's getting cold soon 
The way it is, we're on land 
So I'm someone to hold true 
Keep you cool in this good life 
Won't let you down when it's all ruined 
[hook: frank ocean] 
Just the same way you showed me, showed me 
You showed me love 
Glory from above 
Good glory, dear 
It's all downhill from here 
[verse 2: frank ocean] 
In the wake of a hurricane 
Dark skin of a summer shade 
Nose dive in the flood lines 
Tall tower, milk crate 
It's the same way you showed me 
Cannon ball off the porch side 
Older kids trying off the roof 
Just the same way you showed me (you showed) 
If you could die and come back to life 
Up for air from the swimming pool 
You kneel down to the dry land 
Kiss the earth that birthed you 
Gave you tools just to stay alive 
And make it up when the sun is ruined 
[hook: frank ocean] 
That's the same way you showed me, showed me 
You showed me love 
Glory from above 
Where god could fear 
It's all downhill from here 
[outro: frank ocean beyoncé] 
Real life, lamar woods, don king 
Michael jackson all this year 
(we've come) say what up to magic, just shoot 
Say what up to daddy 
Say what up to life, I found it 
And I know what you might want to know 
Run from me and your team 
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy) 
Give me somethin sweet 
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin

And the peaches and the mangos

Is it just a container for the mind

Is she just a container for the child 
That soft pink matter

Close my eyes and fall into you 
My god she's giving me pleasure 
What if the sky and the stars are for show 
And the aliens are watching live 
From the purple matter

And we sparred until we both grew tired

Hopped into my car; drove far

Does it matter if she wanna be with ? or cool? 
I make her call me BB King cause I give her the blues 
not on purpose though, she was the perfect hoe

most beautifullest things on a bed of roses 
what the coldest? then we hit the hard wood floor 
we sippin yac' not mimosas 
she sittin my nigga lap going HAM like she supposed to 
and she can make it clap if I told her 
or make her ass spread like a back of a cobras 
tell her add tities like a soldier, G.I.Joe man see me I go in 
(yeah that nigga goes up in there) 
like smoke through a chimney 
slow stroke cause she feelin me up in her nigga 
killin me softly rolled off she wants me 
strong and black like a coffee, get off me 
act a donkey, I pin her tail to the mattress 
I been a player make her go from classic to nasty

There's a thief out on the move 
Underneath our legion's view 
They have taken Cleopatra 
Run run run, come back for my glory 
Bring her back to me 
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh 
The throne of our queen is empty 
We'll run to the future 
Shining like diamonds in a rocky world 
A rocky, rocky world 
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere 
As we march to rhythm 
On the palace floor 
Chandeliers inside the pyramid 
Tremble from the force 
Cymbals crash inside the pyramid 
Voices fill up the halls 
Set the cheetahs on the loose 
There's a thief out on the move 
Underneath our legion's view 
They have taken Cleopatra 
The jewel of Africa 
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious? 
How could you run off on me? 
How could you run off on us? 
You feel like God inside that gold 
I found you laying down with Samson 
And his full head of hair 
Found my black queen Cleopatra 
Bad dreams, Cleopatra 
Remove her 
Send the cheetahs to the tomb 
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom 
No more she lives no more serpent in her room 
No more it has killed Cleopatra 
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds 
Wake up to your girl for now, let's call her Cleopatra 
I watch you fix your hair 
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra 
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra 
Then your six-inch heels 
Catch her 
She's headed to the pyramid

Bubbles in my champagne 
Let it be some jazz playing 
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars 
Floor model TV with the VCR 
Got rubies in my damn chain 
Whip ain't got no gas tank 
But it still got woodgrain 
Got your girl working for me 
Hit the strip and my bills paid 
That keep my bills paid

Touch you in places only I know

And now that hearts my own 
And since we're sewed together 
I feel like I got both 
[Bridge:] 
Oh, and I bet they're worth millions 
Oh, beautiful works of love 
Oh, I'm a go to all the fancy places 
All the fancy people and 
They can't tell me nothing, nothing 
[Chorus:] 
Cause they all want what I got 
And I ain't got nothing but you 
Nothing but you, nothing but you 
They can't buy what I got 
Cause I ain't got nothing but you 
Nothing but you, nothing but you 
I'm the richest man in the room 
I'm the richest man in the room 
I'm the richest man in the room 
Time itself wants what I got 
So I don't care about what you've got 
All I know is my girl is special 
You make me better, baby 
You make me happy, baby 
Nobody needs to remind me exactly why I'm 
The richest man in the room 
[Chorus:] 
Cause they all want what I got 
And I ain't got nothing but you 
Nothing but you, nothing but you 
They can't buy what I got 
Cause I ain't got nothing but you 
Nothing but you, nothing but you 
Cause they all want what I got 
And I ain't got nothing but you 
Nothing but you, nothing but you 
They can't buy what I got 
Cause I ain't got nothing but you 
Nothing but you, nothing but you

On the track to stars and back 
Only after we get to the end

How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl 
But you look good in your spacesuit

Oh, up here, up here

The candle's burning in the sun 
We don't need them but you like them 
They glow they glow, oh yeah 
We were at the bar for quite a while 
Took some time but we collided 
Big bang, big bang, look at what we made beautiful

Our entrances into life outside 
We've been in this room too long 
Recreation is keeping 
Us self contained and aware 
Of each other's form 
Still and in full strides just the same 
Keeping us warm 
Walking in straight lines 
Talking in sleep at night 
Coddled and pacified 
Virgins of mother 
Son who leave 
The son who leave 
Having you around 
Son who leave 
The son who leave 
Having you around is 
What if we decide to live by choice 
All this time I knew 
That average was something to fall back on 
After genius ends 
I watch video only difference 
Is it's flat and [?] 
Behind wet faces 
Slip my pants back on 
And rewind it back one more 
The tape stopped before I was back alone 
I'll be back before 
The streets lights on 
Before the daylight's gone 
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts 
They don't compare, no not at all 
And had this been the best I might not know 
What to do with us 
Or we're too sure 
We're to give my words can't hold 
The backs of god 
We're so sorry 
Least we did us perfect

Pool side convo about your summer last night 
Oh yeah 
About your summer last night 
Ain't give you no play, mm 
Could I make it shine last night 
Could I make it shine, on it last night 
Last night 
Could we make it in? do we have time? 
[verse 1] 
I'll be the boyfriend 
In your wet dreams tonight 
Noses on a rare 
Little virgin wears the white 
You cut your hair 
But you used to live a blinded life 
Wish I was there 
Wish we had grown up on the same advice 
And our time was right 
[chorus] 
Keep a place for me, for me 
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing 
It's nothing, it's nothing 
Keep a place for me, for me 
[verse 2] 
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry 
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes 
I came to visit cause you see me like a ufo 
That's like never cause 
I made you use your self control 
And you made me lose my self control 
My self control

Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets) 
On my waist, there’s a black Glock (black Glock) 
New girl moved on the block (on the block) 
She been plottin’ on my brown cock (brown cock) 
Last night I slept over hers (over hers) 
During sex, I overheard (I overheard) 
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na 
Rolled off the bed then shot back, pa-pa 
Blood on the sheets probably spillin’ from my gash 
Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin’ on the grass 
A real ninja with the blade and the mask 
Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks 
Now she tryna patch me up, but 
Girl, I was just tryna get a nutbust 
If that’s your ex, you should probably own a pistol 
But I’m guessin’ it’s wiser to exit with dude 
[Hook: Frank Ocean] 
The blinds wide open so he can 
See you in the dark when you’re sleepin’ 
Think about it, fresh out the shower 
You touch yourself after hours 
Ain’t no man allowed in your bedroom 
You’re sleeping alone in your bed 
But check your window, he’s at your window 
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator] 
The night light hits off, turnin’ kisses to bites 
I’m a down to earth nigga with intentions that’s right 
You’ll be down in earth quicker if you diss me tonight 
But I’ll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight 
We can chill and I can act like I don’t wanna fuck 
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one 
But I give two for us cause you’re the one that I want 
Don’t wanna seem like a punk pussy that sips on the punk pussy 
See when I’m with my friends I just put on a front 
But in the back of my top I’m writing songs about we 
We as including I and yourself, making three 
Little ones (?) pretty hard if you ask me 
You’re a pretty broad in the top three 
Of things that I’ve been waiting to come, so 
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin’ and then 
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure in Time 
[Hook] 
[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator] 
One, two, you’re the girl that I want 
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit 
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this 
And I just couldn’t take it, you’re so motherfuckin’ gorgeous 
Gorgeous, baby you’re gorgeous 
I just wanna drag you’re lifeless body to the forest 
And fornicate with it but that’s because I’m in love with 
You… cunt 
[Bridge 2: Tyler, The Creator] 
I just wanna talk, and conversate 
Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate 
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date 
So just say yes, let the future fall into place 
I just wanna talk, and conversate 
Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate 
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date 
So just say yes, let the future fall into place… cunt

This is joy, this is summer 
Keep alive, stay alive 
Got your medal on, we're alone 
Making sweet love, takin' time 
"look guys, jacksons! " 
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by 
That's a pretty long third gear in this car 
Glidin' on the five 
The deer run across, kill the headlights 
Pretty fucking 
Underneath moon light now 
Pretty fucking 
Sunrising, sand, comes a morning 
Haunting us with the beams 
So it ain't as far as it used to be 
It begins to blur, we get older (blur!) 
Summer's not as long as it used to be 
Everyday counts like crazy (smoke, hazy) 
Wanna get soaked? 
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat? 
We smell of californication 
Strike a pose 
Everything grows in the congo 
Everything grows 
Can you call when I call again 
[verse 2: frank ocean (kendrick lamar) ] 
On comes the evening 
Both seeking ends 
Peace in my hands worth twice than a friend 
And two limbs over shoulder, carry the way 
Because I'm stronger, congo is damned (smoke) 
In comes the morning (smoke) 
In comes the morning (haze)</field>

Do you slide on all your nights like this? 
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)

Put some spotlight on the side

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean] 
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark 
This my favorite part, we see the lights, they cut so far 
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arm 
Wrist on the wrist, a link of charms, yeah 
Player, we're still in Lincoln Park 
It's like we could dye our own hair 
Like we could dye it all blonde, hon' 
If we could see in 20-20 
Twice we could see it 'til the end 
[Verse 2: Quavo] 
Put that spotlight on her face (spotlight) 
Put that spotlight on her face (ah, yeah) 
We gon' pipe up and turn up (pipe up) 
We gon' light up and burn up (burn up) 
Mama too hot like a (like what?) 
Mama too hot like a furnace (furnace) 
I got a hundred G's in my Goyard (G's) 
My diamonds gon' shine when the lights dark (shine) 
You and I'll take a ride down the boulevard (yeah) 
And your friends really wanna break us apart 
Good lord 
[Verse 3: Offset] 
(Offset!) Good gracious 
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out the spaceship 
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia 
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy 
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato 
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand paintings, Picasso 
Bitch'll be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho 
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo 
She havin' it 
When they call her workin' on The Bachelor 
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us 
Average, I'ma make a million on the average 
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch I'm out of it

Sometimes it rain 
You still behind like asses 
You ain't got no words for [?]

And when you slide on me, you slide on me 
You slide off [?] side, yeah-yeah 
Cause a freak slide on me 
First time's on me 
Next time gon' be oh, yeah-yeah 
[verse 1] 
For your mentality 
You play ball, you run 5 on 5 at least 3 times a week 
Live parked down the street 
Waitin' on you to tie every time with victor key 
Play so savagely 
Always fighting with them you grew up with 
When you lose you don't cry but you lowkey sad to see 
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself 
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling 
I'm still working while your dream pop 
I can never let a scene stop stylin' on me 
I don't think they get the point pop 
They forgettin' that it's me 
Akhi tell 'em I ain't goin', wallahi 
I'm just all day running numbers 
How the fuck you think I live? 
Too many hands waitin' for my downfall 
They're like somethings gotta give 
Boys in the hood'll give me updates 
Like they know the weather 
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky in my hair 
I can see the sky

And when you slide on me, you slide on me 
You slide on both sides, yeah-yeah 
And when you slide on me, you slide on me 
Both sides on me, oh, yeah-yeah

This is for when you change your mind 
And slide back this way 
You'll be being yourself 
I can never let a see stop stylin' on me 
This is for the night set backs won't let that much fade 
Guess you can't blame no one you choose blah-blah 
Blah, blah, blah, blah

Hand me a towel I'm dirty dancing by myself 
Gone off tabs of that acid 
Form me a circle, watch my jagger 
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo 
One time 
We too loud in public 
Then police turned down the function 
Now we outside and the timing's perfect 
Forgot to tell you 
Gotta tell you how much I vibe with you 
And we don't gotta be solo 
Now stay away from highways 
My eyes like them red lights 
Right now I prefer yellow 
Red-bone, so mellow 
Fuck 'round, be cutting you 
Think we were better off solo 
I got that act right 
In the windy city that night 
No trees to blow through 
But blow me and I owe you 
Two grams when the sunrise 
Smoking good, rolling solo 
[chorus] 
Solo, solo 
Solo, solo 
S-solo, solo 
S-solo, solo 
It's hell on earth and the city's on fire 
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven 
There's a bull 
And a matador dueling in the sky 
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Solo, solo 
Solo, solo 
[verse 2] 
I'm skipping showers and switching socks 
Sleeping good and long 
Bones feeling dense as fuck 
Wish a nigga would cross 
And catch a solo, on time 
White leaf on my boxers 
Green leaf turn to vapors for the low 
And that mean cheap 
Cause ain't shit free and I know it 
Even love ain't, cause it's enough cost 
That clinic kill my soul 
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though 
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious 
All she want is her pickett fence 
And you protest and you picket sign 
But them courts won't side with you 
Won't let you fly solo 
I wanted that act right in colorado 
That night 
I brought trees to blow through 
But it's just me and no you 
Stayed up 'til my phone died 
Smoking big, rolling solo

It's hell on earth and the city's on fire 
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven

Aye, aye, so now I'm 
[verse: andre 3000] 
So-lo that I can see under the skirt of an ant 
So-lo that I don't get high no more 
When I "geronimo! " I just go hit 
So-lo my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend 
So-lo that I can admit 
When I hear that another kid 
Is shot by the popo it ain't an event 
No more 
So-lo that no more high horses 
So hard to wear polo 
When I do I cut the pony off 
Now there's a hole that once was a logo 
How fitting 
So-lo that I can give a fuck about 
What is trending 
Tryna cut down on my spending 
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending 
And bending over backwards 
Over half of these hoes had work done 
Sayin' they want something real from a man 
Just saying it, we being real persons 
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you ann 
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on 
So pardon me if I am being insensitive 
But darling this only worsens 
So-lo my halo, stay way low 
It feels like it's bent 
So-lo that when they throw 
Pussy on pesos I pay no attention to it 
So-lo that I am no rookie 
But feel like a kid 
Lookin' at the other kids 
With astonishment while I'm on punishment 
Watchin' the summer come close to an end 
After 20 years in 
I'm so naive I was under the impression 
That everyone wrote they own verses 
It's comin' back different 
And yea that shit hurts me 
I'm hummin' and whistlin' 
To those not deserving 
I'm stumbled and lift every word 
Was I working just way too hard?</field>

Even sex has got me braggin'

And you're the one I want girl 
You're like static

And I'm a take it nice and slow, yeah.

I'm on my way to you, here's what were gonna do 
And girl I tell you to, move in closer, don't stop 
Don't mess up the flow, don't be scared 
Touch right there, make it personal 
I don't really know what it is that you do 
It's like a force, I'm stuck onto you like static

When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing 
Every moment was so precious, then 
I'm still kicking it, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing 
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end 
Just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn 
I should say and you should hear I've loved 
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here 
[Verso 2] 
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know 
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go 
Cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing 
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved 
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times

And millions are left behind while the sky burns

That I stay pretty busy, lately 
And I could be misbehaving 
I just hang with my niggas 
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot 
I'm faithful 
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket 
And this is painfully honest 
And when I say it I vomit 
On cloudy days when I'm salty 
I play the hate to the laundry 
State to state for the profit 
It ain't a stain on me, nigga 
My momma raised me a prophet 
I play for dollar incentive 
And where I'm walking, it's studded 
And half-retarded I stumble 
To where she park when she visit 
I grab the bottle and chug it 
I see the car in the distance 
I know the dark isn't coming 
For the moment, if I could hold it 
She, she seems that 
All my dreams got dimmer 
When I stopped smoking pot 
Nightmares got more vivid 
When I stopped smoking pot 
And loving you is a little different 
I don't like you a lot 
You see, it seems like 
I'm coming back I gotta handle business 
Vanish to my sleeper seat 
Left you at terminal three 
I'll meet you down at baggage claim 
In a couple weeks, a fortnight 
When you parade my homecoming, don't cry 
You know I can't live in any place I visit 
To live and die in la 
I got my fleetwood mac 
I could get high every day 
But I'd be sleepy, ocd and paranoid, so 
Give me bali beach, no molly please 
Palm, no marijuana trees 
Yo hickeys on my aorta 
And tattoos you could only see 
When I'm playing surfboarder 
Put whisky in that salt water 
I emptied every canteen, just to wear 
That straight edge varsity you think's cool 
They thought me soft in high school 
Thank god I'm jagged 
Forgot you don't like it rough 
I mean he called me a faggot 
I was just calling his bluff 
I mean how anal am I gon' be 
When I'm aiming my gun 
And why's his mug all bloody 
That was a three on one? 
Standing ovation at staples 
I got my grammy's and gold 
Polka dots on my brit 
I'm not supposed to be stunting 
It's all melodic this song 
I catch this vibe in my sleep 
But I'm just jet-lagged is all, and restless 
All my dreams got more vivid 
When I stopped smoking pot 
Nightmares got more vivid 
When I stopped smoking pot 
And loving you is a little different 
I don't like you a lot 
I mean, fuck 
I don't know what we're about 
What good is west coast 
Weather if you're bi-polar? 
If I'ma need this sweater 
I'd rather be where it's cold 
Where it snows 
I see how it goes 
I put the flowers in bowls 
I know they're coming in droves 
You'll only miss when it goes

Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms

Parents ain't around enough 
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar 
Too many white lies and white lines 
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends 
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends 
Start my day up on the roof 
There's nothing like this type of view 
Point the clicker at the tube 
I prefer expensive news 
New car, new girl 
New ice, new glass 
New watch, good times babe 
It's good times, yeah

Panic and patch me up

Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough

And all they clothes revealing they tits 
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch 
We party in my living room 
Cause father is gone 
And he left me this empire 
That runs on its own 
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want 
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want 
We end our day up on the roof 
I say I'll jump, I never do 
But when I'm drunk I act a fool 
Talking bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits 
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm 
She slaps my head 
It's good times, yeah 
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall 
The market's down like 60 stories 
And some don't end the way they should 
My silver spoon has fed me good 
A million one, a million cash 
Close my eyes and feel the crash

Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high 
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free

That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it? 
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it 
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding 
And everytime the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them 
And I've got this black suit on 
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral 
Five more miles 'til the road runs out 
[Hook] 
I'm about to drive in the ocean 
I'mma try to swim from something bigger than me 
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good 
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good 
[Verse 2] 
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah 
Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated 
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference 
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby 
I've had this black suit on 
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral 
One more mile 'til the road runs out 
[Hook] 
[Bridge] 
I'm going off, don't try stopping me 
I'm going off, don't try saving 
No flares, no vest, and no fear 
Waves are washing me (out)

I make stacks and stacks of cake in the bank, bank 
You ate through em, you ate through em 
You ate through em, yeah, yeah 
Tell me how does that taste 
Tell me how does that taste, oh 
When I re-up, got you coming back 
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed 
All the newest shit, and the benz I baked you 
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you 
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy 
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving 
Said that gucci taste good, but dior taste amazing, baby 
We took chartered flights 
All around to taste those malls that 
You like most, said the jetfuel taste like pink raspberry 
Good credit, a1, just like that sauce 
Said you liked ruth chris way better 
Lean back my seat, watch your head go down 
Tell me how does that taste 
Tell me how does that taste, oh

Love me as long as you're fed, you said

Just want to keep you here

I've been thinkin' 'bout you (You know, know, know)

'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh) 
No, I don't like you, 
I just thought you were cool enough to kick it 
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho 
Since you think I don't love you, 
I just thought you were cute 
That's why I kiss you 
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though

Yes, of course 
I remember, how could I forget? 
How you feel? 
And though you were my first time 
A new feel 
It won't ever get old, not in my soul 
Not in my spirit, keep it alive 
We'll go down this road 
'Til it turns from color to black and white

Cause in the words I could still hear love 
Somebody still cared 
And I would rather sleep on the sofa as long as you're still in our bed 
At least I'm sure that you're at home and you ever left me yet 
You said you know my heart is good 
But you'd hate me if you could 
If love would allow you to you would 
You could, you should, but don't 
Try to leave me 
Try to stay 
Giving up 
Is harder baby 
Don't try don't try 
Don't try to leave girl

Try, try

Sickening I hate standing at that station 
It's a picture that I don't wanna frame

My hands fatigued and off the opus 
Kept it underground, I focus 
I feel afterlife, 6 under oath, don't want no hokus pokus 
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact 
With my facemask 
Nothin' but, nothin' but net 
Is you Roger or Novak? 
You still are no match, you get no rematch 
Boy, you missed your moment 
Perusing the MoMA 
I'm all on my lonely, burst in tears 
On his shoulder and it's so cold cause he sculptured 
Where's the shaman ayahuasca 
I at once ask him for atonement 
I never ever trust a pre-rolled 
I never let a random mothafucka shoot the B-roll 
I never ask advice from him cause what could he know? 
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though 
It forever seems like time's up 
When we swerve in the Honda 
Now forever seems like no time 
I mean time flies when you have some 
Both nuts weigh two pounds 
all on your bitch like futons 
My crew saved you crew 
like niggas came through with the groupons 
Cookin' with the grease down, couple fries and Cholula 
Are you slowin' down? Are you holdin' down? 
Whoever held you down 
Whoever propped you up 
Built the structures with you 
Swished the buckets with ya 
Who was fuckin' with ya? 
Really brothers when you needed that? 
When you seeing eye is a forced black 
Hail Mary on a fourth down 
Hands to the sky 
[Verse 2] 
Yeah, peace to the holy 
peace to the people that think they know me 
Peace to Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing 
Peace to the boys that we used to be though 
Geto Boy North Face too cold on these hoes 
Peace out to Willy B, Bushwick Billy and Face 
Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace 
Hands to the sky

U-N-I-T-Y 
Neptunes and peace signs 
Chiraq, Palestine life 
Hyper built 1995 
You'd think that was airstrikes on outside 
I put refugees in my villa 
Play kids the Fu-Gee-La 
All this space Atlanta 
Place order McMansion and two apple pies 
I want the Porsche, a Bugatti design 
Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up 
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine? 
Sick, blew nose, spit foamin' white like frapple, Jackal

I believe Jehovah Jireh 
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war 
I believe a woman's temple 
Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort 
I believe that marriage isn't 
Between a man and woman but between love and love 
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith 
But you must believe in something, something, something 
You gotta believe in something, something, something 
[Hook] 
I still believe in man 
A wise one asked me why 
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked 
I know that we sin but I do believe we try 
We all try, the girls try, the boys try 
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try 
[Verse 2] 
I don't believe in time travel 
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon 
I don't believe our lives are simple 
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude 
I don't believe my hands are cleanly 
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart 
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith 
You must believe in something, something, something 
You gotta believe in something, something, something

Try to believe (just try) 
I do believe I do believe

Mind on the road, your dilated eyes 
Watch the clouds float, white ferrari 
Had a good time 
16: How was I supposed to know anything? 
I let you out at central 
I didn't care to state the plain 
Kept my mouth closed 
We're both so familiar 
White ferrari 
Close by me 
You will find 
You will find me 
Is this the slow body 
Left when I forgot to speak 
So I text to speech, lesser speeds 
Texas speed, yes 
Based takes it's toll on me 
Eventually, eventually, yes 
I only eventually, eventually, yes 
I care for you still and I will forever 
That was my part of the deal, honest 
We got so familiar 
Spending each day of the year, white ferrari 
Good times 
In this life, life 
In this life, life 
One too many years 
So taste what I lived on a facelift 
Mind over matter is magic 
I do magic 
If you think about it it's over 
In no time the best life 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension 
You say we're smaller 
And not worth the mention 
You're tired of movin', your body's achin' 
We could vacay, there's places to go 
Clearly this isn't all that there is 
Can't take what's been given 
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine 
I'm up and naked 
You dream of walls that hold us in prison 
It's just a scar 
At least that's what they call it 
And we're free to fall</field>

They'll rip apart his flesh 
Til all that's left is glorious bone 
So you'll bury your own 
Too vain 
You saw it unfold 
What you know 
And you claimed all you could hold 
Until death did you apart from the mess you made 
I bet your mother would be proud of you 
I bet your mother would be proud of you

To survive and thrive in the jungle 
Maybe hearts were made to pum blood 
Maybe lungs were made for flood

Rather let my limbs be drug through mud

Come on, come on 
 
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn 
From the cigarettes 
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy 
Running on my mind boy 
Forrest Gump 
 
I know you Forrest 
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle 
But you're so buff, and so strong 
I'm nervous Forrest 
Forrest Gump 
 
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn 
From the cigarettes 
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy 
Running on my mind boy 
Forrest Gump 
 
I saw ya game, Forrest 
I was screamin' run 44 
But you kept runnin' past the end zone 
Oh where'd you go Forrest 
Forrest Gump 
 
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn 
From the cigarettes 
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy 
Running on my mind boy 
Forrest Gump 
 
Forrest green 
Forrest blues 
I remember you 
This is love, I know it's true 
I won't forget you (you) 
(Oh you you) it's for you Forrest, you you 
(Oh you you) it's you you Forrest

Stage diving sky diver 
Spray the crowd with cold water 
Now its mosh pits and wet tits 
I think I need a cold shower 
Cool waters 
African girl speaks in English accent 
Likes to fuck boys in bands 
Likes to watch westerns 
And ride me without the hands 
Show me her passport 
She's on her own tour 
 
But you're beautiful to me 
Wave 'em high girl to the sky 
But you're beautiful to me 
We're in the clouds 
Wave 'em high girl to the sky 
But you're beautiful to me 
Life in the clouds 
Keep em high y'all 
Beautiful stars 
In the sky 
 
Monks in the mosh pit 
Stage diving Dahli Lama 
Feet covered in cut flowers 
They mosh for enlightenment 
Clean chakra good karma 
One with the water 
Indian girl sleeps above the temple 
Planning a run away young at heart 
You found a boyfriend 
And now you wanna get away, get away 
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away 
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away 
Abhaya Mudra 
 
I never ask for much 
But please keep up lover 
We've got no choices left 
The running's fast 
Run run run run 
You're beautiful to me 
Run run run run you'd better run 
You mean so much to me 
In my world, in my world 
 
We made it safely 
Even with your father's army trailing us 
We escaped him 
Even with his archer's bows at our backs 
What a great escape 
But there's a long way still in fact 
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds 
There's a monsoon that never ends 
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber 
To guide and protect us til the end 
 
We're in the clouds 
Wave 'em high now, to the sky 
But you're beautiful to me 
Keep em high y'all, show you right 
But you're beautiful to me 
Beautiful</field>

Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator 
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (ice cold!) 
You out here flyin' high (high!) 
Go head, fly that thing! 
High! High! 
But fly alone 
 
You always smokin' in the house 
What if my mother comes over? 
You can't get up and get a job 
Cause this little hustle's getting you by 
You're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss around 
 
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones 
She took me high, then she took me home 
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones 
 
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again 
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober 
See there you go reachin' up your blouse and no I don't want a child 
But I ain't been touched in a while by the dealer 
And the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known 
 
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones 
She took me high, then she took me home 
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones 
 
In the sky up above, the birds 
I saw the sky like I never seen before 
You thought I was above you 
Above this in so many ways 
But if I got a condo on a cloud 
Then I guess you can stay at my place 
Ooh I'ma get one 
I need ya 
Admit it 
You're my Pilot Jones</field>

You could sell for me 
 
What do you think my brain is made for 
Is it just a container for the mind 
This great grey matter 
Sensei replied what is your woman 
Is she just a container for the child 
That soft pink matter 
Cotton candy Majin Buu 
Close my eyes and fall into you 
My god she's giving me pleasure 
 
What if the sky and the stars are for show 
And the aliens are watching live 
From the purple matter 
Sensei went quiet then violent 
And we sparred until we both grew tired 
Nothing mattered 
Cotton candy maajin bu 
Dim the lights and fall into you 
My god giving me pleasure 
Pleasure pleasure pleasure 
Pleasure over matter 
 
Since you been gone 
I been having withdrawals 
You were such a habit to call 
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself naw 
She's better with some fella with a regular job 
I didn't wanna get her involved 
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe 
Hopped into my car drove far 
Far's too close and I remember 
My memories no sharp 
Butter knife what a life anyway 
I'm building y'all a clock stop 
What am I Hemingway 
She had the kind of body 
That would probably intimidate 
Any of 'em that were un-southern 
Not me cousin 
If models are made for modeling 
Thick girls are made for cuddlin' 
Switch worlds and we can huddle then 
Who needs another friend 
I need to hold your hand 
You'd need no other man 
We'd flee to other lands 
 
Grey matter 
Blue used to be my favorite color 
Now I ain't got no choice 
Blue matter 
 
You're good at being bad 
You're bad at being good 
For heaven's sakes go to hell 
Knock knock on wood 
You're good at being bad 
You're bad at being good 
For heaven's sakes go to hell 
Knock knock knock knock on wood 
 
Well frankly when that ocean so muhfuckin' good 
Make her swab the muhfuckin' wood 
Make her walk the muhfuckin' plank 
Make her rob a muhfuckin' bank

There's a thief out on the move 
Underneath our legion's view 
They have taken Cleopatra 
 
Run run run, come back for my glory 
Bring her back to me 
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh 
The throne of our queen is empty 
 
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds 
In a rocky world, rocky rocky world 
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere 
As we march to rhythm on the palace floor 
Chandeliers inside the pyramid, tremble from the force 
Cymbals crash inside the pyramid, voices fill up the halls 
 
Set the cheetahs on the loose 
There's a thief out on the move 
Underneath our legion's view 
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra 
 
The jewel of Africa 
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious? 
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us? 
You feel like God inside that gold 
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair 
Found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra 
 
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb 
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom 
No more she lives no more serpent in her room 
No more it has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra 
 
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds 
Wake up to your girl for now, let's call her Cleopatra 
I watch you fix your hair 
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra 
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra 
Then your six-inch heels 
Catch her 
She's headed to the pyramid 
She's working at the pyramid tonight 
 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
 
Pimping in my convos 
Bubbles in my champagne 
Let it be some jazz playing 
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars 
Floor model TV with the VCR 
Got rubies in my damn chain 
Whip ain't got no gas tank 
But it still got wood grain 
Got your girl working for me 
Hit the strip and my bills paid 
That keep my bills paid 
Hit the strip and my bills paid 
Keep a nigga bills paid 
She's working at the pyramid tonight 
 
She's working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
 
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body 
Touch you in places only I know 
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater 
Can we make love before you go 
The way you say my name makes me feel like 
I'm that nigga 
But I'm still unemployed 
You say it's big but you take it 
Ride cowgirl 
But your love ain't free no more 
But your love ain't free no more 
 
She's working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight 
Working at the pyramid 
Working at the pyramid tonight

Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different

And a new day will bring another cryin' babe into the world

Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills 
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools 
The water's blue, swallow the pill 
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like 
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high 
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free 
My TV ain't HD, that's too real 
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life 
 
The sweet life, sweet life 
Sweet life, sweet life 
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life 
Sweet life, the sweet life 
Sweetie pie 
 
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born 
The sunshine always kept you warm 
So why see the world, when you got the beach 
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach 
The sweet life 
 
The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down 
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off 
Transmitting the waves 
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave 
 
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like 
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high 
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free, my tv ain't HD, that's too real 
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life 
 
A sweet life 
A sweet life, yeah 
A sweet life, a sweet life

Live and die in the life 
 
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born, yeah 
The sunshine always kept you warm 
So why see the world, when you got the beach 
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach 
 
And the water, is exactly what I wanted 
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be) 
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day 
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy 
 
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born 
The star shine always kept you warm 
So why see the world, when you got the beach

A one-man cult

Never make him love me

Panicking, patch me up, Pappy done latch keyed us 
Toying with Raggy Anns and mammy done had enough 
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts; don't believe us 
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup 
 
We end our day up on the roof 
I say I'll jump, I never do 
But when I'm drunk I act a fool 
Talking 'bout , do they sew wings on tailored suits 
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm 
She slaps my head 
It's good times, yeah 
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall 
The market's down like 60 stories 
And some don't end the way they should 
My silver spoon has fed me good 
A million one, a million cash 
Close my eyes and feel the crash 
 
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce

            <field name="lyrics">Many college students have gone to college 
And gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol 
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else 
Don't try to be someone else 
Be yourself and know that that's good enough 
Don't try to be someone else 
Don't try to be like someone else 
Don't try to act like someone else, be yourself 
Be secure with yourself 
Rely and trust upon your own decisions 
On your own beliefs 
You understand the things that I've taught you 
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs 
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana because that stuff is highly addictive 
When people become weed-heads they become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned 
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned 
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom 
Unless you're taking it under doctor's umm control 
Then it's regulated. Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol 
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated 
This is mom, call me, bye</field>

Warned your ex 
I run my hands through what's left 
But we're getting older, baby 
How much longer baby? 
Why am I preaching? 
To this choir, to the saved kids 
Just like mine versions of these belong to you 
After a while

And we was together since 3 years 
And uh, I was not even cheating on her or what 
And Facebook arrived and she wanted me to accept her on Facebook 
And I don't want it because I was like in front of her 
And she told me like "Accept me on Facebook" 
It was virtual, made no sense 
So I say "I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook" 
She started to be crazy 
She thoughts that because I didn't accept her 
She thought I was cheating 
She told me like, uh, "it's over" 
I can't believe you 
I said "come on you're crazy" because like yeah 
I'm in front of you, I'm every day 
Here in your house 
That's, it means like it's jealousy 
Pure jealousy for nothing

You know I'm Africano Americano 
And even if you're half Japanese 
Roots run deep 
Family tree, throw a big shadow, tech company

Our friendship don't go back that far 
Tyler slept on my sofa yeah 
Niggas go back that far

This the last song so 
I'm finna wipe that off 
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar 
Menage on my birthday 
Tap out on the first stroke 
'Cause this ain't no work day 
She don't give head anyway 
'Cause what niggas say 
That's what she tell her man 
What a difference distance makes 
Niggas want fight in the streets now 
Shit starting to make my hands hurt 
Jay hit me on the email 
Said I oughta act my net worth 
Dog this is chess now 
Not fetch I ain't runnin for a nigga 
Ain't ran since track meet 
That's the only time I ran from a nigga 
You could change this track now 
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago

I, it's highlights when I was convinced 
That it isn't much more it's so not you 
I know you don't need me right now 
And to you it's just a late night out 
 
This nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you nigga

The start of nothing 
I had no chance to prepare 
I couldn't see you coming 
The start of nothing 
I could hate you now 
It's quite alright to hate me now 
When we both know that deep down 
The feeling still deep down is good 
 
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking 
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces 
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then 
We didn't give a fuck back then 
I ain't a kid no more 
We'll never be those kids again 
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then 
Back then 
No matter what I did 
My waves wouldn't dip back then 
Everything sucked back then 
We were friends 
 
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me 
The start of nothing 
I had no chance to prepare 
I couldn't see you coming 
The start of nothing 
I could hate you now 
It's quite alright to hate me now 
When we both know that deep down 
The feeling still deep down is good 
 
In the halls of your hotel 
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell 
How much I meant to meant it sincere back then 
We had time to kill back then 
You ain't a kid no more 
We'll never be those kids again 
It's not the same, ivory's illegal 
Don't you remember? 
I broke your heart last week 
You'll probably feel better by the weekend 
Still remember, had you going crazy 
Scream my name 
The feeling deep down is good 
 
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me 
The start of nothing 
I had no chance to prepare 
I couldn't see you coming 
And we started from nothing 
I could hate you now 
It's alright to hate me now 
When we both know that deep down 
The feeling still deep down is good 
 
All the things I didn't mean to say 
I didn't mean to do 
There were things you didn't need to say 
You didn't need to need to 
I could dream all night 
Dream all night 
I could drive all night 
Drive all night 
Dreaming, dream on</field>

That's the way everyday goes 
Every time we have no control 
If the sky is pink and white 
If the ground is black and yellow 
It's the same way you showed me 
Nod my head, don't close my eyes 
Half way on a slow move 
It's the same way you showed me 
If you could fly then you'd feel south 
Up north's getting cold soon 
The way it is, we're on land 
So I'm someone to hold true 
Keep you cool in this good life 
Won't let you down when it's all ruined 
 
Just the same way you showed me, showed me 
You showed me love 
Glory from above 
Good Glory, dear 
It's all downhill from here 
 
In the wake of a hurricane 
Dark skin of a summer shade 
Nose dive in the flood lines 
Tall tower, milk crate 
It's the same way you showed me 
Cannon ball off the porch side 
Older kids trying off the roof 
Just the same way you showed me (you showed) 
If you could die and come back to life 
Up for air from the swimming pool 
You kneel down to the dry land 
Kiss the Earth that birthed you 
Gave you tools just to stay alive 
And make it up when the sun is ruined 
 
That's the same way you showed me, showed me 
You showed me love 
Glory from above 
Where God could fear 
It's all downhill from here 
 
What a life 
Remember how it was 
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all in this year 
Say what up to Magic, just shoot 
Say what up to Penny 
Say what up to life one more time 
And I know what you might want to know 
Run from me and your team 
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy) 
Give me somethin sweet 
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin

I'm not brave (brave)

I'm living over city 
And taking in the homeless sometimes 
Been living in an idea 
An idea from another man's mind

Maybe I should move 
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool

Speaking of Nirvana, it was there 
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix 
There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah 
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought

That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God 
I be dreaming a dream in a thought 
That could dream about a thought 
That could think about dreaming a dream 
Where I can not, where I can not 
Less morose and more present 
Dwell on my gifts for a second 
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod 
Spin this flammable paper on the film that my life 
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice 
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you 
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight 
Noses on a rare, little virgin wears the white 
You cut your hair but you used to live a blinded life 
Wish I was there, wish we had grown up on the same advice 
And our time was right 
 
Keep a place for me, for me 
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing 
It's nothing, it's nothing 
Keep a place for me, for me 
 
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry 
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes 
I came to visit cause you see me like a UFO 
That's like never cause I made you use your self control 
And you made me lose my self control, my self control

That's a pretty long third gear in this car 
Glidin' on the five 
The deer run across, kill the headlights 
Pretty fucking 
Underneath moon light now 
Pretty fucking 
Sunrising, sand, comes a morning, haunting us with the beams 
So it ain't as far as it used to be 
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!) 
Summer's not as long as it used to be 
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, hazy) 
Wanna get soaked? 
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat? 
We smell of Californication, strike a pose 
Everything grows in the Congo 
Everything grows 
Can you call when I call again? 
 
On comes the evening 
Both seeking ends 
Peace in my hands worth twice than a friend 
And two limbs over shoulder, carry the way 
Because I'm stronger, congo is damned (smoke) 
In comes the morning (smoke) 
In comes the morning (haze)</field>

Gone off tabs of that acid 
Form me a circle, watch my jagger 
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo 
One time 
We too loud in public then police turned down the function 
Now we outside and the timing's perfect 
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you 
And we don't gotta be solo 
Now stay away from highways 
My eyes like them red lights 
Right now I prefer yellow 
Red-bone, so mellow 
Fuck 'round, be cutting you 
Think we were better off solo 
I got that act right in the Windy city that night 
No trees to blow through 
But blow me and I owe you 
Two grams when the sunrise 
Smoking good, rolling solo 
 
Solo, solo 
Solo, solo 
S-solo, solo 
S-solo, solo 
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire 
Inhale, in hell there's heaven 
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky 
Inhale, in hell there's heaven 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Solo, solo 
Solo, solo 
 
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long 
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross 
And catch a solo, on time 
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low 
And that mean cheap, cause ain't shit free and I know it 
Even love ain't, cause it's enough cost, that clinic kill my soul 
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though 
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her Pickett fence 
And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you 
Won't let you fly solo 
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night 
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you 
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo 
 
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire 
Inhale, in hell there's heaven 
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky 
Inhale, in hell there's heaven 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Solo, solo 
By myself 
Solo, solo

            <field name="lyrics">Aye, aye, so now I'm 
 
So-lo that I can see under the skirt of an ant 
So-lo that I don't get high no more when I "Geronimo!" I just go hit 
So-lo my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend 
So-lo that I can admit 
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo it ain't an event 
No more 
So-lo that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo 
When I do I cut the pony off, now there's a hole that once was a logo 
How fitting 
So-lo that I can give a fuck about what is trending 
Tryna cut down on my spending 
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending 
And bending over backwards 
Over half of these hoes had work done 
Sayin' they want something real from a man 
Just saying it, we being real persons 
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you Ann 
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on 
So pardon me if I am being insensitive but darling this only worsens 
So-lo my halo, stay way low, it feels like it's bent 
So-lo that when they throw pussy on pesos I pay no attention to it 
So-lo that I am no rookie but feel like a kid 
Lookin' at the other kids 
With astonishment while I'm on punishment, watchin' the summer come close to an end 
After 20 years in 
I'm so naive I was under the impression that everyone wrote they own verses 
It's comin' back different and yea that shit hurts me 
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving 
I'm stumbled and lived every word, was I working just way too hard?</field>

If I have love for ya, But you weren't ever close enough to feel it.. Is my love any good? (x2) Ohh... But the distance aint even a room away You're laying in the bed right next to me, Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us, Some soundproof glass and some bars in the middle... Oh baby when I wanna talk to you, I'm conversing with bricks and steel, A pile of bricks and steel.. And when I tap your shoulders, You're cold as bricks and steel, A pile of bricks and steel.. And how do I stay in love with your rubbish all the the left over's and garbage Was it ever real..If you were never here.. Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen, Like a pile of bricks and steel.. Bricks bricks, steel steel.. Oh I know you're somewhere in there.. Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer And start chiseling away,away.. Chiseling away.. away.. Girl my phone bill is crazy, The rate is sky high when I call ya.. But you only let it ring.. You only let it ring no ohh... But the distance aint even normal aayeee..

Yeah, this somethin special y'know, somethin epic 
Lloyd Banks, you know 
Cause a nigga thuggin don't mean he don't 
..Wanna see you smile baby 
... 
Wooo! I wanna be the reason you smile 
I wanna be the reason you smi-ile 
I wanna be the reason you smile 
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes 
[Lloyd Banks] 
I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge 
From the conversations we have and the way it ends 
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends 
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz 
It all depends, maybe if we make amends 
We can start from scratch 
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact 
We plan to be platonic but the hearts in tact 
So everytime we seperate, somebody's marchin back 
You're amazing in the sack 
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black 
God Bless whoever gave you all of that 
If you seen her from the back 
You'd understand why dis feel like that 
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows 
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows 
And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows 
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes 
Up and down 
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks + (50 Cent)] 
Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin down 
Let the thought of me be (be the reason you smile) 
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown 
I wanna bring you joy and be (be the reason you smile) 
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down 
I provide by any means to be (be the reason you smile) 
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while 
I'm just happy I'm around to be (the reason you smile) 
[Lloyd Banks] 
The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful 
What about the half of this shit I done did to you 
Violated and tip toed into a crib or two 
I've come clean to be a bigger individual 
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you 
Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggaz 
when you tease 'em with your physical 
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left 
Wild drama, section 8 princess 
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed 
Cause it's hard to communicate 
Cause she don't speak no english 
I been around the world from state to state 
But now I'm back bustin in your bathroom 
Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on 
Cause I'm leavin in a hour flat, really dont matter, shes mad 
Even when I holla back 
All I really need your attention for a while 
And, I bet you I can make you smile 
[Chorus - 2X]</field>

I wanna be your lawyer 
I really wanna defend you, baby 
I'm lost in your lovin' 
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy 
I wanna be your lover 
I wanna get to know you, baby 
I'm lost in your lovin' 
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy 
[Young Buck] 
Im lovin' how you look in my eyes 
Swingin' them hips when you pass 
I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby 
Jump on this Harley 
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley 
Sip some Bacardi 
Then go pull up at the afterparty 
I think we make a perfect couple 
But you think I'm trouble 
Maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number 
She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman" 
Think im'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin' 
Your toes painted half fixed all the time 
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine 
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you 
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do 
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long 
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong 
Before I head home 
Im'a stop at your house and blow the horn 
If you come outside you know it's on 
[Chorus] 
[Lloyd Banks] 
Bitches be frustrated with the baller 
Qonder why I call her 
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spall her 
Hickups annoy ya from time to time I gotta ignore her 
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more 
She loves it when I'm in town 
Hate it when I'm not around 
I get her and wed down 
Next door neighboors hear the sound 
Pictures hittin' the ground 
Just enough to hold us down 
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round 
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy 
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady 
I admit I fell in love with a frame 
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name 
Her panties wet over fame 
Fall in love with my chain 
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain 
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only 
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie. 
[Chorus] 
[50 Cent] 
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more 
Watching her lick her lips 
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man 
I sweet talking her if she like 
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right 
Look I'm legit now used to break laws 
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours 
Big house big Benz girl it yours 
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws 
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you 
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal 
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you 
Cause their be some honies gonna hate you that never saw you 
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me 
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me 
Let me ride on you and you can ride on 
We can do it all the night 
We can have a balla night 
[Chorus] 
I wanna be your lawyer 
I really wanna defend you, baby 
I'm lost in your lovin' 
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy 
I wanna be your lover 
I wanna get to know you, baby 
I'm lost in your lovin' 
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy 
I wanna be your lover 
I really need to stand you, baby 
I wannt be your lover 
I really need to stand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.</field>

Every hood we go through 
All the gangstas around know my whole crew (Nigga what) 
We hold it down like we supposed to 
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin’ them thangs 
[50 Cent] 
After the VMAs my baby momma cuss my ass out. 
I kicked her ass we back friends like Puffy and Steve Stout 
Cut the grass around my clique so I could see these sneaks 
You see back in the hood it’s cuz I see they fake 
I preach a sermon about the paper like I’m cut flow a dollar 
I’ll pop you punk niggaz like I pop my collar 
I’m confused; I like Megan, Monica, and Mya. 
Missy’s freaky and Brandy’s shy, uh 
Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up. 
I’m on now, god damn it I done came up. 
Now you could find me with the finest hoes. 
Choosin’ which whip to drive by what match my clothes. 
I got a fetish for the stones, heavy on the ice man 
If I ain’t gotta pistol on me, sure I gotta knife man 
Get outta line and I’m lightin’ your ass up. 
Semi-automatic spray, I’ll tighten your ass up (What) 
[Hooks X2] 
[Lloyd Banks] 
Slow down little nigga 
Don’t exceed your speed 
Cuz I will put g's on they fitted like the Negro league 
I got connects so I don’t need no weed 
I’ve been in LA for a year now 
So I don’t see no seeds 
After I’m done you clappin’ the crew 
Hell yeah, I fuck fans 
Guess what your favorite rapper does too 
In a minute I’ma have the Jew to makin’ my rims spin 
My crew run wild at the Jamaica’s at Kingston 
Nothin’ but bling bling in ya face boy 
That’s why my knicks shine like one of them shirts Puffy and Mase wore 
I done find a nympho as soon as I pop a bra 
She had my balls head first just like a soccer star 
You can only stand next to the man if you proper 
Ya'll take care of birds like a animal doctor 
Been out and I’m buzzin’ niggas just slept on me 
So I’m out for revenge like one of bin laden's cousins 
[Young Buc] 
Read the paper, look at the news 
We one the front page 
Yeah we in the Bahamas with AK's on the stage 
The ice and the Jacob watch make a broke nigga take somethin’ 
So I gotta keep the four fifth with no safety button 
G-Unit getting’ money 
I know some artists is starvin’ 
But play the game like they rich to me this shit funny 
I know you see me comin’ 
Cuz on the front of the Maybach 
It say payback for those who hated on me 
I hate when niggas claim they bangin’ a game 
You ain't no crip like snoop 
You ain't no blood like gang 
See I’ve been having beef 
I have my own bullet proof vest 
Most of my enemies dead I got about two left 
Until my last breath I’m sendin’ niggas bullet holes 
Innocent bystanders get hit tryin’ to be heroes 
You know how we roll 
Every where that we go 
It’s fo’ fos’, calicos, and desert eagles (yeah)

(Tony Yayo) 
You a half time hustla, im a full time hustla 
(50 Cent) 
Cuz I stay on the grind, i stay on the grind 
(Lloyd Banks) 
While you chasin your dick, Ill be chasin them tits 
(50) 
Cuz I stay On the grind, I stay on the grind 
Man, the D's on me, cuz they caught me with a nine 
And I, stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
(TY) 
Wife be beggin, for me to spend time 
(50) 
Cuz I, stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
(Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
All I do is sit and think of ways that I can come up 
Hit tips of 1 up, then maybe they could gun up 
My pockets are hurtin homie, I aint feelin this shit 
Have yo mama screamin (BABY BOO, IS YA HIT?!) 
I aint Scarface, "No women no kids" I dont give a fuck 
Better teach that bitch and that little nigga ta duck 
With a P90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya 
If you survive, you gon feel what time'll do to ya 
I'm a hard-headed nigga, I came up so hard 
Had to get shot 9 times for me to find God 
If 10 planes hit the projects, nobody will care 
Look around, they aint nothin but black folks around here 
From brothers that become political, and start to manuever 
They'll give you a hundred years man, they did it to Hoover 
Ya, you can hate me or love me, when you see me bust shots 
Come and hug me, come show me she loves me 
(CHORUS: 50 Cent) 
I go hard for mine, I work 9 to 5, and I 
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
I aint got time for love 
I'm tryna get mine, and I 
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
I got moans in the middle, and I'm always gon shine, cuz I 
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
If you call when I'm busy, when you got spare time, cuz I 
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
(Verse 2: Tony Yayo) 
I got claintell, I flip coke in a hurry 
Darryl Strawberry even called me on the celly 
And Whitney Houston, saw my coke be movin 
I got the china white from the schuben 
And my dope connects, the dudes be African 
He got Boo-koo bucks, he be traffican 
I know feinds that'll rob a train, to feed their vein 
Feinds that'll kill an addict that support their habit 
Feinds that'll pawn their jewels for dog food 
So when I'm on the strip, you know I'm on the move 
Fuck cops in a bentley, with low ass knowledge 
I cop ten bricks and pay for a pilots 
Now theres coke in Ohana, dope in Alabama 
I'm, not a rapper, Tony Yay' is a scrambler 
Remember back then, is when I slinged on the corner 
I had the sheep skin, my girl had to love the barber 
((Chorus)) 
(Verse 3: Lloyd Banks) 
Dont get caught robbin the pot, cuz your hand'll be tossed 
Get on both sides, its your man Berry Boss 
Imma flood the watch, and every cross 
Nevermind a horse, im in a porsche, its my turn to floss 
Dont put me in a mix of your rap lies 
Diss me, Ill dip you in toilet water so you can get baptized 
I grew up with the peasants in the halls 
Elevators is broke, probably have a specious in the walls 
Now haters get wreckless with the calls 
As Im fuckin their bitch and they buyin breakfast in the morn 
Not to mention, he dresses in the malls 
New Prada footwear, Nexino necklace with the fauls 
I dont care if you over 300 pounds, dont seduce me 
You'll get your big ass cut up like Bruce Lee 
I wont stop till my starve eat 
We got tools, thatll steam your ass around like a 5 heart beat 
((Chorus))</field>

Dre don't care if I blow 
God damn, all this from fucking selling headphones 
Chris died, Theo didn't show up to a nigga wake 
Which indicates the team I thought we built, it was fucking fake 
Barry's drunk, Barry dump, Barry's in the pen again 
I'm back at the drawing board, somebody call Eminem 
These days can't believe what you hear on the street 
That nigga said he owns the team, he only on the seat 
That's fool's gold we sold you, you fools, I watch you buy it 
What's this here some kind of new hustle, I might try it 
This flow got us all put on so I know I'm nice 
Fucking with the wrong bitches got me cold as ice 
These niggas'll change on you 
I can't keep count of how many times 
I done watched them change on me 
Now they hate everything I do 
I can't help but win, I'm a winner, nigga, you changed on me 
Guess I gotta stop posting all this money on Instagram 
They welcome you with open arms and open hands 
I ain't rich like 50, I just know the man 
Red emoji faces in your text, I know you mad 
Pitch me a few dollars, more than sure you can 
When you balling the world's on your shoulder pads 
I don't owe you nothing, they busting, you ain't bang back 
You never fronted me nothing I couldn't bring back 
They gave dap, now they saying you never gave back 
You never gave me nothing I couldn't pay back 
Now you talking to the Feds because you ain't fed 
Give a nigga a foot, they want your whole leg 
Fuck what he said, tell 'em get his own bread 
If niggas got a problem that's a code red 
That's when niggas pull up with long dreads 
Bumbaclot, man, shooting at your forehead 
These niggas'll change on you 
I can't keep count of how many times I done 
Watched them change on me 
Now they hate everything I do 
I can't help but win, I'm a winner, nigga, you changed on me 
They say family's first, but family is the first to get you hurt 
And these hoes even worse, all these riches is a gift 
And a curse 
Hate running all through the tree, thought they be rooting for me 
Backstabbing, lies stacking, the truth is gorey 
Forever holding on the grudges from my early struggles 
They see you go out and get it then want it from you 
Say you'll never be a winner, show up at your parade 
Outside showing you smiles, inside hoping it fades 
Rather be low now, money over the stage 
Sanity over fame, eye-candy calling your name 
But it changes, their love is dangerous 
Fog up your aim, there's a million ways to hit them cages 
Shit's contagious, forget my favors 
I'm outta here, flipping pages 
You slipping backwards going with all the other actors 
The limelight is hot, I ain't ask to be here 
The money and the power make problems disappear 
People change like the weather 
I weather the storm until it's better 
And these fake ass niggas wanna shake my hand 
Instagram hoes backstage with fans 
And the snakes in the grass ain't a part of my plan 
Stab me in my back and they say I changed 
These niggas'll change on you 
I can't keep count of how many times I done 
Watched them change on me 
Now they hate everything I do 
I can't help but win, I'm a winner, nigga, you changed on me 
Some of you motherfuckers changed for the worse though 
Some niggas change for the better 
Some bitches'll just never change 
Some of these hoes'll never change, man, yo</field>

Bitches with me cruisin, Moulin Rouge and 
They fuckin and they strippin nigga, I ain't even trippin nigga 
Me I handle business; God's my only witness 
Watchin homicide, sayin "Who the fuck did this?" 
Me I run the street mayne, so I keep the heat mayne 
Sews what you reap, when you fuck with the elite mayne 
I don't fuck around boy; you better ask around boy

You niggaz got the nerve, I'm at Johannesburg 
With Mandela nephew blowin heavy herb 
Then back to the projects, low from the task force 
The dope spot's sellin more shit than Scott Storch 
I'm tired of these pricks, lyin 'bout bricks 
Got my can and my white, my tan like Mariah and Nick 
Fly in the '60 U.F.O. 
Unidentified flyin object on twenty-fo's 
More money more hoes, more money more clothes 
Smoke that AK-48, not bullshit 'dro (yeah) 
I rock big arenas, not bullshit shows 
And my pants three thousand, these ain't bullshit clothes (OHH!)

You see out on hydro, Luciano blind hoe 
Loiue V offended me, {?} in my Bentley C 
And weekends are the chills, I'ma fuck her 'til she empty 
Empty on you if you front, 'til your passenger is stuck 
Give your ass a brand new scar, in need of a brand new car 
I ain't them I'm different baby, I talk, you listen baby 
Listen and I'll show you, how money controls you 
I'll put you in my old school, and let you pop the switch 
Pocketful in every packet, that's why I'm poppin shit 
I don't forgive I don't forget, what you said, where you flip 
When you get hit, I hope that's it, pop-pop, all on your whip 
I-I, be on that shit, I'm high, I'm on that piff 
Bye-bye, you fuckin bitch, you ain't hot, you ain't rich

I put my weed on a digital scale 
I put my dope on a digital scale

Sixty-two eights of that raw, imported keys 
Half of chicken whole chicken 
Niggas got to cop 'n' go, yo 
I said you niggas got to cop 'n' go 
This is like fast food, nigga 
May I take your order 
I require nothin' cookin' but bakin' 
Soda 'n' water ice, cold 
That's crack inside that pyrex 
We get the work, then move the work 
The pressure we apply next 
Every now and then, a nigga set-trip 
I8 bmw; I'm electric 
Keep that hammer around me 
In case shit get hectic 
Shit pop off when I'm rhymin', I protect it 
Fuck around

I put my weed on a digital scale 
I put my dope on a digital scale

Baggin' up half a brick 
My lawyer sittin' on the couch 
He said it's cool, buck I swear I won't open my mouth 
I weigh a bag on the triple-beam scale 
I'm all kushed out, coke under my fingernail 
My uncle been playin' with that powder, and I can tell 
You know that crack smell, and he lookin' all frail 
My sister need bail; she just caught the weed sell 
Now the feds on her trail 
I just got the email 
Shit crazy, but I'm still cookin' up babies 
Hookin' up my niggas daily with this dope 
Get out and get some, nigga 
Can't pay me if you broke, no 
Let a nigga hang himself just give him enough rope 
I get it fresh out the boat 
I put my coke on a digital scale 
I put my weed on a digital scale 
I put my dope on a digital scale 
It's time to re-up what my scale read 
Numbers don't lie; scales don't either 
Every time you out, fiends wanna reach ya 
Out with some bitches, fiends wanna call 
In the club with my niggas, fiends wanna call 
When I'm waitin' on them, man they never call 
The life of a hustler in a nutshell 
G-5 eatin' snakes, soup and raw fish 
Snakes see the ray phantom off of raw fish 
My main bitch is like bonnie parker 
My side bitch is like clyde barrow 
They start to shoot you up shit's creek without a paddle 
They roll up and smoke you like kumar and harold 
Catch 'em in the whip like caine cousin, harold 
My nigga flippin' on his p

Cause he can't travel 
You owe me, I take your child for collateral 
Gun wave, hello 
Shots echo 
Won't save money switch to gecko 
You known from the get-go

Cookin' bitches casserole

It ain't no love here, but your heart's tied in 
Soul's slipping, sparks flying 
Masterpieces is an art dying 
Crime release, we break apart lying 
Man down, the parts crying 
Tears of joys heal a real mccoy 
Bury your worries, don't wonder who rides for ya 
Know yourself, relax and study 
Bloody your uniform, no rest, keep moving on 
Anybody who do you wrong, wrong turn, it's on 
Somebody chain got took, somebody life got lost 
Somebody water not working, somebody lights cut off 
I watched my partner od in '03 in front of me 
Took the plea, went on a spree, damn near did the whole ki 
Paranoid, nose dirty, 'bout to go for them thirty 
You keep saying he's hurting, now all his homies is worried 
Second-guessing this gangster, they don't know what he said 
They don't know what he told, but now you know that he dead 
I'm in them trenches like I'm a marine sniper in his gillie suit 
Hk, sk, turn niggas vegetable 
Live past 22 like climbing mount everest with one shoe or flip-flop 
Middle finger to the opp' 
Bacon, egg and cheese at my clip from last night 
Smoking, think about that drama from last night 
Emotion in your mind, love and hate cause casualty 
These old dogs wack in that cave mentality 
Dope boy salary, block ground athlete 
Move so much weight I lost a couple calories 
The palms sells the size of deep batteries 
Get hit like jay rock when that fat nigga squeeze

I've been hungry since a little nigga weed in my high top (Woo) 
Face burgundy red, in need of a eye drop (uh huh) 
I had the black Delta Force, blue in the front 
Back when Jordan was flyin', and Ewing could dunk 
Of course, you can fuck now, you was buyin' the shrimp then 
Me on the other hand, Don Bishop and Pimp King 
(*harmonizing of "doo, doo" plays in backgroud until G-Unit is yelled) 
I'm runnin' from a digital Munster 
I do this for the hood and every kid in a dumpster 
My name is poppin', and I ain't been at it long 
My neck's 16, and made Flex drop a Benz latin bomb (G-UNIT!) 
I'm the best thing to happen to hip hop 
Since (uh huh) "Life After Death" and that Tupac shit drop 
I'm even good to a white boy with a slick top 
Stuck up in the mountains with a gun and the wrist pop 
Who? where?, Master P says our watch don't tick tock 
I'm cleanin' out my 6 shot, watchin' the Knicks flop 
Damn near the whole damn passenger green 
Thats how my bedroom, look like the World Trade after the scene (smoking) 
Breaking news, hijack, bus passenger scream (yeah) 
I'm your worst nightmare, I crush half of your team 
To me your line up is pussy, three wet Pampers 
The uzi will have you shakin' like them G-Dep dancers (damn dude) 
(*50 Cent - harmonizing "doo,doo,doo"*] 
*beat stops 
[Lloyd Banks] 
What the fuck happen to the rest of the beat man?

Ya, let's take em back 
Uh huh 
Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl 
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world 
Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies 
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody 
I wanna live good, so should I sell dope for a 
fo-finger ring 
Money and them gold ropes 
Santa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat 
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd 
be dope 
Tossed and turned in my sleep at night 
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike 
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the 
hood 
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I 
could 
[Chorus (50 then Game) :] 
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top 
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop 
Go head' envy me 
I'm raps MVP 
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me 
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top 
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop 
Go head' envy me 
I'm raps MVP 
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me 
[Game] 
On the grill of my lowrider 
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires 
I'll fo-five em 
Kill a nigga on my song but really do it 
Thats the true meaning of a ghostwriter 
10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces 
Believe you me homie i know all bout losses 
I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious 
One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy 
I stay strapped like car seats 
Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his 
Barkley's 
That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you 
try me for my Air Max 95s 
Told Banks when i met him imma ride 
And if I gotta die rather homicide 
I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died 
Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on 
See how time fly? 
[Chorus - 50 Cent] 
From the beginnin to the end 
Losers lose, winners win 
This is real we ain't got to pretend 
The cold world that we in 
Is full of pressure and pain 
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game 
[Game] 
Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench 
Now i'm fuckin with 5-0 it's all startin to make 
sense 
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent 
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz 
Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range 
Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes 
When there's kids starvin 
Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the 
garbage 
I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin 
No school books they use that wood to build coffins 
Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted 
I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion 
I love ya Ma'

Break it down, rock it, chop it, if the feds come knockin' 
Drop it, man they plottin' on my drug house 
Man, I hope they don't run in before I run out 
I'm runnin' out, I don't know who to trust now 
No dap, hugs, or "what's ups" now 
I don't fuck around with the fuck arounds 
You see me, get the fuck from 'round me 
I don't talk, texts 
I don't off bets 
I don't fuck with niggas ain't from the set 
I'm from the projects 
Surprised you ain't got robbed yet 
I really don't do no conversatin', no call waitin' 
I know ya'll hatin'; I'm cool with it 
On probation with no patience 
I hop out and act a fool with it 
Fuck who did it 
If you with it, then you get it 
Two to your fitted 
I don't fuck with none of ya'll anyway 
Your funeral could be any day 
Ever since I said send the yay' 
You fuck niggas been' in the way 
I'm just doin' what 50 say 
Puttin' a hundred rounds in the k 
Buck 
My four-five, I grip it, grip it 
Work chef, and I'll whip it, whip it 
Four days, and I'll flip it, flip it 
Front off a meal ticket, ticket 
Hoes wanna come kick it, kick it 
Heard a nigga will trick it, pick it 
Up after we throw it, throw it 
Big money, we blow it 
That gangsta shit, we did it, get it 
Still do; we ain't new to it 
Boy, I ain't never gon' tell on me 
You bitch nigga, bet you do 
You talk a lot 
Niggas around here don't say much 
Niggas around here don't play much 
Soon as shit pop, they blame us 
Cause the money ain't never go'n' change us 
A lot of gun talk in the streets 
But real recognize real beef 
And real soldiers get the mission accomplished 
Never slippin', steady grippin', killin' for nonsense 
Sideline hatin', backbitin haters 
Catch you in your car like them red-light cameras 
Green light, what? 
Green light, woo 
My money cause a fuckin' holocaust

I'll teach you how to stunt 
Nigga you can't see me 
My bently GT got smoke-gray tints 
I'll teach you how to stunt

I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans 
I'll teach you how to stunt

Seven series BM, Six series benz 
Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims 
R1 one wheel when I'm on one of them 
Ma, that boy out there actin a fool that's him 
They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy 
They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy 
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace 
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me 
And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold 
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show 
In the hood they say Fifty man your sneaker look white yo 
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho 
Banks is a sure thing, yall niggaz might blow 
I'm fittin to drop that, so I suggest you lay low 
Buc, he from Cashville, Tenneckee nigga 
Getting them ten of keys, save ten for me nigga

I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rappin 
But the kids used to look up to you, what happened? 
Me on the contrary, hand covered with platinum 
Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one 
On point, cuz you get R.I.P.'s when slacking 
So the stashbox big enough to squeeze the mack in 
Yeah, I'm feelin new but I demand some respect 
Cuz I already wear your advance on my neck 
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches 
Blue yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers 
I already figured out what to do with all my features 
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers 
When it comes to stuntin' theres nothing you can teach us 
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us 
Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt 
Come with me out front, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STUNT

Chain so icy, you don't have to like me 
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback nikes 
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days 
The only thing changed is the numbers on the range 
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains 
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain 
My Sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing 
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game 
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old 
The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold 
G-Unit homie, actin' like yall don't know 
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more 
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes 
They never seen doors lift up on a car before 
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know 
That's how to show these fougaisies how it's supposed to go

Couldn't step in the booth

Couldn't lie what your life bout 
Had to tell these folk

I roll with the windows up, cloudy, cloudy 
Shit chill, I got bricks here 
Sellin' dope out the house and I live there 
So many came to the south think I kill here 
I'm just tryna figure out why I'm still here 
Ay let me hit that 
I'm bout to elevate, elevation 
Tryna elevate on you niggas 
Switchin' positions in this (?) 
I'm all in tucson 
Tryna meet this cuban 
He not the plug but he said he knew some 
You're gonna have to keep your mouth closed 
If I let you come 
If I get you this I'm gon' have 
To kill ya if you run 
Posted in the front of the church 
Pew with two guns 
Prayin' that the lord 
Let me make it through with these 2 tons 
Knowin' niggas with me just 
To see if I give you one 
Funny how when you get rich niggas 
Think that you dumb 
Where you from? 
Where I'm from murder's always the outcome 
Your strap is like your everything 
You can't leave home without one 
Man they got me puttin' 
My gun in the hand of my son 
Somebody come in this house 
Then y'all gon' see what I done 
Why I'm keepin' so much reefer 
Now in my lungs 
I tell 'em I've been pitchin' 
On probation for the last three years 
Yes memph we hot right now, yes we is 
Is 2pac missed nigga? yes he is 
Hey man I never seen 
Seen so many people this point 
Man in my life homie 
I'm one of those people 
It's all the real niggas 
That's not here no more 
Rest in peace 
First you here, before you know it 
It's too late y'all 
Close your eyes then you think 
About nate dogg 
Lil flat, lord infamous, they died real 
Dj screw, fat pat, pimp c died trill 
Soulja slim, doe b 
Now all the ladies drop left eye left tear 
Big pun, biggie smalls, a$ap yams too 
Eazy-e, odb, man this can't be true 
Gang starr, mac dre, jam master j 
Heavy d, slim dunk, and he was from the a 
Static nature, lil wayne had him on his way 
Lil snupe, I seen him with meek 
Just the other day 
It's okay y'all the truth here 
I know eminem feelin' like me 
We wish proof was here 
Obituary like a souvenir 
We just look at 'em 
And reminisce about when you was here 
Somebody pour up, yeah

Of cannabis

Tryna see just how high I can get 
It's an embarrassment just to hear 
A nigga say "I quit" 
Yeah that actavis I like 
But I can't pay for that fake shit 
Don't know what's that in your sprite 
Woah purp niggas make me sick 
She said "buck you takin' flight" 
Least that molly got me right 
Plus these niggas doin' 
All this snitchin' baby I've been outta (whoo)

Quick to take a project bitch to a travelodge 
Fuck her to some mary j 
Blige, get out of dodge 
Dirty nigga, but all my dope clean though 
And I got fishscale for sale, fuck you mean ho? 
You niggas crack under pressure; tim tebow 
The shots didn't hit, you was at the freethrow 
I let my heat go, pull up with my seat low 
Girls smoking, I keep asking banks where the weed go 
Still with the shit, still searching for a kilo 
I'm the reason why these niggas peeping out their peephole 
Wouldn't dent a armor at them niggas all together 
Louise summer sweater, yankee on the sky-dweller 
'Gamo belt, fly fella, they think all of mines vanilla 
Six or seven more flavors out in vegas with weather 
With my kush up in the hall of fame 
Cavemen, break out your ball and chain 
I'll orchestrate the walk of shame 
Your life's plain, escort me through here like the president 
Royal room, you gotta tell the hoes what hotel I'm in 
You never did; you out here regular; y'ain't got one heckler 
I ball consecutive as long as they got neck to give 
Salute me you ever see me, I'm a vet 
Cd full of cracks, easy with the grills, click clack 
Fishscale paid the bill, I ain't never been broke 
Arm ya, adrien broner on the ropes 
I'm still at that mickey d's off of atlantic 
My bk niggas, man, I feed them hammers 
My connect only speaks spanish 
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, full bricks then vanished 
Jump in the martin vanquish 
Donald sterling think he a slavemaster 
Turn my clippers jersey inside out 
Feed niggas with long spoons running their mouth 
Godfathers to the head, they spoiled that

Is that you Tah? 
Y´all niggas is pussy 
I´m ballin´ now nigga now watch me (watch me) 
Ain´t nothin´ you can do to stop me (stop Me) 
You niggas get so emotional (emotional) 
You remind me of my bitch. 
It´s not in my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe, 
But she doesn´t understand catch attitudes when I leave her (leave her) 
Like being on probation makin´ it harder for me to except her 
as my own she tries to tie up my phone and (phone and) 
I´m not at home she´s thinkin´ that I´m not alone probably out tryin´ to bone anything in the street 
I let her know she can leave I ain´t tryin to tie her up but see 
it´s hard to fuck with somebody after she touches me mami 
I´m not your regular nigga I know the game (I know the game) 
But I don´t play by the rules I´m focusin´ on my moves that way I´ll never lose 
See I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Benz´s with 22´s 
Say I confuse you play little tricks with your head 
Catchin´ feelin´s ever since the first time I slept in your bed 
I´m not here to tease you mislead you or mess up your dreams (nah) 
I can´t say I love you I dont know what that means 
I´ma pimp. 
[Chorus: (x2)] 
Girl you know I like it when you climb on top 
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock 
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock 
Take me to extasy without taking Extasy 
[Verso 2:] 
When I first met her 
I did anything to get her (what?) 
Paid all her bills and filled the ´fridgerator (uh huh) 
Reminiscin´ on late nights when I try to lay up 
but couldn´t get off cause your baby would stay up 
She even crashed the whip tryin´ to switch in the third lane 
That´s when I realized this bitch was a bird brain 
A pigeon writin´ her baby pops in the box in the prison 
Sing-sing is where he biddin´ 
She in the Gucci tights and Findi high heals 
Baby wipes and cans of Infamil 
Moter bike and grams of fish scale 
It´s a 9 to 5 niggas with no frills 
Turnin´ young niggas with princables to old men with debts 
And all the prank calls was death threats that bitch had the best sex 
All across the globe and the bitch head game was out of control 
[Chorus: (x2)] 
Girl you know I like it when you climb on top 
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock 
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock 
Take me to extasy without taking Extasy 
[Verso 3:] 
I´m wonderin´ when I´m gone if you´ll miss me (miss me) 
or do you miss the Don Perion and the Cristy 
I´m fuckin´ with you 
I´m feelin´ your shape I´m feelin´ your eyes 
Later on I´m feelin´ your ass and feelin´ your thighs (come here baby) 
Sweet heart your book smart and street smart (uh huh) 
I knew you was my type from the very very start (yeah) 
I´m into tongue kissin´ and four play all day 
Mama ain´t home so the noise is okay 
O.D.B you know he like it the raw way 
Latex safe sex no hickeys on the neck 
Now you learnin´ (whoo) 
The Lords blessin´ makes me wiser as the world´s turnin´ 
My tongue touch the right spot have your toes curlin´ 
Whether we´re just kickin´ it or sexin´ (uh huh) I´m a pro baby girl I spit game to perfection (Yeah) 
So when niggas make mistakes I correct them and 
When niggas get out of line I check them man 
[Chorus: (x2)] 
Girl you know I like it when you climb on top 
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock 
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock 
Take me to extasy without taking Extasy 
Yeah 
Don´t think I forgot about your fat ass though Irv 
Runnin´ around takin´ pictures like you Puff Daddy and the family mothafucka 
And that bitch Charli Baltimore bitch look like she died last week pale as fuck 
Paint her hair red think she gone sell records tryin´ to impersonate Pink and shit bitch 
Punk ass mothafuckas 
All you mothafuckas get wrote on nigga 
Ain´t no mothafuckas leave her alone cause she a bitch fuck that nigga. 
Fuck all of it but not you Ashanti baby you know how I feel about you baby (kiss) come on come here girl

Rock and rollin' on 'em 
[Verse 1: Young Buck] 
100 bottles, give me every bottle in this bitch 
Where she at? 
I want every model in this bitch 
Blow the check, these hoes wanna know just who I am 
Takin' pictures, trynna do it for they Instagram 
Presidential Roley, Benzel got them big boogers 
Fuck the home, shout-out to the real cookers 
Gold chains, couple Audemars and Cartiers 
We [?] ; these hoes know the party here 
Blowin' on that 
[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd] 
Blowin on that killa kill: neck on chilly-chill 
Baby, let me get a feel; show me that it's really real 
Bad bitch from Cashville, met her up in Club Live 
Don't care who you man is, long as he ain't up in here 
Ain't nothin' changed, still the same ol' two-step 
I don' had some A-1 hoes, and a few Fs 
I done order bottles, 100 bottles and got two left 
Somebody got bust upside the head, G-Unit there

Hol' up, I think I love these hoes

No suckers in my section 
Oh no, no, no, my shit legit 
You niggas get to flexin' 
Bitch and I will get ya hit

A nigga gettin' plenty bread 
Oyster perpetual 
You niggas know what time it is 
Dance like a b-boy 
Just like a d-boy 
Yeah, I'm a g, boy 
You know it's me, boy 
[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks] 
Uh, I think I'm gon' remain reclined and count 
So many girls, it take a hour for me to shout ‘em out 
The coupe foreign, the shit I hit been super borin' 
Dog, I'm sharp as hundreds with the blue tan on 'em 
Shit a phenomenon, I kept my promise 
Respect and honest, the grind bought off a neck of diamonds 
Shinin', plenty tried, don't got the timing 
Bet he out there island hopping 
And your lost still in the thousands 
[Verse 5: Tony Yayo] 
Bottles of Clickquos 
Smokin' hookah with eight hoes 
Five angel heads on my neck, all froze 
Inter vision, interpretations 
Watch with your ears 
I bought the last watch in the lear 
Ask Jacob, ask David, ask Eric the Jeweller 
Ask 'Beth in Jersey when I bought my first Muller 
I got 'em watchin' me 
With the yatch Master Rolly on 
In that new Rolls Royce with the top gone

Fuck the Police with an HIV carrier

I smoke lean and piss Louis the XIII

A crazy nigga he don't play tho

When all my niggas die

Fuck the police they killed Sean Bell 
Fuck the FEDS I still deal fishscale

You shootin back, but u ain't hittin

Baby you got, you got, you got, you got what I want 
Baby you got, you got, you got, you got what I need 
Now shake that thang 
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it up 
Girl shake that thang 
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it up 
[Chorus - 50 Cent] 
Baby you got 
Hips that hypnotize 
When you walk I can't help but watch you shake 
I love the way you shake (Baby you got) 
Hips that make a nigga fantasize 
I could spend a day lost in your eyes (Baby you got) 
Some kind of control on me 
Feels like you got a hold on me (Baby you got) 
My imagination running wild 
Infatuated with your physical, damn, I like your style 
[Verse 1 - 50 Cent] 
It's something about your style, it's something about your smile 
It's something about you making me want you right now 
If you don't like me, then don't listen to me 
Lord knows I spit that G that have you coming out your clothes 
I'm a professional when I become sexual 
You need a chaperone to bring your girlfriend next to you 
Don't it sound like phone sex, kinky, when I talk switch the slang 
Partner, tell that nigga from New York, shorty 
Come ride on my roller coaster 
Porn star stamina, I try not to damage ya 
Unlimited tongue action 'til you're climaxin' 
Foreplay, you can have it your way 
I follow directions, whoa, your jiggling baby 
Back shots have your whole back wiggling crazy 
After sipping on Nightrain, that potent pipe game 
I have you saying "slow down baby" 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 2 - Young Buck] 
Baby it's hard to look and don't touch 
Girl the way you strut and dressed in your fine dutch 
I don't know if it's your lips or your hips that got me 
Or the way that ass bounce when you move your body 
I'm parked outside in the blue Denali 
There's room for two, just me and you, if you 'bout it 
Ice from Tiffany and Co., Norma Kamali footwear 
I spend g's, I'm a G, that's a good look girl 
You need a thug that can handle that 
One dose'll make you go and put my name on your back 
Whenever you pass through, whatever they ask you 
Just tell em you my boo, and show em your tattoo, ooohh 
Don't hurt nobody baby 
When you drop to the ground and drive me crazy 
I done been around the world, and I finally found ya 
Now back that ass up and let me get behind ya (ahhh!) 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 3 - Lloyd Banks] 
Baby you've got a hell of a first impression 
Making me wanna ask you a personal question 
Like "Are you flexible?" and "How do you like it?" 
Give me a little input, I'm not a psychic 
Cuz you can exit as soon as you get the ok 
You got a body like the cold ray, hey 
I need a drink, I'll be right back 
But before I go, do that little dance, yeah, just like that 
It's late, I have to score, "This blue drink tastes good, don't it?" 
"Sure it does, now have some more" 
I'm deep, but she got her ladies wit her 
So bring em, I'll call ya a babysitter 
So we can hit the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn 
I'm contemplatin' how my time's spent 
Cuz I'm bent, and I'm as hard as a brick, love 
You move like you work in a strip club

Cause when you broke you can't afford to fuck ya sneakers up 
I take my time, keep my mind on my bank funds 
Learn how to seperate the real from the fake ones 
And on my heater nina rep what could I carry on 
My nigga just lost his momma, and his daddy gone 
From now on I can provide cause my paper's straight 
Family losin his legs, but I can take the weight 
Some niggaz hate but I'll be damned if they hold me down 
Front niggaz didn't know me then, bet they know me now 
Blunt and a smile, eventually it'll be a frown 
Cause every time I turn around a nigga locked down 
While I'm in the world, tryin to bring my loot through 
Hopin one day we can kick it like we used to, my nigga

Dre's beats 
Fuck you, pay me, take your magazine flicks 
This ain't no Nelly hurr, take a good look at this 
Got the wrists of a chemist and the heart of a hustler 
Plus I probably done robbed mo' artists than Russell 
Always in trouble, you can blame my mother 
Gave birth to a gorilla and raised him in the jungle 
I ain't crawled, I stumbled across the Mexican with birds 
Papi had coke and new plates and pounds of herb 
Keep my hand on my glock, and my ear to the streets 
I'm a country boi, you can hear it when I speak

I made a nigga heart colder than December (yeah!) 
Don't take much to make my gun go off 
One shot'll make a hardrock look oh so soft (woo!) 
If you don't know you betta ask who I be 
Or end up in Icu gettin fed through a Iv 
Down in the Lou', they say they feelin me derrty 
In New Orleans they say I'm that nigga, ya heard me? 
From them Southside blocks to Watts, Westside don't front 
You know about them Grapestreet Gangstas, G'd up 
Rollin that weed up

Hit with a bat or beat up

Next year it’s the new Hummer 
Stash box with the llama drive through in the blue data bomba 
Heaven or Hell will prevail when I’m a goner 
Cuz I Eat up tracks Like Hannibal and Dahma 
I’m the first one out, and last one on the corner 
This life is a hustle any day you be a goner 
P89 Ruger with the silence off 
Little clipper sellin’ spitballs goin’ through straws 
We got plenty of rap sheets but not on sale 
We even got dillingers that hold shotgun shells 
These rappers is talkin’ ‘bout bricks in they rhymes 
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes 
I don’t respect it my work is never watered down 
So on the first I get more checks than Nike town 
Swingin’ 31 Money’s I been on the block 
Since nigga’s did the snake runnin’ man in the walk 
When I was 15 I didn’t want no workin papers 
I worked the strip all night, servin’ niggers 
Listen nigga, We live like Italians in jail 
I got CO’s bringin’ cell phones to my cell 
Get rich in the game, niggas out to get you 
Fill you ass up with led turn yo’ ass to a pencil 
I jumped out with the Ruger rapid fire 
I had you on the run like Omar on the wire 
I’m the only rapper you know that stay on the run 
I’m the only rapper you know that stay with a gun 
I’m a hustla’ OG’s love to hate 
Cuz I got old school money put away in a safe 
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at 
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback 
I’m a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper 
Fuck judge wong he gon’ catch me on the corner 
Nigga make poor attacks, homie ya owe me 
You wanna rap we can battle for yo’ see through rollie 
I begin in a mansion stripin’ the models 
The bathroom’s so far you gotta piss in a bottle 
There’s too many Indians and not enough chiefs 
Why you buy all the gun’s if you ain’t got enough beef 
 
The shit I spit will cause an all out riot 
In my new 4 fifth will cause a hollow tip die 
Im the type to tie up your lady, gun butt your baby 
Im like the mob nigga fuck you pay me 
Im’a hide my assets, and disappear 
Make a quick 20 mil and vanish in thin air 
I’ve finished my work now its time to cop 
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggage spot 
I Need 12 12’s 
And 58 58’s 
Cuz I got 8 sales 
And they all gon’ wait motherfucka 
50 CENT: 
Yeah and it don’t stop, 
I do a 187 on yo’ motherfuckin block 
Yeah and it don’t quit, 
It’s G-Unit in yo’ motherfuckin’ ass bitch

Y'all niggas spend too much time watchin' flicks 
Who you wanna be? Tony Montana n shit? 
Well you can start, right before his ass get hit 
So when I walk up you can see the shotgun spit 
Ferrari roof go down, Lam doors go up 
I got big boy toys, when you gon' grow up? 
Nigga knick knack pattywack, give a dog a bone 
Im still down to sell crack got a fiends home 
God bless the child with a flawless flow 
Say gave a nigga the talent to push blow 
like a pimp watch a hoe, I watch the grams go 
Watch the stash grow, straight cash flow 
im a hundred time bigger than Preme in his prime 
100 mill in my account and Im still on the grind 
When you aint in my clique, its hard to shine 
I mean talent like this is so hard to find 
G-Unit! 
[Tony Yayo - Verse 2] 
I don't dream now that i'm livin, Im out to get it 
My truck bomb kitted an AK can hit it 
Im a rap tycoon, I was fly in the whom 
So Im gettin ass like a public bathroom 
I went from Rikers Island, to shows at the garden 
Automatic startin' in the drop got your bitch pussy fartin 
My album about to drop in 7 days 
But I still poke a rapper at the VMA's 
Kilo's in a gram, PO's be my fans 
That's why I'm overseas doin shows in Japan 
I got Gats from the future, see-through guns 
So when my bullets leave the chamber I can see you run 
Nigga I flip my advance before I ran through it 
Cuz that money turn haters into that barmen fluid 
My dope be a 8, from a 1 to 10 
Keepin in a cool place from Uncle Ben 
[Muder Mase - Verse 3] 
You know you messin' with a nigga that do this for a livin' 
Put two in the street while theres two in the kitchen 
Put guns in niggaz mouth like "Who's u dissin'?" 
We give for they knew who u was missin, nigga 
You can either have a gun at the chain, or one at the brain 
I have hoes back of the church, hummin' ya name 
Even then I feel it's like cheat my men 
Watch God leave the sky to come and greet my men 
I pop niggas in the chest they never breathe again 
Route 20 in the fitness see the streets again 
Whats a man tryna wake up who cant wake up? 
Back guards face straight up with kinds of make up 
Cuz eveyrtime I run, scream, pop a 3-80 
I hear a mother scream "Please not my baby!" 
Quick as I see its you, bullets will hit you, boy 
Your nobody so no one will miss you 
Queens start to kickin' its too much to get through 
Leave a nigga leakin' like an Indian ritual 
Who wanna run up on me they get known quick 
I blackout then snatch your chrome clique 
Leavin' jail in '91, made Im homesick 
Move Pow-Fu like a Farrakhan atonement 
Raised in, caged in, let my ways spin 
Face wrapped up like a Saudi Arabian 
[Young Buck - Verse 4] 
A country nigga still lookin' for a New York hoe 
About to kill these niggas with this New York flow 
Say one nigga name homie you gon' go 
You in that Hot97 so New York know 
I use to listen to Jada I've never listened to Joe 
I couldnt tell ya how now one of his verses go 
Seen Styles and Sheek out, doin promo 
I was like "What Up?" and they was like "Uh-Oh!" 
I aint just get cold, see my block been hot 
50 give me the word, niggas would have been pop 
Fuck a interview nigga I get into you nigga 
Enough hearin' 'bout what you finna do nigga 
[Prodigy - Verse 5] 
Murder at its best, this is rap at its finest 
You can see my verse, even if you the blindest 
My raps is vivid, ya bitch I hit it 
All ready, yeah that's right this is spaghetti 
Head mob niggas, my gun bomb niggas 
Go 'head and shoot, my pistol nuke niggas 
When I let off the whole Earth feel the effects 
I mix CD's and treat 'em like album shit 
Our albums, we treat 'em like the president elections 
On our champagne campaign livin' up dresses 
On the dance flo' the Hennessee it flow 
When you fuck with G-Unit then you gon' fuckin' blow 
When you fuck with Mobb Deep, then bring some fuckin' hoes 
Cuz its a gang of us and we ready to go 
Cuz after the party after the party we get so drunk 
We forget all about the next day hun 
[Havoc - Verse 6] 
Get it teflon don, AK-filled 
Get your mouth blown off like the hand that feeds you 
Yeah little motherfucker put the hammer in diesel 
G-Unit Game Over this is only a preview 
Niggas shittin' on theyself gotta rock in the huggy 
The coke in the pot rise to the top like dougy 
Got chicks with a ass like Buffy, yes homie trust me 
Plays fuck me, kick 'em out when they try to get touchy 
QB/Southside, if you wanted to Trestle 
Man your man is hot, you dont wanna get next to 
Like 50's beef is mine and mine is his 
See this serious, motherfuckin ask them kids 
Niggas wild on the streets, scared to death to bid 
Sell anything that stay from the bottles and cuffs, nigga butt 
[Billy Danze - Verse 7] 
You about to witness an M.O.P thug out 
And for you niggas hatin' listen to the sounds of the Unit kiss my ass with your tongue out, nigga 
Fuck a warden I ring bells like a doorman 
So all you motherfuckers take it easy like sunday mornin (Get 'em up!) 
Put 'em up, wrap ya hand or knuckle up 
Ground zero we never ran never will we fuck 'em up 
Dude you gonna get your ass banged fuckin' with that homie Lloyd Banks 
Wild gun style what the fuck y'all think.. 
[Lloyd Banks - Verse 8] 
Niggas aint got nuttin' on me, everybody know that 
Niggas run up on a V, everybody gon' clap 
And if he aint what he say, n everybody gon rats 
Just rat, and catch your little body all rats 
Matter'fact, I dont hang out with no lobby for rats (Nah) 
The gun swallow me back off Bacardi and Yack 
Im in the club with the snub, this the part of the track 
A stray from the K will take a part of ya hat 
Im gettin cake like you wouldnt believe but im accepted 
By mainstream America and good in the piece 
Now niggaz wanna talk all greasy (why) 
Like they aint used to open up for me in New York on tv (Ya know) 
Skip all chatter, and walk off Eazy 
A milly will make your body looker look all measly 
Ya bitch spotted me on the dolo and Im low-low 
Damn near broke a monolo for a photo 
I aint ridin' around with a Dodo that's a No-No 
Momma taught me better than that you go to go home 
Look at me now, a product of poverty 
I cant watch the way I gotta decide a me 
The 'hoods fulla hurt but that was a robbery 
Critics owe me an apologee, Im probably 
A sixteen away from the lottery 
My niggas keep guns, thats one of the things I gotta be 
Im wrapped up in a dome shit, cause nigga got all kinds of beef they want ya to come get 
Im 2 steppin' with my weapon, cause they dont check 'em up 
I know niggas from 'round there and they dont check us 
All of the niggas was fans when I met 'em, just waitin' in the wind for niggas to come and get 'em 
On my next album, Im'a have some fun wit' 'em, spank 'em all around so everybody forget 'em 
They Envy, cause I got the 'hood in a frenzy 
And I move smooth with the wooden Benzy 
Blend in, niggas will body ya for a pen 
Baby need food, baby momma need fin 
You know me, New York cap on 
Batman whip that I got off a rap song 
Im the fan with the illegal strap on 
Teflon n a wife beater n black on 
Its on!

Wassup? this the kid 50 Cent man 
Its going down, ya heard me? 
Niggas got me mad, ya talk, ya niggas got me all fucked up..

Everytime I'm in the kitchen, you in the kitchen 
Let me finish this brick, 'fore you put that fish in 
Listen, I know we just came from fishin 
But I'm on a mission, you see, there's money that I'm missin 
I got 'em posted, so the move and I'm gonna murder y'all 
You and all the trouble goin through by servin y'all 
And only cause my man heard of y'all 
Other than that, shit, y'all won't get served at all

I went from oodles and noodles to lobster and shrimp 
I went from bare bubble coats, to brand new minks 
And yo my neck upgraded, my wrist's upgraded 
I stay C of F, I ain't got time for Jacob 
I'm still on the strip, tryin to get my grims off 
Nigga tryin to flip and its a Mexican stand off 
I put a hole in your grill, with the nine mil 
Dressed in all black, lookin for souls to steal 
[Chorus] - 2X 
Little bit of dust, little bit of cocaine 
Little bit of dro, little bit of heroine 
A little bit of ecstacy 
That's why your bitch want to be next to me 
We sell a little bit a everything 
[Young Buck] 
I put the two Mags, up to your doo rag 
And rockaby baby, I'm in the blue Jag with new tags, in case you wanna chase 
I never knew that, the impact, comin up out a Desert Eagle 
A make a nigga wob and wiggle screamin call my people 
We got these fiends pourin liters, and they shootin needles 
Need to be takin your connection, cause we got it cheaper 
Shit I ain't new to this, I met this air stewardess 
Who knows the ins and outs on how to get it in and out, nigga 
[Lloyd Banks] 
Ya if I put a dress code all black, nine hows and a laser 
And the party is an ink pen, bottle, or a razor 
Your hollerin for praise ya, catch me in the hood with a model named Taysha 
And the swallow game major 
These cowards ain't gangsta, they tellin you lies by sellin you dreams 
And they ain't fill ins, they fiends 
Plus they rat, and it's too hot to chill in the sun 
My pops 39 years old, and still on the run

Wodie what you want, you want dope, you want coke 
Wodie what you want, you want X, you want dro 
Shit you got beef, I got a tec and a fo' 
You feelin' hot and moist, I even get you a ho 
If you don't got no whip, I get you a car 
If you don't got no skills, I get your some more 
My nigga we don't cut it, we serve it raw 
Got anythin you want, play us awful hard

My 22's bling, so niggaz scheme 
745i clean, this little shell nigga, fuck a triple beam 
Coffee pot to cook coke, Joe to smoke, I was born to loc 
Method cut the coke, 50 no joke 
I ain't "Scarface", no women, no kids, I don't give a fuck 
Better teach that bitch, and that little nigga to duck 
With a P-90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya 
If you survive you gonna feel what talent do to ya

I don't play around with you bombaclot 
Bring it you to you if you really want this 
My heart cold, I'll send you something hot

That shit got my brother shot 
Standing right in front of his mother's spot 
But that got about ten of them popped 
And last night another one of them dropped 
We don't do no peace treaties 
No backing down, no calling quits

They gon' patch him up like a slow leak 
Rest in peace to ezell, middle finger to the police 
Fuck y'all with no grease, no justice, no peace 
They did mike wrong like cochise ain't nobody getting no sleep 
Now they saying we ignant, buck is you rolling with me? 
My hoodie on like trayvon 
I'mma give zimmerman the business 
Where I go my niggas follow 
Hollow points thrown like a spiral 
It's go time, show time 
Get clapped like the apollo 
I'm trapped out like fuck y'all 
I'll abide by this gun law 
Unless you gon' do me like eric garner 
If you catch me smoking on my cigar 
Put my hands up and you pull your pistol 
Just because I'm a hood nigga 
This full clip gon' full flip you 
(I can't breathe) 
Once again, police beating up on people 
All he did was break up a fight and 
This is what happens for breaking up a fight 
This is a disgrace, there's a test in this city 
And we intend to keep the pressure off

Life can't be this

I either dump eat or sleep or snatch this purse

Yeah I know you niggas want me to get merked

call and see to the dome 
where lil' niggas don't get to see disney land 
they settle for a funeral home 
the only hoes that know that the leads hot 
prepared for anything tonight aslong as it's not a head shot 
the bigger the rim the bigger the tire 
hollow tips'll make it feel like a nigga on fire 
Everybody got to know it's the truth 
so i figure while i'm waitin on my turn i'ma blow up the booth 
I seen niggas in wheel chairs, eye patches and cruches 
arm slings that came home to train conductors 
we can roll it but need i shoot 
put some holes in your Fila suit

I play the hood all the time because I don't give a fuck!

Baby you got, you got, you got, you got what I want 
Baby you got, you got, you got, you got what I need 
Now shake that thang 
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it up 
Girl shake that thang 
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it up 
[Chorus - 50 Cent] 
Baby you got 
Hips that hypnotize 
When you walk I can't help but watch you shake 
I love the way you shake (Baby you got) 
Hips that make a nigga fantasize 
I could spend a day lost in your eyes (Baby you got) 
Some kind of control on me 
Feels like you got a hold on me (Baby you got) 
My imagination running wild 
Infatuated with your physical, damn, I like your style 
[Verse 1 - 50 Cent] 
It's something about your style, it's something about your smile 
It's something about you making me want you right now 
If you don't like me, then don't listen to me 
Lord knows I spit that G that have you coming out your clothes 
I'm a professional when I become sexual 
You need a chaperone to bring your girlfriend next to you 
Don't it sound like phone sex, kinky, when I talk switch the slang 
Partner, tell that nigga from New York, shorty 
Come ride on my roller coaster 
Porn star stamina, I try not to damage ya 
Unlimited tongue action 'til you're climaxin' 
Foreplay, you can have it your way 
I follow directions, whoa, your jiggling baby 
Back shots have your whole back wiggling crazy 
After sipping on Nightrain, that potent pipe game 
I have you saying "slow down baby" 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 2 - Young Buck] 
Baby it's hard to look and don't touch 
Girl the way you strut and dressed in your fine dutch 
I don't know if it's your lips or your hips that got me 
Or the way that ass bounce when you move your body 
I'm parked outside in the blue Denali 
There's room for two, just me and you, if you 'bout it 
Ice from Tiffany and Co., Norma Kamali footwear 
I spend g's, I'm a G, that's a good look girl 
You need a thug that can handle that 
One dose'll make you go and put my name on your back 
Whenever you pass through, whatever they ask you 
Just tell em you my boo, and show em your tattoo, ooohh 
Don't hurt nobody baby 
When you drop to the ground and drive me crazy 
I done been around the world, and I finally found ya 
Now back that ass up and let me get behind ya (ahhh!) 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 3 - Lloyd Banks] 
Baby you've got a hell of a first impression 
Making me wanna ask you a personal question 
Like "Are you flexible?" and "How do you like it?" 
Give me a little input, I'm not a psychic 
Cuz you can exit as soon as you get the ok 
You got a body like the cold ray, hey 
I need a drink, I'll be right back 
But before I go, do that little dance, yeah, just like that 
It's late, I have to score, "This blue drink tastes good, don't it?" 
"Sure it does, now have some more" 
I'm deep, but she got her ladies wit her 
So bring em, I'll call ya a babysitter 
So we can hit the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn 
I'm contemplatin' how my time's spent 
Cuz I'm bent, and I'm as hard as a brick, love 
You move like you work in a strip club

I ain't a wrestler, but I'll put your bitch the Boston crab 
I talk money cause it costs to brag 
Round here bitches walk around wit the hair that the horses had 
Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks 
I don't really like to exercise but I'll push up on a bitch 
Y'all sweet like ninety-nine bananas 
That's why I got ninety-nine niggaz wit ninety-nine hammers 
They all want a nigga to stop 
Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox 
I'm just a playa that found out where the coaches know 
That's why I'ma be around longer than the Oprah show 
You and your man y'all both should know 
That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go 
Shit I been hated since the fifth grade 
That's why my best friend the tray pound, a ice pick, and a switch blade

See where they rest at and lay with their peeps 
Now you got the drop, know their daily routine 
So the second rule please leave the crime scene please 
Third rule pick a day, fourth rule pick a time 
Fifth rule pick a fifth, sixth rule pick a nine 
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet 
So when the shootout you leave him six feet deep 
Eighth meet in a fast car with disguise 
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes 
Ninth rule don't say shit cause po-po listen 
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system 
And the tenth rule don't put a tag on a broken heart 
Just put a toe-tag on your mark 
And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend 
You better watch where you heading

Stones in my cross the size of your earrings

Better yet like nigga Bookers that made bail 
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot 
They got scared, "Cent got money," and I got shot 
You so much pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac 
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot 
What little niggaz say to 50 cent don't matter 
I'll fire shots at the chef and watch the sheeps scatter

You scared then get the fuck around me

All these bitches on my dick, same, old shit

to Pimp C, I'm the same, old pimp 
Fly over seven different time zones 
I got a big booty bitch up in shroom zone 
Got emergency blunts when I come home

Yeah, Malibu beaches, unlaced bikini bottoms 
Mo' money, mo' problems, fo' fo' will solve 'em 
Just every day I'm with a stank sip, 30 in the clip 
Riding through that Gaza Strip, kill a nigga quick 
Hit a nigga with my race car, Tony Yayo turn to Tony Stewart 
Rap niggas die over music 
 
[Verse 2: Young Buck] 
Just got this brand, new chopper and I'm dying to use it 
Dry snitching niggas testifying in their music 
I seen niggas last five minutes then they lose it 
Wrap the sheet around his neck, he said, "this time I couldn't do it" 
A platinum nigga in the penitentiary going, "do it" 
Put Prada on the prison yard, started getting to it 
Two zero's, six, six, nine, 'o seven five 
That's the number that they gave me when I arrived 
It's just another form of slavery that's in disguise 
To all my niggas locked up just trying to survive, I know why 
 
[Hook] 
 
[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd] 
I'm yelling money over bitches, money over everything 
Money got me everything, every watch, every chain 
Every brick, every whip, kicks with designer names 
I used to hustle Texas whose child I can claim 
Paid all my mama's bills so how can she complain? 
Call my bitches dimes, I treat 'em like loose change 
Call me Brian in the clutch, ballin' with my English brain 
No love, got it out the mud, my shirt ain't got a stain 
Iced out Rollie, three fingers reppin' Rida Gang 
Entire streets in the streets so them hoes know I came 
 
[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks] 
Ballin' on these hoes all the time 
You got your kids, don't need mine 
Word to my favorite design, my mama raised me to shine 
These C-notes play in my mind, they on rewind 
I am top five alive, I've been picked out by God 
I'm never not on my job, too hard to argue that 
Shining my records like, "where's my target at? " 
Came through your stereo, feel me charging back 
I owe you 15 bums for that 
Stains in the garden, hate when they all go black 
Cracks in the armor, this reach further than rap 
Before we start react, mob attack 
Stacks or don't call me, rain down 'til nobody standing 
Won't show no snipe for your army

Lloyd Banks 
You know cuz a nigga thuggin don't mean he don't wanna see you smile, baby. 
(50 Cent) 
We wanna be the reason you smile (3x) 
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes. 
(Lloyd Banks) 
I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge, 
From the conversations we havin', the way it ends. 
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends. 
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz. 
It all depends, maybe if we make amends we can start from scratch. 
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact. 
We plan to be platonic, but the heart's in tact. 
So everytime we separate somebody's marchin' back. 
Young May's and then the sack... 
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're Black. 
God bless whoever gave you all of that. 
If you've seen it from the back, you'd understand why they still like that. 
It ain't to Florida with tours, the Lord knows. 
The pussy good enough to miss award shows.... 
And I ain't gotta say nothing, she just knows 
By the way I lick her though to take her from her clothes up and down ooOOOOh.... 
(Chorus: Lloyd Banks and 50 Cent) 
Whenever I'm not around, and you're feeling down, let the thought of me be (the reason you smile) 
I don't wanna see you frown, make them kids watch and clown, I wanna bring you joy and be (the reason you smile) 
You leanin' on my style, you know how I get down, I'll provide by any means to be (the reason you smile) 
We done been through the ups and downs, and drama for a while, I'm just happy I'm around to be ( the reason you smile) 
(Lloyd Banks) 
The main reason that I been looking at you pitiful, 
With about half of the shit that I done did to you. 
Violated or tiptoed into a crib or two. 
I've complained to be a bigger individual. 
Even though they visible, the evenings when I visit you 
Kinda makes me feel lucky cuz I see niggaz when you teasin' with your physical, 
She wanna wreck up the rooms, I ain't got no more wind left 
Wild while on my section-made princess, my foreign chick bad but she bitchrest, 
Plus it's hard to communicate, cuz she don't speak in no ingles. 
I been around the world, state to state, but now I'm back 
Bustin' in your bathroom, got you laughing in your shower cap. 
Let's get it on, cuz I'm leaving in an hour flat. 
Really don't matter 
She's mad even when I holla back. 
All I really need is your attention for a while, and I bet you I can make you smile.

You leanin' on my style, you know how I get down, I'll provide by any means to be (the reason you smile) 
We done been through the ups and downs, and drama for a while, I'm just happy I'm around to be (the reason you smile) 
(50 Cent) 
We wanna be the reason you smile (3x) 
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes...</field>

No peace talks, no white flags 
No mercy, I'm gettin yo ass 
[50 Cent] 
Niggas done heard about my click how we stay wit the toastas 
Blood in, blood out, la kostra nostra 
You don't wanna bang wit the best 
I'll have Doc removin fragments from your chest 
They say God's a forgivin' man, I hope he forgive 
Thirty shells I let off don't curse my kid 
They say Fifty done blew up, Fifty you changed 
Nigga you stunt, I pull out 
And you see I'm that same nigga that when he start to roar 
I think he's flyin 
Eight outta eight on movin targets 
You run? You still dyin 
Check my resume, I am oh so loco 
Mama ain't raise no chump, I don't talk no pocco 
[Chorus - Lloyd Banks] 
Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me 
But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy 
Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin for it too 
Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks 
Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me 
But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy 
Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin for it too 
Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks 
[Young Buck] 
There once was some niggas that tried to murda me 
I hit em up, put em in plastic surgery 
This 4-5 has made a lot of guys apologize 
The truth come out, 'stead of hearin' a lot of lies 
Some niggas catch a case and then claim they hard 
A couple chest wounds will make a nigga change his heart 
I just play my part, and while you shootin up cars 
I'm smokin' niggas like a Cuban cigar 
Let's get it poppin' 
[Chorus - Lloyd Banks] 
[Lloyd Banks] 
I'm tired of you niggas with your maybe beef 
We gonna be here forever, you're temporary like baby teeth 
I'm in and out the night clubs, A-D-D 
Dark blue Benz, navy seats, eighty sneaks 
These niggas tellin' out the blue 
So you hang em off the bridge 
At least they'll have to helicopter you 
The Jimmy lived in the bags, the Bell or Hop will do 
I rap for the neighborhood niggas that failed in high school 
You can tell I came a long way in my sense, home grown 
That's why them little niggas in the projects love me 
You provide the beat downs for free, I paid my dues 
I don't even freestyle for free 
I gave em a break, flew over seas 
But it's kinda hard to get homie-sick when there's blue in the 
trees 
Sit back and try to play your role wit the copies 
I put more staples in yo ass than a telephone pole, Yea

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks] 
I come from a big city, the streets corrupt 
Now I'm rollin with snub-noses to heat you up 
Out here niggaz'll do anything to reach a buck 
Cause when you broke you can't afford to fuck ya sneakers up 
I take my time, keep my mind on my bank funds 
Learn how to seperate the real from the fake ones 
And on my heater nina rep what could I carry on 
My nigga just lost his momma, and his daddy gone 
From now on I can provide cause my paper's straight 
Family losin his legs, but I can take the weight 
Some niggaz hate but I'll be damned if they hold me down 
Front niggaz didn't know me then, bet they know me now 
Blunt and a smile, eventually it'll be a frown 
Cause every time I turn around a nigga locked down 
While I'm in the world, tryin to bring my loot through 
Hopin one day we can kick it like we used to, my nigga

G-Unit and Shady, them dudes is crazy 
Next time, we only usin Dr 
Dre's beats 
Fuck you, pay me, take your magazine flicks 
This ain't no Nelly hurr, take a good look at this 
Got the wrists of a chemist and the heart of a hustler 
Plus I probably done robbed mo' artists than Russell 
Always in trouble, you can blame my mother 
Gave birth to a gorilla and raised him in the jungle 
I ain't crawled, I stumbled across the Mexican with birds 
Papi had coke and new plates and pounds of herb 
Keep my hand on my glock, and my ear to the streets 
I'm a country boi, you can hear it when I speak

[Verse Three: 50 Cent] 
Bentley is all dreams, G-5 is understood 
I made a nigga heart colder than December (yeah!) 
Don't take much to make my gun go off 
One shot'll make a hardrock look oh so soft (woo!) 
If you don't know you betta ask who I be 
Or end up in Icu gettin fed through a Iv 
Down in the Lou', they say they feelin me derrty 
In New Orleans they say I'm that nigga, ya heard me? 
From them Southside blocks to Watts, Westside don't front 
You know about them Grapestreet Gangstas, G'd up 
Rollin that weed up 
Nigga get outta line, get shot stabbed jacked 
Hit with a bat or beat up 
Fuck that, we're on that same bullshit 
Same forty-cally glock, same full clip 
Pussy claat bwoy, ya nah wanna tak wif me

To all living things around me 
Cash rules everything around me 
Your music is unenthusiastic 
My jewelry glow in the dark 
Scorpio from serbia, catch you in traffic 
20-Round clip, curved magazine 
And you could leave the earth over small, little things 
John gotti hit the cake, go bada bing 
And you ain't do shit when them things start to ring 
South side, we outside, niggas kill, son 
They'll seattle seahawk you, throwing bullets like wilson 
White sheets cover his feet, ku klux klan'ed your man 
Left him in the streets, strap in his left hand 
The thought of even coming around here was a death plan 
And if a nigga cosign that he a "yes man" 
Shoot the fuck out of a fuck nigga, I'm all fucked up 
So loser, I lose, the dice game getting stuck up 
When shit real you get killed around here, it's not a big deal 
Load her out, nigga, use my big bitch for a shield 
(You know I'm saying?) thank you for real 
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy 
When your mouth to be shooting 
You find out that we been shooting all along 
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy 
You get caught without that ruger 
We put hot shit through you then we gone 
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy

La reid with the dope, son, jimmy iovine with the coke, son 
Wise time fly by, I'm an og, bad bitch with double d's 
Nigga, jordan couldn't palm these, feel the breeze 
Wrap 'em in satin, they be gone by the morning 
Federal subpoenas while swats kick the doors in 
Fuck up the sheets, the electric tapes to your door though 
I show that bitch how to breathe under water 
Excuse moi, french bitches bending over 
Snatch 'em out the whip, throw 'em in the range rover 
Snitches and phones, catch the 30 piece from the jewelry 
[?] Why they texting 'bout [?] body 
Frank lucas put flowers on bunk graves every tuesday 
That's loyalty and don't listen to everything your lawyer say 
Red dot, surgery with the laser 
Have a nigga missing like that plane from malaysia 
Fo' fo's, long nose is gonzo's 
Hundred rounds, drum on the k, that's bongos 
Running your mouth with deadly convos, I clap like, "bravo" 
Bend back for the I call, nigga, huh 
You pussy niggas think you got nine lives 
I'mma make sure I stick you more than nine times 
With that ice pick I'm a cold killer

And I don't fuck with rappers, bein' honest

For the crime you standing on and walking on is getting poise 
Plus the Cadillac's we pimpin so slightly you been slippin 
On really how it goes when these ties begin to grippin 
And shiftin and whole takin to the spot where hoes shakin

And pimp fool like niggaz with gataz without no chaperone 
So see, we been doing this from way back long

Ride a 'Lac like a true playa 'posed to do 
Old school, slant back with a jigga too 
Tan gold wit some bows like a poster boo 
Old school, gold chain, still grippin the grain 
Show a crease in my jeans, stay ahead of the game 
Got a, piece on my grill, diamonds off in the back 
And got so many hoes had to change up my 'Lac 
All day I don't know how to act 
Got this game down pat, sure be running the track 
Get some money from these hoes and see how they react 
Show 'em how a real nigga come down like that

Pitch me a few dollars, more than sure you can 
When you balling the world's on your shoulder pads 
I don't owe you nothing, they busting, you ain't bang back 
You never fronted me nothing I couldn't bring back

I can't help but win, I'm a winner, nigga, you changed on me 
They say family's first, but family is the first to get you hurt 
And these hoes even worse, all these riches is a gift 
And a curse 
Hate running all through the tree, thought they be rooting for me 
Backstabbing, lies stacking, the truth is gorey 
Forever holding on the grudges from my early struggles 
They see you go out and get it then want it from you 
Say you'll never be a winner, show up at your parade 
Outside showing you smiles, inside hoping it fades 
Rather be low now, money over the stage 
Sanity over fame, eye-candy calling your name 
But it changes, their love is dangerous 
Fog up your aim, there's a million ways to hit them cages 
Shit's contagious, forget my favors 
I'm outta here, flipping pages 
You slipping backwards going with all the other actors 
The limelight is hot, I ain't ask to be here 
The money and the power make problems disappear 
People change like the weather 
I weather the storm until it's better 
And these fake ass niggas wanna shake my hand 
Instagram hoes backstage with fans 
And the snakes in the grass ain't a part of my plan 
Stab me in my back and they say I changed

Tears of joys heal a real mccoy 
Bury your worries, don't wonder who rides for ya 
Know yourself, relax and study 
Bloody your uniform, no rest, keep moving on 
Anybody who do you wrong, wrong turn, it's on 
Somebody chain got took, somebody life got lost 
Somebody water not working, somebody lights cut off 
I watched my partner od in '03 in front of me 
Took the plea, went on a spree, damn near did the whole ki 
Paranoid, nose dirty, 'bout to go for them thirty 
You keep saying he's hurting, now all his homies is worried 
Second-guessing this gangster, they don't know what he said 
They don't know what he told, but now you know that he dead 
I'm in them trenches like I'm a marine sniper in his gillie suit 
Hk, sk, turn niggas vegetable 
Live past 22 like climbing mount everest with one shoe or flip-flop 
Middle finger to the opp' 
Bacon, egg and cheese at my clip from last night 
Smoking, think about that drama from last night 
Emotion in your mind, love and hate cause casualty 
These old dogs wack in that cave mentality 
Dope boy salary, block ground athlete 
Move so much weight I lost a couple calories 
The palms sells the size of deep batteries 
Get hit like jay rock when that fat nigga squeeze 
My homie kenny booth doing life over 8 racks 
He broke down in court when they played the tape back 
I'm from mazant, 6 shots, I ate that 
Now I won't pay back, let my kids slay that</field>

Whoop! Whoop! Throw up ya hands to it 
Go head, call em pops 
(Chorus-Lloyd Banks) 
Girl whats it gon take to have you close to me 
Right by my side where you supposed to be 
They start to notice you when they notice me 
And you can have it all free of charge 
I know you like European cars 
Take, Take a look at my garage 
Make, Make we can a-menage 
Me in the middle and your legs to the stars 
(50 Cent) 
I got that Bentley, that Ferrari, that Lambo lean 
My car game crazy, I can't be seen 
That Aston, Bugatti, the Range and the Rolls 
Got me freakin off with some high class hoes 
You know with me man anything goes 
I'll have shorty in the telly workin all 3 holes 
Jesus, I betcha won't believe this 
Unless I letcha see this, she deepthroat my whole car 
Now I'm thinkin this bitch is so hot 
I gotta take her to my hood, let her blow my whole block 
Yeah I just happen to be what she like 
She say I'm special, I'm like, "Yeah babe you're right" 
A lil Goose, a lil Patron tonight 
I'll have the club lookin like a fuckin Zoo aight 
New music, you can't confuse it 
With the other cliques or groups, its the Unit 
(Chorus) 
(Lloyd Banks) 
Uh, Shorty came over, I told her, I can mold her 
Turn her, to a rider, rollin, with a roller 
Hold her, like a cobra, bone her, til she sober 
Fold her, in positions til its hard to bend over 
I'm a very special kind, I can't let you shine 
These rappers out they mind, don't compare to me combined 
If you look at my design, my Louie fittin fine 
My jewelry might blind, I'ma walkin white line 
You can't get on my level, that'll take a lifetime 
And I got it at 25, take your lifetime 
I don't care about crime as long as its not mine 
I'ma be fine, I'm stronger than white lines(?) 
If your girl ain't home, til the early morn 
She's prolly with the G-Unit gettin in on 
I told her she's Miss Right, so I can't be wrong 
And we went at it all night long 
(Chorus) 
(Tony Yayo) 
From 1 to 10, baby girl off the Richter 
But I ain't trickin, I ain't Eliot Spitzer 
Shake that ass, drop it low like a stripper 
Shake that ass, drop it low like a stripper 
I'm in the club again, with them drugs again 
Same club, same spot, same girls again 
Girls comin in, and we poppin dem bottles 
By 12 O'clock, we be poppin dem models 
Yeah, Falsetto, the club go crazy like,"OOH! OOH! OOH! Baby!" 
Okay, bottle Rozay, girlie seen the Porsche and her friend like,"Heyyy"

Thought he was locked up 
Came thru stuntin' wit his wrist all rocked up 
Shoulda seen him smile, missin' the tooth 
Coupe missin the roof 
He like "what up, 50?" 
I'm like "what up with you" 
Lance had a reputation that was well earned 
Heard he taught niggas how them shells burn 
Out there in red firm 
At the dice game, he rolled ahead, crapped in the crack 
I'm like "nah, i ain't paying for that!nigga, shoot it back" 
Niggas lookin at me like i'm crazy, they shook 
I don't give a fuck who he shot out in red hook 
Asked him about ???? 
Yeah, bizzy was my man till he beat me for ten grand and sold my mac for 
Seven grand (fuckin' crazy) 
The man was crazy i could tell by his look

This jamaica stars, cream dreams, my paper large 
Had to erase all loss, propellers, I'm taking off 
Steaming potent, I'm illegal rowing 
My holy flow keep the demons folding

Racks on me in this whole-in-the-wall club with 100 packs on me 
Got the goons out, you know we don't do much 
Catch you coming out the club if you doing too much 
Couple cubans on my neck, smoking a cuban on the jet 
On my way to collect from niggas that's losing bets 
Joe pesci, baby, I enforce the rules 
Take two's and tighten up niggas with loose screws 
Your bitch wanna be my bitch 
She saying we friends, I done fucked her again

Watch a nigga come up, watch a nigga come up 
Feels like hawaii going through this car wash 
Get the foreign, you know I gotta get the boss 
Ar green beamer size of kevin hart 
These 22 jump street niggas talk 
Watch a nigga come up off this trap phone 
Cold jeans hold the coke five flex roam 
In the clouds care less about the chit chatter 
Bad bitches don't fuck these soundcloud rappers 
One, two, buck 'em out them seven shoes 
Pockets full of revenue, kitchen filled of residue 
Pitching on the avenue, million dollar attitude 
Fuck you, pay me, I don't show gratitude 
Told that ho bring it back, rewind it

Half of chicken whole chicken

Hookin' up my niggas daily with this dope 
Get out and get some, nigga

Let a nigga hang himself just give him enough rope

Out with some bitches, fiends wanna call 
In the club with my niggas, fiends wanna call 
When I'm waitin' on them, man they never call 
The life of a hustler in a nutshell 
G-5 eatin' snakes, soup and raw fish 
Snakes see the ray phantom off of raw fish 
My main bitch is like bonnie parker 
My side bitch is like clyde barrow 
They start to shoot you up shit's creek without a paddle 
They roll up and smoke you like kumar and harold 
Catch 'em in the whip like caine cousin, harold

Half of these hoes never rode in a phantom 
We be doing the thing, girl, hope you don't change, girl 
Maybe one day I might get you and my main girl 
Tequilla shots, got her taking off her top 
Make that ass pop, I'mma drink this bottle to the last drop 
I got bands, baby, dance like a mascot 
You can hit me up, I done moved from the last spot 
Don't tell your baby father shit 
He worried about getting lit 
Them other women can't outclass you 
Celine bag with the tassels 
Pretty face and she got some ass too 
High heels, pills and potions 
Wrists [?] get the dutches, we smoking 
I'm a starver for my southside chicks 
But please don't run your lips about no side nigga dick 
Money too long, it don't matter, but it measures 
You ain't in my good look, we just look better 
Gotta keep it on the low though, don't tell 'em 
He ain't cuffing you like a convicted felon 
Said she wanna groove back like stella 
No one could do it better, k

She beautiful, she bella, homie, don't sweat her, let her 
She was like that when you met her 
Rg, goodfellas, let's go 
(Don't tell 'em) 
You don't really care right? Say it like you mean it 
Later on you're sneaking, behavior going indecent 
No holding back, ain't got no reason 
Middle of the summer and I'm out here freezing 
Please and all of the above 
Girl, don't tell that nigga nothing, play it cool 
He accusing you, just say it wasn't another fool

Gotta do my own addiction in the v inhaling chocolate 
Spit the sickest flow, the inscription clips are hard narcotic 
Money standing by the hobbit 
We managed, ran back out of product 
The hottest topic, killing shit, don't know how to stop it 
The pie is lit, you ho for chromo you a bozo really

if you see a nigga with me then theres more than one gun, 
five straight soldier ain't that tired of being the dumb one, 
or even satisfied being another niggas dun-dun, 
we all know friendships turn sour when you gettin it,

Came from the country, dirty south get it nigga, 
Feds tryin to question me, they run up in my hotel, 
they said there wasn't shootin', but they found no shells, 
New york city, hell they throwin' niggas under jails, 
I got love for them and i ain't even from there, 
Now bust a shot for them boys on the block, 
I can feel your pain nigga, 
I'm still in the game nigga, 
There somethin' bout the sound of a trey-pound, 
That make me pull up, hop out and make a nigga lay down, 
See every time we round' ya hear some shots go off, 
And niggas get there chains snatched when they try and show off, 
Shoot outs in broad day we do it the mob way, 
And come to find out these niggas is softer than shawty, 
I'mma keep livin my life with a pistol in my palm and a wrist full of ice, 
you can call me the don.

I got a hand gun habit, nigga front i'll let ya have it, 
When the shots go off cops sayin 50 back at it, 
I'm alergic to the feathers on these bird ass niggas, 
Front and i'll put ya brains on that curbed fence nigga, 
I ain't a marksman my spark and i'll spray shit, 
Enough rounds for the Hk i don't play bitch, 
Move like i'm militant back on that gorilla shit, 
Moody, disrespectful, i'm ruley but niggas can't move me, 
I squeeze till i run outta ammo, if it's a problem it's handled, 
I'll have your people pourin' out liquor and lightin' candles, 
You fuck around i'll blow your brains on my new york times, 
Run home turn to the sports section and read your mind, 
It's crystal clear you should feel when that gat bust, 
First it's crime scene tape then you end up in that black hurst, 
We don't go to funerals but we'll go to your wake fam, 
View your body all banged up, you made a mistake man.

And shorty layin on her back while you blowin tro, so dont

[Verse One: Young Buck] 
You never know when death's comin, all you hear is gunshots 
Lil' kids get to runnin, old ladies get off the block 
When the poppin the truck music comes to a stop 
Niggaz get on the floor with they front doors locked 
Syringes and sirens the only thing on the street 
People act like they don't know who did it, but they notice me 
Every day's a death threat, but I ain't dead yet 
So I go put a hole in a nigga from the next set 
Don't know where I slept at, just know where my tec at 
It's the first of the month, my bitch ain't got her check yet 
Juvie left me in California, I don't respect that 
I love him too much to beef, so I'ma accept that 
But I'ma just step back, and focus on Buck 
Tired of ridin in yours, I'm bout to buy my own truck 
Got to try my own luck, "Get Rich or Die Tryin'" 
It's G-Unit 'til I'm gone, Lord knows I ain't lyin niggaz 
[Chorus: 50 Cent - repeat 2X] 
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand 
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand 
When times get hard and shit hits the fan 
God don't walk with me, he carry me man 
[Verse Two: Young Buck] 
You don't know what I been through to get what I done got 
If you looked through a scope, you couldn't hit what I done shot 
Couldn't flip what I done copped, couldn't tip what I done topped 
I murder you all-talk like a clip without a glock 
When you holla G-Unit on some other shit 
You need to do the research, and see who you fuckin wit 
I smoke all your weed up, go run up your Beeza 
Your baby momma want me, I don't want that skeeza 
She's scratched my Beema, but I ain't seen-her 
When I catch the bitch, I'ma gangsta lean-her - WHOA 
We be playin in them videos, with them pretty hoes 
Cash bucks and the key bitches and New York City hoes 
They learned it from Lil' Kim to let they titties show 
I'm the King of the South, this is how it really goes 
Lord knows, I keep all my jewels froze 
As long as the check come, then FUCK the award shows 
You know me nigga 
[Chorus] 
[Verse Three: Young Buck] 
Half of these kids never read the Bibles 
But they can tell you how to kill a man better than I do 
The reason they fucked up, they all been lied to 
I know what it feels like when a nigga misguide you 
My momma stay in the projects and I been havin money 
I went bought her a house, but she told me she ain't want it 
(What?) Right then I understood that the hood's in my blood 
So I hollered CASH REAL, lettin 'em know where I'm from 
Niggaz know I got a gun when I come to the club 
And if it go down, you better tell your people to duck 
Why should I slow down, I just got started targettin artists 
Wait 'til the bullets start hoppin out the cartridge 
I come to get it poppin, pray to God the news watchin 
So when they see 'em snitch niggaz'll know who got 'em 
We came from the bottom to the top, from hoopties to a drop 
And kill or be killed is the attitude I got nigga 
[Chorus] 
[Young Buck] 
I know you prayin I get killed nigga 
He who fears death is in denial 
50 told you niggaz, Young Buck showed you niggaz

This buck, cashville, y'all know 
Uh, way back in the day 
Deep, deep down south 
Where the nigga had a lil pack of yay 
Cause the nigga with the big ak 
Tryna rob everybody round here where I stay 
Back then I was at your house party 
Had your little sister on the walk in loose 
Pour a little hen in the punch in the juice 
Used to take a one on one back 
Then for a boost 
Couldn't step in the booth 
Talk that shit 
Nigga had to know you was the truth 
Couldn't lie what your life bout 
Had to tell these folk 
What you really gon' do 
The rap game on some other shit 
They ain't tellin' what they doin' 
Tellin' what they gon' do 
Get caught up with a couple bricks 
And guess what nigga, they tellin' on you 
See I'm still on this scarface shit 
Gotta kill these niggas, you tellin' on who? 
I can't just turn my back on the trap 
I'm out here sellin' it too 
I'm connected all in cali 
Pounds of the kush, we lettin' it through 
And a nigga tryna spread the love 
So what y'all niggas really ready to do? 
I'm just tryna bring it 
Back to the master p days 
Make the pot say, ughh 
Make the pot say, ughh 
I can bring it back like, ughh 
I'm just tryna bring it 
Back to the master p days 
Make the pot say, ughh 
Make the pot say, ughh 
I can bring it back like, ughh 
You bout it? yeah 
I'm bout it, bout it, you know 
Ay where you from homie? 
You know that dirty south gangsta shit 
Ay put your hood up 
I represent, it's g-unit gang 
Country nigga all in queens sellin' cocaine 
I fuck that white girl, I push that dog food 
I know ways to make sure 
We get it all through 
I fuck with gang members 
That's gon' die about it 
I fuck with lean sippers 
That's gon' die without it 
You got it? cause I got it, got it 
I roll with the windows up, cloudy, cloudy 
Shit chill, I got bricks here 
Sellin' dope out the house and I live there 
So many came to the south think I kill here 
I'm just tryna figure out why I'm still here 
Ay let me hit that 
I'm bout to elevate, elevation 
Tryna elevate on you niggas 
Switchin' positions in this (?) 
I'm all in tucson 
Tryna meet this cuban 
He not the plug but he said he knew some 
You're gonna have to keep your mouth closed 
If I let you come 
If I get you this I'm gon' have 
To kill ya if you run 
Posted in the front of the church 
Pew with two guns 
Prayin' that the lord 
Let me make it through with these 2 tons 
Knowin' niggas with me just 
To see if I give you one 
Funny how when you get rich niggas 
Think that you dumb 
Where you from? 
Where I'm from murder's always the outcome 
Your strap is like your everything 
You can't leave home without one 
Man they got me puttin' 
My gun in the hand of my son 
Somebody come in this house 
Then y'all gon' see what I done 
Why I'm keepin' so much reefer 
Now in my lungs 
I tell 'em I've been pitchin' 
On probation for the last three years 
Yes memph we hot right now, yes we is 
Is 2pac missed nigga? yes he is 
Hey man I never seen 
Seen so many people this point 
Man in my life homie 
I'm one of those people 
It's all the real niggas 
That's not here no more 
Rest in peace 
First you here, before you know it 
It's too late y'all 
Close your eyes then you think 
About nate dogg 
Lil flat, lord infamous, they died real 
Dj screw, fat pat, pimp c died trill 
Soulja slim, doe b 
Now all the ladies drop left eye left tear 
Big pun, biggie smalls, a$ap yams too 
Eazy-e, odb, man this can't be true 
Gang starr, mac dre, jam master j 
Heavy d, slim dunk, and he was from the a 
Static nature, lil wayne had him on his way 
Lil snupe, I seen him with meek 
Just the other day 
It's okay y'all the truth here 
I know eminem feelin' like me 
We wish proof was here 
Obituary like a souvenir 
We just look at 'em 
And reminisce about when you was here 
Somebody pour up, yeah

Purp they got out here right now

But I can't pay for that fake shit 
Don't know what's that in your sprite 
Woah purp niggas make me sick

            <field name="lyrics">[50 Cent - Talking from Lloyd Banks] 
Yeah, niggas talking all that gangsta shit 
Acting like my money ain't no good in the hood, you know what I mean? 
Fucking head blown off nigga, you know? 
[Chorus x5] 
They, they talking that 
That gangsta shit 
They ain't about that 
Man, matter of fact 
Hand me my strap 
Show me where they at 
I'll stop 'em from talking like that 
[50 Cent] 
I'm the talk to hit every barbershop and beauty salon 
Cause these other niggas that rap ain't on the shit that I'm on 
Cause 50 this, 50 that, 50 stay with a gat 
Thirty-two shots in the clip, hollow tips in the Mack 
But when I come through, shh.. 
the talking stop 
My money long now, I can make the Pope get shot 
Now, we can blow an hour talking bout the stones I rock 
All the hoes I got, cause he stunts in the drop 
Now, naw, you love the kids, 50 on that killa shit 
That been mobbed the bad man, bitchy as guerilla shit 
I'm marking my music like diesel on the block 
So if you with me you gon' eat and you gon' starve if you not 
Weed smokers love me like they love Buddha 
I'll send your kids through the shooter, Crip niggas love me like they love Hoova 
They tell me see careful good, cause niggas wanna see like you 
They ain't used to a G like you, BLAM! 
[Chorus] 
[Young Buck] 
You think you a killer but we gon just pay 'em a visit 
Put the potato in the barrel so nobody hear it 
I keep a holster on my shoulder like I'm John Wayne 
Shooting these niggas lights out like Lebron James 
Holla my name, gimme a reason to see you bleeding 
After you feel these hollow tips, nigga, then we eating 
Full of anger until there's no more bullets in the chamber 
Ain't nothing like when you get popped and don't know who to blame-a 
Nigga told me, "Do your dirt all by your lonely" 
So I go hit them niggas 'fore 50 couldn't even hold me 
I'm waiting, anticipating to put a nigga under 
Smoking like we some Jamaicans fucking with this ganja 
Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must 
Bad as I want to, some shit I just don't discuss 
So point him out and watch how I knock him off 
Everywhere you bitches go, I got a nigga watching ya'll, motherfuckers! 
[Chorusx8] 
[Lloyd Banks] 
Come on, nigga, I ain't here to make no friends, just cut the checks 
I got a long pump that'll put your stupid ass up in steps 
Begging niggas don't understand though 
Probably cause my hand glow when I'm anticipating the lambo 
Lean out my bucket for niggas thinking they Rambo 
You get one warning so I suggest you let your man know 
These rap niggas portray to be tough, nobody acting soft 
'Til they laid out in the hospital, eating applesauce 
Usually for yapping off and turn apologetic 
Waving a white flag, the danger they might have 
My niggas buying so much ammo 
If you reach in the couch for loose change, you'll probably feel on the handle 
Holding sixteens to get your bandages and broke bones 
So I suggest you get alarm systems in both homes 
There's only one team on top, we number one with a glock 
Fuck around and get your dumb ass SHOT!

You gotta love it 
(You got to be good to me) 
Yea you gotta figure out how to make me feel special 
(I'm going be good to you) 
And I'll be good to you 
I'll treat you how you need to be treated 
(You got to be good to me) 
You got to be all I need you to be baby 
(I'm going be good to you) 
And I'll make you feel like OHH MY GOD 
[50 Cent:] 
I'm a 360 nigga, 730 all the way dirty 
I got that burner on me now, you heard me 
Tasted the good life twice, rap and shooting dice 
Hell naw, I ain't put my head between her legs 
Smelled like a philly wood grain 
Bitch I'm balling, in a Bentley continental see bitch I'm hauling 
You got to want to win like I want to win and do things my way 
If not I'll put your ass out on the highway 
I'm a bad judge of character, I know that shit 
Man time don't fly when you fuck with the wrong bitch 
I mean damn why you come to me bitch 
What you want from me bitch 
You're like the boogey man, your haunting me bitch 
I give you money, you spend that, and come back 
Like you need a new stack 
I'm puzzled now, how the fuck you blow that 
You got a nigga on the side, well you should have him full time 
Go fuck up his shit instead of mine 
[50 Cent:] 
Go get, punk bitch 
(You got to be good to me) 
I don't need you round here, no way 
A mufuckin headache, you understand what I'm saying 
(I'm going be good to you) 
Look my motherfucking head hurts right now cause of your punk ass 
Bitch, why don't you find something constructive to do 
(You got to be good to me) 
You know, KILL YOUSELF 
G-Go on kill yourself 
(I'm going be good to you) 
Go on to the bathroom, open the cabinet, and eat the pills 
[Lloyd Banks:] 
She loves you when your paper thick 
It looks like your making it 
In and out the town fresh, Audi R8'ing it 
Freak fest, south beach, mardi gras taping it 
In the club balling on my party hard take and shit 
V.I.P.'ing on her, you ain't even got a place to sit 
Smoking piff, you'll cough, every time you take a hit 
Well mama got me stuck, look how she shake her hip 
She ain't used to this shit but I'm a make it fit 
She wants a sex drive, she wants a new one 
I'll do you one better, I won't cum 'til you cum 
A joint account'll turn one bum to two bums 
Dealing with a chick that can't even walk and chew gum 
Money don't solve the problems, it prolongs it 
You don't want things to get better, you just want shit 
Ain't nobody happy bout me and you, they all sick 
Bitch you had swagger, but mine reinforced it 
Everything you had lost it 
[50 Cent:] 
Man, you should be happy you got rid of that bitch man 
(You got to be good to me) 
She wasn't even worth the shoes she walked out in 
(I'm going be good to you) 
I know you want the mufucking shoes back 
Them mufuckers were hot man 
I ain't going to front 
Fin' tell my bitch 
(You got to be good to me) 
"Man you need to get you a pair of those shoes man, Banks said those things looking good" 
(I'm going be good to you) 
I'm a real nigga, Tonys that bitch nigga, how much money you got nigga 
[Tony Yayo:] 
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's super nigga 
With 5 acres and a mule and the coupe is bigger 
You gone trip on that hoe, you a stupid nigga 
I'm a P.I.M.P 
not cupid nigga 
Hoe pimping all day bitch, this ain't a hobby 
My name Tony, not Paul McCartney 
I'm in a 7 star suite, Dutchin' my haze 
Remote in my hand, model bitch on my mate 
Baby girl want Chloe and Fende spars 
She wants to fly to L.A 
and live like a star 
She wants to eat lobster and caviar 
But we eat Burger King and we fuck in the car 
I'll be far from your friend and your lover 
I hit a bitch off, drop her off, and burn rubber 
Pull out the rubber, can't get a dime, it's bad enough Uncle Sam trying to take mine 
Shiiiiiiitttttttt 
[50 Cent:] 
Damn nigga, a bitch can't even get a pair of shoes 
(You got to be good to me) 
Man you ain't going to be able to keep no bitch like that man 
(I'm going be good to you) 
I'll tell you, I started out the same way 
I mean even in the projects 
(You got to be good to me) 
Bitch didn't pay attention for all that 
Know what I'm talking about 
(I'm going be good to you) 
I started out like that too 
Now I buy 'em whatever they want

Ya, let's take em back 
Uh huh 
Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl 
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world 
Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies 
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody 
I wanna live good, so should I sell dope for a 
fo-finger ring 
Money and them gold ropes 
Santa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat 
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd 
be dope 
Tossed and turned in my sleep at night 
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike 
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the

I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I 
could

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top 
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top 
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop 
Go head' envy me

On the grill of my lowrider 
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires 
I'll fo-five em 
Kill a nigga on my song but really do it 
Thats the true meaning of a ghostwriter 
10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces 
Believe you me homie i know all bout losses 
I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious 
One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy 
I stay strapped like car seats 
Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his 
Barkley's 
That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you 
try me for my Air Max 95s 
Told Banks when i met him imma ride 
And if I gotta die rather homicide 
I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died 
Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on 
See how time fly? 
[Chorus - 50 Cent] 
From the beginnin to the end 
Losers lose, winners win 
This is real we ain't got to pretend 
The cold world that we in 
Is full of pressure and pain 
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game 
[Game] 
Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench 
Now i'm fuckin with 5-0 it's all startin to make 
sense 
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent 
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz 
Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range 
Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes 
When there's kids starvin 
Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the 
garbage 
I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin 
No school books they use that wood to build coffins 
Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted 
I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion 
I love ya Ma'

Heard a nigga will trick it, pick it 
Up after we throw it, throw it

That gangsta shit, we did it, get it 
Still do; we ain't new to it 
Boy, I ain't never gon' tell on me 
You bitch nigga, bet you do 
You talk a lot 
Niggas around here don't say much 
Niggas around here don't play much 
Soon as shit pop, they blame us 
Cause the money ain't never go'n' change us 
A lot of gun talk in the streets 
But real recognize real beef 
And real soldiers get the mission accomplished 
Never slippin', steady grippin', killin' for nonsense 
Sideline hatin', backbitin haters

Go 'head, ask me what I'm ridin in so I can say the Enzo 
My bitch roll down the window so I could feel the wind blow 
Got big enough for me to fiddle on my kinfolk 
Bitches with me cruisin, Moulin Rouge and 
They fuckin and they strippin nigga, I ain't even trippin nigga 
Me I handle business; God's my only witness 
Watchin homicide, sayin "Who the fuck did this?" 
Me I run the street mayne, so I keep the heat mayne 
Sews what you reap, when you fuck with the elite mayne 
I don't fuck around boy; you better ask around boy 
I hit you with the pound, leave yo' ass on the ground 
For, you poppin that bullshit, like I don't pull shit 
Fully loaded clips and whips, get the grip, clip the bricks 
Nigga we hittin licks, stickin shit, gettin rich 
That's why my name ring bells all around this bitch 
Any hood you go through they know 50 Cent (wooo-oooh!) 
And I don't wanna talk about it (OHH!) 
[Chorus] 
[Tony Yayo] 
Yeah, it's the kid nigga, yeah 
Aiyyo, big money, my car got the big face (yeah!) 
Forty-five, my belt got the big eights 
Niggaz hate but I'm low seven star Caesar 
For grimy niggaz tryin to line me like {?} preacher 
You niggaz got the nerve, I'm at Johannesburg 
With Mandela nephew blowin heavy herb 
Then back to the projects, low from the task force 
The dope spot's sellin more shit than Scott Storch 
I'm tired of these pricks, lyin 'bout bricks 
Got my can and my white, my tan like Mariah and Nick 
Fly in the '60 U.F.O. 
Unidentified flyin object on twenty-fo's 
More money more hoes, more money more clothes 
Smoke that AK-48, not bullshit 'dro (yeah) 
I rock big arenas, not bullshit shows 
And my pants three thousand, these ain't bullshit clothes (OHH!) 
[Chorus] 
[Lloyd Banks] 
Nah, uhh 
B-A, N-K, S-5, 5-oh 
Or 6-8, M-G, tinted with my eyes low 
Homie I'm a Tahoe, fully loaded nine blow 
You see out on hydro, Luciano blind hoe 
Loiue V offended me, {?} in my Bentley C 
And weekends are the chills, I'ma fuck her 'til she empty 
Empty on you if you front, 'til your passenger is stuck 
Give your ass a brand new scar, in need of a brand new car 
I ain't them I'm different baby, I talk, you listen baby 
Listen and I'll show you, how money controls you 
I'll put you in my old school, and let you pop the switch 
Pocketful in every packet, that's why I'm poppin shit 
I don't forgive I don't forget, what you said, where you flip 
When you get hit, I hope that's it, pop-pop, all on your whip 
I-I, be on that shit, I'm high, I'm on that piff 
Bye-bye, you fuckin bitch, you ain't hot, you ain't rich 
You a snitch!

Now how much it that 
I can breath on a track and make money, ahha ahha 
Now how much is that 
I'm getting money baby, my truck a Lamborghini 
I'm in ??????, where the girls are freaky 
Haters wanna be me, hoes glad to see me 
Ma I love it when you lie and say my eyes are dreamy 
I'm in the club frontin, I'm in the club stuntin' 
10 Grand to buy the bar, Ma it ain't nothing 
(Verse 3) Lloyd Banks 
If home girl wit it, I'm get it, hit it, split it 
She'll think about me everyday, hour, minute 
Second to nobody, baby check it

And when your neck it, I'm ready to f**k 
A little head in the truck 
If a turn gang good, i'ma let her come up 
When the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town 
Stash box down, put the magnum down 
I'm with G-Unit, 
Nigga you not ballin a the G 2 jet

Waitin on it like..

Yea right now 
You got skills on them high heels 
When we leave this club, I'm take you were I live 
Do me before I get her 
I might eat out depending on how I feel 
Baby girl got a thang for me 
She do what every I say 
and I ain't got to make it rain money 
Go getta and she ghetto with it 
Told shawty dont do it, but she already did it 
I'm all on her back, when she move like that

Is that you Irv? 
I smell pussy 
Is that you Ja? 
I smell pussy 
Is that you Black? 
I smell pussy 
Is that you Tah? 
Y´all niggas is pussy 
I´m ballin´ now nigga now watch me (watch me) 
Ain´t nothin´ you can do to stop me (stop Me) 
You niggas get so emotional (emotional) 
You remind me of my bitch. 
It´s not in my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe, 
But she doesn´t understand catch attitudes when I leave her (leave her) 
Like being on probation makin´ it harder for me to except her 
as my own she tries to tie up my phone and (phone and) 
I´m not at home she´s thinkin´ that I´m not alone probably out tryin´ to bone anything in the street 
I let her know she can leave I ain´t tryin to tie her up but see 
it´s hard to fuck with somebody after she touches me mami 
I´m not your regular nigga I know the game (I know the game) 
But I don´t play by the rules I´m focusin´ on my moves that way I´ll never lose 
See I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Benz´s with 22´s 
Say I confuse you play little tricks with your head 
Catchin´ feelin´s ever since the first time I slept in your bed 
I´m not here to tease you mislead you or mess up your dreams (nah) 
I can´t say I love you I dont know what that means 
I´ma pimp. 
[Chorus: (x2)] 
Girl you know I like it when you climb on top 
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock 
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock 
Take me to extasy without taking Extasy 
[Verso 2:] 
When I first met her 
I did anything to get her (what?) 
Paid all her bills and filled the ´fridgerator (uh huh) 
Reminiscin´ on late nights when I try to lay up 
but couldn´t get off cause your baby would stay up 
She even crashed the whip tryin´ to switch in the third lane 
That´s when I realized this bitch was a bird brain 
A pigeon writin´ her baby pops in the box in the prison 
Sing-sing is where he biddin´ 
She in the Gucci tights and Findi high heals 
Baby wipes and cans of Infamil 
Moter bike and grams of fish scale 
It´s a 9 to 5 niggas with no frills 
Turnin´ young niggas with princables to old men with debts 
And all the prank calls was death threats that bitch had the best sex 
All across the globe and the bitch head game was out of control 
[Chorus: (x2)] 
Girl you know I like it when you climb on top 
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock 
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock 
Take me to extasy without taking Extasy 
[Verso 3:] 
I´m wonderin´ when I´m gone if you´ll miss me (miss me) 
or do you miss the Don Perion and the Cristy 
I´m fuckin´ with you 
I´m feelin´ your shape I´m feelin´ your eyes 
Later on I´m feelin´ your ass and feelin´ your thighs (come here baby) 
Sweet heart your book smart and street smart (uh huh) 
I knew you was my type from the very very start (yeah) 
I´m into tongue kissin´ and four play all day 
Mama ain´t home so the noise is okay 
O.D.B you know he like it the raw way 
Latex safe sex no hickeys on the neck 
Now you learnin´ (whoo) 
The Lords blessin´ makes me wiser as the world´s turnin´ 
My tongue touch the right spot have your toes curlin´ 
Whether we´re just kickin´ it or sexin´ (uh huh) I´m a pro baby girl I spit game to perfection (Yeah) 
So when niggas make mistakes I correct them and 
When niggas get out of line I check them man 
[Chorus: (x2)] 
Girl you know I like it when you climb on top 
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock 
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock 
Take me to extasy without taking Extasy 
Yeah 
Don´t think I forgot about your fat ass though Irv 
Runnin´ around takin´ pictures like you Puff Daddy and the family mothafucka 
And that bitch Charli Baltimore bitch look like she died last week pale as fuck 
Paint her hair red think she gone sell records tryin´ to impersonate Pink and shit bitch 
Punk ass mothafuckas 
All you mothafuckas get wrote on nigga 
Ain´t no mothafuckas leave her alone cause she a bitch fuck that nigga. 
Fuck all of it but not you Ashanti baby you know how I feel about you baby (kiss) come on come here girl 
Come on gimme some love girl

While this thick bitch just twerk on the table 
I talk big nips, look like fantasia 
She ready, willin' and able 
Just got a piercing in her navel 
Walking nine to five and she staying 
She say she flying down to my city 
Cause she got a birthday coming in april 
We ain't got no kind of commitment 
Why you worried 'bout if I'm hitting it? 
Don't worry about how I'm getting it 
Stay the fuck up out of my business 
No more stressin', I'm vvs'in', ballin' lessons on dvd 
Pay per view shit, making moves since 2'03, can't see me free 
That love gon' get you like ddp, psa: I'mma be okay, I'm the iron g 
Fix flash and I'm a fly emcee, I put a duffle on all of y'all 
Trouble can't ignore me, I was born to ball 
Fuck is up? I'm one of one, I need a custom cut 
Hear the summer come, I want the number one 
Bitch, walk in with a fleet behind me 
Shades damn near to the sneaks, gianni 
Too nights and no repeating, mami 
I'm guttered up, my streets define me 
I drop your ass to the floor, it'll be more 
Rob me I'll make a detour, robbery how I get to her 
Probably want out like I knew her, I done got colder 
Chip on my shoulder, head when I sit in the rover 
Brought me a zipper to odor, phone numbers slid in the folder 
Bullshitting how? Show you my pimping diploma 
Brought an audemar for when times was hard 
Nine calls from the 9th ward 
Mardi gras, take your top off 
I'm a nasty nigga, might slide and roll 
Fly your girl out to miami 
Sent her back home like they done lebron 
I ain't tripping if you ain't tripping 
Party hard 'till he calls the law 
Got my own house so I can throw you out 
I got my own blunt so I ain't putting it out 
This is my car and I can smoke it out 
Got my own money and like four accounts 
Bought my own bottles so I can pour it out 
Got my own shooters and they scoping out 
Bought my bitch an ass, now it's poking out 
If she don't throw it back then I'mma throw her out 
My condo money don't fold out, wild all out 
Hoes out, let's roll out, funeral when I go south 
Girl, your mouth got the kind of brain I don't know about

G-Unit, they ain't ready 
AHHHH! 
[Hook: 50 Cent] 
I don't know what you been thinkin, don't know what you been drinkin 
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass DOWN 
Don't know what you been thinkin, don't know what you been drinkin 
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass DOWN 
[Verse 1: 50 Cent] 
I've been out in LA with Dre and Snoop for so long 
I'm fin ta Crip walk and put some mo'herfucking khakis on 
Naw that's aight man I ain't got nothin to prove 
I'm rich but I still live like I got nothin to lose 
Look man, I don't know what you been drinkin I don't know what you been thinkin 
But get outta line and Snoop's upside ya head 
The media they write whatever they choose 
And the cops stay on my ass so I stay on the news 
These other rap niggas couldn't walk in my shoes 
Went through a bunch of bullshit while I was paying my dues 
They say my music make a gangsta wanna pop somethin 
Well tell them niggas to get poppin and stop frontin 
You heard of me but do you know how I get down 
Stay with a vest on, roll wit a couple tre-pounds 
In case you motherfuckers wanna jump bad now 
I'll start some bullshit and I'ma lay ya punk ass down 
[Hook: 50 Cent] 
I don't know what you been thinkin, don't know what you been drinkin 
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass DOWN 
Don't know what you been thinkin, don't know what you been drinkin 
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass DOWN 
[Verse 2: Young Buck] 
Hittin niggas from long range for writin the wrong thangs 
My name YOUNG BUCK but I look like a old mayn 
Just cuz I like ice don't compare me to Lil Wayne 
I make rap niggas dissapear like Lil Zane 
See Buck been shot, but not more than 50 
I don't dance, what I look like signin wit Diddy? 
I got plans, grenades and the G-Unit wit me 
And on command, we spray give a fuck who we hittin 
What's in my hand? A tan bout a hundred and sixty 
Hollow tips, four-fifths with the rubber grip 
Crips and Bloods they show me love like I'm claimin a set 
These industry niggas know they better pay me my check 
I get a kick outta seein these broke ass rappers 
Ten people showed up that's why your show got cancelled 
50 whatever they did to the kid is handled 
Niggas callin for these features but they get no answers 
FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAS 
[Hook: 50 Cent] 
I don't know what you been thinkin, don't know what you been drinkin 
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass DOWN 
Don't know what you been thinkin, don't know what you been drinkin 
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass DOWN 
[Bridge: 50 Cent] 
Everywhere we go, just leaves number one 
We won't stop, every billboard chart (we number one, number one, number one) 
Man we own that slot, we won't stop 
[Hook: 50 Cent] 
I don't know what you been thinkin, don't know what you been drinkin 
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass DOWN 
Don't know what you been thinkin, don't know what you been drinkin 
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass DOWN 
[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks] 
A bitch know it's a privilege if I stop to check her 
Nigga all I got is hot shit the kids call me Dr 
Pepper 
And I don't mean a soda 
The 16 top shot loader'll bend ya ass up like yoga 
Your fuckin wit a soldier 
I'm sellin tickets for a first class trip to a hospital folder 
So please keep talkin 
So we can spread your feet, and have you on your boulevard C-Walkin 
The birds keep hawkin, why? 
Cuz I'm burnin every CD and Walkman from D.C 
to Boston 
I laugh at a snotty chick, bitch I don't argue 
I'll leave a print in your ass from a karate kick 
Them niggas that Javey wit, got guns on the big body tip 
And if they pull out you'd prolly shit 
Jewelry got me in heavy gray pictures

Play me I'm arm crazy, I'm Tom Brady 
Emeralds and baguettes when I'm hoppin up off the jet 
A nigga reach for that and I'm choppin him in his neck 
One big remix, and she'll be on my penis 
If my flow had a phoenix and my paws are the cleanest 
9-millimeters in the bars and arenas

I'm hollow tilting, Champagne bottles open 
Chronic smoking, 
Even the models groping 
My pockets pocking, 
The games sick, I'm the potion, 
I be proofing, 
And I flow like the ocean, 
Machines make movies, 
You can be the poster,

Your riding in the mini-vans,

How your nigga gonna help you when he stuck in the pen

Start by choosing the telly we meeting there tonight

First class trips 
Take a boat to the six 
Floor seats with the nicks 
I take a broke nigga bitch 
These hoes they trouble man 
That bitch dont love you ha ha 
If I gave a fuck about a bitch 
I'd always be broke 
I never had no motherfucker sour to smoke 
He went raw and she had twins on you 
Take half your check and her ass spittin on you

It happens all the time 
You'll remember me forever 
But it's only for the night 
Your out here doing wrong 
Thinking karma gona be nice 
So your girls ain't bout nothing 
Than your looking for a ride 
I ain't heard every opinion 
Been round the world twice 
You gon hold a nigga up 
Talkin how you feel about me 
That ain't shit to brag about 
You got love for everybody 
No thanks baby 
I'm bank crazy 
Party like we won 
Hardly leave alone 
Leave the snotty ones half fun 
I bet you still keep it spoil 
Your queen creeping on you

And your nigga can't do nothing for ya

Change your location off, fly a g to the crib 
I don't need that nigga outside where I live 
Cause I know you got a man 
And he know just who I is 
Kidd kidd 
I dont wife em, I dont love em 
I dont like em, I dont trust em, I don't cuff em 
I dont hug em, I dont kiss em 
I diss em, dismiss em, don't miss em 
I trick are you tricking homie thats a big difference 
She into big things big chains big titties 
Big spending big business big ballin big pimpin 
Her ass to fake for me to care about real feelings 
Been kilt that ho off and she still trippin 
He put you in the penthouse and a panamera 
He buy you everything you want but hes never there 
Hey you can't miss me I'm everywhere 
Follow the sparkles on the bottles and I appear 
Attitude kinda rude when we first fucking (you know) 
Her man play in the nba and I sell dope (coke!) 
When a rich nigga want you said no! (remember?) 
Now a bitch nigga got you your ready to go (fasho!) 
I make a good girl see how good kush blow (smoke!) 
Shawty said she want a nigga she can cook for (what's up?) 
I had no idea that they label her hood ho (aw!) 
Till yayo said there something I should know 
Come on, come on, girl 
Why you fronting? 
Baby show me something 
When I call her, she gon' leave 
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat 
Come on, come on, girl

Tell me will they blast me 
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now 
It's gettin crazy after dark, 
These narcs be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart 
Now picture me scared of the penetentiary 
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary 
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me 
I'm stackin Gs buyin all the things on TV, believe me 
I got some killas on my payroll and they know 
When its time to handle business nigga lay low 
Although I'm young I'm still comin up 
I'm gettin paid pullin razors on niggas when they runnin up 
The first to pull the strap when theres drama 
Buster you ain't heard? 
I been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama 
There ain't a cop that can stop me 
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me 
I'm loyal to the game

Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home 
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone 
I'm gettin used to the needles on the bathroom sink 
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink 
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink 
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think 
So look like I'ma be the man of the house 
Gotta have somethin to put in the air when it's out 
Up early in the mornin the first to get it 
They say if you really want it then come on wit it 
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars 
And I only spent 30 days behind bars 
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid 
I handled any beef that they sent my way 
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change 
It's thug in my veins

Yeah 
It ain't my fault I came up fast 
And your the name niggas bring up last 
And all the dames get a king up ass 
10 grand on every ring I flash 
Deep frog--and I'ma have to fling your ass 
I'm on the block where its scorchin hot 
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block 
I get 'dro by the pickle jar 
These broke niggas wanna get the star 
So I don't keep the four-nickel far 
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game 
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin her brain 
Get more slugs to boil in your frame 
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain 
The paints the same color as oil in the Range 
I'm stingy ain't got nothin for you but some change 
I'm good now but the fact still remains 
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name 
[CHORUS: 50 Cent] 
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin

Matter fact, man I'ma do anything for the dough 
N.Y.'s finest with llamas and mo' 
[Chorus - 2X] 
[Tony Yayo] 
A-T-L, money make the world go round 
Ca$hville, money make the world go round 
N.C., money make the world go round 
Bad News, money make the world go round 
I love that money, I need that money 
It gives me shelter, it's there when I'm hungry 
It feeds my kids, it fills my fridge 
It pays my bills and the mortgage on the crib 
It keeps me icy, it make hoes like me 
It gives me, seats at the Garden next to Spike Lee 
It made me rich, it made me change 
I seen a lot of places and bought a lot of things 
You got me haters, you got me drama 
You paid for the lawyers, you paid for the llamas 
You make niggaz goners, you rule all the corners 
When somebody dies, you gotta pay the moroners, moroners 
[Chorus - 2X] 
[Tony Yayo] 
Chi-Town, money make the world go round 
Oakland, money make the world go round 
Texas, money make the world go round 
Detroit, money make the world go round 
Bed-Stuy, money make the world go round 
Southside, money make the world go round 
Harlem, money make the world go round 
B-X, money make the world go round 
Staten Island, money make the world go round 
Long Island, money make the world go round 
Rhode Island, money make the world go round 
Maryland, money make the world go round

Clip in the k, whippin' and flippin' the yay 
36 O's in a day, thumbing through pay 
When you do shit the right way 
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me 
How they gone eat? I run the seam 
I got that work, bitch, I got it 
I got a few maseratis, dope in my new maserat

Stash it, it's hotter than hell 
Movin' them squares in for real 
Servin' that broad, said yeah 
Either way you put it on, bitch, I'm good 
Triple salute bitch, I'm straight out the hood 
Triple beam, look what I got on the scale 
This is that dope boy life right here for real 
All this money, need a calculator 
I'mma a drop it off and get back at you later 
Shoes gator, suit tailored, cookin' chickens, we do cater 
Give it to your front door like newspaper 
Two twenty on the dash, I lose haters 
Plug showed up with two trailers 
Two flavors, what dude gave ya 
I got thirty cars in my front yard 
Hundred acres, no neighbors 
I finished up the white shit 
50 On the fight shit, I might go to vegas 
I keep up with who supposed to pay us 
Who cash out and who delay us 
Crash out if you try to play us 
Dope boy universal, all you can say is 
Young buck move that dope 
The future of the dope game, I'm mixing [?] and bottega veneta 
That's 60 a gram, I'm stretching the yams and making my cheddar 
Whippin' that coke like patsy - 12 years of a slave 
Alphabet boys catch me, it's natural life in a cage 
Presidential on my arm, you need to work on your own 
I don't do consignment 
They think I'm 'inati the way that I shine 
In the kitchen with rida gang chopping an eight 
S-s-h-h, [?] all on my momma's good plates 
Dumped the the meth all on my face 
Should get an a up in chemistry 
Murder the block on a killin' spree 
Move the shit fast as a centipede 
You gone need a fade to get rid of me 
Movin' that boy and that girl 
Take over life from the [?] 
Lean the pot all the way to the side 
Scrapin' the extras, need all of mine 
Call it a slave when I'm whippin' that brick 
3-6 Exorcist with the risk 
Bakin' soda water all in the mix 
All this work got us changing up shit 
Paper stackin' in the path of evil 
Bitch I'm dope in a platinum needle 
All my day; one's magazine you 
Play with the money and your head is see-through 
I'm paid in full; never had a sequel 
You nodded off; my rap is lethal 
I get one wish, bring back my people 
Brick on wrist, bookbags of diesel 
I'm icin' out my imagination 
Just due - never got that from waitin' 
Just wrote my movie, new chapter shapin' 
Pack the wall, clubs asses shakin' 
Whose first? Take a dark ride in that hearse 
Makeup run down on your shirt 
Won't be no waitin' for reasons cause I'mma bomb first

My buddy, my buddy 
Wherever I go, he go 
My buddy, my buddy 
Can run for your life on the stick up out the window 
My buddy, my buddy 
I lay your ass out mothafucka is simple 
Stay in your place I recommend or say hello to my litte friend 
[Lloyd Banks] 
Everywhere I go I gotta tag along 
Cause my buzz gettin' strong And they mad I'm on 
They ride with me when I'm past the mall 
Don't wait for me on the bench when I'm playin' a game of basketball 
One sqeeze will make a bastard fall 
Gasp and crall 
You need a bulletproof vest mask and all 
Bring your buddy when it's time to roam (why?) 
Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home 
My hand bling full of platinum the shine is chrome 
He even got closet space inside of my home 
He ain't never been broke he glitchless 
So reliable I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas 
Infared beam in the scope for distance 
The best company wouldn't proach in business 
He who ride with me to the end 
We all gotta friend 
And mine is a G-U-N. 
[Chorus: 50 Cent] 
My buddy gotta temper he dyin' to pop off 
Like Tommy did the cops had the block all locked off 
Take them with me to hustle stashed him in the trash can 
My finger tips sore for four hours I backround 
She meet him his destination hell or heaven 
Cause I only bring em out for that 187 
He dont have a heart I just keep feeding him shells 
He get it poppin' in the hood so his name ring bell 
Ms 
Jones stay on the third floor she call the cops on me 
They came I ran I had to toss my Uncle little homie 
Niggas they all got new friends so they stay in there place kid 
I stay screamin' on niggaz and beatin' up base heads 
These niggaz sayin' doley just like they pretend 
Keep fuckin' around they gon say hello to my little friend. 
[Chorus: 50 Cent] 
[Young Buck] 
We been through it all yet we both still livin' 
We been in a box but we both still spittin' 
And when there was beef you even played your position 
Got under the seat until we spotted our victim 
At first they wouldn't listen to they heard you go off 
Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York 
And little did they know we was ready for war 
Bet that nigga wished he'd never stick his window out the door 
See whenever you come out something happen on the block 
You the reason that nigga done stop rappin' like Pac 
People see you ain't run and you even say shit 
They just know you ain't nothin' to play wit 
Stay wit 16 homies and one in the hole 
When the first one get out the next one go 
To know where your headed you gotta know where you been 
The glock stay with me we friends till the end.

I came to get somethin, I ain't worried 'bout nothin 
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin 
Strap like it's legal, ridin around bumpin 
If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em

Hey. 
(Nobody gon' miss you anyway)

I got the burner burner, I come to burn and burn ya 
Revolver turn ya, call it murder murder 
I ain't smilin I ain't smirkin, I ain't muh'fuckin jokin 
See if you think somethin sweet when your head open 
Cross me, force me, go 'head, line me up 
I found where you rest at, you grimy fuck 
I be out front your raggedy-ass crib on a stake-out 
With a pound, two clips, and Chinese take-out 
You make it rain, I make it lead shower 
You say your prayers, you in your last hour 
I have you pushin up daisies, the coke dump crazy 
You chumps amaze me, the wolves they raised me 
You don't like me then spray me 
[Chorus]

This is that face down on the floor, ski mask shit 
If I fall off, I rebound quick 
Like Greg Odin, Tony Yay' I be holdin 
German mouths on my hip, cause my wrist be frozen 
How these rappers claim {?} and the books is closed? 
How these rappers claim cars and they gun don't smoke? 
I catch a nigga on his deathbed 
And rip the IV out his arm, then jump in Optimus Prime 
Dust the yellow Enzo with the Dalvins on 
In my bullet-proof Ac', who you stylin on 
When the sun is gone, and the wolves come out 
You coward-ass niggaz bring your jewelry out 
[Chorus] 
[Lloyd Banks] 
You may have to bring that, ain't nobody trippin 
Shit, niggaz is hungry, I ain't nobody chicken 
A nigga screw is missin, I'm pimpin, I'm livin 
Nice with the dice, deuce-deuce six'n 
Look how the game change, bad for the system 
Niggaz on game shows, two dudes kissin 
Listen, we're not the same, we're not for fame 
The industry's punked out, we're not to blame 
These niggaz been perpetratin so long 
If they can make it rain, I can make it storm 
He's makin a scene, but I can make him calm 
I just got a N.B., that'll break a arm

Baby let's shine where we can shine 
And ball where we can ball 
Sharin' sometime together we not promised tomorrow 
Know the difference between love and lust 
Lustin' for your love f'na to feel your touch 
Baby I'm grown, I'm not goin' through a phase 
Let's talk, the touch could be brains in both ways 
Now could you tell me, what's a king without a queen 
I'm usin' metaphors, what's me without you is what I mean 
[Mary J 
Blige] 
In the middle of the night, you hold me tight 
Said it's alright, I'm yours forever 
I'll do what you want, if you don't hurt me 
I'll cook and clean, I'll make you happy 
and.

Can't leave you alone, I'm so addicted 
I can't sanctify, its the sweetest pain 
So who's your girl? 
You better say my name 
[Llyod Banksl 
It feels like I made it to heaven when I'm inside her 
And we ain't gotta keep no secrets cuz she's a rider 
She got a hold of her kid that's tighter than yo' pliers 
And I got her hittin' notes that's higher than Mariah's 
Maybe I'm jumpin' or gunnin', maybe I'm crazy 
Maybe she's movin' too fast, maybe I'm lazy 
She's kind'a different you know 
Her body shape'll make you wanna take a trip in the snow 
[Young Buck] 
My thug luv got her, the way I put it down 
Got you callin' on my phone when ya man not around 
Shorty I know what you like and we don't have fight 
You ain't gotta be trippin', you know I'm comin' home tonight 
Tried to warn ya bout a playa, but she ain't wanna listen 
Till I got ya in the bedroom, huggin' and kissin' 
I got what ya missin', put you in the position 
Now you hollerin' and screamin', talkin' bout how I did ya 
Come on baby

You know a nigga a beast when I'm out on the street 
Frozen cube and frozen Jesus piece 
Your main ho be stalkin' me 
I had to block the bitch on my ig 
Posted pictures where I be 
Tell other regular shit she wanna try me 
Don't you hate an ordinary nigga? (I do) 
Drinkin' on ordinary liquor (we don't)

Can't tell you how ordinary feels 
I pull, I pull any girl and she's with it 
I'ma hook her up with other bitches 
Hot boy with cold cash 
Check out my n

Swag 
Nothin' fresher than toe tags 
When I pull the trigger at your ass 
Rap niggas got no chance 
I ain't even go in my bag 
Run through the paper like a notepad 
What you know about it with your broke ass? 
All my mind irregular 
All you smoke is regular 
And your ho too regular 
Find a runway, go step it up 
I do this on the regular 
Basis, you basic 
Same shit, you ordinary 
Damn these hoes need a mortuary, uuh 
Stepped the game up and tip the bitch 
The niggas you was with ain't use to shit 
I put 10 bands in her hand 
Then sent her home to her man 
She said, "don't you hate an ordinary nigga? " 
Pour up a four, I ain't drinkin' on ordinary liquor 
This syrup, ferragamo belt holdin' up my levi britches 
Forreal, I look like drug money 
But I keep my bitch ridiculous 
I said "baby, I'm the realest 
Even though I'm not the richest" 
I'm still gonna bet 50 these 50 racks; my ho' the biggest 
What you wanna do? We all got bands 
He ordinary - ordinary 
Whoa, ordinary - ordinary 
Ordinary, ordinary 
Whoa, ordinary - ordinary 
Don't think I'ma chose 
Kickin' back, foreign shoes 
Watch me make and break all the rules 
Do all the moves 
I carry you out of your dream 
Feel me out, I'm on steam 
Please, I'm out of your league 
Visa's found in my jeans 
These 2014's 
Please deny to your fiens 
Normal walls, I ain't been 
All my girls, you a ten 
Thank the lord I ain't them 
In the store, I ain't spend 
Spendin' time to get me nowhere 
I'm mismatchin' the whole year 
Peace sign to 'em like "later" 
Countin' these stacks when the slip clear 
She shop on cloud 9, live on saks 5th 
Her closet game on some kim kardash shit 
Draft night, she lookin' for a first round pick 
Shorty think I'm andrew wiggins, tryna fuckin' hit

bop to it 
No frontin here shorty, niggaz know how I do it 
For the paper let the gat pop, jackpot 
Find me trippin, ridin slow through the back blocks 
Red Coupe switchin lanes, top down, party frame 
Diamond rangs, diamond chains, diamonds on e'rythang 
Mo' flows, mo' dough, money come, money go 
New straps, new clip, stack chips, don't trip 
Play playa, go hard, stunt nigga, oh God 
Party ain't never over, niggaz hardly ever sober 
Different day, same shit, different city, different chick 
Show you how I do this shit, you notice how I do it kid

Bitches recognize when I'm walkin in 
Smokin that piff, goin where dolphins swim 
44-Colt, that's tossin him 
And that four-do' car is what I'm flossin in (YEAH!) 
I'm in the black, you in the red 
You owe your label money, I'm gettin bread 
Can you feel it, feel it? Nothin can save ya 
In my purple tag Polo and neon Gators (break it down now!) 
Bitch play cute, I don't get upset 
'Til her ass get a facial and a washin set 
I'm in a private jet, but before the deal 
Hoes was like, "He's all right, but he's not ill!"

But the party ain't over 
Then it's back to the crib, to cut shorty that's how we on it

Shorty move like you wanna move, work it shorty 
Gon' do what you wan' do, twerk it for me 
Now get low, shorty work that back 
Now get low, yeah just like that 
Now get low

Yeah, they love it when I pop round, doors up, top down 
Seat back, keep that, motherfuckin glock round 
Nigga this is my town, my block, my crown 
My sound, peace to my niggaz on lockdown 
They don't really want that, they know we get it poppin 
Six-four droppin, you still window shoppin 
I'm ridin round rockin, knockin, Rakim 
Slick Rick, Rick James; big stack, big chains 
I'm so sicker, the flow liquor, you're broke nigga 
I toast wit'cha - if ya got a cup 
Hold your fuckin bottle up, I really want a model but 
You can get behind the truck, if you swallow nut 
I'm just playin, unless you gon' do it 
You put your back into it, the rest is all fluid 
Don't pull that thing out unless you gon' use it 
Ain't nobody bleedin, I guess it's all music

Shawty the kush still burnin, Aston Martin wheel turnin 
Higher than Mount Vernon, the passenger she German 
Bottles is still poppin, clubs is still rockin 
Feds is still watchin, but fiends is still shoppin 
I got vitamin water money like I signed a deal 
How would you feel if you niggaz just got 400 mil' (like me) 
My bad bitch do her thang in her Vera Wang 
She let me have a brain, I let her wear my chain 
I'm on the plane smokin on that Mary Jane 
Listenin to Trina while she run game on Lil' Wayne 
My Ten-a-ki' timepiece shinin like a light bulb 
David Brown t-shirt, dressed just like a thug

Lloyd Banks 
Yeah 
Fresh out the rimshot, my wheels tick-tock 
My steel six shot, the paint flip flop 
My charm truckie that's why they wanna fu*k me 
207 McLaren, body like Buffy 
Old head get rusty, and I'm a can of oil 
If Hip-Hop do die, a 100 grand'll boil 
Show up at your bougie event, get your body harmed 
Slide you all over the stage like Omarion 
Don't need a party calm, on the pepsi and bacardi bomb 
Bail ain't nothin, I make a Gotti bond 
Magician, I can make a dollar flip 
Stick a whole Corona bottle in a model chick 
50 Cent (Chorus) 
I move the keys, they call me the piano man 
I'm classically trained, nobody do it better man 
I do my thang, with me and my Beretta man 
I got that girl, you want her come and get her man 
Hook X4 
Call me the Piano Man 
Young Buck 
I'm richer than a muthafu*ka ridin' in a dirty ass 
phantom 
We kill undercovers down here we can't stand em 
Fill up the door panels and stuff the floor boards 
I can fit a hundred in a Honda Accord 
Blood of a drug lord, brain of a baller 
Hand of a hustler, I'm all about a dollar 
Everybody's a customer, Nobody's a friend 
Somebody gotta do it, anybody can win 
If I did it then, I can do it now 
When we get 'em in, we just ship 'em out 
A Gucci briefcase, dressed in a suit and tie 
Cartier's you can tell that I 
50 Cent (Chorus) 
Move the keys, they call me the piano man 
I'm classically trained, nobody do it better man 
I do my thang, with me and my Beretta man 
I got that girl, you want her come and get her man</field>

[50 Cent] 
Every hood we go through 
All the gangstas around know my whole crew (Nigga what) 
We hold it down like we supposed to 
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin’ them thangs 
[50 Cent] 
After the VMAs my baby momma cuss my ass out. 
I kicked her ass we back friends like Puffy and Steve Stout 
Cut the grass around my clique so I could see these sneaks 
You see back in the hood it’s cuz I see they fake 
I preach a sermon about the paper like I’m cut flow a dollar 
I’ll pop you punk niggaz like I pop my collar 
I’m confused; I like Megan, Monica, and Mya. 
Missy’s freaky and Brandy’s shy, uh 
Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up. 
I’m on now, god damn it I done came up. 
Now you could find me with the finest hoes. 
Choosin’ which whip to drive by what match my clothes. 
I got a fetish for the stones, heavy on the ice man 
If I ain’t gotta pistol on me, sure I gotta knife man 
Get outta line and I’m lightin’ your ass up. 
Semi-automatic spray, I’ll tighten your ass up (What) 
[Hooks X2] 
[Lloyd Banks] 
Slow down little nigga 
Don’t exceed your speed 
Cuz I will put g's on they fitted like the Negro league 
I got connects so I don’t need no weed 
I’ve been in LA for a year now 
So I don’t see no seeds 
After I’m done you clappin’ the crew 
Hell yeah, I fuck fans 
Guess what your favorite rapper does too 
In a minute I’ma have the Jew to makin’ my rims spin 
My crew run wild at the Jamaica’s at Kingston 
Nothin’ but bling bling in ya face boy 
That’s why my knicks shine like one of them shirts Puffy and Mase wore 
I done find a nympho as soon as I pop a bra 
She had my balls head first just like a soccer star 
You can only stand next to the man if you proper 
Ya'll take care of birds like a animal doctor 
Been out and I’m buzzin’ niggas just slept on me 
So I’m out for revenge like one of bin laden's cousins 
[Young Buc] 
Read the paper, look at the news 
We one the front page 
Yeah we in the Bahamas with AK's on the stage 
The ice and the Jacob watch make a broke nigga take somethin’ 
So I gotta keep the four fifth with no safety button 
G-Unit getting’ money 
I know some artists is starvin’ 
But play the game like they rich to me this shit funny 
I know you see me comin’ 
Cuz on the front of the Maybach 
It say payback for those who hated on me 
I hate when niggas claim they bangin’ a game 
You ain't no crip like snoop 
You ain't no blood like gang 
See I’ve been having beef 
I have my own bullet proof vest 
Most of my enemies dead I got about two left 
Until my last breath I’m sendin’ niggas bullet holes 
Innocent bystanders get hit tryin’ to be heroes 
You know how we roll 
Every where that we go 
It’s fo’ fos’, calicos, and desert eagles (yeah)

My rope all freezy, dope on the TV 
Ecstasy especially out the GT 
You next to me, you best to be holdin somethin too 
Least you can say, you let somethin fly when somethin flew 
These niggaz get hit and call they lawyer 
And try to sue you, that's a bitch nigga for ya 
I'm tough like Mayoga, and De La Hoya, I saw ya 
Man niggaz'll stack nines for that Cola 
Cause zips in my shit, I don't grow stems 
Him got 14 karats, carrots, and gold rims 
Why say somethin about my name? 
Don't jump out the window, it's safer jumpin out a plane 
I can't ditch my bitch, it's somethin 'bout her brain 
If she put her mind to it she could suck out a vein 
You don't want a lead shower stay the fuck out the rain 
There's so much ammo niggaz don't gotta aim 
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks] 
You don't get a warnin, there's no heads up when it's on 
Here it comes, ready or not 
Don't be out there snorin, one eye blink and you're gone 
Keep it cocked - and ready to pop 
The man makes no mistakes, it's been on since the day I was born 
Stop drop, or get lead in your knot 
I'm known in hip-hop, but I'm still ridin around with my chrome 
Here it comes - ready or not 
[Tony Yayo] 
Yeah, yeah 
My little shooter's 16 from the projects 
Glock-16 with the Napoleon complex 
I'm in and out the projects, my lifestyle pleasant 
You? You live life like a barbaric peasant 
Me without my gun in the streets is like a Muslim eatin pig feet 
Fuck the pigs on the street 
They all wanna off a nigga - and when these rappers 
get shot they ain't gangsta, they turn into corporate niggaz 
You die if it's rated R 
If it's PG-13 you leave with a scar 
R.I.P 
to Troy and Bags, big shout to Hommo 
They got fishin money cooked, buy me the Apollo 
These model hoes swallow, I buy another bottle 
of this M.O.B 
nigga, that's my motto 
These rappers ain't kings, they pawns 
And got dust bunnies on they guns 
[Chorus] 
[Lloyd Banks] 
I think God spent a lil' extra time on me 
Pop planted a miracle seed my mom ain't see 
I got a high intelligence level, I ain't no dummy 
I ain't satisfied with 10 mil', that ain't no money 
My talents are blood deep, you can't take those from me 
And my sense of humor's shot, I don't take jokes funny 
My paranoia rolls with my bullet holes 
givin me a third eye, my foes can get a magazine full of those 
The hip-hop cops follow my Suburban 
Hopin they can find a pistol on him when they search him 
I'm icier in person, they like me when I'm cursin 
So here's a dirty version, you only heard me urban 
If niggaz try to hurt him, the I-30's squirtin 
Right through your curtain, don't stop 'til you murk him 
Mechanical workin, Hechler handle's jerkin 
That'll pull the Gate in after you Heavenly church him</field>

And watch these bullets have that ass singing like Keith Sweat 
You ain't met me yet

And I'm co-signing Fifty, 'cause them niggas all pussies 
Bustin' shots at ya convoy 
You don't want war 
No surrender, no retreat, this is Vietnam boy 
Check my war wounds, I done took a couple for the team 
Only niggas that been on the battlefield know what I mean 
Take cover we coming, pulling pins outta grenades 
You won't make it to the general, without getting sprayed 
Might as well say "Hello" to my brand new little friend 
Only time he come out, to put holes in grown men 
You continue troops and get 'em all blowed back 
Walk up on 'em with a deuce-deuce and nigga all that, what!

Stand alone, provide my own supper 
Tell ya baby mama stop coming around here or I'm gon' fuck her 
Don't tryta pick up for them lames around you 
You get shots for free, like I fragant fouled you 
I'm on the road blowing grade A haze and brown 
Got niggas running like the KKK's around 
My album's coming, a new year's approaching 
My buzz getting bigger, my few ears is open 
Can ya team play in the game without you their to coach 'em 
There's a very fine line between a pool and the ocean 
Sometimes I'm in Atlanta where they make head bounce 
And you can come, but after you give Banks head, bounce 
These niggas really want war, 'cause if so 
Get on your vest, 'cause all you gotta do is say that

I wanna be the reason you smile 
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes 
[Lloyd Banks] 
I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge 
From the conversations we have and the way it ends 
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends 
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz 
It all depends, maybe if we make amends 
We can start from scratch 
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact 
We plan to be platonic but the hearts in tact 
So everytime we seperate, somebody's marchin back 
You're amazing in the sack 
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black 
God Bless whoever gave you all of that 
If you seen her from the back 
You'd understand why dis feel like that 
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows 
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows 
And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows 
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes 
Up and down 
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks + (50 Cent)] 
Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin down 
Let the thought of me be (be the reason you smile) 
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown 
I wanna bring you joy and be (be the reason you smile) 
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down 
I provide by any means to be (be the reason you smile) 
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while 
I'm just happy I'm around to be (the reason you smile) 
[Lloyd Banks] 
The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful 
What about the half of this shit I done did to you 
Violated and tip toed into a crib or two 
I've come clean to be a bigger individual 
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you 
Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggaz 
when you tease 'em with your physical 
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left 
Wild drama, section 8 princess 
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed 
Cause it's hard to communicate 
Cause she don't speak no english 
I been around the world from state to state 
But now I'm back bustin in your bathroom 
Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on 
Cause I'm leavin in a hour flat, really dont matter, shes mad 
Even when I holla back 
All I really need your attention for a while 
And, I bet you I can make you smile 
[Chorus - 2X]</field>

Fuck the Police with an HIV carrier 
No vaseline in the M-16

And gotta body like I feed it creatine 
My birth stone in diamond, my favorite color's green 
I smoke lean and piss Louis the XIII

A crazy nigga he don't play tho

Al Qaeda expert merkin 
When all my niggas die 
They gon have 80 virgins 
I'm the 'Burb swervin 
Cause I'm drunk and I'm high 
With that glock and pump, that mac and .45 
Fuck the police they killed Sean Bell 
Fuck the FEDS I still deal fishscale 
Mini me niggas wanna copy my style 
But legal aid lawyers ain't good for trial 
Pull up to the projects and throw the kids 100's 
Drop top Phantom got him sick in his stomach

Put the muzzle on the Tech look like it's on fire 
My gun jammed and unjammed like I planned it 
Like I was jus takin a breather I'm back blamming 
I'm Charles Bronson, Dirty Harry with the cannon 
You shootin back, but u ain't hittin

When shit don't go down smooth I don't panic 
Switch pistol, switch hands, switch targets hit ya man

I'll teach you how to stunt 
Nigga you can't see me 
My bently GT got smoke-gray tints 
I'll teach you how to stunt 
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man 
I'll teach you how to stunt 
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans 
I'll teach you how to stunt 
[50 Cent] 
Seven series BM, Six series benz 
Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims 
R1 one wheel when I'm on one of them 
Ma, that boy out there actin a fool that's him 
They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy 
They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy 
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace 
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me 
And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold 
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show 
In the hood they say Fifty man your sneaker look white yo 
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho 
Banks is a sure thing, yall niggaz might blow 
I'm fittin to drop that, so I suggest you lay low 
Buc, he from Cashville, Tenneckee nigga 
Getting them ten of keys, save ten for me nigga

I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rappin 
But the kids used to look up to you, what happened? 
Me on the contrary, hand covered with platinum 
Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one 
On point, cuz you get R.I.P.'s when slacking 
So the stashbox big enough to squeeze the mack in 
Yeah, I'm feelin new but I demand some respect 
Cuz I already wear your advance on my neck 
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches 
Blue yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers 
I already figured out what to do with all my features 
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers 
When it comes to stuntin' theres nothing you can teach us 
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us 
Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt 
Come with me out front, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STUNT

Chain so icy, you don't have to like me 
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback nikes 
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days 
The only thing changed is the numbers on the range 
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains 
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain 
My Sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing 
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game 
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old 
The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold 
G-Unit homie, actin' like yall don't know 
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more 
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes 
They never seen doors lift up on a car before 
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know 
That's how to show these fougaisies how it's supposed to go

Leave your car door and your windows all clapped out 
I turn enemies to memories, remember me? 
The Hennessy, got my eyes glassy, niggaz try to blast me 
With the .38 them stray shells flew past me 
I'm on 'em, what I'ma do, don't ask me 
Understand I'm fin' to have yo' ass on the stand B 
Sold three to muh'fuckers tryin to jam me 
I'm caked up so niggaz in my hood can't stand me 
It's fuck 50, I stay in the drama 
He love her, I fuck her, she's his baby's mama 
She a freak, she give me the na-na 
That nigga try to front, I'll give him the llama, YEAH!

Yeah (uhh) 
Everything was slow motion, but I think I got the potion 
Cause now that they overdosin all my doors are back, open 
In my Cadillac, totin, nigga play with me I'll smoke him 
Murder one one, four three-fours where I'm from son 
I don't need a gimmick, I'm the sickest nigga in it 
Get it upside-down or twist it, I could promise you a visit 
You're a midget, I'm taller than that nigga playin ball and 
Meanin everybody know me when I'm walkin through the mall and 
I get hot, in the mornin and right before I'm performin 
I been on it since a young'n, I'm comin and here's your warnin nigga 
Don't be snorin, bein on point is important 
Cause a coffin'll follow shortly after the white chalk and 
Call me what you want nigga but you can't call me broke 
Call me crack, call me coke, call me uncut, dope 
See my oh-eight gas burnin and my eighty-somethin rope 
Time's over for you niggaz, red line on your throat (terminated)

Who, who, who, who, who, who want it? 
Which gangsta want it? (WHAT?) Which rapper want it? (WHAT?) 
Which trapper want it? My house is haunted 
And I'm gone, the Feds wanna bug me and wrap me 
I'm the Gingerbread Man, them boys can't catch me 
Two-oh-nine, M-6 stuck in the matrix 
BM got a new friend, they finally got a facelift 
Yeah, I treat bitches like cars, I drove 'em out 
They keep a nice trey-pound from when the wolves is out 
Horses, Cavalies with a real-life vest on 
I kick game like Pele and Beckham (c'mon) 
I got dopehead hands, and crackhead fingertips (oh yeah!) 
From baggin up with my Bankhead, Atlanta bitch 
Every day is Christ', I live like Santa bitch 
I'm a scrambler bitch, the Feds can't stand this shit

Cuz I stay on the grind, i stay on the grind

While you chasin your dick, Ill be chasin them tits 
(50) 
Cuz I stay On the grind, I stay on the grind 
Man, the D's on me, cuz they caught me with a nine

Wife be beggin, for me to spend time

Cuz I, stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
(Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
All I do is sit and think of ways that I can come up 
Hit tips of 1 up, then maybe they could gun up 
My pockets are hurtin homie, I aint feelin this shit 
Have yo mama screamin (BABY BOO, IS YA HIT?!) 
I aint Scarface, "No women no kids" I dont give a fuck 
Better teach that bitch and that little nigga ta duck 
With a P90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya 
If you survive, you gon feel what time'll do to ya 
I'm a hard-headed nigga, I came up so hard 
Had to get shot 9 times for me to find God 
If 10 planes hit the projects, nobody will care 
Look around, they aint nothin but black folks around here 
From brothers that become political, and start to manuever 
They'll give you a hundred years man, they did it to Hoover 
Ya, you can hate me or love me, when you see me bust shots 
Come and hug me, come show me she loves me 
(CHORUS: 50 Cent) 
I go hard for mine, I work 9 to 5, and I 
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
I aint got time for love 
I'm tryna get mine, and I 
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
I got moans in the middle, and I'm always gon shine, cuz I 
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
If you call when I'm busy, when you got spare time, cuz I 
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind 
(Verse 2: Tony Yayo) 
I got claintell, I flip coke in a hurry 
Darryl Strawberry even called me on the celly 
And Whitney Houston, saw my coke be movin 
I got the china white from the schuben 
And my dope connects, the dudes be African 
He got Boo-koo bucks, he be traffican 
I know feinds that'll rob a train, to feed their vein 
Feinds that'll kill an addict that support their habit 
Feinds that'll pawn their jewels for dog food 
So when I'm on the strip, you know I'm on the move 
Fuck cops in a bentley, with low ass knowledge 
I cop ten bricks and pay for a pilots 
Now theres coke in Ohana, dope in Alabama 
I'm, not a rapper, Tony Yay' is a scrambler 
Remember back then, is when I slinged on the corner 
I had the sheep skin, my girl had to love the barber 
((Chorus)) 
(Verse 3: Lloyd Banks) 
Dont get caught robbin the pot, cuz your hand'll be tossed 
Get on both sides, its your man Berry Boss 
Imma flood the watch, and every cross 
Nevermind a horse, im in a porsche, its my turn to floss 
Dont put me in a mix of your rap lies 
Diss me, Ill dip you in toilet water so you can get baptized 
I grew up with the peasants in the halls 
Elevators is broke, probably have a specious in the walls 
Now haters get wreckless with the calls 
As Im fuckin their bitch and they buyin breakfast in the morn 
Not to mention, he dresses in the malls 
New Prada footwear, Nexino necklace with the fauls 
I dont care if you over 300 pounds, dont seduce me 
You'll get your big ass cut up like Bruce Lee 
I wont stop till my starve eat 
We got tools, thatll steam your ass around like a 5 heart beat

Ayy (ayy, ayy) 
I make the airline and pop to it, N.Y 
bop to it 
No frontin here shorty, niggaz know how I do it 
For the paper let the gat pop, jackpot 
Find me trippin, ridin slow through the back blocks 
Red Coupe switchin lanes, top down, party frame 
Diamond rangs, diamond chains, diamonds on e'rythang 
Mo' flows, mo' dough, money come, money go 
New straps, new clip, stack chips, don't trip 
Play playa, go hard, stunt nigga, oh God 
Party ain't never over, niggaz hardly ever sober 
Different day, same shit, different city, different chick 
Show you how I do this shit, you notice how I do it kid 
[Tony Yayo:] 
Bitches recognize when I'm walkin in 
Smokin that piff, goin where dolphins swim 
44-Colt, that's tossin him 
And that four-do' car is what I'm flossin in (YEAH!) 
I'm in the black, you in the red 
You owe your label money, I'm gettin bread 
Can you feel it, feel it? Nothin can save ya 
In my purple tag Polo and neon Gators (break it down now!) 
Bitch play cute, I don't get upset 
'Til her ass get a facial and a washin set 
I'm in a private jet, but before the deal 
Hoes was like, "He's all right, but he's not I'll! " 
[Chorus: 50 Cent] 
You might see me yawnin, four in the mornin 
But the party ain't over 
Then it's back to the crib, to cut shorty that's how we on it 
The party ain't over 
Shorty move like you wanna move, work it shorty 
Gon' do what you wan' do, twerk it for me 
Now get low, shorty work that back 
Now get low, yeah just like that 
Now get low 
[Lloyd Banks:] 
Yeah, they love it when I pop round, doors up, top down 
Seat back, keep that, motherfuckin glock round 
Nigga this is my town, my block, my crown 
My sound, peace to my niggaz on lockdown 
They don't really want that, they know we get it poppin 
Six-four droppin, you still window shoppin 
I'm ridin round rockin, knockin, Rakim 
Slick Rick, Rick James; big stack, big chains 
I'm so sicker, the flow liquor, you're broke nigga 
I toast with'cha - if ya got a cup 
Hold your fuckin bottle up, I really want a model but 
You can get behind the truck, if you swallow nut 
I'm just playin, unless you gon' do it 
You put your back into it, the rest is all fluid 
Don't pull that thing out unless you gon' use it 
Ain't nobody bleedin, I guess it's all music 
[Young Buck:] 
Shawty the kush still burnin, Aston Martin wheel turnin 
Higher than Mount Vernon, the passenger she German 
Bottles is still poppin, clubs is still rockin 
Feds is still watchin, but fiends is still shoppin 
I got vitamin water money like I signed a deal 
How would you feel if you niggaz just got 400 mil' (like me) 
My bad bitch do her thang in her Vera Wang 
She let me have a brain, I let her wear my chain 
I'm on the plane smokin on that Mary Jane 
Listenin to Trina while she run game on Lil' Wayne 
My Ten-a-ki' timepiece shinin like a light bulb 
David Brown t-shirt, dressed just like a thug

Bout to spend a mill on a car lot 
Streets dried up 
Get tied up for small packs 
Niggas workin' phone wired up, don't call back 
I'm a surgeon; I put shit back together 
I determined to bring my black mac wherever 
Niggas lurkin' this ain't the place to be 
Fuck a hit

Tougher than leather cut

Quick to take a project bitch to a travelodge 
Fuck her to some mary j 
Blige, get out of dodge 
Dirty nigga, but all my dope clean though 
And I got fishscale for sale, fuck you mean ho? 
You niggas crack under pressure; tim tebow 
The shots didn't hit, you was at the freethrow 
I let my heat go, pull up with my seat low 
Girls smoking, I keep asking banks where the weed go 
Still with the shit, still searching for a kilo 
I'm the reason why these niggas peeping out their peephole 
Wouldn't dent a armor at them niggas all together 
Louise summer sweater, yankee on the sky-dweller 
'Gamo belt, fly fella, they think all of mines vanilla 
Six or seven more flavors out in vegas with weather 
With my kush up in the hall of fame 
Cavemen, break out your ball and chain 
I'll orchestrate the walk of shame 
Your life's plain, escort me through here like the president 
Royal room, you gotta tell the hoes what hotel I'm in 
You never did; you out here regular; y'ain't got one heckler 
I ball consecutive as long as they got neck to give 
Salute me you ever see me, I'm a vet 
Cd full of cracks, easy with the grills, click clack 
Fishscale paid the bill, I ain't never been broke 
Arm ya, adrien broner on the ropes 
I'm still at that mickey d's off of atlantic 
My bk niggas, man, I feed them hammers 
My connect only speaks spanish 
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, full bricks then vanished 
Jump in the martin vanquish 
Donald sterling think he a slavemaster 
Turn my clippers jersey inside out 
Feed niggas with long spoons running their mouth 
Godfathers to the head, they spoiled that 
"Mike trout your legs, overseas pussies, y'all loving thots 
Been around the world, crime scene in the parking lot</field>

G-Unit 
 
[Chorus: Olivia - repeat 2X] 
Boy if you want me, then you can have me 
I want you to want me and love me unconditionally 
[Verse 1 - 50 Cent] 
You want me to want you, you want me to need you 
You want me beg and stay by my side 
You want me to chase you, you want me to lace you 
You want me to just swallow my pride 
You want too much from me 
Pretending I'm that nigga you lovingg 
Last week it was my man, the week before your husband 
Girl that ring on your finger means nothing 
Its just a waste of money, and he was just a dummy 
I know you kiss hI'm and hug him 
And tell hI'm that you love him, you lying 
Because I hit the first night and I wasnt even trying 
You facinated with the flow 
You know I'm about to blow 
Come to see me at my show 
Admire how my wrist glow 
You like the way I get the dough 
We can go, just to drow 
Let your knees hit the floor 
I like it when you do it slow 
Aint nobody got to know 
We can keep it on the low 
I don't like niggas in my business, told you that before 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 2 - Young Buck] 
You want me to hug you, you want me to love you 
You want me to miss you everytime you gone 
You wanna shine, you wanna spend time 
Girl this is just a fling thing, word is bond 
You want too much from me 
Everyday calling my phone 
You found out my benz sittin on chrome 
Wont leave me alone 
Catchin feelings cause I'm never at home 
I should've known not to pick up the phone 
Before a nigga got on 
You wouldn't take time out to speak 
Then you expect me to take your ass out to eat 
I can't lie girl you sure look good in that mink 
Tonight its on you, you gonna buy me a drink 
Whatchu think? 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 3 - Lloyd Banks] 
You want me to lay out quality time, like you don't know I'm on tour 
Fuck you blowin up my cell phone for? huh? 
Why everytime we talk you askin for more, huh? 
You want a nigga to commit, that our relationship shit and 
I didnt string you along, you talkin reckless 
Shorty look at my necklace 
I don't sell dreams, I sell records 
I know your type, used to parade around town 
Bumped into an entertainer, now you wanna slow down 
Introduced me to family and friends as well 
Walkin out the house feeling like a piece of show-n-tell 
cheatin cause your boyfriend doesnt like to spend 
I hate to bust your bubble but I'm just like him

[Chorus] 
I wanna be your lawyer 
I really wanna defend you, baby 
I'm lost in your lovin' 
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy 
I wanna be your lover 
I wanna get to know you, baby 
I'm lost in your lovin' 
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy 
[Young Buck] 
Im lovin' how you look in my eyes 
Swingin' them hips when you pass 
I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby 
Jump on this Harley 
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley 
Sip some Bacardi 
Then go pull up at the afterparty 
I think we make a perfect couple 
But you think I'm trouble 
Maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number 
She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman" 
Think im'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin' 
Your toes painted half fixed all the time 
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine 
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you 
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do 
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long 
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong 
Before I head home 
Im'a stop at your house and blow the horn 
If you come outside you know it's on 
[Chorus] 
[Lloyd Banks] 
Bitches be frustrated with the baller 
Qonder why I call her 
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spall her 
Hickups annoy ya from time to time I gotta ignore her 
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more 
She loves it when I'm in town 
Hate it when I'm not around 
I get her and wed down 
Next door neighboors hear the sound 
Pictures hittin' the ground 
Just enough to hold us down 
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round 
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy 
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady 
I admit I fell in love with a frame 
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name 
Her panties wet over fame 
Fall in love with my chain 
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain 
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only 
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie. 
[Chorus] 
[50 Cent] 
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more 
Watching her lick her lips 
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man 
I sweet talking her if she like 
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right 
Look I'm legit now used to break laws 
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours 
Big house big Benz girl it yours 
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws 
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you 
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal 
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you 
Cause their be some honies gonna hate you that never saw you 
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me 
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me 
Let me ride on you and you can ride on 
We can do it all the night 
We can have a balla night 
[Chorus] 
I wanna be your lawyer 
I really wanna defend you, baby 
I'm lost in your lovin' 
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy 
I wanna be your lover 
I wanna get to know you, baby 
I'm lost in your lovin' 
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy 
I wanna be your lover 
I really need to stand you, baby 
I wannt be your lover 
I really need to stand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.</field>

Blow the check, these hoes wanna know just who I am 
Takin' pictures, trynna do it for they Instagram

Fuck the home, shout-out to the real cookers 
Gold chains, couple Audemars and Cartiers 
We [?] ; these hoes know the party here 
Blowin' on that 
[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd] 
Blowin on that killa kill: neck on chilly-chill 
Baby, let me get a feel; show me that it's really real 
Bad bitch from Cashville, met her up in Club Live 
Don't care who you man is, long as he ain't up in here 
Ain't nothin' changed, still the same ol' two-step 
I don' had some A-1 hoes, and a few Fs 
I done order bottles, 100 bottles and got two left 
Somebody got bust upside the head, G-Unit there

[Verse 3: 50 Cent] 
Hol' up, I think I love these hoes 
A nigga trynna fuck 'em all

No suckers in my section 
Oh no, no, no, my shit legit 
You niggas get to flexin' 
Bitch and I will get ya hit 
I got a paper route 
A nigga gettin' plenty bread 
Oyster perpetual 
You niggas know what time it is 
Dance like a b-boy 
Just like a d-boy 
Yeah, I'm a g, boy 
You know it's me, boy 
[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks] 
Uh, I think I'm gon' remain reclined and count 
So many girls, it take a hour for me to shout ‘em out 
The coupe foreign, the shit I hit been super borin' 
Dog, I'm sharp as hundreds with the blue tan on 'em 
Shit a phenomenon, I kept my promise 
Respect and honest, the grind bought off a neck of diamonds 
Shinin', plenty tried, don't got the timing 
Bet he out there island hopping 
And your lost still in the thousands 
[Verse 5: Tony Yayo] 
Bottles of Clickquos 
Smokin' hookah with eight hoes 
Five angel heads on my neck, all froze 
Inter vision, interpretations 
Watch with your ears 
I bought the last watch in the lear 
Ask Jacob, ask David, ask Eric the Jeweller 
Ask 'Beth in Jersey when I bought my first Muller 
I got 'em watchin' me 
With the yatch Master Rolly on 
In that new Rolls Royce with the top gone

Since the west coast fell off the steets been watchin, 
The west coast neva fell off i was asleep in Compton,

I got California love fuckin bitches to that pop shit, 
And westside connection been had it locked bitch, 
I'm in the rear view my guns is cockin, 
I'll put red dots on that nigga head like rodman, 
All stars, phat laces, gun charge, court cases, 
Faught that, not guilty im back, 
Niggas hate me been there, done that, sold crack, 
Got jacked, got shot, came back jumped on Dre's back, payback, 
Homie i'll bring ur CA back, 
And i dont do button up shirts or drive Maybacks, 
All u old record labels tryin to advance, 
Aftermath bitch take it like a mutha fuckin man,

If you take a look in my eyes, 
You see i'll be a gangsta till I die, 
That California chronic got me so high,

Run up on my low-low you stop breathin, 
Hollow tips make niggas dissappear like houdini, 
Gang bangin is real, 
Homie im livin proof like Snoop Dogg C-Walkin on top of da devils roof, 
Rap critics wanna converse, about this and that, 
Cuz red strings in this converse and this a Dre track, 
Keep jibberin jabberin i'll pull a .38 magnum, 
And get the clickin and clackin, 
You'll homies will wanna kno what happened, 
Come to Compton and see thriller like Mike Jackson, 
I might be Spike Lee, of this gun clappin, 
Prior to rappin I was drug traffic, and 
In the dope spot playin John Madden, 
Homie I aint braggin, I took five, 
If u wanna die run up on that black 745

New York New York, big city of dreams, 
I got my L.A Dodger fitted on im doin my thing, 
Got me fuckin wit G-Unit you kno the drama that bring, 
I got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens, 
And Buck told me in Cashville I'm good when I come through, 
So i don't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Poo, 
I'm gangsta more like Deebo when he was Zeus, 
Play bishop I paint that picture now who got the juice, 
You niggas is nuts so, i take off ur roof, 
Leave your ass steched out like a Cadilac Coupe, 
God gotta let me in heaven all the shit I been through, 
I was an OG in the hood before i truned 22, 
Homie I'll let the .38 special rip through that vest, 
And i kno Compton don't play whether or not he left that shit on the dresser, 
Got Compton on my back,

New corvette, switch gears fast, nigga 
Leave you wet like splish splash, nigga 
Run up, it's a hundred yard dash, nigga 
Just 'cause I rap don't mean I won't blast, nigga 
Studio full of plaques, known as the greats 
Fast money, bagging up over versace plates 
I got a shawty named mary jane 
She got a girl named pure cocaine 
And now you know the deal 
We turned up in the trap house late night 
See this the reason why a rapper still deal white 
And this the unit crew, thought I should've told you

You supposed to be hard muthafucka 
You so tough 
[Tony Yayo] 
For that china white 
I'll lay a nigga momma down 
We can shoot it out 
Like Frank White did in Chinatown 
You know I got that hard white 
You know I got that tannin brown 
Automatic trey-pound 
Leave a nigga maned-down 
Murda murda homicide 
Real right niggas ride 
Gangstas, they never hide 
Thank God I'm still alive 
My pockets look like there's cracks on me 
My waist looks like I got the mac on me 
These hoes on my dick I got that axe on me 
You a R.N. 
Regular nigga that rap homie 
I'm crack homie 
I'm dope money 
I wake up and wipe my ass wid coke money 
C-back, Maybach 
My shit two-toned 
Nigga run up on that 
Yo ass a tombstone 
I'm wood like a group home 
Ghetto like a payphone 
Jake the snake 
I'm low in the hood 
[50 Cent] 
Nigga you so tough 
Tough until ya heartbeat stop 
The trey-pound pop 
Ya arteries shot 
Ya bleedin and shout 
Get in the pine box 
Damn yous a hard muthafucka 
You so tough 
Tough until ya punkass hit 
The four-fifth kick 
The hypla spit 
You in deep shit 
Now yo ass sit 
You supposed to be hard muthafucka 
You so tough 
[50 Cent] 
Yeah I got a knife for a tough nigga 
Nine for a hard nigga 
Don't make me empty the chamber 
Even if I'm locked in a cell block 
You'll fall into shell shock 
When I open ya head wid the banger 
I cause a riot in the yard 
Make a mess in the mess hall 
Like I jus blew trial 
And I ain't got nothin left 
God, what's todays mathematics? 
Shit ain't addin up 
Get knocked wid 10 machine guns 
Only get 12 months? 
Ooohh weee, don't talk to me 
You talk to him, you talkin to them 
I got the best lawyers money can buy 
They said they woulda got me ten 
Or maybe nine 
I say "how do you explain how homie breathe? " 
He say "you keep ya mouth shut or you in wid G's" 
[50 Cent] 
Nigga you so tough 
Tough until ya heartbeat stop 
The trey-pound pop 
Ya arteries shot 
Ya bleedin and shout 
Get in the pine box 
Damn yous a hard muthafucka

Tough until ya punkass hit

If young metro don't trust you 
I'm gon' shoot you 
I got so many felonies 
I might can't never go to canada 
But drake said he gon' pull some strings 
So let me check my calendar 
I just popped me one 
Of them one what-you-call-its 
And it boosted my stamina 
Now I'm fucking her on the banister 
Guess I just east atlanta'd her 
I'm in an all red drop tarantula 
Fuck a challenger 
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners bruh 
Where's the manager? 
I keep throwing rubber bandies up 
Hoe, pull your panties up 
'cause you fuck like a granny fuck 
You're just an amateur 
This patek philipe 
Gon' make this crooked judge 
Try throw the book at me 
I look like half a million worth of heroin 
When she look at me 
But you ain't gotta fuck with me my nig 
But you're stuck with me 
But how you called the cops on me my nig? 
You grew up with me 
I don't usually do this 
Unless I'm drunk or I'm high 
But I'm both right now 
Got me talking about my life 
I don't usually do this 
Unless I'm drunk or I'm high 
But I'm both right now 
I don't usually do this

I don't usually do this 
Unless I'm drunk or I'm high 
But I'm both right now 
Yeah, I'm both 
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked 
Yeah, you think I need you, but I don't 
Just left out dubai with all my folk 
Open water, my location is remote 
Shout out yachty but this ain't a lil boat 
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke 
See the power of the mind is not a joke 
Man, I said that I would do it and I did 
Used to get leftovers out the fridge 
Nobody was famous where I lived 
'till I got it jumping at the crib 
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean 
I don't usually do this 
Unless I'm drunk or I'm high 
But I'm both right now 
Got me talking about my life 
I don't usually do this 
Unless I'm drunk or I'm high 
But I'm both right now 
I don't usually do this 
Unless I'm drunk or I'm high

Gave my bitch five million dollars, hold it, hold it, ho (Mwah)

At least she hit the sad button, she mad blushin' 
Diamonds got her head huntin', she head huntin' 
Are you scared? 'Cause you ain't saying nothin', we been fuckin' 
Yeah they lookin' and they been lookin', they been lurkin' (Wop) 
Escortin' down her leg, flirtin', she been flirtin' 
I pull up in a four seater, one person (One) 
Fiji diamond bracelet on, they so thirsty 
Baby got an ass on her, it's so perfect 
She tryna make me glance at her, and it's workin' 
Gucci keep them bands on him, he Mr 
Perfect 
No feeling, no ceiling, he so verted 
Ayy, ayy, ayy 
Big bands on me, I'ma throw it on the floor 
Run it up and hit the mall, I spend it at the Gucci store 
Shawty know I'm in designer from my head down to my toes 
Oh, you say you wanna cuff me? I ain't trustin' in no ho 
Why you say I do too much when you know you do the most 
It's a celebration, I might have to make a toast 
I just did it for my city, now they calling me the GOAT 
Looking for the right direction, I ain't have nowhere to go 
She a bad girl, she catching mood swings 
She wanna stay the night, and drink the D'usse 
She said I follow you, and do what you say 
This can be forever boy, master, you're my sensei, ayy 
I still fuck her like a mad Russian, she mad crushin'

Ya acting hard, but I know you soft 
You my fetish, I'm so with it 
All these rumors bein' spreaded

Call on Gucci if you ever need and

Wanna make love, love, love 
[verse 1: gucci mane] 
King of the skreets 
And when these suckas see me 
They should bow to my feet 
And kiss the ground underneath 
I look down at the beef 
That shit childish to me 
Two hundred thousand to see me 
And it's been sold out for weeks 
Can't brush shoulders with me 
These stones in my choker are 2 karats apiece 
Look like boulders to me 
Damn, who colder than me? 
You think he colder than me? 
You more bipolar than me 
You talkin' crazy 
I'm tryna book beyoncé for my wedding day 
I'm the type of nigga 
Spend a million on a wedding cake 
Niggas hate, but hesitate 
They hate to see ya elevate 
I just left out the gym 
I'm 'bout to take a swim and meditate 
Woo! 
Now it's time to celebrate 
Ask me why I'm smilin' 
I say, "'cause I make two mil' a day" 
And I might take your bitch and pay her bills 
That's how I feel today 
And I just wanna fuck 
Don't wanna chill, that's how I feel today 
[chorus: gucci mane] 
I'm makin' money like I'm makin' sweet love 
I wanna make love, love, love 
She say the money make her wanna make love 
Wanna make love, love, love, huh 
[verse 2: nicki minaj] 
Ay yo, ain't talkin' housewives 
But I'm in the porsche 
First I'ma scorch her, then I'ma torch her 
Then I'ma torture her, then I'ma off her 
A million dollars for a show 
They made their off-er 
Go against nicki, it's gon' cost ya 
'cause now it's fuck ya, intercourse ya 
I rep queens 
Where they listen to a bunch of nas 
I'm a yes and these bitches 
Is a bunch of nahs 
Tryin' to win a gunfight 
With a bunch of knives 
I win, get off the bench 
And give a bunch of fives 
I don't see her 
Bitch I'm the greatest 
No kendrick and no sia 
I'm the iphone, you the nokia 
Everybody know you jealous 
Bitch it's so clear 
Tell them bum ass bitches to play their role 
She see my sexy ass every time she scroll 
I got it in the can, dole 
Your career gon' be with anna nicole 
Witcha dumbass face 
She ain't eatin' 
But I swear she got some bum ass taste 
Text her man like, "dawg 
How that bum ass taste? " 
Pay your rent! 
And stay in your bum ass place 
OOhh 
Oh you the qu-e-e-the queen of this here? 
One platinum plaque, album flopped 
Bitch, where? (bitch, where?) 
Hahaha, ahh 
I took two bars off just to laugh 
You see, silly rabbit 
To be the queen of rap 
You gotta sell records 
You gotta get plaques 
S, plural like the s on my chest 
Now sit your dumbass down 
You got an f on your test 
[chorus: gucci mane] 
I'm makin' money like I'm makin' sweet love 
I wanna make love, love, love 
She say the money make her wanna make love 
Wanna make love, love, love, huh

I love to see the money stack up 
Hope that we don't ever, ever break up (up) 
Wanna make love, love, love</field>

I'm rebellious and fearless, I laugh at failure 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
I'm a prophet, a legend, I'm not beggin' 
I'd rather die for my freedom than live like a peasant 
The precious, recessions, the past and the present 
Slavery to segregation, I still rob with my brethren 
Get these choppas up up off me, I'm street but I'm Godly 
Know these white folks fear me but nothin' can stop me 
I was destined to be this so nothin' amaze me 
My best attribute is bravery, they think that I'm crazy 
Ask Gucci if you with me, then let's get to walkin' 
Cause I'm sick and tired of everybody doing nothin' but talkin' 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my payer 
Know you ain't take me this far just to leave me here 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, I know that life's unfair 
But who gon take care of the family if I'm not there? (Lord) 
Dear Lord, oh Lord 
I gotta feed the family 
But I had to leave the family 
I cut off Cmb, I'm an amputee 
But I never leave Christianity 
Might have to plead insanity 
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday 
I'mma pray for you niggas, then celebrate 
Lord I know these streets contaminate 
But Lord I can't get beat like Anna Mae 
Lord I gotta think about Reginae 
And Lil Tune and Lil Neal and Lil Cameron 
Lord, I gotta think like I'm Hemingway 
Make a way, wish a way, anyway, anyway 
Lord I gotta create and innovate 
Or else it's back to the interstate 
Wheeling in my fortunes 
Willing to kill you just for my fortunes 
I can recall we were chillin' on porches 
Living with roaches, dealin' with hoe shit 
Tending to lotion, now we in motion, everything kosher 
God bless the 'Nolia, God bless Angola 
Rest in Peace Soulja and all of the soldiers 
The war isn't over, call on Jehovah, Lord 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my payer 
Know you ain't take me this far just to leave me here 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, I know that life's unfair 
But who gon take care of the family if I'm not there? (Lord) 
Dear Lord, oh Lord

Lit like a wick, sharp as a tick 
Don't slip on the drip, 10k on the kicks 
Metro on my beat, Guwop from the East 
So play if you want, get shot in the teeth 
I cop new time pieces, a million at least 
I cop 'em in threes, a million a piece (Well damn)

Deep-dish rims that I bought from the fish 
My arm in the pot, I'm cookin' the dish

One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
One last time for us to go higher 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
One last time for us to go higher 
Anyway, lil' nigga, don't test The Kid 
Even Maury Povich couldn't test The Kid 
Even R 
Kelly couldn't touch The Kid 
And even wit all your bars you couldn't text the kid 
I got a pool that I never even swam in 
Airports that you bitches never land in 
They be like? what you doin' Nicki brandin'? 
Suck a cock pit 
Prepare for landin' 
I'm brandin'; I ain't talkin' bout Presley 
I keep a sniper; I ain't talkin' bout Wesley 
Why these bitches so pressed B? 
Open my trunk; all I gotta do is press beat 
I'ma violate your asses like Chris Stokes 
I'm the sandro pay on the big boat 
Pull my weight to make a billy like a big goat 
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a sick throat 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
One last time for us to go higher 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
One last time for us to go higher 
Want another round? 
Well then get the ref 
Got the clover line poppin' and the wigs is next 
When I fly you know G5 is the jet 
I'm the mother fuckin' queen? Lizabeth 
Meetings with the president of every network 
That is what the fuck I call? how to network' 
My net worth; that net works 
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the nets work 
Chillin' with executives 
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive 
Trillion dollar deficit 
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit 
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow 
I have both and an empire also 
Sell out shows out in Norway, Orslo 
This is the Re-Up better cop it while it costs low 
Flows sick; I'll slap a patient 
I'm checkin' these bitches like a application 
Cause these bitches trippin' no navigation 
So its off with your head; decapitation 
Send them up up in flames like a fireman 
I do the hiring and I do the firin' 
That boss shit that you talk; I live it 
And I've callin' the travel if you don't stay on your pivot 
Bitch it 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
One last time for us to go highe 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
One last time for us to go higher</field>

From East Atlanta, I can turn soft into hard, on God 
That big advance check, I ain't even cash that yet, that's on God 
Where I grew up, all we did sell dope and rob, we on God 
In the feds I didn't have no one but God, on God 
Runnin' out of space in my garage so I'm thinkin' 'bout (Whoa) 
Buildin' another mansion out of town, am I crazy? (Go) 
All these dead white men in my safe, I'm feelin' racist 
Runnin' out of space in all my safe, I need some spaces 
I asked Todd where he find me and Big Cat where he sign me (Cat) 
Speaker phone on with the plug, I'm whippin' up a nine piece (Skrrt) 
Fevzi made my jewelry, I'm standing next to QCP 
I'm feelin' like they watchin' me, I think they wanna rob me 
Haters lookin' envious, I'm lookin' at they faces (Fuck 'em) 
I keep coppin' money, coppin' jets, and goin' places 
Think I'm gettin' good 'cause I'm peepin' nationalities 
My bitch changed her wig then she switched her personality (Wop) 
Protect yourself at all times, that's on God (God) 
I don't do songs with my opps, that's on God (Fuck 'em)

On the stage gettin it with nicki ricky rozay and flo rida 
I rock maris with the money ball like stoudemire omare 
Hold the blunt with my left hand to show my automall in paris 
Look at all that i've accomplished, i just bought me 3 ferraris 
Spent five million in my company if offended you not sorry...Gucci 
Chorus 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze 
What it gonna be

Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me

Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be 
Ima street magician and i keep on taking pretty girls to lenox 
New mustang with 80 in it watch her spend all 80 in 80 minutes 
Sacks are full real true religion i bought a car so sharp it make you feel suspicious 
See i'm too flamboyant they say its malnutrious i'm in a rare edition, think i'm a mathematician 
Don't nobody in here put their hands on me too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Gotta die on my life as whats it gonna be whatcha gonna do gucci ain't gonna leave 
Still poppin bottles pouring liquor on chicks no need to lie i'm such a freak 
No need to hide you so unique 
Imma try beat your back out until you weep 
Said you ran outta money theres more for me heres more for you 
Cause you a whore for me 
Don't be a hoe for free cause we can ball right now we can do it 2,3, 4 times a week 
From zone 6 down to ??? I pull up in that yellow thing i put rims on everything 
Hoes think i gotta wedding ring

Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be 
Come in to leave throwin money high don't care where it reach 
Spend 2 g's a week on haircuts like 4,5,6 sometimes a week 
These girls petrified they scared to speak 
I'm in the new gt with a georgia peach 
Gotta condo right out on the florida beach 
I ain't hard to reach so nice to meet 
Every night we meet you prolly fight with me 
Say its fine with me to spend the night with me 
No rules everything alright with me 
Now shake baby shake just right for me 
Catch ball players in magic city 
Show them boys how good my jumper is 
Ain't no niggas up in here, makin all pros look like amateurs 
I just showed my ass last night i had a blast 
My jewelery was so white haters put theirs in the trash 
Pulled up in some fans just to make them haters mad 
Rims with paper tag paper bag full of cash 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Got some killa and some gats and money

Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze

Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be

That's why you deserve that first class flight 
Bye bye, 'cause I just quenched your thirst last night 
I'm in Dubai 
Somebody tell the prince that the kingpin has arrived 
If I lived over here, I'd prolly have one hundred wives (damn!) 
Walkin' in the club and they like, "Gucci just arrived" (Gucci!) 
I ordered up a dub and then I threw it in the sky 
I told her I'm a'ight, now she look like she surprised (I'm a'ight) 
She look like a model, but a devil in disguise 
All these chains on me, I look like Deion in his prime 
You know you came to fuck, so why the fuck we wastin' time? 
I got the kind of wood that make a woman lose her mind 
I'm young, rich and handsome, baby, I'm one of a kind 
Just keep it real with me, baby, it won't cost you a dime (Gucci!) 
I know you got expensive taste and I don't even mind

No sleep 
Burr-burr-burr 
I'm outchea 
Zwizzop 
When the sun comes out it takes the rain away 
But just like noah it been rainin' 
The last 40 days 
Takin' pain pills, tryna take the pain away 
Sold my first 8-ball and bought me my first pair of j's 
Momma cussing out these disrespectful ass j's 
They knockin' on the door 
Know I'm just in the 7th grade 
I'm mixin' codeine pills and molly in a lemonade 
I'm feelin' like briscuit so damn high 
Might just die any day 
For all you junkies that's addicted 
Please don't get offended 
I'm a recovering drug addict 
And that's not my intention 
That og gas hit my mailbox 
Like a magazine subscription 
My doctor in the feds 
For writing bad prescriptions 
I got so drunk I left (?) 
And I crashed a bentley 
I'm a mathematician 
I'm too stoned to miss it 
I got the best intentions 
But I made rash decisions 
Throwin' cash at bitches 
Spend like half a chicken 
Before I started rapping 
I was worth half a ticket 
Took your stash to get it 
Or spent it so fast it's silly 
I drop the top on my rolls royce 
I ride past the prison 
They hate with a passion 
I guess that's the new fashion, is it

Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the dea

It's a white girl in town: name is "cocaine" 
It's some dirty birds in town: Gucci Mane and Waka Flame 
We flying, we buying, say you got more bird? You lying 
You trying and lying, you boys ain't supplying 
I pitch like Nolan Ryan, got cocaina flying 
My partners sick up kids, they take what they gon tie in 
In the bushes they lying, ain't lying that's my word 
By the end of the month, they left with them birds 
Zoned off that purp, I'm slurring my words 
I swerve in my Benz, baby, my 40s on the curb 
The lean, the herb, pay me like the 1st 
Cross Brick Squad, get hurt 
I got work - Gucci! 
[Hook:] 
My homeboys will get you, pay you on the 33rd 
2 pints of lean'll have me slurring on my words 
Undertaker car, triple black drop bird 
Stomach full of money, so hundreds I'm a burp 
All the hoods love us like the 15th and the 1st 
2 pints of lean'll have me slurring on my words 
Undertaker car, triple black drop bird 
Stomach full of money, so hundreds I'm a burp 
[Verse 2: Waka] 
Five grand for a head shot 
[?] gonna get your bed drop, nigga 
Triple red drop, bouncing through the parking lot 
Where I'm from, young niggas shooting at the cops 
Where I'm from, they faking 
My hood right side, nigga, green flagging 
Lay your ass down if you do too much bragging 
3 case, 4 Glocks, nigga that's swagging 
[?] 
[Hook] 
[Verse 3: Hootie] 
Half a million dollar jewelry like "fuck that bird! " 
Niggas screaming they want beef, I'm like "roger that! " 
My album didn't sell, so I'm laying niggas down 
Shooting every nigga that burns, sleeps or fuckin frowns 
40 carats on my bracelet, my Polo black 
Niggas talking like they won't be wanting that 
7 grams in this Swisher, I'm gon solo that 
Riding around with my strap like "where they at? " 
All these rap niggas hold us [?] 
You will never be a legend like the Gucci Man 
You will never be taped up like my partner Flock</field>

I'm talkin home gurl be lookin like 
she just stepped outta a magazine 
I'm talkin niggas I'm gonna be somethin' serious 
Gotti here go 12 bars 
Gucci Mane got 9 cars 
We don't call em "dimes" no more 
'09 we call 'em 5 stars 
I'm a 5 star nigga, this a 5 star clique 
That's a 645, this that new M6 
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed 
Might even pay her rent 
And the way she give it to me 
Best money I ever spent 
I can't even lie (why?) 
I'm so super high (high) 
Do not need her, will not keep her 
Unless she is fly 
Gucci Mane's a thug b, your man is a scrub, see 
She loves me now, she loves you not 
Yea all my bitches love me 
And if you in Atlanta 
Look up Gucci girl and beep me 
And we can find a 5 star hotel you can meet me 
That's a 5 star chick 
That's a 5 star chick 
That's a 5 star chick 
Now that's a 5 star chick, if your credit score high 
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice box wet 
And your head something fine 
You a 5 star chick 
You a 5 star chick 
You a 5 star chick 
You a 5 star chick 
I want a 5 star chick 
I need a 5 star chick 
I need a 5 star chick 
I want a 5 star chick 
It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit 
I'm the realist nigga walkin 
And dis the remix, and still I'm out here lookin' 
4 a 5 star chick 
When I catch her, I'mma bless her 
Wit a 5 star kid 
She a natural born hustla 
She ain't chasing no suckas 
On a mission for a real nigga 
She ain't never fucked a busta 
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite 
And all them hating-ass hoes in the club want to fight 
She was born in the A, went to school in DC 
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee 
If you ain't a 5 star, need to go ahead and face it 
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shawty that'll make you basic 
Dat aint a 5 star chick 
It aint a 5 star chick 
Dat aint a 5 star chick 
It aint a 5 star chick 
See I'm a 5 star chick 
Cause I ain't that other chick 
She been struggling for hers 
From the womb I been rich 
I ain't gotta talk about the money in the shoe game 
All you gotta do is Google Trina 
See the proof, Mane 
Cause ain't none of these hoes, doing shows in a recession 
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression 
While I'm spending meals, signing all kinda deals 
I'm a 5 star chick, eating 5 star meals 
My whole lifestyle like "coming to america" 
All my Louis luggage 
You see my bag how I carry her 
Walking through the airport 
Like I'm in a parade on my hologram 
Logging on to E-Trade 
That's a 5 star chick 
That's a 5 star chick 
That's a 5 star chick 
Now that's a 5 star chick, if your credit score high 
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice box wet 
And your head something fine 
You a 5 star chick 
You a 5 star chick 
You a 5 star chick 
You a 5 star chick 
I want a 5 star chick 
I need a 5 star chick 
I need a 5 star chick 
I want a 5 star chick 
I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's 
Fendi on my slippers, and my cookies always slippery 
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time 
So I be yelling: "fuck em! " with a dildo sign 
Bye little mama, you a 3 star 
I ain't sleeping 
when I say I'm in my dream car 
Oh, did I stutter, Harajuku hyphen Barbie 
I'm hot I think its time to put the rice in 
I was in the chair, I was gluing my weave in 
When you hit the stage 
They was booin' and leavin' 
Ya money red flag, no more auditions 
Ask Lil Wayne who the 5 star chick is</field>

This here is bigger than the game, deeper than rap, boy

Fuck a contract, I'd rather shake your hand boy 
Yeah I'm your Ceo but I'm your biggest fan boy

Guwop got more money than all these trappers

But how a drug dealer from East Atlanta go platinum? 
Master P, '93, mixed with a lil Eazy-E 
Dancing in the video like Puff cause I got plenty G's

You niggas ain't legit 
See gucci with the shit 
You keep on talking slick 
Then I'ma go and get the stick 
Caught it as a kid 
Still done talking brick 
Used to have them ninety six impalas 
Sitting on blades chopping

They treat me like a prince 
When I was behind the fence 
You was acting like a bitch 
So I might slap you like a pimp 
My chef is cooking shrimp 
The haters tryna' knock me off my throne

Junkies recognize my face 
Paid a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case 
They used to run up on me, be like "Gucci what you know? " 
I tell them "get this glass and get the fuck away from me hoe" 
And everywhere I go it became an instant cut 
Cause they knew I had those 20's and them big fat monkey nuts 
Can't be scared of the dark when you come from miles apart 
Shooting dice and playing cards, selling blow out of the park 
Had it fresh on your sister but I used to sell your mama 
Breaking 50's down to dimes was my job for the summer 
And my job for the winter, cooking bricks all in the kitchen 
Junkies dead at the carwash cause I heard that they was snitching 
Sure jumping like a chill man and help me buy my tills 
Dope D 
Willy used to finger fuck my rims 
They forgetting on my name so they used to call me Black 
If you beat me for a twenty beat ya I'm a call you back 
She on the dope man dick cause I'm a nigger with a sack 
I'm the hustler of the year and I know that for a fact

Huh, 
Price so low that it comin' through snow 
Standin' at the store and I'm selling yae-yo 
Bought a brick yesterday got a full way to go 
On the highway everything got to go 
Fifty on the table, a hundred on the floor 
Middle of the summer but I'm'a make it snow 
Like a chill pet my money don't grow 
Still servin' niggers through my burglar bars though 
Shorty G's and a little afro 
8 ball check it and the flow stash milks 
I don't get credit that's how niggers get killed 
And if you got a tilt then your car get pelt 
17 going to the 5-5-9 
Like a blind man I don't see no lines 
Thirteen when the nigger did his first crime 
Eighteen when the nigger bought his first 9 
If I don't fly then the show ain't flying 
Picking up dope but the J's keep buying 
Rob a Q lurk and I know they trying 
Try Gucci Mane their ass be dying 
Let me take you back in time 
Let Gucci Mane refresh your mind 
I'm a dope boss they on my grind 
I could pluck you so hard!

Zone six! 
[Hook: Drake] 
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road 
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road 
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road 
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone 
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back 
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane] 
I'm just an East Atlanta nigga with a body on this belt 
I done had a million beefs but I ain't never call for help 
I'll take a nigga bricks and I done took a nigga reup 
Put that pistol on your partner made him piss all on himself 
Got your bitch so pissy drunk 
That she done threw up on herself 
'Fore I send her back to you 
She gon' have Guwop on her breath 
I'm the last real nigga left 
I'm on an island by myself 
I'm my only competition so I'm battling with myself 
Facing prison, drug addiction 
It's like I'm battling with myself 
I done shook up all my demons 
Now I'm back to myself 
You didn't keep it real nigga so just keep it to yourself 
Waiting on Gucci Mane to call you 
Nigga better not hold your breath 
[Hook: Drake] 
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road 
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road 
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road 
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone 
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back 
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane] 
These niggas faking like they happy but they mad I'm home 
I'm the 2k16 Al Capone 
I slap a nigga with a strap and then I throw him a hammer 
He be like "fuck going to trial, man just throw me the money" 
Can't eat, can't sleep, man I miss these skreets 
Muhammad Ali and these skreets miss me 
I went from trappin' on the block to niggas trappin' for me 
I left the trappin' went to rap thought you'd be happy for me 
And then your jealousy turned to hate 
And you wrote a statement on me 
But when they let me out the gates 
My bitch was waiting on me 
See I ain't mad at you homie, we ain't got no beef 
But I ain't got no rat for you, I know you must love cheese 
[Hook: Drake] 
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road

I’m so f-cking dumb I wear diamonds on my thoughts, 
there’s a diamond on my d-ck so theres a diamond on 
her top, 
i can’t feel you baby cos I romantically nought, 
emotionally drained I came here just so I can come, 
theres nothing on the God son that I have’nt done, 
got a lot of p-ssy just … one, 
girls is like buses every 15 mins they run, 
man they like potato chips I just cant have one, 
and I might like you for a minute, 
but I don't like your friends in my business, 
and I feel like you don’t deserve a visit, 
cos you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping, 
[Drake] 
uh, uh ahhhh, 
I know you say you love me girl, 
I know you say you love me girl, 
problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody, 
so we hear you talking booboo we just don't believe 
you, 
uh, ok I’m all about it, all for it, 
I’m allstar team Jordan, small forward, 
I’m never putting up a shot unless it calls for it, 
no hesitation so I’m shooting if i draw for it, 
how how (?) f-ck is up, now man I’m in this hoe, 
life is moving fast, where the f-ck do all these 
minutes go, 
mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show, 
now I get a hundred what the f-ck you think I’m in it 
for, 
Young money forever, i bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree, 
f-ck you to the haters that just spend their time 
attacking me, 
shout out to your girlfriend n-gga lately she 
distracting me, 
wondering if I’m the best, well I am, no Black Eyed 
Peas, 
girls wanna f-ck your n-ggas, guy don't wanna be you, 
lining up around the block so that they can get to see 
you, 
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to, 
you can say whatever girl but we just don’t believe 
you,

How can I believe her 
I dont even believe myself 
Tell me how to trust her 
I cant even trust myself 
And I cant live alone 
At the end of the day cant fuck myself 
I told her Im confused 
And she told me to go fuck myself 
Now Im alone in this world 
Nothing left but me 
But I was born all alone 
So I guess thats how its meant to be 
But she was sent to me 
And I didnt recognize 
And I blame it on ma pride 
On a fact gon send aside it 
Eyes redder than a rose 
Heart bluer than a violet 
My heart broke and Im heartless 
And aint no need to hide it (Gucci)

A heart breaking is heart broke 
Imma tell the truth cause we grown folks 
Why you lookin through ma phone fo 
Thats why we ended up none more 
You done know me like Chan Doe 
Done left me up in my condo 
Looking for you like Wardo 
My nose open like Gunzo 
I think I love her I dont know 
I like her alot but she loco 
She crazy, swagged up, 
I try to hug her she want more 
In and out ah town all the time 
She in and out ma mind all the time 
I cant lie baby girl stupid fine 
But Im out the tush got that stupid grind 
She loves me now or she loves me not 
Treat me cold no she treat me hot 
Caramel but not apricot 
Got one chance wont miss the shot 
I know she special yeah alot 
I know someone might take ma spot 
Cant lie it may hurt alot 
But uh she need a man or not(Its Gucci)

Lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church 
Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt 
Black tee, black beat, trappin on the front street 
Got a black pistol grip pump on the seat 
Black tee, O.G., nigga don't approach me 
Bubble gum wappin ass niggaz can't smoke me 
[Verse 2: Bun B] 
It's Bun B in his black tee and G in his black tee 
Reppin UGK and BAT in his black tee 
Pimp in his black tee, mack in his black tee

Stunt in his black tee, Ball in his black tee

They shot my homie for nothing 
killed my homie for nothing 
I smoke blunts everyday, to try to wish it didn't happen 
But I can't bring him back, cause I am only a mortal 
People think I'm a God, but to me I'm only normal 
I used to trap on the corner, trap [?] with the thermal 
I had that Tec in the bushes, run up on me I burn you 
Folks they come to Atlanta, just to ride through my zone 
Wanna see where I trapped at 
they wanna see what's my home 
In the place that I said, everything that I meant 
I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads 
I got money in the bed, so I sleep with the bread 
If you play with Bricksquad 
them might take off your head 
[Hook:] 
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high 
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high 
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up 
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up 
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high 
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high 
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night 
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice 
[Verse 2:] 
Bitch I bigger pay her or get bigger paid 
everyday is a bigger day 
Bigger nigga get a bigger gun 
hit his ass in his bigger face 
Bigger [?] and I fuck with him 
half the niggas he with her don't like 
That young nigga 'bout trigger play 
and my section Lil Jay like nigga day 
Reiterate I'm 'bout pistol play, anything with my pistol say 
Shoulder deep in this cocaine 
but nigga I can hold the weight 
Appraise me, I'm a mill' today 
A mill, and a mill, made a mill today 
Say you wanna do a show, what's the rate? 
Told a nigga fifty with a steel face 
Smoking on kush and I'm drinking on grape's 
I feel just like I'm Pimp C 
Say Gucci Mane you a murderer 
so you can't get a sponsor like Pepsi 
Say Pepsi, fuck you 
cause I fuck with the Coca-Cola anyway 
On check day it's booming, but it's real slow on rent day 
[Hook] 
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high 
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high 
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up 
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up 
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high 
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high 
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night

I don't holla at girls girls holla at me 
I don't throw dollars at girls, they throw dollars at me 
Gucci you conceited bitch I might be 
cause my chain so bright Stevie Wonder might see 
Yea you got a man but ya man ain't me 
Add ya whole life savings times three 
The mouth full of dro and the clothes ain't free 
so you gotta be a dimepiece to approach me 
How much 'unh can one girl take 
How many cakes can one man bake 
Playa on the real man I don't know 
I just love it when they fresh and they ass cheeks show 
Everybody stare when I walk in the room 
Smokin on purp got me high like the moon 
Chain front big like its New Year's Eve

I neva seen a chick wit a body like that 
Gucci Mane Lil Flap bitch I got it like that 
Stuntin in the club wit my nigga Big Kap

Independent I ain't got no deal 
Hood rich bitch do ya know the feelin? 
My watch worth damn near a quarter million 
Shawty got some shorts on oh, so small 
Say she like me cause my rims real tall 
If you want work bitch you can call us

Money ain't a thang to the boy Gucci Mane 
Old school Chevy same color cocaine 
Ridin through the hood throwin money out the brain 
and I'm lookin for the girls wit the booty shorts mane

[Verse] 
Candy Escalade 26 inch blades 
Throw back money from back in eighth grade 
Ya dancin in the club so I know ya get paid 
but I betcha you'd look betta wit these microbraids 
Girls in the club like dat there stank 
Showin off three or four rubberband banks 
Me and HB keep a big bankroll pulled up in a Hemi wit the Lambo Doors 
Me and yo chick in a red corvette 
I neva had shit nigga what ya expect 
Neva seen a young man paint so wet hood rich and my album ain't even dropped yet 
You'll neva see a man wit a watch like mine 
Face real pretty and a body real fine 
When we get home I'm a break her spine 
Get in her ear and corrupt her mind</field>

Yeah, you think I need you, but I don't 
Just left out dubai with all my folk 
Open water, my location is remote 
Shout out yachty but this ain't a lil boat 
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke 
See the power of the mind is not a joke 
Man, I said that I would do it and I did 
Used to get leftovers out the fridge 
Nobody was famous where I lived 
'till I got it jumping at the crib 
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean 
I don't usually do this 
Unless I'm drunk or I'm high 
But I'm both right now 
Got me talking about my life

And we will be together hopefully

Keep goin don't keep up the security of the key

And no guns cause a coward dats

Your kush pack and my cocaine whiter than taylor swift 
And they taylor make my bread and dine collar 
Costs me a grip

Diamonds matchin my pistols so beefin with me nigga

Guarding my apology now rappers theys not as hard

That's not hard to see I own the street every beat 
That I speak of my fans applauded me

Don't keep up the security of the key blunt no glory 
For the team with scarce money and no guns

Leave the truck 'bout forty thousand, but this one is ? 
I'mma roll to a blimp, ladies ask me do I pimp 
Cause I walk with a limp, so much ice you feel a chill 
Light a spliff, take a wiff, if you feel like take a sniff 
Drink a fifth, pop a ?, one of those then plead the fifth 
40K on a Wednesday, catch me in the M

Microphones I blaze, any little beat, any track I'll kill it 
Fuckin' a model straight Playboy, I stick my ding-a-ling down they throat like ribbit 
Got girls in the club with their lace front swingin' 
Lookin' at my girl like, no you didn't

Pouring up drank nigga my shit darker 
The work came in this time lil' darker 
And the tints on my shit they a lil' darker 
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane] 
Dark tint on my soowoo red charger 
The niggas round me drink lean not water 
I could never hold a job down like my father 
But I could hold a block and push the rock, Shawn Carter 
Bitches on my dick cause my skin real darker 
Got a yellow bitch and The Devil Wears Prada 
Got the narcs on me say my cartel got bothered 
Big fish in little pond, get swallowed 
Dark weed, super dark weed, Cali OG 
Dark lean, super dark lean, straight codeine 
Dark meat pretty brown bitch that adore me

It's a dark night, had a gun fight with a dark clique 
Set up by a dark skin bitch, she was dumb thick 
Gucci Mane keep pulling up in darkly painted cars 
Dropped the top on your bitch, now she looking at the stars 
Diamonds dancing on my wrist, you dancing with the star 
Gucci Mane so geeked up, 
he don't care you light or dark ho 
I just paid 300 cause didn't have nowhere to park ho 
If Gucci Mane just bought it why the fuck he paint it darker 
That shit was already hard, Now he made it harder 
Cali kush, just touched down nigga 
and this pack a lil' darker 
Dog food bricks and cocaina them, now they look darker 
Dark skin brick I'm touching it 
and with it whipping away from the water

We got a dope love, we got a bond that they spoke of 
Two guns we don't give them haters no love 
So thug, see the edge in the wheeler 
My dope girl, double cup leaned up 
Say, thank the creator cause he made you 
Thank you, gotta thank your mama cause she raised you 
Hater, I bet that your daddy is a hater 
Say there, ain't no need to cross that on the plate

Dope girl, so dope, bringing more girls

Hot damn it it's a miracle, please adjust the temperature 
I switched up the interior in my European 50 
Damn Gucci lyrical, naw I ain't lyrical 
But my bracelet is crazy but my necklace is a miracle 
Blacker than Nigeria, with brand new material 
Countin a quarter million while I'm pourin a bowl of cereal 
Fresher than your ever were, richer than a year ago 
with three dollars a Skittle 
but it's eight hundred a Cheerio 
I was arrogant rude same color as a prune 
Yellow chain look like the moon 
and my old school is maroon 
VROOM! Hear it ert-ert when it skrrt 
26's on the skirts, in a bird, with a flirt 
You can jerk, I got twerk, I keep work, in my birds 
I got bird, I got bricks, I got pounds of the herb 
YEAAAAAAAHHHH - used to be my favorite word 
Now my ice game is superb, so these hoes just be like BRR BRR! 
[Chorus 2X: Nicki Minaj (Gucci)] 
Y'all be tryin haaard (but it's easy) 
Tighten up on yo' jooooob (cause it's easy)

Boom boom, 9-5-4 double R zoom zoom 
I don't give a fuck about ya looney tune goons 
Yellin poon poon when your really coon coon 
I eat these rap bitches no fork no spoon 
I'm Nicki, I been Nicki, I'm picky 
I stay around the six like that little mouse Mickey 
Ask Rocko, ask Gucci, ask Gucci Gucci bandana 
I'm a star I'm the black Hannah Montana 
I'm such a girl, I'm such a girly girl 
I'm sippin on my milkshake with the swirly swirl 
Excuse me mister put some cherries in my cups 
I take my shirt off and watch the boys go nuts 
The boys go nut, the boy-boys go nuts 
All the dope boys all the boys wanna fuck 
My niqqa S Beezy, keep my wrist breezy 
Why would I go hard when this shit is so easy? 
[Chorus] 
[Rocko] 
Hold up bitch! 
Man I done stepped my swag up, 
don't fly commercial I'm private 
Step my rank up, so SALUTE you fuckin private 
'Member the days I used to keep my comb, in my pocket? 
Now I'm with pilot smokin kush on auto-pilot 
I jet on a boat and I 'on't even know how to drive it 
But it's all gravy I just coast on auto-pilot 
I'm on another coast, ye ain't even in my time zone (naw) 
By the time you go to bed I'm gettin my shine on 
Yeah it's all good baby go on and climb on 
And ride like a rodeo, get your grind on 
Tell how I spend money, I be gettin my grind on 
Tell how I'm livin when I walk I got my nine on 
Your girl lovin you but she with me know what her mind on 
Don't make me do it hard and get it goin on some down homes 
Watch pitch stats and he don't even have a dime on 
Rocko the don, outta here, my time gone

And I ball hard cause I got racks in my safe 
Eating so good I got to say grace 
Girls wanna fuck me on the first date 
What am I gon do with all these big faces 
New Gucci boots but fuck the shoe laces 
Smoking on purp that smell just like grapes 
And I don't smoke mid I don't like the taste 
Buy my ace of spades by the case

And I keep a big pistol right on my waist 
Sipping on lean that dropped me two ace

Lit like a wick, sharp as a tick 
Don't slip on the drip, 10k on the kicks 
Metro on my beat, Guwop from the East 
So play if you want, get shot in the teeth 
I cop new time pieces, a million at least 
I cop 'em in threes, a million a piece (Well damn)

Deep-dish rims that I bought from the fish 
My arm in the pot, I'm cookin' the dish 
I'm workin' my move, I'm twistin' my wrist 
I fathered the style, gave you all the wave

Get out my lane: ferrari boyz 
You see the chain: so icey boyz 
I'm running in a mansion but I don't think I'm fancy 
But I cut the blinker on and my diamonds dancing 
Once upon a time, a little while ago 
There was a nigga in a "rari with a pretty yellow ho 
Got my head held up cause I think I'm handsome 
But the media portraying me as charles manson 
And I cut up? 
But I'd rather pull up solo in the yellow 2-seater 
Gucci! 
Get out my lane! ferrari boyz 
You see the chain: so icey boyz 
Riding in the 'rari same color as bacardi 
She don't like me, shawty, man she like my car 
Damn near wanna fuck my chain, damn near wanna fuck my name

Deep-dish rims on my horses, mane 
That's how me and gucci mane claim 
Iced out? 
How our bandana's like santana's, screaming out 
"Who wants some banner? " 
Hit a million off my words, they love my country grammar 
That's the antenna, but your rapping careers got static in it 
I'm a walking meal ticket, just wait a minute 
Bank account got commas in it

Baby take it or leave it 
But I know you won't leave it 
'Cause I know that you need it 
Look in the mirror 
When I look in the mirror 
Baby I see it clearer 
Why you wanna be nearer 
I'm not surprised 
I sympathize, ah 
I can't deny 
Your appetite, ah 
You got a fetish for my love 
I push you out and you come right back 
Don't see a point in blaming you 
If I were you, I'd do me too 
Reaching your limit 
Say you're reaching your limit 
Going over your limit 
But I know you can't quit it 
Something about me 
Got you hooked on my body 
Take you over and under 
and twisted up like origami 
I'm not surprised 
I sympathize, ah 
I can't deny 
Your appetite, ah 
You got a fetish for my love 
I push you out and you come right back 
Don't see a point in blaming you 
If I were you, I'd do me too 
The way you walk, the way you talk 
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault 
Ya playin' hard, don't turn me off 
Ya acting hard, but I know you soft 
You my fetish, I'm so with it 
All these rumors bein' spreaded 
Might as well go 'head and whip it 
'Cause they sayin' we already did it 
Call on Gucci if you ever need and 
I'll be South Beach 
in the drop top gleamin' 
Order diamonds, Aquafina 
Just need you in a blue bikini 
You got a fetish for my love 
I push you out and you come right back 
Don't see a point in blaming you 
If I were you, I'd do me too</field>

And all my home boys got ten bricks up

They say I got a warrant out for aggravated finessing 
Next charge Imma get flexing with deadly intentions

I'm in a Bentley on a Wednesday, same clothes 
I been wearing this shit for 3 days 
Fucking hoes, I ain't bathe and I need to shave 
I had a sun valley babe getting that section 8 
Flash shows on the stove, not the microwave 
And I ain't never in my life had some finger waves

Mike will 
I'm hearing shooters load pistols while I'm brushing my teeth 
I get so many death threats it's getting normal to me 
But I bend don't break, I don't ask just take 
Black gloves, black tape and I don't play nor pray 
Wake up and take a piss, I hear 'em sharpening knives 
Main focus every day is make it out here alive 
Take a shower in my boots and go to sleep in my shoes 
Last night I had a dream some killers ran in my room 
Trying to be patient but nigga I can't wait 
On the chase to kill my enemies and beat my case 
So when they ask me how I feel about 'em I can't say 
You either with me, or against me, or you in my way 
I got a pack of hungry wolves and if I don't feed em 
Then they might turn on me, feel like I don't need em 
I keep the best pedigree but hell I don't breed em 
It's a lot of people scared of me and I can't blame em 
They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe em 
I did some things to some people that was down right evil 
Is it karma coming back to me, so much drama 
My own mama turned her back on me, and that's my mama 
I lost three people close to me in one summer 
Ten years later still don't know shot up my hummer 
But I bend I don't break, I don't ask I take 
Black gloves and black tape, nigga it's my first day 
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop

I told my top to get lost 
Cuz I don't really like ceilings 
I told a bitch to get lost 
I think I hurt the girl feelings 
So I hit the gas and get lost 
I hit the thrust and get lost 
I'm in that new Rolls Royce 
If you don't like it get lost 
[Verse 1] 
Me and my top beefin 
So I don't really wanna see him 
They picture man, the flare nigga 
And all the kids wanna be him 
I told that girl to get lost 
Cuz I don't even like to argue 
All this money that I'm makin 
They think I'm playing for the Chargers 
My jury game is retarded 
My car game is exotic 
The inside my Maserati 
Cuz look like he in the hypnotic 
I'm runnin from the paparazzi 
But I'm in the Lamborghini 
They call me Gucci Debiassi 
I think I'm fucking Liberace

They say I fuck on my alarms 
I say it back, it's my choice 
Selling dope with my squad 
Old school's in my yard 
I got a Chevy so clean 
And my goodness so hot 
They say it's getting real hot 
So I took off of my top 
I got the number one spot 
I'm coming down my block

Dragging from the old school in my new school 
Top missing, nigga with my new tool 
Same ways with my new juice 
Getting money on these young fools 
You pay for perfect when you're big time 
You pay for perfect when your sun shine 
Harley Davidson, 1100 
Nigga know we got them army guns 
Big money when we poppin nigga 
Overseas when I'm shoppin nigga 
Hella choppers when we choppin nigga 
Getting money by the mount nigga

Suck a cock pit 
Prepare for landin' 
I'm brandin'; I ain't talkin' bout Presley 
I keep a sniper; I ain't talkin' bout Wesley 
Why these bitches so pressed B? 
Open my trunk; all I gotta do is press beat 
I'ma violate your asses like Chris Stokes

Pull my weight to make a billy like a big goat

Got the clover line poppin' and the wigs is next 
When I fly you know G5 is the jet 
I'm the mother fuckin' queen? Lizabeth 
Meetings with the president of every network 
That is what the fuck I call? how to network' 
My net worth; that net works 
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the nets work 
Chillin' with executives 
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive 
Trillion dollar deficit 
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit 
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow 
I have both and an empire also 
Sell out shows out in Norway, Orslo 
This is the Re-Up better cop it while it costs low 
Flows sick; I'll slap a patient 
I'm checkin' these bitches like a application 
Cause these bitches trippin' no navigation 
So its off with your head; decapitation 
Send them up up in flames like a fireman 
I do the hiring and I do the firin' 
That boss shit that you talk; I live it 
And I've callin' the travel if you don't stay on your pivot 
Bitch it 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter

Shouts out to the homey Coach-K

Im in the Atl and Im high as hell with no Ac 
Drop more grain than Ac, append 1-50 on my Ap 
Im a asshole, kinda arrogant 
An Aquarius, no Aries 
Got a 1000 pieces of asparagus 
And its just touched from Az 
You fuck niggas dont know me 
Be accurate when you compare me 
Got a Ar and a Ak and Ill turn yo' ass to swiss cheese 
Move smooth like a Og 
give it to 'em when I go from A to B 
Watching out for Apd 
Cause this night we hot on goddamn weed 
Flashback, quantum leap 
2003 and Im in my V 
Gold pat, 99, put these things on my Caprice 
Fast forward, prison time 
Coming down the strip in a Bentley 
My pistols my assistant 
Ill shoot yo' ass from a distance

Greasy, greasy 
Dont bring no knife to no good fight because that greasy 
Dont buy no dope in East Atlanta cause that greasy 
These niggas thirsty for that check, I swear they greasy 
Young niggas greasy, Ogs they greasy 
West side, east side, north side 
south side I swear they greasy 
These niggas greasy, these bitches greasy

Gucci Mane bought so much jury 
That the niggas stand in and still feel worried 
Better walk the yellow brick road 
And ask the Wizard can you get some curry 
Buy a brick and it dont do shit 
Dont quit nigga, dont get discouraged 
Real speak, he keep talkin' shit 
All of the niggas in yo clique get tortured 
Im a millionaire but I bought a V 
Smoked it all with my bottom bitch 
Chincos on my top grill, 10 golds on no bottom bitch 
Actin' like you bullshit 
Wheres your Hillary Rodem bitch? 
With them ol' last red bottoms 
She bitch a kiss, I didnt acknowledge 
Think I need me a college chick 
Get brain with that knowledge shit 
Put her up on money 
Switch out the bitch closet quick 
Charge her with a body kit 
Cat suit her body bitch 
Got free bricks, I got free weed 
So you suck my dick you get benefits

Now that I'm finally free 
I was lost, but now I'm found 
I was blind, but now I see 
Super high, can't touch the ground 
Life tested me, but God blessin' me 
Every 16 bars is a testimony 
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa 
Had to find myself, then remind myself 
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself 
Streets taught me everything, I trained myself 
Dead wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else 
They wanna lock my crew up like? 
Think every man? and amuse himself 
Glad as well, but I'm mad as hell 
Because my best friend probably gon' die in jail 
Ain't no lie to tell, probably cry like hell 
If I dwell on it, cause he got 80 years 
I'm going hard, you see I might as well 
Cause I got a hard head like my daddy had 
And my daddy's dead 
I bet my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag 
So I stand today, then get down to pray 
? and my mind is made 
I got a point to prove, and a son to raise 
Can't let him make mistakes that his daddy made 
Now that I'm finally free 
I'm bouta throw it today 
I take my life in my hands 
Cause I'm a grown-ass man

Now that I'm finally free 
Squash the beef I'm free of that 
This crazy song, they ain't feelin' that 
I guess they wanna see us kill each other 
If I'm dead, who the fuck gonna help my mother 
I done struggled and hustled too hard for this 
I done rob stealed killed, ain't proud of that 
Smoke weed, took pills 
I'm a soldier? where the cowards at? 
Man your homeboy gone where the flowers at 
All the money in the world can't bring that back 
If I had one wish, wish mom and dad could 
Come down now and see me rap 
But she see me now, and I believe in that 
On the strength of that I ain't goin' back 
So I put my whole family on my back 
Lost so much time, can't pay that back 
I was lost, but now I'm found 
I was blind, but now I see 
Super high, can't touch the ground 
Life tested me, but God blessin' me 
Every 16 bars is a testimony 
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa 
Had to find myself, then remind myself 
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself 
It's Gucci 
Now that I'm finally free 
I'm bouta throw it today 
I take my life in my hands 
Cause I'm a grown-ass man

You'll never take me away (you'll never take me away) 
Took everything that I have (everything that I) 
Now that I'm finally free (oh finally free)

Cause I'm a grown-ass man (I'm a grown-ass man)

And we have a one night stand 
In my brand new benz 
And we ain't gotta worry bout nobody peeping in 
The windows tinted black so it ain't no lookin in 
Bitches talking bout my house 
I think they tryna climb the fence 
They say they want my dick to mouth its a bigger vent 
Pool in my backyard do you like to swim 
Cause Imma work you out and I'm not talking bout the gym 
Gucci just got out but god damn he goin in

Women on my page like damn he gettin slim

Fuck a bird and a bitch, I need a bird in the hand 
Tell your bitch you a camel, make her walk through the sand 
Jump on the plane with 10000 grams 
Cookin' up dope, 10000 hands 
Cookin' up dope, 10000 pants 
I just fucked my 10000th fan 
Got 10000, 10000 bands 
Got so much money that I'm hurting my hand 
Cut 'em off, I don't need you man 
How you bite that hand that feed you man?

Holdin' up Holdin' holdin' holdin' up? 
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane] 
My main bitch, her anklet 
?Bout the same size of a ankle monitor 
If a diva late one time I'mma put her ass on probation 
I'mma give her two scratches 
She's a fuckin' good woman, I'mma give her a life 
I'mma walk by shinin' with a bitch 
Aye, say I had enough in my life 
I got 80 chains, I got 100 rings 
And a nigga can't take my ice 
Caught a murder charge, but I beat the shit 
?Cause a nigga tried to take my life 
I'm a millionaire, but I'm a country boy 
And my right hand man got a Tonka toy 
I sell, charge, I'm servin' boy 
Major saver, I'm the golden boy 
And I serve the pass like Lawyer Milloy 
Poppin' and poppin' and poppin' the shit 
Talkin' that shit, now you shot in the head 
Brick Squad niggas don't shoot in the leg 
Shouts to our fallen, I ball till I fall, and 
The neighbors don't talk ?cause the neighbors are scared 
A white girl, a black girl, a hell of a mix 
Rollin' up kush while they suckin' my dick 
On my chain is a tag team 
All my niggas gettin' money 
You can get tied, 
then tagged then me and your freak'll start fuckin' 
Got two choppers, it's a tag team 
Four bad bitches and it's all to me 
Had to break into like ten houses to ride on these17s 
Oops, my fault, that's your team's line 
I ain't have time, I was grindin' real hard 
People goin' crazy, 
and my mama goin' crazy but belive it or not, bitch, 
I gotta thank the Lord 
Ballin' so hard when I came out of jail 
Now I'mma get a scene and weigh the doja up 
Sippin' on lean ?til I throw up 
What you want to be when you grow up?

But a nigga might turn into a werewolf 
Got a stash box and it's all hundreds 
And your CEO ain't worth nothin' 
Made a half a mil' in three weeks

I'm a real man, you can't feel me, man 
These fucked niggas keep tryin' to hold me back

Now I'm getting older rocking Gucci, Louie loafers 
I still remember the first day that I ain't have to serve smokers 
You brought sand to the beach, I brought toast to the social 
I gave your girlfriend an autographed Gucci Mane poster 
It ain't nothing mothafuckin' secret, hell yea I got shooters 
I'm the plug to the plug, I'm a goddamn Booster 
You ain't no mothafuckin' gangsta, you's a goddamn groupie

On my worst day, I'm worth 10 mil no jewelry

Killers waiting in the bushes just to tie ya ass up 
Gave my young nigga a dub and told him fire ya ass up 
It seem like everywhere you go, somebody try yo ass up

Your son called you a dead beat 
Step on my feet nigga, you dead meat 
I'm grinding up this ground beef 
I think they just wanna surround me 
Self made with a brick too 
Nigga shoes dirty but the stick new 
In the twelfth grade with a big crew 
Now I'm well paid, I can flip few

Head shot like Fredo, fuck nigga don't flinch 
The empire back, that empire back 
I got some whip out in Fulton, my brick just keep bouncing back

Couple niggas got killed at my show last weekend 
But how am I to blame if they were already beefing 
When they first started shooting man we was just leaving 
Try Bricksquad and we won't let you get off that easy 
Gucci Mane the CEO I feel like Eazy 
The rap game love me but the dope game need me 
Baby says she never seen a nigga so freezy 
But these VVS diamonds make me feel like Meech 
I had a pistol in the club the first day I met Weezy 
AR in the car the first day I met Jeezy 
When I first started dissing niggas it was just teasing 
Glock 40 on my hip, it was just me and MacBreezy

Ain't with that bullshit, gucci don't condone it

And the feds said they want to come get me 
But I'm feelin like big micci 
Still go clean like 
See my girl she was keeping two c's on it 
Her dollar card got two b's on it 
Plus all my cars got ounce on em 
But my lil boy's car got e's on it 
Your cd ain't got nothing on it 
Bought your cd, just to roll weed on it 
Your girl told me you ain't got nothing on me 
That's how we rocking 
He drove up in versace, shawty got some mans 
That's how we rocking 
He keep a chopper with him again 
That's how we rock it 
Bitch you so bad I don't care what I'm gone spend 
That's how we rockin 
This how we rocking, these hoes be jogging 
This how we rocking, bottles keep on popping 
This how we rocking, I take you shopping 
This how we rocking, had a trap house on the dead end 
I know you scared then, I bust you head in 
They said that gucci man was broke, I told em nigga when 
Cause I was trapping on my house when I was only ten 
You say you beat then come see me I got that downright then 
And I would killer, killer, killer, kill again

They wanna lock me up like Suge Knight

But I'm too rich to put my dick in that (Bitch, I'm not goin')

They love my drip, you know I'm statin' facts (I'm not goin') 
I'm a CEO, I keep it cordial with an artist, I just don't politic 
These women been giving me compliments 
Focused, I can't acknowledge this 
Astonishment, ugh 
Look at how the game transformed overnight 
Felt like I was just gettin' read my rights 
Look at how the ice hittin' under them lights 
Married to the game, we ain't throwin' no rice 
All-gray sweats with the white G-Nikes 
Ain't too much changed, got too much change 
Come to think about it, I was lookin' at life 
Stack, invest, nigga don't just rap 
Talkin' 'bout dap, nigga can't do that 
Fetch me the keys, I mean remote 
Car got a button, I'm 'bout to float 
I'm organized, it's lookin' organized 
'Cause the front the house looks like a parking lot 
Take off the shirt, check out the work 
Body scribbled like I mark a lot 
Bandana Louis, no vest, and a fully 
Buyin' dogs, I'm investin' in bullies 
I came from that, I perfected my juggin' 
Diamond teeth, got a watch full of boogers 
Got a chef, vegetarian cookin' 
Cameraman, get professional footage 
They told me stop buying all these fancy cars (But I don't wanna) 
They told me, "Please take all your diamonds off" (But I'm not goin') 
I'm gettin' too rich to fly commercial flights ('Cause I don't wanna)

The world's most hate-able, currently unavailable 
Solo roof, I'm hater-proof, pull up, watch what the haters do 
Gucci's antisocial, bipolar, he's unrelatable 
Heard he wrote a novel, got labels, but you can't label him 
Independent labels, they model him and they study him 
Hood rich lingo, he model, but he not stuntin' them 
Northern people come 'round me, flex, start talkin' Southern now 
Movin' like the governor, fuck it, bitch, I'm the governor 
I'm the new Puffy, fuck it, the new 50 
I'm the new Baby (Bling) , fuck it, the new Jimmy 
Big rock frigid (Yeah) , fuckin' up hoes' vision

These lames runnin 'round thinkin they so fly 
Got a lil buzz but Boo been too high 
I'm pullin hoes in da club and I don't even try 
I guess when she glance at my wrist, she wanna get my dick 
I tell her holla at Jeezy if ya wanna pop Cris 
Get at Gucci Mane cuz he on some lil shit 
And you know I'm in da cut, grippin my 4/5 
Like let a nigga trip, naw we ain't runnin 
We just takin all ya chicks, buyin drinks gettin blunted 
Groupies, show you how to do this son 
We throwin out hundreds while you savin them ones 
[Hook:] 
I got so many rocks, on my chain and watch 
I know I'm da shit, my chain hang down to my dick 
I know I'm da bomb, just look at my charms 
I know I'm da shit, my chain hang down to my dick 
[Chorus] 
I'm so icy 
Look at my charms 
My...chain...hang...down...to my dick</field>

Wop 
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy 
Burr, burr, burr, burr 
But she a sheisty lil bitch 
The bitch is so sheisty 
Bling-bling, bling-blaow 
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy 
Burr, burr, burr, burr 
But she a sheisty lil bitch 
The bitch is so sheisty 
Bling-bling, bling-blaow 
Man the bitch got fresh 
At the mouth so I iced her 
She said something so slick I disliked her 
If you ain't getting no cash 
Like this you can't pipe her 
But if you rock a watch 
Like this it entice her 
Man I can't even front 
On the chick cause she grinding 
Necklace full of diamonds 
Wrist and fist blinding 
The type of chick that guwap like 
You can't find 
It's a clause in my young bitch 
Contract you can't sign 
Her closet like rodeo 
Got all type of designers and 
Every time she leave up out the house 
Niggas remind her 
That she the baddest bitch 
In the world and they want her 
But she just a material girl 
Just like madonna 
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy 
Burr, burr, burr, burr 
But she a sheisty lil bitch 
The bitch is so sheisty 
Bling-bling, bling-blaow 
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy 
Burr, burr, burr, burr 
But she a sheisty lil bitch 
The bitch is so sheisty 
Bling-bling, bling-blaow 
Chilling in the pent playing jazz 
She got jazzy 
She's a pretty lil bitch 
But her mouth is too nasty 
The way she do the trick with her tongue 
The bitch had me 
She's a spoiled girl, rotten 
So bad, I play daddy 
See I'm the type of rich 
That I give before you ask me 
I got the type of dick 
Make a rich girl start harassing 
I started in the trap 
Then I switched and started rapping 
She started drinking shots 
Of patron and started laughing 
Start rocking passion fruit 
Now she sucking me with a passion 
A fire breathing dragon 
She riding me like a taxi 
We started off as friends 
And then we started smashing 
Soon as she got a good dose 
Of the macking she start bragging 
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy 
Burr, burr, burr, burr 
But she a sheisty lil bitch 
The bitch is so sheisty 
Bling-bling, bling-blaow 
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy 
Burr, burr, burr, burr 
But she a sheisty lil bitch 
The bitch is so sheisty 
Bling-bling, bling-blaow</field>

Fiji diamond bracelet on, they so thirsty 
Baby got an ass on her, it's so perfect 
She tryna make me glance at her, and it's workin' 
Gucci keep them bands on him, he Mr 
Perfect 
No feeling, no ceiling, he so verted 
Ayy, ayy, ayy 
Big bands on me, I'ma throw it on the floor 
Run it up and hit the mall, I spend it at the Gucci store 
Shawty know I'm in designer from my head down to my toes 
Oh, you say you wanna cuff me? I ain't trustin' in no ho 
Why you say I do too much when you know you do the most 
It's a celebration, I might have to make a toast 
I just did it for my city, now they calling me the GOAT 
Looking for the right direction, I ain't have nowhere to go 
She a bad girl, she catching mood swings 
She wanna stay the night, and drink the D'usse 
She said I follow you, and do what you say 
This can be forever boy, master, you're my sensei, ayy 
I still fuck her like a mad Russian, she mad crushin'

Wanna make love, love, love 
[verse 1: gucci mane] 
King of the skreets 
And when these suckas see me 
They should bow to my feet 
And kiss the ground underneath 
I look down at the beef 
That shit childish to me 
Two hundred thousand to see me 
And it's been sold out for weeks 
Can't brush shoulders with me 
These stones in my choker are 2 karats apiece 
Look like boulders to me 
Damn, who colder than me? 
You think he colder than me? 
You more bipolar than me 
You talkin' crazy 
I'm tryna book beyoncé for my wedding day 
I'm the type of nigga 
Spend a million on a wedding cake 
Niggas hate, but hesitate 
They hate to see ya elevate 
I just left out the gym 
I'm 'bout to take a swim and meditate 
Woo! 
Now it's time to celebrate 
Ask me why I'm smilin' 
I say, "'cause I make two mil' a day" 
And I might take your bitch and pay her bills 
That's how I feel today 
And I just wanna fuck 
Don't wanna chill, that's how I feel today 
[chorus: gucci mane] 
I'm makin' money like I'm makin' sweet love 
I wanna make love, love, love 
She say the money make her wanna make love 
Wanna make love, love, love, huh

Ay yo, ain't talkin' housewives 
But I'm in the porsche 
First I'ma scorch her, then I'ma torch her 
Then I'ma torture her, then I'ma off her 
A million dollars for a show 
They made their off-er 
Go against nicki, it's gon' cost ya 
'cause now it's fuck ya, intercourse ya 
I rep queens 
Where they listen to a bunch of nas 
I'm a yes and these bitches 
Is a bunch of nahs 
Tryin' to win a gunfight 
With a bunch of knives 
I win, get off the bench 
And give a bunch of fives 
I don't see her 
Bitch I'm the greatest 
No kendrick and no sia 
I'm the iphone, you the nokia 
Everybody know you jealous 
Bitch it's so clear 
Tell them bum ass bitches to play their role 
She see my sexy ass every time she scroll 
I got it in the can, dole 
Your career gon' be with anna nicole 
Witcha dumbass face 
She ain't eatin' 
But I swear she got some bum ass taste 
Text her man like, "dawg 
How that bum ass taste? " 
Pay your rent! 
And stay in your bum ass place 
OOhh 
Oh you the qu-e-e-the queen of this here? 
One platinum plaque, album flopped 
Bitch, where? (bitch, where?) 
Hahaha, ahh 
I took two bars off just to laugh 
You see, silly rabbit 
To be the queen of rap 
You gotta sell records 
You gotta get plaques 
S, plural like the s on my chest 
Now sit your dumbass down 
You got an f on your test

I pray to god I don't ever go broke 
I ain't never ever stopped selling dope 
And I'll never stop buying mink coats

Still saying Imma get rich one day 
Imma get money every goddamn day 
Broke ass niggas can't get no date 
In the club, singing out, shawty swing my way 
Money will talk like a high top fade 
I'm a rich kid, baby who wanna come play? 
At the club live on a Sunday 
screaming out free my nigga Fortre 
Sir Mixalot, my [?] are on broadway 
Serve bricks a lot, I got so much yay 
She a filthy bitch, she got a filthy twat 
I can tell that the bitch sucks dicks a lot

Never friends with a shitbag, get glad or get mad

To my entourage, no gas masks 
I'm in my old school, with the Georgia tag 
With my Georgia ass and my red flag 
I'm g'd up from the feet up 
in my black van wit my feet up 
And the blinds down and the beat up 
Short bad bitch with the seat up 
You know me, from the old me 
On John screen with the ?, 
I was low key, at hb, 
Now I'm 3d, come face me 
I went toe to toe with the best of 'em 
I bust shots at the rest of 'em 
Don't test me, no tester 
I rape you, like Chester 
I'm a rich ass nigga you bitch ass nigga, 
You a ...so snitch ass nigger 
Work to the game feel some to the fame 
Wear enough on me in this... 
I'ma tell you twice, cause it's Gucci two times 
Fuck your clique and fuck your wife 
If you got drama nigga, you can meet me outside 
Get your head bust wide for your old man's pride 
Chorus: 
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold, rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold, rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold, with a mouth full of gold, with a mouth full of gold (x 4)

Rich young G with gold teeth 
A triple black cat just crossed my path 
But its a 4 door jaguar

Tell him Louie chasing and he feel like no one else 
Tell him Peewee Longway say he feel like no one else 
Tell him big Guwop say that he feel like no one else 
Tell him little Guwop say that he feel like no one else 
When I copped that rover, man, I drove like no one else 
When he called it out, I bet he drove like no one else 
When he bought a phantom 
bet he drove like no one else 
When your ho leave Guwop bet she feel like no one else 
 
[Verse 1: Young Thug] 
I got a bad bitch, said that she feel like nobody 
And no vampire, but I got boyfriends divided 
Made a hundred k I'm rapping, rapping 
That my habit 
Now you meet the newest member of the goddamn library 
This monkey bitch crabbing 
so I guess I know her partner 
I don't know her 
but she say she know the mother of my daughter 
I'm not talking 'bout no dad 
but we don't have to go farther 
I don't care, but if you ever need booze 
I take your hard-earned 
I'm looking like my middle name 
That ass fat from a mile away 
I got my mother's friends 
I like that pussy balling head 
I'm thugger, major pain 
I put that icing on her grill 
Just like Johnny Day 
Johnny Day 
Hallelujah!

[Verse 2: Young Thug] 
When I'm in the house

Got your bitch into her vest

Now roll my weed, that stuff two grams 
We fucked up, two cups in the fountain 
Lord, that ain't us, that's country grammar 
Talking like a country boy, I stay in Atlanta 
Y'all niggas ain't know I sell mud out the fountain 
Clienteles'll get your ass scrubbed in Atlanta 
Skinny Beretta on [?] , don't scrub in the Audi 
Uk, foreign whip, don't know a nigga like it 
Switch a royal k, bitch, I thought a nigga like it 
Guwop, Guap and Thug in the posse 
Ain't shit like us, cause we going in your pockets 
Boot it up, nigga, took off like a rocket 
We the plug in the socket 
Taking nigga's bitch is a hobby 
Run around the motherfucking lobby 
Woppa and Thug 
Back to back serving in the 'rari 
Got racks that are older than Atari 
Guwop and the bud 
Jeffing out the plug with a thousand 
Brick Factory count up a thousand 
Sipping mud out the mug, white phone stuck 
A nigga whiling, you'll never see another nigga like it 
 
[Hook] 
[Verse 3: Gucci Mane] 
They say I walk like cash, and I talk too fast 
Girl to the mall yeah I bought her two bags 
Gucci Mane tryna sell more houses 
Don't give a damn that I used to sell ounces 
My block be my trap house, that was powerful 
Sell a man's apartment, shit, to make housing 
Gucci is the God, man, you don't want to start it 
Have the world 
We'll say "Dearly Departed" 
All she wrote 
Bend her and hanging 
Fat give her [?] quote end quote 
I sell dope, I cut coat 
Especially if that ass Boat Imma keep it up [?] 
I'm the captain, all aboard 
Come on while you can afford it 
If I ain't rapping I'd be working 
Is that hard for you to absorb? 
For the free monkeys from me 
Serve it to you dirty cheap 
Dirty dog, dirty job, so Imma charge you thirty-three 
Serve to check my style, yeah, you stole it like a burglary 
Now I'm on emergency I keep on making currencies 
 
[Hook] 
[Verse 4: Peewee Longway] 
Ok, now when she on that molly she turn to somebody else 
She so rich as fuck she tried to do it by herself 
I told her it's Versace, watch how you pulling on that belt 
And these are Christians loose

I'm with Longway, I'm with [?] , pull an eight up by myself 
Pull up in that foreign feature 'rari, hop out and just sit 
Touchdown in La, turned seventeen, got they injection 
I seen Guwop call up Birdman, say 100k a bet 
Why everytime you see the kid

When the sun comes out it takes the rain away 
But just like noah it been rainin' 
The last 40 days 
Takin' pain pills, tryna take the pain away 
Sold my first 8-ball and bought me my first pair of j's 
Momma cussing out these disrespectful ass j's 
They knockin' on the door 
Know I'm just in the 7th grade 
I'm mixin' codeine pills and molly in a lemonade 
I'm feelin' like briscuit so damn high 
Might just die any day 
For all you junkies that's addicted 
Please don't get offended 
I'm a recovering drug addict 
And that's not my intention 
That og gas hit my mailbox 
Like a magazine subscription 
My doctor in the feds 
For writing bad prescriptions 
I got so drunk I left (?) 
And I crashed a bentley 
I'm a mathematician 
I'm too stoned to miss it 
I got the best intentions 
But I made rash decisions 
Throwin' cash at bitches 
Spend like half a chicken 
Before I started rapping 
I was worth half a ticket 
Took your stash to get it 
Or spent it so fast it's silly 
I drop the top on my rolls royce 
I ride past the prison 
They hate with a passion 
I guess that's the new fashion, is it

Where's Rudolph red nose when I really need him 
A bunch of elves on the team and I gotta feed em 
They carry sawed off pumps so it's hard to feed em 
I gift wrap a pipe bomb, bring it to your door 
Ring the bell sit back and watch the fucker blow 
So how you build the snowman with all this melted snow

I made a hundred thousand dollars and the Texaco 
They locked me up and let me out I feel like Plaxico

Yup 
I'm rebellious and fearless, I laugh at failure 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
I'm a prophet, a legend, I'm not beggin' 
I'd rather die for my freedom than live like a peasant 
The precious, recessions, the past and the present 
Slavery to segregation, I still rob with my brethren 
Get these choppas up up off me, I'm street but I'm Godly 
Know these white folks fear me but nothin' can stop me 
I was destined to be this so nothin' amaze me 
My best attribute is bravery, they think that I'm crazy 
Ask Gucci if you with me, then let's get to walkin' 
Cause I'm sick and tired of everybody doing nothin' but talkin' 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my payer 
Know you ain't take me this far just to leave me here 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, I know that life's unfair 
But who gon take care of the family if I'm not there? (Lord) 
Dear Lord, oh Lord 
I gotta feed the family 
But I had to leave the family 
I cut off Cmb, I'm an amputee 
But I never leave Christianity 
Might have to plead insanity 
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday 
I'mma pray for you niggas, then celebrate 
Lord I know these streets contaminate 
But Lord I can't get beat like Anna Mae 
Lord I gotta think about Reginae 
And Lil Tune and Lil Neal and Lil Cameron 
Lord, I gotta think like I'm Hemingway 
Make a way, wish a way, anyway, anyway 
Lord I gotta create and innovate 
Or else it's back to the interstate 
Wheeling in my fortunes 
Willing to kill you just for my fortunes 
I can recall we were chillin' on porches 
Living with roaches, dealin' with hoe shit 
Tending to lotion, now we in motion, everything kosher 
God bless the 'Nolia, God bless Angola 
Rest in Peace Soulja and all of the soldiers 
The war isn't over, call on Jehovah, Lord 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my payer 
Know you ain't take me this far just to leave me here 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer 
Dear Lord, oh Lord, I know that life's unfair 
But who gon take care of the family if I'm not there? (Lord) 
Dear Lord, oh Lord 
Mula baby 
Dear Lord, oh Lord 
Dear Lord, oh Lord 
Dear Lord, oh Lord 
I gotta feed the family 
Dear Lord, oh Lord</field>

Buildin' another mansion out of town, am I crazy? (Go) 
All these dead white men in my safe, I'm feelin' racist 
Runnin' out of space in all my safe, I need some spaces 
I asked Todd where he find me and Big Cat where he sign me (Cat) 
Speaker phone on with the plug, I'm whippin' up a nine piece (Skrrt) 
Fevzi made my jewelry, I'm standing next to QCP 
I'm feelin' like they watchin' me, I think they wanna rob me 
Haters lookin' envious, I'm lookin' at they faces (Fuck 'em) 
I keep coppin' money, coppin' jets, and goin' places 
Think I'm gettin' good 'cause I'm peepin' nationalities 
My bitch changed her wig then she switched her personality (Wop) 
Protect yourself at all times, that's on God (God) 
I don't do songs with my opps, that's on God (Fuck 'em) 
I don't shake hand with my opps, that's on God (Pussy)

If I ain't a millionaire 
Then my lil boy can grow a pussy 
If guwop ain't bout his business 
Then popeye must be a sissy 
And if you ain't getting money I don't wanna talk to ya 
Cause how you let a nigga in the feds out do you 
I'm not politically correct 
Cause bitch I ain't no politician 
I can't hang round none of you niggas 
Cause you niggas might be snitchin' 
But I ain't gotta deal with you 
I ain't eat with you 
How you bitches let 
These bogus ass niggas sleep with you 
I can't live with you lay with you 
Take that pussy with you 
I can't put up with you 
I ain't got free dick to give you 
They tried to cool with ya 
Chill with ya take no pictures 
The fuck I look like standing

I'm laughing to myself cause these rappers so broke 
They sold no dope they dont want no smoke 
How they let a nigga in the feds out do em 
I ain't got no rap I let my chopper talk to em 
A nigga need me, I don't need no nigga 
I'm the shooter and the boss I don't need no killer 
The money that he make don't make me richer 
I'm the slickest nigga walkin' I don't need no feature 
Sittin on the hood of my brand new bentley 
Old neighborhood with some brand new jewelry 
Big diamond rings like a old school preacher 
Bitch let a nigga out the feds come beat ya

It's Gucci 
[Waka Flocka Flame] 
I'm the young nigga all the old head love dawg (FLOCKA!) 
I ain't lettin shit slide, this ain't baseball (BRICK SQUAAAD!) 
Banned in 45 states cause 
I'm too real 
Waka Flocka like a Gucci album, 
I'm hard to kill 
I don't think they fuckin with me whether 
I'm locked dead or in jail 
I'm from Clayon County, 
Riverdale so I'm supposed to give 'em hell 
I'm aware the grass got snakes, 
I'm aware they gon' hate 
You too late, I'll be damned you take this dinner off our plate 
Dirty Birds, Dirty Birds, twenty-one gun salute and got killed 
It's Bankhead Brick Squad out in U.K., these niggaz ain't fuckin with me 
Mob up off that run day, SK's, AK's 
Throwaways I let that triple up like {?} triple beam we crackin 
[Chorus] 
[8Ball] 
Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka and ya boy big Ball 
Hard from the start; I ain't never been no fuckin lame 
Here I go with Waka Flocka, 
here I go with Gucci Mane 
One of a kind - that Memphis 10 runnin through my bloodstream 
Ghetto superstar - man them hood bitches love me 
Cup full of that ol' purple drank, pullin on some of that stanky dank 
Pocket full of Benny Frank and bitch, what the fuck you thank? 
45 hollowheads in my stout, yellow purt{?} 
I hope one of these ol' bitch bitch-ass niggaz don't cross that line and get hurt 
Money what we came to get, money what we represent 
You ain't talkin 'bout shit if you ain't talkin 'bout gettin it 
Hard hustle never fold, forever I will be cold 
Forever I will be big Ball, mouth full of gold

I'm the t-r-a-p-g-o-d 
In the a with an fn h on me 
Know the feds want to build another case on me 
Eight hunnid' got a nigga whole safe on me 
And I'm marching with the bands fam, you want me 
It's a battle of the bands in the vip 
And she say she go to class but she dance at t's 
I dare anybody here to put their hands on me? 
Put the stick up, kids want to kidnap me 
Got a sig on me, are you kidding me? 
A little freak lied and tried to put a kid on me 
And my own homeboys called the pigs on me 
But my faith got stronger and my money grew longer 
Sold all my artists now, gucci mane a fucking loner 
I'm a part time rapper, I'm a full time owner 
Breaking rules and bending corners 
Crack your head with a corona

Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces 
When it all falls apart we pick up the pieces 
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces 
Just hit the streets, hit my jeweler and pick up the pieces 
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces 
Break a brick down then pick up the pieces 
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces 
When it all falls apart we pick up the pieces

I got a fn h on side of me 
Case my enemies feel they want to ride on me 
'bout to throw up in this club, all this ace inside of me 
Bad bitch in front of me, these weak ho's can't front on me 
Ugly ho's can't sell pussy, rich niggas can't fuck for free 
Bad lil' standing in vip, we run off in luxury 
Throwing money ain't nothing to me 
I'm just giving these broke ho's something to see 
2pac all eyez on me, 2chainz yeah, feds watching me 
To live crew, gucci two times hit one 
Too many bitch and I might be 
Haters talking don't worry me, all they do is encourage me 
I'm a worldwide executive, neighborhood celebrity 
Ain't nothing in this world gon' stop me from getting currency 
These bad bitches cherish me, lil' niggas look up to me 
Put my ap and my rollie on when they bury me 
Scared of me, you better be 
Tell me who ain't heard of me 
I just offed another hundred piece 
Bought a watch for eighty g

Now she aint really pretty but she got a nice body 
Im geeked up thinkin this Buffie The Body

Im off three double stacks and Im lookin for that action 
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowin 
Ridin in my drop but I dont know where Im goin 
On two eighty five i keep ridin in a circle 
The inside of my ride smellin like a pound of purple 
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes and a cold orange juice cause im really really trippin

The next thing you know I was throwin rubberbands 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 2:]

You a lie but I aint gonna get upset right now 
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now 
You say you marry well bitch you might be 
But I bet your husband aint Icy like me 
She stand on B.C

When dem dope man nikes and dem jore ass jeans

Aint no waffle house baby hell I cant eat

They know my glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music 
We call it pop music, we call it pop music 
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music

The studio is the house, so we making house music 
Come ride with me through the six and see how the south do it

Take my 44 handle, shot through the door panel

The trap god, I make it rain and I make it snow 
I use my money as a blanket, it was better cold 
In buckhead in a drop head, pulled me over laney's row 
Versace slippers with the matching saint glass, hiss and roll 
I bulletproofed the sprinter cause I got a hundred foes 
I spent a million, so how the fuck am I not gonna get parole? 
I feel like lester coke, cause I don't touch the dope 
You feel like lester man 
You took the oath and told the folks (snitches) 
Don't think that I don't know they wish I was on death row 
But imagine how these crackers feel that I moved next door

Knowin' I ain't got no time to waste 
Be fuckin' around with no nickel bitch 
Your nigga pinchin' pennies 
But I'm out here making these millions, bitch 
Don't ask me who I'm votin' for 
Cause I got all the presidents 
My bitch walk 'round in lingerie 
All day, she think she elegant 
It's an elephant in the room 
Guess who's the mothafuckin' elephant? (It's Gucci) 
Maybach in the garage, elevator in the residence

We hit the city, the old me goin' Oc 
How a friend only gonna watch that, it's so weak 
Seven times in a row, I could go the whole week 
I could take you from the nosebleeds to the floor seats 
But I need that, in the sauna 
In the bathroom, at your mama's 
Like a porn star, I'm a monster

In the G-string, girl I want you

In my bedroom, in the guestroom 
In the restroom, fuck it, every room

Do anybody know somebody who know somebody? 
Who know somebody who know somebody who got the mollys 
Karate Kid but I don't even know karate 
Kush got my eyes low like Mr 
Miyagi 
East Atlanta Santa, yeah my stomach fat and jolly 
Fucked up 50 grand in Vegas with my nigga (?) 
Got the battle of the bands going in my Robin's 
And if you think of robbin Gucci, you gon have some problems.. 
Servin pizza pies, all my pies got extra toppings 
And I be shittin on all these niggas just like pigeon droppings 
30 grand in all hundreds, I don't do the wallet 
And I'm about to fly to New York cause I'm going shoppin 
[Bridge] 
I take a brick, break off a brick and cook a deuce 
Way I'm beating up all these babies call it child abuse 
Way I'm beating that white girl, that's domestic violence 
And my money talk for me cause I be being quiet 
[Hook] x2 
Quiet, quiet, cause I be being quiet 
I let my money talk for me because I'm being quiet 
[Verse 2] 
Break a 4-way off a brick and then I'm bout to fry it 
My money gettin obese, your shit is on a diet 
I sip lean all day every day until the kid is tired 
I make em search for that ? cause this pussy's wired 
If you think you can defeat me, fuck it nigga, try it 
I got squares all in my trunk I think he wanna buy it 
Got a G-4 but I do not have no one to fly it 
I'm so fly that I might stop rappin and be a pilot 
Gucci Mane the shit and you can't deny it 
I got the game in a knot and you can't untie it 
I let my money do the talking, I be being quiet.. 
And I get money out the streets but keep my business private! 
[Bridge] 
I take a brick, break off a brick and cook a deuce 
Way I'm beating up all these babies call it child abuse

Hey girl I'm tearin it up and they knowin that

At the rack everyday and they knowin that 
Well I'm blowin that and I'm doin this 
And my red flag got the haters pissed 
Don't reckless, this not a diss 
This not a threat, this real shit 
And don't play me, cause ain't no stoppin me 
Ain't no toppin me, and ain't no robbin me 
Cut the robbers outs, I brought the goons out 
We reckless, we O.G. 
On Acuras and they textin us 
But who gives a fuck and who gives a damn? 
I'm blood in and blood out on Flat Shoals with big sand 
And Waka Flocka, thanks Flocka Waka 
Two times, cause we two crimes 
Two bloods and two rides with fo' nines and gang signs 
So what's up? The pricety, I'm icey and Icey 
I'm the king of diamonds and the princess shinin 
And all mine behind me 
[Chorus: repeat 8X] 
Let's get reckless, let's get reckless

Oh yeah! Cap, I'm in beast mode 
Hell yeah I'm on reckless

Respect this or meet your death wish

Don't fuck with us, get the fuck from 'round 
Cause I like to pop and we sucker free 
Reckless, reckless, e'rybody goin HAM 
Don't test this, cause if you do 
That Smith and Wesson go blam, damn 
Look what the fuck done happened 
Just cause you heard that a nigga start rappin 
That I'm worryin about the {?} pulled out 
No toppin, no clappin, clear the whole scene I'm smashin 
Bye, gone - boy you better catch up nigga 
Get hit from your neck up nigga 
Nobody wan' fess up, get your block up 
Leave the whole scene full of ketchup nigga 
They are wildin, on wildin, on ballin, they violent 
I got the little man sydrome, get me in the end zone 
Signin autographs who's stylin? 
[Chorus] 
[Chill Will] 
Huh? Huh? Huh? 
Vacation in Miami, they say I'm swag surfin 
Your girl with ya she ain't lookin but her ass flirtin 
See I'm a classy nigga, a thousand dollar curtains 
And I just made yo' nigga mad cause his pocket hurtin 
And I don't mean I'm jackin off when I say I'm chokin chickens 
I mean, when we rap on mo' we call that chokin chickens 
I got a talkin code, for all he knows it folds 
Too buck to be on probation, too rich to be on parole 
My dawgs love me on I'm on the mic talkin reckless 
Stuntin, ballin, million dollar flexin 
My dawgs love me on I'm on the mic talkin reckless

And say I like to start shit but I'm not with the fuckery 
Don't talk about my last crime

And I can't let ya pass by 
Cause baby girl, you too fine 
East atlanta gangsta 
I ain't trynna get my phone [taken?] 
My home boy tried to steal from me 
That's why he got 4 fingers 
Cookin with a clothes hanger, eat it like he stole something 
Ask me can he hold some, I told him I can find him some 
Called him for la mount of some 
Turned into the punisher 
Call your auntie or your uncle 
Bitch you better get my money up!

My baby mad she woke up 
Told me it's a brick in the bed 
I told her don't sleep all wild 
Tonight there's a stick in the bed 
And if them folks run in here 
Tonight I just might take off they leg 
I cook a brick real good 
But I can't cook a egg 
They said I failed a piss test but I went smokin on reggie 
They say the feds on the walk but I'm 3 steps ahead 
They say the nigga on the building might jump off the ledge 
They say that guwop did that, yeah is that what they said? 
But guwop bring the 9 give 10 what he said

I still think about the day that I was robbed 
Young and invincible I thought that I was hard 
But ain't no games getting played in mountain park 
That shit get ugly down there like bubba sparks 
They'll take the food off 
Your plate and you'll starve 
In east atlanta even robbers getting robbed 
Them niggas hungry and they need a meal card 
They make a king pin get a real job 
I done robbed niggas I done got robbed 
I done sold soft and I done sold hard 
I done got away and I done got caught 
So if I'm crazy then it ain't my fault

Dough came of with the first kick 
I had a chick named angel so thick 
She watch me come up from a crum to a brick 
I know that karma is a bitch real shit 
But I don't rob one nigga I rob clicks 
The niggas I came up with got no sense 
Break in your house ask them they don't know shit 
They snatch you up and make you call your folks 
And tell them go and get all your dough 
Don't bring em to em then your throat slit 
Man I don't play no games my four slick

Who you wanna shoot but I dont wanna go back 
You dont wanna do that why you gotta prove that?

Why would you woo that? 
Crazy color coupe what you wanna do?

Sippin absolut (eghh) 
Im walkin from the car line straight to the boost 
So my swagger through the roof

My cane came from peru 
My car paint pyroon 
Piss body say sawoo 
My earrings came in blue 
We walk in different hues 
See me on the news 
My lawyer is a jew 
In case you wanna sue 
I got alot of scoons 
Your beef aint nothing new

Same color as a suit 
And I aint got on a suit

Conduct yourself one class on me tasha dont disturb me

Can think of, I spent it 
Any car out in the streets I've driven 
Any bad bitch you could think of 
I hit it 
shawty wanna give me that ass tonight 
But a nigga hating and he won't let it go 
What he don't know is I dunn been there before? 
Hit it ho, baby hit his ho</field>

The legendary Dj Scream 
The legendary Gucci Mane 
The young legend Dj Spinz 
And this Trap God 2 nigga 
I guess run cool you a game but you just a fuckin lame 
I can put you up on something but you still wouldn't learn nothing 
You know the game is to be sold man, it not for you lames man 
(Can't just give that shit to you nigga) 
I spent half of my life nigga sellin crack cocaine 
(.. 
in this shit nigga) 
[Verse 1:] 
I'm a victim of the dope game, I don't like to name names 
I don't like the main drop, I just like cocaine drop 
All I do is drop top, man I'm so goddamn high 
If you got a old car then go get a new one 
If you don't got no strap go and get yo 2 gun 
Got a bitch so fine with me, she make me wanna do some 
I told her baby call me Mr 
Never Ever Use A Coupon 
Baby got that slow tone, my trap like a group home 
I'm bad with niggas but I'm good with bitches 
Man Gucci Mane so superstitious 
I like the riches, no pot to piss in 
Three years going I ain't seen no Christmas 
Six months going I ain't seein no drop 
Work so good it don't ever get slow 
Putting bar doors on all my houses 
I'm a put hardwood on all my floors 
[Hook:] 
Talk a bitch, drag a bitch so bad I need a damn cover 
Pimp nigga ain't turning shit down but my damn collar 
Police running at me tryna snatch me by my damn collar 
Gucci Mane ain't never graduate but I'm a trap scholar 
Talk a bitch, drag a bitch so bad I need a damn cover 
Pimp nigga ain't turnin shut down but my damn collar 
Police man be chasin, wanna grab me by my damn collar 
Gucci Mane didn't graduate, but guess what, I'm a trap scholar 
[Verse 2:] 
Hit the club I'm clean as hell but yea I got them 30 dollars 
Drag a bitch so bad I need a goddamn dog collar 
Pull up in 3 Phantoms like I'm crib flow damn dollars 
And if your bitch with me, no need to call, don't even bother 
Limpin, screamin, pimpin, turn my trap to a damn brothel 
Need these pieces on my Charger, tryna dodge every pothole 
You ain't gotta worry bout yo bitch cause yo boys got er 
Said she want some dick, then guess what she gon get a whole lotta 
Nothing but I think I need a goddamn El Dorado 
Big face Rollie keep it rolling, fore I leave ya holy moly 
I'm golden, call me Goldie 
Can't none of these fuck niggas hold me 
I'm a young nigga but a Og 
I'm about to turn me into the old me 
And no Oc, I could Od cause I drink so much damn codeine 
I'm solo, no codeine 
And this Mac11s my homie 
I'm up ain't talkin bout mollies 
I'm up ain't talkin bout coffee 
I don't give a damn about you nigga and don't give a damn about the police 
[Hook:] 
Talk a bitch, drag a bitch so bad I need a damn cover 
Pimp niggas ain't turning shit down but my damn collar

I use to trap on the corner but that was decades ago 
I was high as a cloud and that was seconds ago 
I had the game in the lock a couple records ago 
And I aint never trust nobody I would check in the door 
And if you spend a living molding your necklace will glow 
He see me textin the phone and I aint choking the hoe 
But he keep talkin bout a gangsta, he put fault in the hoe 
I gave my dentist a 50 just for my trophies to show 
I look like Pablo Escobar the way Im holding the drow 
I feel like Bunklin George 
I got so many bills from the plug 
I got a suite apartment in the part mit under the rug 
And every drank in my frigerator filled up with mud 
[Hook:] 
I dont know bout nobody else but I dont servin 
And as long as these bads come in Im gonna circle 
Niggas say they aint getting money but I dont work it 
Im runnin with so much dough that Im nervous 
If the police tryina pull up on me Im gonna swerve em 
You aint never seen so many guns on one person 
Dump truck, 2 trucks came on one person 
You need to switch up the shit you doin, just aint working 
[Verse 2:] 
They got me feeling like me, no couple mill in the safe 
But when snitched at the end, it was a slap in the face 
I need a bitch like Keyshia, shout your mill of the day 
And Puggy smoke, what the fuck G minor 
put some trust in the J 
13 thousand dollars worth of narcotics 
wrapped in some tape 
I spent 130 thousand dollars just on my drapes 
I got a coke model, supermodel feedin me grapes 
And you can keep the money nigga 
cause your payment too late 
And you aint coming with me nigga 
you tryina run in the way 
Youre just a spy telling lies, tryina look at our play 
You call me country to my face, I hit your ass with this K 
Tomahawk, chop your head off, home of the brave 
[Hook:] 
I dont know bout nobody else but I dont servin 
And as long as these bads come in Im gonna circle 
Niggas say they aint getting money but I dont work it

Ain't no bougie bitch

Curves like a coke bottle

Got choppas like I'm big papa

I'm out pussy 
It's your worst nightmare 
Glacier, hah 
I was just sittin' in a cell playin' solitaire 
Now they see me everywhere, bracelet full of solitaires 
Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire 
Bad bitch from Fort Lauderdale, said she love them solitaires 
Four mil for the crib, one point five just to keep me chill (One point five) 
Who my neighbors is? Jack and Jill, still trap up the hill (Through the hill) 
Fiji water, talkin' Aquafina, glass, crystal clear (Clear) 
Ice there, ice here (Ice) , I just iced the atmosphere 
(Huncho) , I'm walkin' real light (Walk) 
It's somethin' like skatin' on ice (Skate) 
Your ho wanna fuck my vibe (Sheesh) 
Huncho Brett Favre, throw pies (Huncho) 
Uh, try the gang and we dumpin' (Dumpin') 
Glacier Boy, it's a global warmin' (Yeah) 
Now everybody wanna come join in (Gang) 
Niggas born in, they ain't sworn in (No) 
I was just sittin' in the cell playin' solitaire (Huh) 
Now they see me everywhere, bracelet full of solitaires (Wow) 
Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire 
Bad bitch from Fort Lauderdale, say she love them solitaires (Mwah) 
Bitch, I don't play no solitaire (No) , I'm a fuckin' millionaire (Yeah) 
Trap stars everywhere (Trap) , bad hoes everywhere 
Right wrist quarter million dollars, that's no lie, huh 
Left wrist, all baguettes, I put it in the sky 
All my stones single, man, they ain't with the mingling 
Damn near smashed the whole clip, but we ain't with that kinky shit 
Wop be on that Nicki shit, my whole clique robbin' 
Lookin' at the robbers like, "Y'all ain't finna take shit" 
Glacier Boy, amazin' shit, your jeweler ain't up on this 
Crazy diamond bracelet, I'm jealous of my own wrist 
You ain't spent a million yet, you probably won't agree with this 
Make jewelers compete for us, we keep on coppin' pieces (It's Gucci) 
I was just sittin' in the cell playin' solitaire 
Now they see me everywhere, bracelet full of solitaires 
Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire

(Mike Will Made It) 
Burr! 
It's Gucci! 
Mike Will 
Burr! 
[Hook] 
I'm in the kitchen cooking babies in my long johns 
3 Swishers put together, that's a long one 
I got a Bankhead bitch 
That bitch from Zone 1 
I said the trappin' gonna catch up in the long run 
I'm in the kitchen tryna make it do the long jump 
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps 
Look like speed bumps, look like speed bumps 
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps 
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane] 
I swear I seen it 
You never seen it 
I really seen it 
Tiss and Tina was the meanin' 
Y'all really mean it 
The cleaners 
Blocks in your tires and you can't peek the meters 
When I scream it 
I really mean it, won't see the evening 
Man, I'm freezing 
So fuck the cold, and I got the sneezies 
There for seasons 
These stripper hoes will suck me till I'm sleepin' 
Leaving Magic, I'm drunk as fuck 
so you know we weavin' 
Ain't no secret 
You niggas know that I don't fuck with Jeezy 
It was tragic, wars everywhere 
they say the boy was bleeding 
It was easy 
I eat yo crew up like some Reese's Pieces 
This is street shit 
So once you say this shit you can't delete it 
Twice a week, bitch 
My plug would pull up, and drop me off the pieces 
[Hook] 
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane] 
I bought all of the sessions, ain't no sessions left 
A 150 bottles, but I'm by myself 
I'm fresh as hell 
Pocket full of dollar bills 
On the real, I buy the deal 
I push weight like I'm in the gym 
You better chill 
Before I kidnap and ransom one of your relatives 
And when that pistol in your face 
You have no choice, you better kill 
None of y'all niggas got better dope 
None of y'all niggas got better pills 
Y'all don't know about popping seals 
[?] re-rocking squares 
It's Gucci Man and Mike Will 
So you chillin' with a bunch of players 
Say that you a gangsta bitch 
But came in with a bunch of squares 
Louboutin's with pony hair 
Imagine with money belt 
[?] 
All wasted standing on furniture

House full of naked hoes snortin' blow 
Its so lonely at the top, plus its real cold 
A house full of hoes and they kickin' blow 
I'm a zone six nigga and you know I'm pourin' 
Middle of the winter I pull up in a vert 
Its the middle of december 
She pulled up in a skirt 
Santa claus of the hood 
I pull up with the work 
They call me east atlanta santa 
Run up on me get murked 
I'm just trappin' through the snow 
Sellin' nine half a bricks in four ways 
Over the hills we go 
Got an extendo and an ak 
I'm a neighborhood philanthropist 
I'm sellin' bells of cannabis 
Preachin' like an evangelist 
But I don't fuck with amateurs 
I drive spiders yea tarantulas 
My diamonds are Immaculate 
I'm not on no romantic shit 
But I'm cookin' cocaine candle lit 
I'm so true your hoe can't handle it 
But damn that bitch can suck a dick 
Skeeted on her face and lip 
Guwop can't fuck no basic bitch 
The teacher teachin' arithmetic 
Show you how to whip a brick 
Learn you how you run your clip 
And told you how to kill your's 
My young girl she a freaky chick 
But damn she on that sneaky shit 
Ran off with a half a zip 
And now I got to slap a trick 
All these record labels broke as shit 
Ricky dicky wreckin' shit 
I sell more meth than a mexican 
My dog food yea its excellent 
I done started sellin' christmas tree 
I'm tryna jingle bells hoe 
Its christmas time its hollis 
Queens [?] I'm stompin' in my shell toes 
Christmas in '96 I asked santa 
For twelve goals 
But now guwop got gifts to give 
But I don't fuck with twelve though 
Santa claus tryna see a bag full of goodies 
I wish these faggot-ass cops 
Would let a nigga live 
I'm tryna come down the chimney 
With a 100 mil 
I'm the bricksquad boss I'm like santa claus</field>

And every fuckin' time I say

Haha, Weezy man, Young Money

Started gettin' on my nerves so I hit her with a "BURR!" 
Hustlers love me, all the haters hate me, They brothers wanna fight me, They sisters wanna date me, 
I tell her bless it baby, You could be my bust it baby, 
But stay in your place, I need my space, Don't suffocate me, 
Back black approach us, Clack clack gats in holsters, Cops in black control us, 
Treat us like rats and roaches, 
But the blue Benz, Got the blue lamps, 
And your wifey, What we use her for a food stamp, 
Ain't no big deal, But she keep the fridge filled, 
Eggs scrambled, cheese, grilled, cold juice and grits Kill! 
Don't forget veal, Italiano, Gallardo, Yea the big wheels,

We'll rush in ya spot, 
Knock Knock, snock of the glock,

Gucci in the hood sellin weed like a docter 
Fifty dollar slab to a trunk full of holes 
Never at the house cause im always doing shows 
Teamed up with big cat now they want to chit chat 
Role to crash raod, flat shoals represent that 
Gucci in the booth and my flows crazy 
Is it hot in here nigga or its just me 
Have you at south beach fallin of jet ski 
Smokin purple weed under shade of palm trees 
In biloxi we could spend a hundred gees 
Ill play the crap table you get the slot machine

Broke bitch grew up in the hood eating fish sticks 
Hood bitch thinking she the shit but you ain't bitch 
You's a thirsty ass, thirsty ass, thirsty ass ho 
Thirsty ass, thirsty ass, thirsty ass ho 
She a hood bitch, only dreams to suck a rich man's dick 
If you got more babies then the motherfuckin trap bitch 
You's a thirsty ass, thirsty ass, thirsty ass ho 
Thirsty ass, thirsty ass, thirsty ass ho 
[Verse 1] 
It's Gucci in this bitch, I put my Bentley on fo's 
This one for the hoes like to play with they nose 
Got no paper problems 
baby paper planes full of hundons 
Mcm shoes, belt, book bag full of condoms 
If you ain't suckin dick 
why the fuck you got your tongue pierced? 
Baby girl them ass shots you can't fool guwop 
It's Guwop like 2pac, purple drank no Ci-roc 
Need to buy a weed whacker for my new weed spot 
Flash back 95, 87 T-Top 
Ya girl suck a nigga cock till a nigga knee knock 
Cooking dope in Granny house in ma dear tea pot 
Sellin dope in Trestletree and I ain't never re-rock 
Feinin for some head so I'm pulling up my custom 
Bad bitch, five kids fine motherfucker 
That ain't my kids but they blaming you for asking though 
That ain't my kids but I give em all a Twinkie though 
[Hook] 
[Verse 2] 
I had this fine bitch with me but she thirsty dawg 
In the Maybach with me open up my curtains dawg 
Baby you fine but riding with me is a no touch clause 
And this yo second violation cause you wore yo draws 
Third strike, coach bag, baby step yo game up 
If your boyfriend broke, don't bring my name up 
If you keep sucking dick like that, you gone get famous 
Man these hoes so thirsty, gotta sign disclaimer 
I had a girl go to Spelman was a good, good-brainer 
At first she wasn't good so I had to train her 
I had a Peruvian and she was personal trainer 
I tried to marry in the family just to get the cocaina 
I'm in a charger cost 100, that's a whole other lane 
I'm in a jeep that cost 200 bitch, now step up ya game 
I'm in Bentley, spent 400 bitch, a whole 'nother lane

So I hit him with the force, this is what I do

He's so hood, he's some damn hood 
He's so hood, he's some damn hood 
[Gucci Maine] 
Come help me mow yo lawn, mama, turn you up into a soldier 
Head to the dreams, and your pretty legs on my shoulders 
So don't lie to me I know you're scared of me 
You ain't gotta be 
cuz I'll have yo back as long as you stay on top of me 
First I let her drive (nyum) , then I make her ride (nyum) 
She suck your head like every day like she met Dennis Rodman 
Say paying wit yo waist, shit, she can overcharge 
Still rough around the edges, but money's not a problem 
Take it to the hood, move out the hood 
but I park the booth, got a pocketbook 
Then I call the jeweler, bring the cooler 
make it look like Gucci look (burr) 
Shawty got a mean swag, I wanna fuck with her 
She don't need no lame nigga 
She need a thug nigga 
[Ciara and Gucci Mane] 
I ain't gotta worry about nothing 
He's makin' trouble, always give me something 
He's so hood, he's some damn hood 
Down, keep it so right, and he do it good 
I'm too hood for my own good 
But we can ball to the mall down, it's all good 
He's so hood, he's so damn hood 
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good 
[Gucci Maine] 
She know I like to smoke a little cannabis 
I'm in my hood sittin' low in my lambo (nyum) 
And we can be a duo, a tandem 
Come through around until I back to back found em 
Her mama like he ain't got no manners 
But her mama like "damn, Gucci, have some" 
It's a date night, yeah I got my cake right 
The diamonds in the air, flashin' brighter, that's some brake lights 
No I'm not a trouble maker, I just make it double (burr) 
Shawty staring at me, but it's something make her hesitate 
Maybe it's my reputation, maybe it's my entourage 
I'm straight out the hood, but ain't no need to try to camouflage 
[Gucci Mane and Ciara] 
She ain't gotta worry (worth for nothing) 
I hold it down, she too much for you (sucka so good) 
She's hanging off in jewelry all on her 
And all the girls want him, so you can (tell them nothin') 
He's so hood, he's so damn hood 
He's so hood, he's too hood for his own good 
He's so hood, he's so damn hood 
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good 
[Ciara] 
Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick 
(Start rootin' for it, can't play it down like this) 
Find them in the (sun) , find them in the 6 
Find them in the air, somewhere in the bricks 
Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick 
Start rootin' for it, can't play it down like this 
Find them in the (room) , find them in the bay 
Find them in New York, find them in L 
A

Never bite the hand that's keepin her fed 
Bring home a baby and I killed a bitch 
Don't go in that room, it's too crowded

Cut a hoe off, I don't trust that bitch 
Big gucci baby on that juvy shit 
Got them in my house and I have that shit

Three tibs off baby, I'm wearing it 
I'm kind of careless with that money, might drop a mill 
Spend 50k on bags and heels 
Smoke that kali kush in the hollywood hills 
Ball so hard, you don't need no nigga 
I mean a real bad bitch don't need no nigga 
My trip with the homies don't feed no niggas 
Big guwop, he better choose that nigga 
Better cut that man off, better lose that nigga 
Since the last man was born 
All these lames be pourin 
It's a miracle that we ain't sleepin 
Been on the road, playin we tourin 
On the road main bitch a foreign 
Yea and I'm a paint it orange

Been ballin since the day I was born 
That lil nigga don't get along with me 
Cause the niggas I got too squad with me

Homie, he just say he want his girl back 
In a drop top, I'mma push the top back 
I was gone for a second, but the kid back 
If you ever cross me I'mma get some payback 
Close the curtain on them haters, in my maybach 
Put a hole in your motherfuckin' snapback 
It's gucci mane bitch, so you can say the trap back 
I'm back at em, it's back on 
I'm that strong, I'm back home 
Me and flockavelli, and wooh da kid 
He got a nine, I got a six 
I do it huge, we do it big 
Got a hundred bricks, stuffed em in the fridge (burr) 
Two hundred piece, stuffed it in the attic 
I'm a drug addict, bitch I gotta have it 
I got a gift, I can water whip, I can flip a brick, I can triple up 
Need a hundred mill, fuck a record deal 
cause a couple millions just not enough 
Sell your momma a zip of dust 
serve your daddy a ounce of hard 
Got your little sister on the molly 
she done went through the whole squad 
I don't wanna have to push your cap back

Making money's my hobby, flipping bricks is my passion 
Home girl in the lobby, "is you suckin' dick? " I'm just asking' 
I ain't mean to be rude boo, but you know I'm that dude true 
More birds than atlanta zoo, going in like a curphew 
I lost my mind, and my train of thought 
and my top all at the same time 
If you sendin' them birds across the country 
then we probably got the same grind 
I'm an og like my daddy, I'm a hustla' like my momma 
I'mma stack my bread up all winter 
so I can ball out all summer 
Got foreign choppas, osama, smoke presidential, obama 
Got that bald head, got that skinhead 
that white girl sinead o'connor 
Make em drop dead, I'm in the drop head, I'm.. 
I'm santa 
I need a crown cause I'm standing down 
I'm the king of east atlanta 
I don't wanna have to push your cap back

Choppa on the floor pistol on the coach 
Hood rich so i never had a bank account 
Junkies going in junkies going out 
Made a hundred tho(usand) in my trap house 
Money kinda short but we can work it out 
Made a hundred tho(usand) in my trap house 
Bricks going in, bricks going out 
Made a hundred tho(usand) in my trap house 
I'm tired of selling bricks i wanna go legit 
I wonder can i sell 11 mill like 50 cent 
Cause platinum ain't enough i got too many vices 
I love to smoke weed love to shoot dices 
Say my life style extravagant i talk cash shit 
Bitches say i'm arrogant well god damn gucci cockie then 
But at the same time young hoes be jocking slim 
Gucci ain't shit, bitch i beg your pardon 
I'm independent but i'm balling like a major artist 
I stay high like giraffe pussy in my trap house 
Smokin' rubber cushie 
[hook] 
Jumped out the whip everybody looking 
Big clouds of smoke but ain't nobody cooking 
(females)(girl their go gucci mane 
I want his autograph 'cause i'm his biggest fan) 
Yellow hummvie with the yellow feet 
Yellow diamonds the same color as yellow cheese 
And i'm smoking on that purple shit 
They call me temp service 'cause i'll work a bitch 
Money long like shaq feet 
Running dough like a sprinter at a track meet 
I heard he got that soft white 
Extended clips make them busters get they mind right 
[hook] 
In my trap house watchin sports center 
In the kitchen cooking but i ain't cooking dinner 
Splash it with the water whip it make it harder 
17 for 'em the same number as qunice carter 
Say i'm working with wit a mill or better 
Married to the game me and ????? live together 
Street smart niggah never listen to the teacher 
You can catch me in the bathroom smoking reefer 
Prices low like wal*mart 
Bricks on i-9 get ya shopping cart 
Knee deep in the dope game 
I'm not a farmer but i'm known to push them collard greens

Home girl seen my auto mall and said let's go and have a ball 
Hold applause change your drawers, Big Gucci not Santa Clause 
Young'uns might just break the law, whole Squad be like "Damn the law" 
If what you seen ain't what you saw, Scary Movie, Saw 3 
East Atlanta, whassup Santa, Alabama ride with me 
Glock nine on me, hot rod lonely 
Gucci ridin double wides, tractor-trailers, ponies 
What'chu mean? Bag of beans, same boy from the magazines 
Two AK's three magazines, make a stupid horror scene 
Orange Ferrari, purple trees, whippin like on gold D's

Ain't nothing retarded 'bout Gucci but this gold Rolex 
A ten thousand dollar bounty put on my neck 
I hope you didn't pay them cause they didn't have no success 
You seen my interview nigga and you got upset 
I seen your interview too, you looked oh so stressed 
I think the nigga just mad cause I fucked his ex 
And I'm a big dog, he got the lil' boy complex 
Go dig your partner up nigga, bet he can't say shit 
And if you looking for the kid I'll be in Zone 6 
I hit a birthday party fresh, you and ya homeboy Tip 
I know y'all seen me over there with that black fo' fifth 
I bought a Bentley Mulsanne, it look just like Tip's 
But I never went platinum, do you catch my drift 
I never let a nigga do me like Tip did Flip

I'm a old school fool, don't make me show my age nigga 
Grab a Louisville and turn it to a batting cage nigga 
I did a song with Keyshia Cole and I know you still miss her 
But Puff was fucking her while you was falling in love wit her 
Call you to do a song, wouldn't even smoke no bud wit ya 
I was screaming so icy and was a neighborhood nigga 
This AR is my back up cause I don't need nan nigga 
Must didn't hear when Flocka said "Let them guns blam nigga!" 
Used to drive to Birmingham with a lot of grams nigga

Keep a rocket in my pocket like my name was hakeem 
Somebody had the picture, she thought it was a dream 
A college chick dream big man on campus 
All these folks impersonate me like elvis 
Too much sauce and I'm not selfish 
I rule with a nine bitch wrapped in velvet 
The seat way back and the top laid back 
Her waist real small but that ass real fat 
She get turnt up and you can't turn back 
She make my dick stand up, I push them legs way back

I wanna be a billionaire, me too 
So i can count a b cashing hundreds on you to 
I get dirty money bitches know with ciroc on my rada 
On the stage gettin it with nicki ricky rozay and flo rida 
I rock maris with the money ball like stoudemire omare 
Hold the blunt with my left hand to show my automall in paris 
Look at all that i've accomplished, i just bought me 3 ferraris 
Spent five million in my company if offended you not sorry...Gucci

I'm in the new gt with a georgia peach 
Gotta condo right out on the florida beach 
I ain't hard to reach so nice to meet 
Every night we meet you prolly fight with me 
Say its fine with me to spend the night with me 
No rules everything alright with me 
Now shake baby shake just right for me 
Catch ball players in magic city 
Show them boys how good my jumper is 
Ain't no niggas up in here, makin all pros look like amateurs 
I just showed my ass last night i had a blast 
My jewelery was so white haters put theirs in the trash 
Pulled up in some fans just to make them haters mad 
Rims with paper tag paper bag full of cash 
What it gonna be

And I'm still in the Murda Bizness 
I can hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics 
(Right, right?) 
You should want a bad bitch like this 
Drop it low and pick it up just like this 
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris 
High heels, something worth a half ticket on my wrist 
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that 
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back 
What? 
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at? 
Champagne spillin', you should taste that

I'm so fancy 
Can't you taste this gold? 
Remember my name 
'Bout to blow 
I said, "Baby, I do this, I thought that you knew this" 
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is 
And my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed 
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department 
Better get my money on time 
If they not money, decline 
And swear I meant that there so much 
That they give that line a rewind 
So get my money on time 
If they not money, decline 
I just can't worry 'bout no haters 
Gotta stay on my grind 
Now tell me, who that, who that? 
That do that, do that 
Put that paper over all 
I thought you knew that, knew that 
I be the I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold

Can't you taste this gold? 
Remember my name

Trashed the hotel 
Let's get drunk on the mini bar 
Make the phone call 
Feels so good getting what I want 
Yeah, keep on turning it up 
Chadelier's swinging, we don't give a fuck 
Film star, yeah, I'm deluxe 
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch 
Aoh 
Still stunting how you love that? 
Got the whole world asking 
How I does that 
Hot girl hands off, don't touch that 
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that 
that's just the way you like, huh? 
You're so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh? 
Never turn down money 
Slaying these hoes 
Gold trigger on the gun like 
I'm so fancy 
You already know

But they don't wear these shits where I'm from 
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you 
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through 
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt 
Sugar cane, back lanes 
Three jobs, took years to save 
But I got a ticket on that plane 
People got a lot to say 
But don't know a thing about where I was made 
Or how many floors that I had to scrub 
Just to make it past where I am from 
No money, no family 
Sixteen in the middle of Miami 
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Now get this work 
Working on my shit 
You can hate it or love it 
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting 
Thorough bread in a mud brick before the budget 
White chick on that Pac shit 
My passion was ironic 
And my dreams were uncommon 
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me 
Robbed blind, basically raped me 
Rose through the bullshit like a Matador 
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em 
And even the score 
So, I went harder 
Studied the Carters 'till a deal was offered 
Slept cold on the floor recording 
At 4 in the morning 
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer 
Immigrant, art ignorant 
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit 
Hate be inconsiderate 
But the Industry took my innocence 
Too late, now I'm in this bitch! 
You don't know the half 
This shit get real 
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins 
What you call that? 
Head over heels? 
No money, no family 
Sixteen in the middle of Miami 
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Now get this work 
Working on my shit 
Pledge allegiance to the struggle 
Ain't been easy 
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle 
Bags is all we had 
Do anything for my momma, I love you 
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice 
That ya managed to muscle 
Sixteen you sent me through customs so 
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury 
Turn first at the light that's in front me 
'Cause every night I'mma do it like it's my last 
This dream is all that I need 
'Cause it's all that I ever had 
Now get this work 
Now get this work 
Now get this work 
Now get this work 
Working on my shit 
Now get this work 
Now get this work

I'm gonna love you like a black widow, baby 
This twisted cat and mouse game 
Always starts the same 
First we're both down to play 
Then somehow you go astray 
We went from nothing to something 
Liking to loving 
It was us against the world and now we're just fucking 
It's like I loved you so much, now I just hate you 
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you 
I wanted all or nothing for us 
Not a single place in between 
By me believing what you say that you never mean 
Like it will last forever, but now forever ain't as long 
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song 
You were different from my last but now you got it mirrored 
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer 
You used to be thirsty for me 
But now you wanna be set free 
This is the web, web that you weave 
So baby, now rest in peace 
I'm gonna love you until you hate me 
And I'm gonna show you what's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Than to mess with me harder 
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you 
I'm gonna love you like a black widow, baby 
(Black widow baby) 
I'm gonna love you until it hurts 
Just to get you 
I'm doing whatever works 
You ain't never met nobody 
That's gonna do ya how I do ya 
And I'll bring you to your knees 
Praise Jesus, hallellujah! 
I'mma make you beg for it 
Plead for it 
'Til you feel like you breathe for it 
'Til you do any and everything for it 
I want you to fiend for it 
Wake up and dream for it 
'Till it's got you gasping for air 
And you lean forward 
'Till they have a Cat scan to check on your mind 
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it) 
Now it's me time, believe that 
If it's yours and you want it 
I want it, promise I need that 
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at 
I can't fall back, go quick 
Cause this here is fatal attraction 
So I take it all or I don't want shh 
You used to be thirsty for me 
But now you wanna be set free 
This is the web, web that you weave 
So baby, now rest in peace 
I'm gonna love you until you hate me 
And I'm gonna show you what's really crazy 
You should've known better

A savior, to save me...) 
I feel like y'all playin' tricks on me 
Got a fix on me 
Feel the weight of the world 
Like I got a brick on me 
Had a dance with the devil 
And he got a grip on me 
I'm just tryning get to heaven 
Hope you got a ticket for me, uh 
I've been sending up prayers, I need feedback 
Past full of sin, can someone delete that? 
My path got muddy 
I feel like my feet trapped 
Can you give me the strength now to beat that? 
'cause my heart beats for you only 
I wonder if you even know me 
Countin' down every moment 
That I wait for ya, I wait for ya 
I wonder if you even notice 
Lately I've been feelin' hopeless 
Easy to lose focus, but I'll wait for ya 
I've been looking for a savior 
I've been looking for a savior 
I've been looking for a hero in my corner 
I've been looking for a savior 
A savior, to save me 
Saving my love for you 
Saving my love for you 
Saving it, saving it all for you 
Saving it all for you, all for you 
Saving my love for you 
Saving my love for you 
Saving it, saving it all for you 
Saving it all for you 
I've been looking for a savior 
I've been looking for a savior 
I've been looking for a hero in my corner 
I've been looking for a savior 
A savior, to save me 
Been around the world and I, I, I 
(hey, I've been looking for a) 
Been around the world and I, I, I 
(hey, I've been looking for a) 
Been around the world and I, I, I (hey) 
I've been looking for a savior 
a savior, yeah, save me</field>

I shoulda known that you were bad news 
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos 
'Cause most guys only want one thing 
But I'm undecided, tryin' to figure out if that's you 
Either way though, I think you're worth the test drive 
'Cause I know you're so much better than the next guy 
And a little trouble only makes for a good time 
So all the normal red flags be a good sign 
Don't you come here thinking you're balling 
Oh no, ain't down for it 
You seem like trouble to me 
I can tell by the way that you lean 
And the way that you kiss your teeth 
And you turn up so fresh and clean 
Smells like trouble to me 
Opposites attract, I guess this is that 
Good girl, bad guy, what a perfect match 
And if we fuck you gon' wanna pay back tithes 
When we finish you gon' feel like you was baptized 
See baby now you fiendin' for a test drive 
'Cause you don't wanna lose your ride to the next guy 
And baby trouble only makes for a good time 
So all the normal red flags be a good sign 
Don't you come here thinking you're balling 
Oh no, ain't down for it 
You seem like trouble to me 
I can tell by the way that you lean 
And the way that you kiss your teeth 
And you turn up so fresh and clean 
Smells like trouble to me 
I got it bad for him in the worst way 
Dear Lord, how'd I get in this positioning 
Should've never got involved in the first place 
Second place never get the recognition, um 
See what he doin' to me make me have to shout it out 
Gotta hold on me and that's without a doubt 
So clear now that he's trouble starter 
But I ain't a saint neither and these ain't no still waters 
Just 'cause all the girls are falling at your feet 
Don't mean no thing to me 
'Til you show me where it's at 
Smells like trouble to me 
Just 'cause all the girls are falling at your feet 
Don't mean no thing to me 
'Til you show me where it's at 
Smells like trouble to me 
I shoulda known that you were bad news 
(Knew you were bad news) 
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos 
(All of the tattoos) 
I shoulda known that you were bad news 
(Knew you were bad news) 
But I'm undecided, tryin' to figure out if that's you 
You're trouble to me 
Don't you come here thinking you're balling 
Oh no, ain't down for it

And that's why you won't survive the summer! 
Amen! 
Uh, she's salty, I sauté the bitch 
Alaïa jacket and I slay the bitch 
Big body on display and shit 
This is just another day and shit 
Was down for love, I got played and shit 
Cameras flashing, downplay the dick 
I would never ever claim your dick 
In interviews, I'm like who is this? 
Bitches tryna put the end to me 
Producers still sending beats 
I send it back in like a day or so 
You bitches writin' slow like centipedes 
My crib got amenities 
I just bought a T-Rex tooth 
'cause I'm tryna stunt on Mr 
Flintstone 
One look and your bitch gone 
Turned a T-Rex tooth to a chain 
Shit cost more than your Range 
I'm a diamond in the rough, fancy diamonds by the way 
I been making moves, been writing rhymes 
been stacking commas 
But you? Hold up, bitch, can you survive the summer? 
Woah, uh 
You won't survive the summer, look, yeah, uh 
You won't survive the summer, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Can't stay alive much longer, look, look 
You won't survive the summer! 
Umm, I just wanna get in my Ferrari 
And drive real slow, so everyone can see my face 
And all you bitches gon' hate this shit 
Get the fuck up out my way and shit 
Give 'em hell 365 
You would think I'm 'bout to bake a bitch 
Summer's over, it's a cold front 
Tryna stop me is a witch hunt 
Lemme' drop a lil' wisdom 
Crack kills, you a victim 
You a victim, you a victim 
If I don't like it then I switch (uh) 
Label tripping so I switch (uh) 
Which one? Which one? 
Bring the bag and it's done

For the hot girls pulling at their G-Strings 
You're gon give it to them soon as you leave, huh?

Fuck beef, I got more estate than Philly

            <field name="lyrics">He got a house that's too big 
Sits on a hill in the valley 
Said he trying to move on with life 
But he still wanna be a good daddy 
So I sit in the ride cause I don't want us overlapping 
Spendin' money on Mac, that's cute 
I get checks from them in Paris 
Better check my tax bracket 
What you think was gonna happen 
Naggin', now he's had it 
And y'all fell off like Mad Men 
These exes excessively hatin' on the next bitch 
She's no housewife, just desperate 
I know it's hard to let go but accept it 
Cause the whole world is watchin' 
And the paparazzi is flockin' 
Cause we fly shit when we drop in 
And we shut down your party 
'His' and 'her' gold chains 
Gold watches, everything 
His old girl, she gon' hate 
They gon' have something to say 
When I hop out his new six 
Fresh in some new shit 
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this? " 
Yeah I'm his new bitch 
I'm his new bitch 
And I'm spending his new cash 
Few trips, new bags 
Damn, she is too bad 
Oh you mad? 
That I'm his new bitch 
Yeah, I'm his new bitch 
[Interlude - Spoken] 
She be the one that be like 
"Hey, girl, what's up? You in town? " 
Yes, I'm in town, kissing ---- on the face, and you know this 
So just say it 
It's always jealous broads wishing they was in my shoes 
But I'm a debut, you a deja vu 
Girl, you know the drill, I got a couple loose screws 
Driving, riding, all black suits up 
Up north in a coupe before I meet him with the crew 
And what I do, it can't be compared 
You well done and bitch I'm rare 
So stop popping up unexpected 
Stop sending threats and text messages 
We too grown for this messy shit 
This will be my last conversation 
If you don't want no problems 
Move yourself from the equation 
Cause the whole world is watchin' 
And the paparazzi is flockin' 
Cause we fly shit when we drop in 
And we shut down your party 
'His' and 'her' gold chains 
Gold watches, everything 
His old girl, she gon' hate 
They gon' have something to say 
When I hop out his new six 
Fresh in some new shit 
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this? " 
Yeah I'm his new bitch 
I'm his new bitch 
And I'm spending his new cash 
Few trips, new bags 
Damn, she is too bad 
Oh you mad? 
That I'm his new bitch 
Yeah, I'm his new bitch 
Tell your friends to tell their friends too 
He got a new chick but it ain't you 
I'm just saying, you know it's true 
Cry a river and swim on through 
I know you hoping we won't make it 
Clyde and Bonnie, let the world chase us 
Ride or die where the world takes us 
If we end up poor or rich and famous 
I'm all he needs and more chick 
His home chick 
His tour chick 
His 4th finger, left hand chick 
And all those people go 'Damn, chick' 
When I hop out his new six 
Fresh in some new shit 
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this? " 
Yeah I'm his new bitch 
I'm his new bitch 
And I'm spending his new cash 
Few trips, new bags 
Damn, she is too bad 
Oh you mad? 
That I'm his new bitch 
Yeah, I'm his new bitch</field>

Let me feel myself, yeah, daddy know I'm cocky 
Ah, my wrist is rocky, come try and stop me 
He wanna pop a wheelie 
Ride him like a Kawasaki 
Big Phantom grill, cook the streets like hibachi 
I'm sipping saki 
I'ma roll like Gotti 
Boy, why you always wanna meet me in the lobby 
He wanna pop a wheelie 
Ride him like a Kawasaki 
Ah, I'm going live, sit down and watch me 
You're rocking Jordans but you're Dennis Rodman 
I used to get the chicken fingers but now I get the lobster 
Or I get the poster, yeah, all my bitches mobbing 
Halloween teen fame turned me to a monster 
I make him fight for the pussy, I'm Ronda Rousey 
Playin' hard to get, ring around the rosey 
If we're locking, keep it low key, shit 
I'm going live 
The block is hot 
Bistro inside 
Barry Sanders tryna juke the truth, he know you lyin' 
She popping pussy, pussy swollen, pop 'em ultra now 
I can take my jewellery off, to be the golden child 
I'm going live, she just wanna watch 
She with you 'cause you're rich, she just wants a watch 
They told me to be humble, so I started humming (mm, mm) 
Fuck you hoes, I came from nothin' (huh!) 
They telling me be humble but they know I'm cocky

He wanna pop a wheelie 
Ride him like a Kawasaki 
Ah, I'm going live, close your eyes, open wide 
I could act like I'm humble but you know I'm not 
You mean to act like I don't know when I know I'm hot 
Ex shot by my shiplock, woah 
He wanna rock to my tempo 
I'm in the endzone, he in the friendzone 
If you really on, where you team at? Put them on 
Looking in the mirror, only bitch I depend on 
Ah, I'm going live, sit down and watch me 
See my ass tan, I was in the tropics 
'Bout to catch a flight just to go shopping 
This a 1 of 1, what you know about it? 
Big amounts, big time accountants 
I can only vouch for my accountant 
And who I hold it down with 
They told me to be humble, so I started humming (mm, mm) 
Fuck you hoes, I came from nothin' 
They telling me be humble but they know I'm cocky 
Let me feel myself, yeah, daddy know I'm cocky 
Ah, my wrist is rocky, come try and stop me 
He wanna pop a wheelie

Jesus, form my number, or you could fly kites 
See I'm bout to get with it, I'm getting ratched and live it 
You think I'm cool and forget it 
You feeling froggy then ribbit 
Be like banana and split it, before your melon is splatted 
I bet you know what you see, all my girls … other 
Beat down, stop, wait 
Think about it, think about it, 
Work, work, run up, if you want some 
Need the drums … that's how you done 
Wait, I should think about it, never mind 
It's a waste, when this bitch hit the ground 
How these Louis Vuitons taste 
I'm sorry, the promoter, let's put these in the passes 
Cause that bitch kept on staring 
So I had to whop that ass,

Checking down ladies no take no lip 
Take no lip, take take no lip 
If you rap or you girls, pump your fist 
Pump pump your fist 
Now swing it into hold if your bang looking funny 
If she came with a man then take all his money 
It's the year of the women, go grab a cannon… she gonna get it 
Beat down, beat down, beat down

Ironic, I been livin' off what people down to kill for 
And I find no comfort in numbers 
Knowin' there's always a mill more 
Fact was that cat dragged my pretty ass 
Right on the top of that billboard 
And all of my folks who done 
Been here from jump you the ones I'ma cover the bill for 
And as I get ill more 
We gon' triple the order of champagne and spill more 
Let's handle the real score 
Been wonderin' what the public got a feel for 
So let's keep it real, y'all 
You know I'm killing game soon as I step on the field, y'all 
The top where I'm at now, there's no turning back now 
I won't ever back down 
They feel me like they givin' Iggy a pat-down 
I needed a moment I found it 
Lately I've been on my runnin' the town shit 
Especially walkin' around with 
This heavy crown 
You can't always please the crowd 
But I am still not bowing down 
This heavy crown 
It comes and goes around 
And when it's time, I'll pass it proud 
But bitch I got it now 
So keep a cute, chick, and don't be hatin' on the new chick 
Go back and check your stats 
And bet they let you know I do's this 
Glasses full of empty dependent unpoint of view chick 
If you was mad before 
I bet you hate me for this new shit 
Maybe you should watch 
What you've got coming out your two lips 
Get cool with how I kick it or else you gon' get the boot, bitch 
Iggy A-Z-A a 
k 
a 
captain of the crew ship 
Don't penny pinch I promise babe 
I don't need your two cents 
Get rid of the makeup let us see just who you is 
But if you feel like that girl bless your heart 
Go get it how you live 
When you hear my name 
You gotta know that she's something regal 
I'm one of one ain't no sequels 
I'm wearing 
This heavy crown 
You can't always please the crowd 
But I am still not bowing down 
This heavy crown 
It comes and goes around 
And when it's time, I'll pass it proud 
But bitch I got it now 
To everyone who said I'd never make 
Oh Lord, weren't you mistaken 
I got a dinner date with greatness 
Iggy Igg ain't never been nothin' to play wit, hol' up 
To everyone who said I'd never make 
I'm at the top laughin' at you faces 
I've been practising my patience 
But I switch back quick if you play with 
This heavy crown 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
This heavy crown 
Oh Lord weren't you mistaken

Put everything in a suitcase one day 
And run away to the runway 
To find somewhere to lay my heart, lay my heart 
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going 
To find somewhere to lay my heart 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
(Verse: Iggy Azalea) 
You ever start to feel that home wasn't your home 
Kinda like somebody made you wear the wrong clothes 
What you say ain't gotta be what you made of 
Well see your heart don't always match where you came from 
Couldn't see you so they treat you like a misfit 
Because your mind clicks in another district 
Call you favor they don't know what's inside you 
'Cause what's inside justifies what divides you 
Searching for that place right where you wanna be 
That's really real where it's never full capacity 
Roll back and get away, never come back never runaway 
(Chorus) 
Put everything in a suitcase one day 
And run away to the runway 
To find somewhere to lay my heart, 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going 
To find somewhere to lay my heart 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
(Verse: Pusha T) 
They say home's where you hang your hat 
So beware of the owner 'cause he bang his gap 
And in that shit I push and I clean my set 
All over the globe via I rap 
And it still ain't enough for the haters 
Put on for my city, light it up like it's Vegas 
How you frontin' on I lead I'm the greatest 
Flow like a butterfly, the porsche ride amazing 
I feel like speedracer 
My jello's in the Louie Duffle 
MCM hold the finna' buckle 
Paw, that's what I call an interracial couple 
A long whip poppin' tans, that's a power struggle 
(Chorus) 
Put everything in a suitcase one day 
And run away to the runway 
To find somewhere to lay my heart, 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going 
To find somewhere to lay my heart 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
(Verse: Iggy Azalea) 
Change my lounge too, and my lattitude 
To get an attitude, the shit granted too 
But my mind's gone until my fine home 
Then I can get my shine on no rice stones 
Then I can get my shine on no rice stones 
See you later with my bigz, I'm gone 
(Chorus) 
Put everything in a suitcase one day 
And run away to the runway 
To find somewhere to lay my heart, 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going 
To find somewhere to lay my heart 
Home's wherever I lay my heart</field>

Understand my life is easy 
When I ain't around you 
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin' 
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you 
More than I love your presence 
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit 
I let you go, let you back 
I finally learned my lesson 
No half-steppin' 
Either you want it or you just playin' 
I'm listenin' to you knowin' 
I can't believe what you're sayin' 
There's a million you's baby boo 
So don't be dumb 
I got 99 problems but you won't be one 
Like what! 
One less, one less problem

Imma keep him if he eating with no cutlery 
Pardon me, I'm too audacious

Got no further f*cks, so don't ask for donations (Woo!) 
Better get your bag up

Oh My God, Gucci slippers 
Oh My God, my wrist vicious 
Oh My God, might hurt yo feelings

Girl, when you come around 
Time to keep it 100, I'm a boss chick but he run it 
No Michael Kors just Tom Ford 
Saint Tropez, I'm like bonjour 
In Spain wearing that Balmain, Lanvin, Givenchy 
On the top floor of that penthouse 
I got ten toes in that concrete 
Keep it G with the lot, ain't gotta lie about shit 
I don't need your money, I Can Buy My Shit 
Heard in the streets that he fucked that bitch 
He know I'll put his ass out my shit 
Paid one million for that drop six 
And he got the Glock in my cockpit 
Them other chick you get caught with 
I'm the bitch he gonna Rock With 
They talk shit but we 'bout shit 
Fly as we're on golf shit 
When we need to be, where we need to be 
Until I'm gone ain't no thing to me 
Gotta hit that, bang, bring that back 
Let me thumb through the check if you wanna get sexy 
You knew I was High Player ass when you met me 
My money talk to every of y'all 
Got to know shorty is so fashion 
I'm a Fancy Bitch but I'm retched 
All other bitch you had ain't never had shit 
Respect that, I won't come around, no run around 
You better hummer down 
And the game's aim, gonna play none 
Been A1 since day one 
Yeah 
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around 
Keep your mind on your money 
and you ain't looking to settle down 
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're around me 
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're around me 
Girl, when you come around 
Bankrolls'r'us, we got it 
You know how we ride 
No credit, no debit, no thanks 
My clique pay cash everything we buy 
See me walking by with my nose in the sky 
Make you be like "Damn bitch, can't say hi? " 
Then I hop in the drop and wave goodbye 
As I drive through the tunnel looking like Lady Di 
Why stress myself when he ain't there? 
Let's see how he likes seeing me out there 
You know how many dudes want me out there? 
Just stop thinking about it 
You got no idea 
Don't try me man, you know I will 
Throw this brick through your wind shield 
Knife your nice new Rover Wheel 
That fireplace? Your clothes in there 
If I know you two in there 
No asking what you doing there 
Imma send my crew in there 
You two gonna be ruined there 
You violate, I demonstrate 
Especially if I'm true to you 
And when I come around I keep it 100 as usual</field>

Been down for you, don't get it confused 
Boy you could lose your turn 
Don't let the tables turn

My love cost too baby, ain't nothing free 
Check my angle, daddy, you could call me angel, daddy 
Uh, but you gon' turn your beauty right into a beast 
Now, this is the business of pleasure let's keep 'em separate 
I ain't tryna be second, just for the record 
See you slippin' you trippin' just thought I should let you know 
I admire your effort but I need better love 
See many men try to play me 'til they get scared away 
Told 'em that's a fall, try another day 
This is different, now I'm seeing that it isn't 
Promise I'm not gon' cry here like Mary Jane 
Now ain't that funny, that you was something special 'til 
I noticed that you just like these losers who come in several 
But I, know that if you leave you comin' right back 
So my question boy is, why you acting like that? 
Don't let the tables turn 
Don't let the bridges burn 
Been down for you, don't get it confused 
Boy you could lose your turn 
Don't let the tables turn 
Don't let the bridges burn

I'mma make you beg 
I'mma make you beg 
Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby 
High price, but I'm worth it, baby 
Can't play with ya, I've been busy working, baby 
Gettin' faded in the European swervin', ay 
Look, describe Iggy ground breaking what the word is 
Hit the stage, ass shaking like I'm nervous 
When in New York got me parking right on Madison 
This ain't no accident, I'm killing them on purpose 
I-G-G-Y, think she just had to do it better 
Ride with me, fly livin', there ain't nothin' to it 
Am I waist slim ass fat you gotta have it 
Get my bake on, cake long 
That's automatic 
I know you like the way I turn it on 
I'm out here with my friends 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone 
I guess you'll have to beg 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
Pussy power, pay me by the hour 
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward 
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers 
If I peek and you lucky, baby, this money ours 
All yellow gold on me, like I'm Trinidad, James 
Sittin' drop top wonder where the ceilings at 
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back 
But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feeling that now 
Iggy Iggy, Iggy can't you see? 
That everybody wanna put their hands on me 
See I be on this money while your man on me 
And I need another hand with all these bands on me 
I know you like the way I turn it on 
I'm out here with my friends 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone 
I guess you'll have to beg 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
Get up out my face like who'd you think you are? 
Talking all this trash like bla-di-bla-di-blah 
Oe oh, na uh, Oe oh, na uh 
Get up out my face like who'd you think you are? 
Make me wanna laugh like ha-di-ha-di-ha 
Oe oh, na uh, Oe oh, na uh 
I know you like the way I turn it on 
I'm out here with my friends 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone 
I guess you'll have to beg 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
Hooked boy I'm like a drug 
If you want my love better smoke it up 
Make you beg for it, I'mma make you beg for it 
You can look boy, but don't you touch 
If you want my love make me give a fuck 
Make you beg for it, I'mma make you beg for it</field>

And I'm gonna show you what's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Than to mess with me harder 
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you 
I'm gonna love you like a black widow, baby 
This twisted cat and mouse game 
Always starts the same 
First we're both down to play 
Then somehow you go astray 
We went from nothing to something 
Liking to loving 
It was us against the world and now we're just fucking 
It's like I loved you so much, now I just hate you 
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you 
I wanted all or nothing for us 
Not a single place in between 
By me believing what you say that you never mean 
Like it will last forever, but now forever ain't as long 
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song 
You were different from my last but now you got it mirrored 
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer 
You used to be thirsty for me 
But now you wanna be set free 
This is the web, web that you weave 
So baby, now rest in peace 
I'm gonna love you until you hate me 
And I'm gonna show you what's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Than to mess with me harder 
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you 
I'm gonna love you like a black widow, baby 
(Black widow baby) 
I'm gonna love you until it hurts 
Just to get you 
I'm doing whatever works 
You ain't never met nobody 
That's gonna do ya how I do ya 
And I'll bring you to your knees 
Praise Jesus, hallellujah! 
I'mma make you beg for it 
Plead for it 
'Til you feel like you breathe for it 
'Til you do any and everything for it 
I want you to fiend for it 
Wake up and dream for it 
'Till it's got you gasping for air 
And you lean forward 
'Till they have a Cat scan to check on your mind 
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it) 
Now it's me time, believe that 
If it's yours and you want it 
I want it, promise I need that 
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at 
I can't fall back, go quick 
Cause this here is fatal attraction 
So I take it all or I don't want shh 
You used to be thirsty for me 
But now you wanna be set free

On the floor right now 
Iggy on the top 
The last time the world's seen a booty this good 
It was on "Jenny From The Block" 
I got 'em all crazy lately 
Baby, all the men on my magnet 
Wanna tell all of my ladies 
To get up on the floor 
And just shake it, shake it 
Y'all know where I been on 
Y'all know where I been on 
Queen Booty Iggy 
Now find me a bone to sit on 
Girls with those cheeks, put they hands in the air 
And pop that, pop 
Let 'em know that you're in here 
See everybody wanna get a taste 
Ya know that we got enough to share 
But fact we girls with the big fat booty 
Too fancy to ever play fair 
Mesmerized by the size of it 
You can't fight it 
If you like, take your turn 
I can guarantee you'll have the time of your life 
Throw up your hands if you love a big booty 
Big, big booty

Joint venture, we'll partner up until the shares are up 
And I'll up your wages 
On a private island, dolo 
One across the Cono 
Them broads before me was locals 
Through customs accustom your wardrobe, damn 
Stamped passports where they all pass ports 
'Till the clocks fast forward 
Then we got blue shores where they don't do chores 
We just get chauffeured 
Damn, this is the life

If you could listen more than you speak 
I get you everything that you need

I be blowing on strong weed when we ride 
And everybody just lookin' 
But ain't no nigga gon' holla 
They like "nah shawty, she tooken" 
I'mma get you up out that coffee shop 
Pick you up and leave you marked where you wanna shop 
And let me show you that watch you supposed to wear 
Get up out that Honda Civic and get your ass in here 
Tell your mom and dad you're straight 
Don't worry 'bout it you got it 
You fly over in coach and fly back in a jet 
"Hustle Gang" got your chest 
Ain't no time for no stress

On acres without the neighbors 
We fast-forward four years more 
We long way from 
And all the shit that we endure 
I told you what you was in for so 
[Hook x4] 
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it 
I'mma change your life (life) 
Once you go grace, you never go good 
You never go back, even if you could 
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good 
You never go back, even if you could 
Have you ever wished your life would change? 
Woke up and you lived your dreams 
Baby I can help you make that change 
I can show you how to do this thing 
[Hook x4] 
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it 
I'mma change your life (life) 
Once you go grace, you never go good 
You never go back, even if you could 
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good 
You never go back, even if you could 
[Outro] 
Once you go grace, you never go good 
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it 
I'mma change your life (life) 
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good 
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it 
I'mma change your life (life)

And if I could have one wish its that I die rich

So turned up don't wanna turn down 
You see that ass from the front, no turn arounds 
Like got damn, I mean oh, shit! cold bitch and my flow sick 
So sick I might cough and hack and then toss some racks 
Like count alla that 
Nah, now im about my business. 
And I know these hoes ain't with it 
Wanna talk about paper? I got it. 
Broke muthafuckas might not get it 
Now murder murder kill, hundred dollar bills 
Real bitch till I die, now tell me how it feel, huh?!

Verse 2: 
Money up so its going down, 
I got enough dough to go round and round 
Im talkin round and round, but no merry-go 
Hoes see me out and say "there she go" 
You know point and look 
You know stop and stare 
Yeah im racked up, but not stopping there 
You see me in the store then im copping that 
Clutch full of that green, Rodman hair 
You know first class champagne designer life is my campaign 
I been ill and I can't change, so ill its a damn shame 
But I spend it like its no damn thang

Low paper, really no paper, huh?

Bitch gone do it, watch me run through it.

            <field name="lyrics">I remember when it used to be simple 
But all this cash it just complicates things 
And all this money we into 
It will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder 
Grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer 
Sometimes you gonna think that it's too much on ya 
But think what I'd be doing if this wasn't going on 
So I just keep pushing when 
I'm being pulled in every direction 
Now I'm popping so they watching 
Every step of my progression 
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing 
On the road to the riches turning earth into heaven 
Dear Lord, if you hear me 
I don't need not a new friend near me 
Cause I don't want none of that fake love 
Cause how I'm looking at it, all of that be made up 
I remember when I wasn't this big 
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here 
Oh now everybody wanna love me 
Try to knock me down but I'm strong 
I did all this on my own 
Ain't got no time for no new friends 
So for now just leave me alone 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all 
Making each and every song like it might be my last one 
But still making sure the cash come 
Still ain't forget the times when I didn't have none 
Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab some 
That's when, I took time and I figured it out 
I'd rather deal with the stressing more than living without 
Take a one way trip to the top one time 
Let you have it for a minute now I want mine 
Same girl on the cover of the magazine 
Was the one hiding pain that you hadn't seen 
Talking 'bout 
No money, no family 
Sixteen in the middle of Miami 
Same critics love me nowadays couldn't stand me 
Now we talking 'bout VMA's and a Grammy 
But in due time, turn nothing into something 
So now I need money, put it all in my discussions 
I remember when I wasn't this big 
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here 
Oh now everybody wanna love me 
Try to knock me down but I'm strong 
I did all this on my own 
Ain't got no time for no new friends 
So for now just leave me alone 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all 
And if you wasn't here when I was down 
Then you won't be here when I'm up 
Now the same one you looked over 
Be the same one that blew up 
Ain't it funny how this life thing works? 
When you think it's finished is when it all begins 
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work 
It goes up and down then it starts again 
When I reminisce sometimes I can't even keep a dry eye 
But my how time flies by 
When you on top of the world sky high 
I remember when I wasn't this big 
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here 
Oh now everybody wanna love me 
Try to knock me down but I'm strong 
I did all this on my own 
Ain't got no time for no new friends 
So for now just leave me alone 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all anyway 
I don't need y'all</field>

This pussy gone drip on them locks 
That hello kitty no pencil pouch.

But im verifying his face card and he say he love it

It's three in the morning 
I'm up and I'm horny 
I want you, I want it, I need you up on me 
Are you hungry? 
Let me know cause I can cook if you coming 
Tell me exactly how you want me to look when you're coming 
I could be dressed like a schoolgirl and reading a book 
when you come in 
It's ready for you could come get pussy you want it 
Fresh out the shower in a towel, ready to 
I.O.U like a vowel for hours 
We both getting money I'm just trying feel the power 
Winter, spring, summer til we fall like autumn 
Lick me all over like they dipped me in chocolate 
Give me LoveRance loving, like Mayweather boxing 
Beat it up, that's right like I stole something 
Speed it up, now I know that made you hungry 
Get it up, I can't wait too much longer 
Hurry up, hurry up 
[Hook: Mike Posner] 
I pray I don't crash 
Cause I'm speeding really fast 
Yeah I'm racing to your love 
And I'll be there in a flash, flash, a flash 
I want it bad, over high 
I gotta have your sexy ass, yeah yeah uh uh 
Put on the gas I'm getting dash 
And I'll be there in a flash, flash, a flash 
[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea] 
How long for you hear my exit on the freeway 
We gonna freak and let Pandora DJ 
Say you now used to seeing pussy on the TV 
Well that's probably cause it's usually on your face, 
boy what's up? 
Damn you so sexy that passive aggression 
I love when you sweating, 
it means you working around these curves 
And when you swerving it excites me 
The way you just doing in, Nike 
Almost like here's two of me, Siamese 
My main thing fuck me good like a side piece 
Tell me that I'm beautiful and get it from the side please 
And I'll be calling out your name like you need to be reminded 
This pussy yours baby, this pussy yours baby 
So add some to your food and have more baby 
Cause you got me on lock, like a close door 
Now hurry up cause you know what I'm waiting for 
[Hook: Mike Posner]

Pull my cash out my let her lap dance for it 
Fuck around and bust a band no black jack on it

She giving me head then coming outta her jeans 
Smoke a pound today

Seen the bitch I like hit the bitch twice 
Stay flexing hard mother fuck a price

Poppin molly dig it back to business 
Ride the lamb doing twice the limit

Twenty years in the rap game,

That bullshit that you smoking never been in my cigar 
What im smoking on you gotta keep in a jar 
Own it to the shit and nigga pop and have a bar 
With two white chicks menage-a-trois 
Rolling up, back to back

One night with yo bitch then you can have her back 
Me saving these hoes imagine that

I'm just tryin' to build my army up 
But these days they shootin' at me with a tommy gun 
Carry the weight 'cause I'm strong enough 
But sometimes the hate, make me feel like 
I'm pulling a Tonka truck 
What's the fuss? I bought the murda bizness to all of them 
They asking questions like I ain't talking about dressing 
Are we talking about art, or are we talking about perception? 
If it bangs play my record, if not, then shelf it 
While others coming up shorter than elf limbs 
I realize I may be the realest bitch they ever dealt with 
And to be honest these rumours be all fables 
See I don't get dropped; I drop the label 
Let's keep it very clear, I'm doing just fine 
I'm sitting on a million, your bank's flatline 
Death to the haters, face it one time 
You got your own dick bitch 
Why you ridin' mine? 
(Hook) 
Kick me down but I'm a champion 
Heard them say that I'm not the one 
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them 
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them 
Carry the weight like a champion 
Go sell the dreams to the other ones 
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them 
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them 
[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea] 
I never learned to fail, all I know is win 
The haters shoot me down, can't help but crash land 
I get up walking, they still talking it never ends 
They build me up to break me down it builds me up again 
On my Twin Tower shit, even when I'm gone 
They gon' pay to see where I've been 
I ain't do this shit alone but it ain't take many friends 
Now I understand the song, many men many men 
It's only so long, fake bitches can't pretend 
I'm gone with the wind, they can't even catch my drift 
The hate keep you from hearing, well fuck it read my lips 
There's some things I never do: never lose, never quit 
Never change who I am, never give a fuck who gives a shit 
I'm drunk off life, of course I'm swerving in and shit 
I'm in the zone throne empty I'ma take a sit 
And like my girl Tiny all these haters on my Tip 
(Hook) x3 
Kick me down but I'm a champion 
Heard them say they can knock you off 
Nevermind them, never nevermind them 
Nevermind them, never nevermind them 
Carry the weight like a champion 
Go sell the dreams to the other ones 
Nevermind them, never nevermind them 
Nevermind them, never nevermind them</field>

Ain't nobody here to play around 
Push it to the edge, I won't back down 
Cause it's time to go hard or go home 
One way up, no way out 
I give it all, all for the family 
We stay up, no bail outs 
Give it all, all for the family 
Five, four, three, two, I got one shot 
You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop 
New work, top drop 
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop 
And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out 
And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not 
It's love and loyalty until my heart lock 
Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out 
I said it once, I'll do it again 
I'm playin' the game, I do it to win 
With you and your friend, that's thick and thin 
That's me and my team, you know we gon' win 
You know we gon' ball 
You know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off 
You know we gon' stick to the course 
We ain't thinkin' 'bout y'all

We stay up, no bail outs 
Give it all, all for the family 
M-O-N-E-Y, what I go hard for 
Swingin' on the green like I'm tryna get a par four 
You ain't sittin' at my table, hope you starve 
Ho, don't be pushin' my buttons 'less you startin' up my car 
Pressure make a diamond, that pressure make me a star 
Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar 
People always askin' me how I got this far 
My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are 
Now they call me Mrs 
Money 
Like I'm married to the mula 
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers 
Glory, hallelujah, I'mma take that ass to church 
I'mma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work 
I feel like the sky is falling down 
Ain't nobody here to play around 
Push it to the edge, I won't back down 
Cause it's time to go hard or go home 
One way up, no way out 
I give it all, all for the family 
We stay up, no bail outs 
Give it all, all for the family 
I feel like the sky is falling down 
Ain't nobody here to play around 
Push it to the edge, I won't back down 
Cause it's time to go hard or go home 
One way up, no way out

You done pissed me off, what is y'all leaving for? 
A what? A white girl with a flow ain't been seen before 
Bow down until your knees get sore 
Treat Neimans like a grocery store 
Selfridges get the same rapport 
Ask Bey' when we off on tour 
Hopping out a fly whip screaming "This ain't yours" 
How famous can one get 'fore she get tired? 
One phone call that make all the money get wired 
Uh, spit fire that'll burn down an empire 
20 deep in the Sprinter tryin' the Benz tires 
Wave hello when I breeze by ya 
Make enough in ten months 
I could live off of or retire 
But I just won't quit 
Tryna figure out which part of this you just don't get huh 
Lord, lemme know if you got this 
Preaching about prophets 
It ain't no one man can stop us 
Bow down to a Goddess 
Bow down to a Goddess 
Bow down to a Goddess 
It ain't no one man can stop us 
Bow down to a Goddess 
Goddess! 
Got it? 
Same critics wondered if I had it in me 
Now want me to play friendly 
But how the hell you play friendly when the mention 
Of my name keep causing media frenzy 
The cameras flash everywhere, make it hard to miss me 
Lately I been crazy til a sight will commit me 
After any competition coming up against me 
You think it's anything better, then come convince me! 
Til then I'll be leading the race 
So bow down, put your knee to your face 
While I make wine outta water, turn rappers into martyrs 
Set it off whenever I-G-G in the place, huh 
Young rapper, Goddess 
Y'all are boring, read like Rapper's Digest 
I could never see you fall like I skip through August 
I'm thinkin bout now would be the time to start this 
Lord, lemme know if you got this 
Preaching about prophets 
It ain't no one man can stop us 
Bow down to a Goddess 
Bow down to a Goddess 
Bow down to a Goddess 
It ain't no one man can stop us 
Bow down to a Goddess 
Put your hands to the sky 
But only if you feel the vibe 
They wanna bury me alive but ya'll know 
Real Goddess never die! 
Put your hands to the sky 
But only if you feel the vibe 
They wanna bury me alive but ya'll know 
Real Goddess never die! 
Lord, lemme know if you got this 
Preaching about prophets

Gold hoops and my gold chain 
Gold medals, no second place, that silver shit just don't fit

They say love is like a drug 
Baby you gon' make me relapse

Boy you know, love it when you get candid 
Getting turned on with ya in the backseat 
Down the streets like royalty

Search high and low inside his dirty mind 
Then concentrate on making his hot brains 
Find your treasure 
Make it last forever now 
Get what you want in more pleasure 
Leave no one, y'all come together 
Whisper in his ear it makes it hotter 
Don't wipe the sweat, it makes it better 
Let him come when he wants 
Don't hit him with questions

What you know about 
Blowing 'bout 20 racks 
Ain't worried 'bout coming back 
If you're going now 
Got him wrapped around my fingertips 
And rock hard everytime that he can't get in 
'Cause I make him wanna shag it up 
And I only feel forgiven if he changes up 
Bonny and Clyde, never strange to us 
'Cause what's life if you never live dangerous 
And when we ain't much that 
When we get it right 
He says love is his drugs 
He won't get it light 
I never been a kind of tuck and a kid 
And I'm gonna take you light 
Until you go and get a sitting tight 
Get it like this, like that 
And I own you, won't 
Boy I ain't tryna hiver when you talking front 
See, I know your weak spot 
So I always go there 
And I bet that's the reason he ain't goin' nowhere 
Like huh 
He ain't goin' nowhere 
Get what you want in more pleasure 
Leave no one, y'all come together 
Whisper in his ear it makes it hotter 
Don't wipe the sweat, it makes it better

Ironic, I been livin' off what people down to kill for 
And I find no comfort in numbers 
Knowin' there's always a mill more 
Fact was that cat dragged my pretty ass 
Right on the top of that billboard 
And all of my folks who done 
Been here from jump you the ones I'ma cover the bill for 
And as I get ill more 
We gon' triple the order of champagne and spill more 
Let's handle the real score 
Been wonderin' what the public got a feel for 
So let's keep it real, y'all 
You know I'm killing game soon as I step on the field, y'all 
The top where I'm at now, there's no turning back now 
I won't ever back down 
They feel me like they givin' Iggy a pat-down 
I needed a moment I found it 
Lately I've been on my runnin' the town shit 
Especially walkin' around with 
This heavy crown 
You can't always please the crowd 
But I am still not bowing down 
This heavy crown 
It comes and goes around 
And when it's time, I'll pass it proud 
But bitch I got it now 
So keep a cute, chick, and don't be hatin' on the new chick 
Go back and check your stats 
And bet they let you know I do's this 
Glasses full of empty dependent unpoint of view chick 
If you was mad before 
I bet you hate me for this new shit 
Maybe you should watch 
What you've got coming out your two lips 
Get cool with how I kick it or else you gon' get the boot, bitch 
Iggy A-Z-A a 
k 
a 
captain of the crew ship 
Don't penny pinch I promise babe 
I don't need your two cents 
Get rid of the makeup let us see just who you is 
But if you feel like that girl bless your heart 
Go get it how you live 
When you hear my name 
You gotta know that she's something regal 
I'm one of one ain't no sequels 
I'm wearing 
This heavy crown 
You can't always please the crowd 
But I am still not bowing down

Oh Lord, weren't you mistaken 
I got a dinner date with greatness 
Iggy Igg ain't never been nothin' to play wit, hol' up 
To everyone who said I'd never make 
I'm at the top laughin' at you faces

We spendin' money 
There's june money and decemeber money 
Theres summer money and winter money 
Cold-co-co-co-cold. 
Clothes on top of clothes 
I'm flyer than a bird and I'm shittin' on you hoes 
Whatchu know bitch I'm on. 
And can't nobody turn me off 
And if I was a dick I would be hard but you would make me soft, my god. 
He's choosing like hello hello so pretty bitch hey yellow yellow 
Blond but please don't think I'm dumb 
I'm getting to this bread 
Where's there grey poupon 
These dudes is on my jock 
Everytime I come you would think I was trippin shit the way 
They throw them ones at me 
I can make you go, 
I can make you move, 
I can make you do what the fuck I want you to do. 
I walk in they like hello hello hello, 
I walk in they like hello hello hello x2 
Fuck you bitches, 
You ugly bitches, 
You stupid bitches, 
You dummy bitches, 
You dusty bitches 
Don't touch me bitches whoa. 
Whoa whoa whoa. 
No no no no no 
You're not on my level, 
You're not even close. 
These are ferragamo baby 
What the fuck are those? 
Since you sniff pussies and cry baby 
Go and blow your nose. 
Bitch I'm on. 
And if I have to tell you one more time I'll blow 
Like a bomb, or a horn, or a bitch behind a bungalow at prom. 
What I'm on. 
I swear these bitches not. 
This pussy two times 
twat, twat. 
Pussy two more times is exactly what he got. 
After I made it hot and he spent up all his gwap 
I'm talking racks on top of racks. 
And stacks on top of that. 
He took me to the shops and I got bags on top of bags. 
You just like orphan annie get a kitchen back them rags. 
You're not lookin' too good and that's too bad so sad. 
I can make you go, 
I can make you move, 
I can make you do what the fuck I want you to do. 
I walk in they like hello hello hello, 
I walk in they like hello hello hello x2</field>

Hot boys on my dick in the club 
Tell 'em chill out, super thick in the club 
This my new shit, play this in the club (Hey, Iggy) 
Pretty squad women make a minute man bust like a semi 
(rrah) 
Hit me late night like Jimmy 
If I give it to him once, he gon' chase me 'round the city like 
(hey Iggy) 
Where you get that ass? 
Where's the number to your doctor 'cause bitch you bad? 
Nosey hoes asking 'bout my brand new nose 
But my bank account, got some brand new O's 
(ohh, hah, go it) (hey Iggy) 
Heard he got that work, wanna be my assistant 
He love the white chocolate, I'm thicker than a snicker 
Thicker than a stripper, if she clap it, I'ma tip her (hey Iggy) 
Where you get that ass, low-low waist, brand new bag? 
(Hey Iggy, hey Iggy) 
I say hey Iggy, you're so fine 
you're so fine, you blow my mind (hey Iggy, hey Iggy) 
I say hey Iggy, you're so fine 
you're so fine, you blow my mind (hey Iggy, hey Iggy) 
Baddest white bitch in the game 
I could make Future put down the drink 
From trapping in Miami, nominations at the Grammies 
Haters can't stand me but they love me at the bank 
(hey Iggy) 
You want that in all hunnids? 
It really turn me on seeing bitches getting money 
It really turn me off seeing boys actin' thirsty 
Told them I'd be bad and I curved him (hey Iggy) 
Where you get that ass? 
Feeling on my booty while I fill my glass 
This's what you want, what you need, huh? 
For the dope boys doubling their re-up 
For the hot girls pulling at their G-Strings 
You're gon give it to them soon as you leave, huh? 
(Leave, huh?) (Hey, Iggy) 
Why they hate Iggy? 
While you was on a diet, your girl made millies 
Fuck beef, I got more estate than Philly 
Where you get that ass, low-low waist, brand new bag? 
(Hey Iggy, hey Iggy) 
I say hey Iggy, you're so fine, you're so fine 
you blow my mind (hey Iggy, hey Iggy) 
Baddest white bitch in the game 
I could make Future put down the drank 
Baddest white bitch in the club

Drunk bitch, big tits, motorboats on the way 
She say she wanna earn some stripes 
Well we about to see if she about that life 
Rollin, rollin, rollin, I ain't steppin in weed 
I got a bad bitch with me and I think she a freak 
We about to make a movie girl, get the camera ready 
Man it's the fucking minute, I'm thinkin that she ready 
I think she ready, I think she ready 
Red cup, double stuff, I think she ready

Takin molly to the dome, I think she ready

Get here home by the Cove, I think she ready

Someone needs weeds for you hoes

Up all night in a life like this, fans pass out when I kiss 
If you hate then you are toast 
knot breakers keep burnin' witch 
Chain hang, diamonds swang 
two red cups my Sprite is mixed 
Powder white keep sippin Angel

Stop, drop, bottles pop, for-ever, sandlot 
Other rappers underground, call them all fraggle rock 
There's a pretty big bar, I got no manners 
Don't blame me, just blame my Daddy, for 
For life fort, some may snort, some may bort 
They on my caddies, I'm on that E, the roll is me 
Me and yo beesh, we bang like rabbits 
(And that Cat..

Probably call, shit blue magic, purple brain, I fill my cup 
Bitch you know, that my cup ready

Act a fool and then I'm game

Ijjy aza, yeah then a nigga like moaning to the ea 
All my exes mad cause they was playing 
So I hit my home girls and told 'em I can't stay in 
Spotlight stuck on me, that's how it seems 
Stepping out, diana ross, no supremes 
See it took about an hour just to fit into these jeans 
And I don't see no end or future or what it seems 
I bet you're wishing that you had me back 
And knowing my frame down when you catch a track 
So, could you please tell anyone to catch a stack? 
And I heard that the new girl that you have is whack 
I've been where.. 
what you holler them about? 
Money talk, keep quiet, baby, let your dollar shine 
I've got what you want, bet I'm never running out 
Checking in, there is space in the benz, I'm coming out! 
I'm coming out, I've got my girls tonight 
It's time we take control! 
Baby, you're coming! 
I'm coming out, I've got my girls tonight 
It's time we take control! 
I'm coming! 
For too long I put up with your lies 
And your lame alibis 
No more, no more! 
For too long you kept me in the dark 
I won't let you break my heart 
No more, no more! 
I'm calling my girlfriends 
They're all telling me move on, move on! 
Girl, it just ain't working! 
So be out by the weekend 
Pack up all your 
I'm gone, I'm gone, cause you just don't deserve it! 
I'm coming out, I've got my girls tonight 
It's time we take control! 
Baby, you're coming! 
I'm coming out, I've got my girls tonight 
It's time we take control! 
I'm coming! 
I'm so wrong to think that I would change 
I will let you run your game no more, no more! 
I was so wrong to get a second chance 
But I finally understand, no, no, no! 
I'm calling my girlfriends! 
I'm calling my girlfriends 
They're all telling me move on, move on! 
Girl, it just ain't working! 
So be out by the weekend

Good riddance to all you bitches

I mean its one for the haters, one for the road 
Literally, bitch, I let her go 
You ain't got a name, I let you go 
Whoop that trick-hustle flow 
Do you really, really wanna go? 
You take one, shit, I take 40 - producer o

I'm sorry nicki but these hoes disrespecting hard 
Had to address the nonsense, here's a postcard 
Smell aroma 
W kill these hoes 
at least they'd know their not tricked out put beats in comas rhymes so sick words 
You're defeated before you speak it 
Eow deleted

In time you will all see, I'm so fresh man 
Your mouth fronting, hey

Nagalova, bitch 
Second home: the big apple 
Who want beef, ho? I heard cattle 
Bury bitches in the sand

Very likely that I'll reach a high, insane 
So I hope you got a rain coat 
Ready for this rain 
Hang yourself 
Ltop

Better luck next time

'Til I get where I want, baby I ain't leaving 
Everytime I go out everybody wanna show me 
I just see a girl in the mirror, told her: you the reason 
Simmer down bitch 
It's Iggy season 
Simmer down bitch 
It's Iggy season 
I ain't worried 'bout shit 
It's Iggy season 
Bad bitches scream "yas" 
It's Iggy season 
Every man needs some Azalea 
Why don't you do what I tell ya? 
Play in my team, and get the ring back 
You don't, you gon' end up a failure 
I look like a fantasy, your wifey mad at me 
Just 'cause you be the fan of me, you understand me? 
So skip the talking, maybe you're too busy balling 
Pedal to the metal and my engine never stalling babe 
Bitches gon' hate, while the critics critique 
I pay them no mind whenever they speak 
What they make a year, I can make in a week 
I know you can't stand it, just get you a seat 
See the sky be the limit when you dealin' with me 
I'm stuntin' this hard, and I ain't even reached my peak 
I just get money to spend it, let the cycle repeat 
I'm feeling like I got this world at my feet 
Hm, Iggz 
Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy season 
'Til I get where I want, baby I ain't leaving

It's Iggy season 
Bad bitches scream "yas" 
It's Iggy season 
Go Iggy, go Iggy, go Iggy, go Iggy 
You ain't down to make a purchase 
Tell me what's your purpose? 
Go out and play somewhere 
The grown folks ain't busy working 
Iggy independent whether they know that for certain 
You be on the internet, thirsty, prolly worse in person 
Down payment on a car, I dropped that on a Birkin 
You don't sit in VIP 'cause you ain't no important person 
Money wrapped around my mind like a turban 
Iggy got them pop titties but that ass on that urban 
If I told you what I'm worth, you would throw up 
So have my money on top before I show up 
I'm drinking PJ on a PJ in my PJs 
Thinking money 25 8, no free days 
If the girl gone by, I would cool down 
They ask me who I do it for, I say "you down" 
Damn right, I like the life I live 
Who else you know that slay like Iggz 
You little bitch 
Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy season 
'Til I get where I want, baby I ain't leaving 
Everytime I go out everybody wanna show me 
I just see a girl in the mirror, told her: you the reason 
Simmer down bitch 
It's Iggy season 
Simmer down bitch 
It's Iggy season 
I ain't worried 'bout shit 
It's Iggy season 
Bad bitches scream "yas" 
It's Iggy season 
Drop down on 'em, bring 'em back up 
Iggy Iggy in the building, call for backup 
See I don't want nothing but them stacks 
So if you see a bad bitch, point her out, where she at tho? 
I'm clap, clap, clap, clapping on 'em 
I'm clap, clap, clap, clapping on 'em 
See 
we don't wanna ever turn down 
So go ahead and back, back it on 
Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy season 
'Til I get where I want, baby I ain't leaving 
Everytime I go out everybody wanna show me

Never die out until your heart drops 
Success will separate you from the have nots 
And have all these haters at your neck like an ascot 
You could do it too young world 
I remember being exactly like you young girl 
But wait, you could do it too young man 
See you'll be fine as long as on your own two you stand 
Keep on living, keep on breathing 
Even when you don't believe it 
Keep on climbing, keep on reaching 
Even when this world can't see it 
No, Impossible is nothing 
Even when you don't believe it 
Impossible is nothing 
Even when this world can't see it 
Impossible is nothing 
Gotta hate to not have it more than you'd love to obtain it 
Your future is round the corner so close 
You can almost taste it 
It gets worse before it's better 
That storm you gon' have to weather 
Either be a busted pipe or a diamond due to this pressure 
25 hours 8 days out the week 
Focus, keep eyes open victory never sleeps 
My prayers for you is that you hit all them goals 
You trynna reach 
I even hope at one point you take it farther than me 
Keep on living, keep on breathing

Keep on climbing, keep on reaching 
Even when this world can't see it 
No, Impossible is nothing 
Even when you don't believe it 
Impossible is nothing 
Even when this world can't see it 
Impossible is nothing 
I shall never let them see me sweat 
Promise to want for more till my very last breath 
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next 
And never sell out my soul for any number on a cheque 
I shall never let them see me sweat 
Promise to want for more till my very last breath 
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next 
Just promise me when I'm gone you won't forget 
Keep on living, keep on breathing 
Even when you don't believe it 
Keep on climbing, keep on reaching

You was hanging so hard, you nearly lost that 
Little trick you like to do, yeah I taught that 
I got a brand new man and a brand new place 
Glad you called, thought you coulda had that space 
I'm alright, and Imma play it cool 
I can't cook, but I made a plate for you 
You wanted something more, than what we had 
What's up with her? She ain't all that 
I'm not trippin' on what coulda been 
I know it's kinda weird, I'm just askin' 
Just askin' 
I know it's kinda weird, I'm just askin'

To run into you and I noticed your reaction 
You couldn't say shit, I read your caption 
She a one-hit wonder, and you missin' my classics 
Damn that's tragic 
I would hate to be you 
To tell the truth, she could never be me 
I got a new man, with a few new bands 
Give me what I want, and he got that D

He wanna pop a wheelie

I'm sipping saki 
I'ma roll like Gotti 
Boy, why you always wanna meet me in the lobby 
He wanna pop a wheelie 
Ride him like a Kawasaki 
Ah, I'm going live, sit down and watch me 
You're rocking Jordans but you're Dennis Rodman 
I used to get the chicken fingers but now I get the lobster 
Or I get the poster, yeah, all my bitches mobbing 
Halloween teen fame turned me to a monster 
I make him fight for the pussy, I'm Ronda Rousey 
Playin' hard to get, ring around the rosey 
If we're locking, keep it low key, shit 
I'm going live 
The block is hot 
Bistro inside 
Barry Sanders tryna juke the truth, he know you lyin' 
She popping pussy, pussy swollen, pop 'em ultra now 
I can take my jewellery off, to be the golden child 
I'm going live, she just wanna watch 
She with you 'cause you're rich, she just wants a watch 
They told me to be humble, so I started humming (mm, mm)

I could act like I'm humble but you know I'm not 
You mean to act like I don't know when I know I'm hot 
Ex shot by my shiplock, woah 
He wanna rock to my tempo 
I'm in the endzone, he in the friendzone 
If you really on, where you team at? Put them on 
Looking in the mirror, only bitch I depend on 
Ah, I'm going live, sit down and watch me 
See my ass tan, I was in the tropics 
'Bout to catch a flight just to go shopping 
This a 1 of 1, what you know about it? 
Big amounts, big time accountants 
I can only vouch for my accountant 
And who I hold it down with 
They told me to be humble, so I started humming (mm, mm) 
Fuck you hoes, I came from nothin' 
They telling me be humble but they know I'm cocky 
Let me feel myself, yeah, daddy know I'm cocky 
Ah, my wrist is rocky, come try and stop me 
He wanna pop a wheelie 
Ride him like a Kawasaki 
Big Phantom grill, cook the streets like hibachi 
I'm sipping saki 
I'm roll like Gotti 
Boy, why you always wanna meet me in the lobby 
He wanna pop a wheelie 
Ride him like a Kawasaki

            <field name="lyrics">Can we love until there's nothing left 
And we're collecting dust? 
Use the halo of our golden souls 
Until we're flecks of rust 
A love so deep, nothing else like it 
Scars go deep, but they can't find it 
Flames so bright make the daylight look dark 
Cross my heart, that I'll always keep you 
Cross my heart like a bitter sweet tattoo 
And we go 
Oh, you're my kingdom come 
Oh, you're my kingdom come 
So sit me on you throne 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Ler it intertwine 
Your hand in mine 
And fill the empty space 
All the demons cry 
Cause you and I 
Found love in a broken place 
A love so deep, nothing else like it 
Scars go deep, but they can't find it 
Flames so bright make the daylight look dark 
Cross my heart, that I'll die for you 
Cross my heart, that I'll always keep you 
Cross my heart like a bitter sweet tattoo 
And we go 
Oh, you're my kingdom come 
Oh, you're my kingdom come 
Sit me on you throne 
Yeah (yeah) , yeah (yeah) , yeah (Iggs) 
Gather around, now I'm back from my holiday 
"Long live the Queen", what the people say 
And that be me, I got a king in my calvary 
Them other knights, say goodnight, they get apathy 
You'll never catch an Adam without Eve 
You'll never catch a bloom without seeds 
See what I mean? 
You're my Caesar upon my clariot 
You know family matters what' as Carl without Harriot? 
Is that trouble like Mary Kate and Ashley? 
Incredible, I'm ready if you ask me 
To ride on them feminine chicks, you feel me? 
I break' em down, it's a sport, I should win an Espy 
Royalty, another level, boy you don't shine 
Legendary, leather nation needs a paradigm 
Call all the king's horses and all the king's men 
We're ruling' til the end, kingdom come 
Oh, you're my kingdom come 
Oh, you're my kingdom come 
You're my kingdom come 
So sit me on your throne</field>

Talkin' hits on hits, McGuire, Bonds, Griffey

Pearl handle on the pistol, tell this world to come and get me 
And I'm thummin' through designers 
To pick which'll fit me proper 
Paid dues, climbed through the ranks, but we ain't Shabba 
Need me a rude boy, something straight outta shottas 
That could drive a girl crazy, all the way off my rocker 
Versaces over eyelids, lookin' like Biggie Poppa 
No they thought I wouldn't make it 
I'm lookin' like what's the matter? 
But tell them money talks, and them man not saying nada

Can't help that I rap, oh my accent's fake? 
Guess I'm joseline, they gon' talk anyway, way 
Life move fast so I drive slow 
And my life move fast so I drive slow 
Uh, ain't tryna say I'm not a pop star 
Like jay say, "ayy, you are who you fuckin' are" 
Uh, and I ain't tryna change that 
Million dollar bills ain't tryna change that

Stay for two years and get to acting like I grew here

White bitch down slugs, and gangstas faint 
I shut it down, go and hate

No time to waste 
Amazing grace, embrace the place 
You basic bitch, get out my face

Bottles over here, more till I die 
Sparkle every bottle, see the glare in my eye 
Turned over here, it's the 4th of july

            <field name="lyrics">He got a house that's too big 
Sits on a hill in the valley 
Said he trying to move on with life 
But he still wanna be a good daddy 
So I sit in the ride cause I don't want us overlapping 
Spendin' money on Mac, that's cute 
I get checks from them in Paris 
Better check my tax bracket 
What you think was gonna happen 
Naggin', now he's had it 
And y'all fell off like Mad Men 
These exes excessively hatin' on the next bitch 
She's no housewife, just desperate 
I know it's hard to let go but accept it 
Cause the whole world is watchin' 
And the paparazzi is flockin' 
Cause we fly shit when we drop in 
And we shut down your party 
'His' and 'her' gold chains 
Gold watches, everything 
His old girl, she gon' hate 
They gon' have something to say 
When I hop out his new six 
Fresh in some new shit 
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this? " 
Yeah I'm his new bitch 
I'm his new bitch 
And I'm spending his new cash 
Few trips, new bags 
Damn, she is too bad 
Oh you mad? 
That I'm his new bitch 
Yeah, I'm his new bitch 
[Interlude - Spoken] 
She be the one that be like 
"Hey, girl, what's up? You in town? " 
Yes, I'm in town, kissing ---- on the face, and you know this 
So just say it 
It's always jealous broads wishing they was in my shoes 
But I'm a debut, you a deja vu 
Girl, you know the drill, I got a couple loose screws 
Driving, riding, all black suits up 
Up north in a coupe before I meet him with the crew 
And what I do, it can't be compared 
You well done and bitch I'm rare 
So stop popping up unexpected 
Stop sending threats and text messages 
We too grown for this messy shit 
This will be my last conversation 
If you don't want no problems 
Move yourself from the equation 
Cause the whole world is watchin' 
And the paparazzi is flockin' 
Cause we fly shit when we drop in 
And we shut down your party 
'His' and 'her' gold chains 
Gold watches, everything 
His old girl, she gon' hate 
They gon' have something to say 
When I hop out his new six 
Fresh in some new shit 
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this? " 
Yeah I'm his new bitch 
I'm his new bitch 
And I'm spending his new cash 
Few trips, new bags 
Damn, she is too bad 
Oh you mad? 
That I'm his new bitch 
Yeah, I'm his new bitch 
Tell your friends to tell their friends too 
He got a new chick but it ain't you 
I'm just saying, you know it's true 
Cry a river and swim on through 
I know you hoping we won't make it 
Clyde and Bonnie, let the world chase us 
Ride or die where the world takes us 
If we end up poor or rich and famous 
I'm all he needs and more chick 
His home chick 
His tour chick 
His 4th finger, left hand chick 
And all those people go 'Damn, chick' 
When I hop out his new six 
Fresh in some new shit 
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this? " 
Yeah I'm his new bitch 
I'm his new bitch 
And I'm spending his new cash 
Few trips, new bags 
Damn, she is too bad 
Oh you mad? 
That I'm his new bitch 
Yeah, I'm his new bitch</field>

Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch 
Get her out dem tennis shoes 
Throw some heels on a bitch

Hold up, only if she bad though 
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last go 
Take her to my castle 
Drown her in my cash flow 
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole 
Told me she can write this shit 
No further than a cab go 
Said I got that don dick 
She wanna be my tutor 
So she give me brain getting head on the scooter 
Had sex on the beach 
From Bermuda up to Cuba

But I'm looking for a cute bitch

You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you 
Understand my life is easy 
When I ain't around you 
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin' 
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you 
More than I love your presence 
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit 
I let you go, let you back 
I finally learned my lesson 
No half-steppin' 
Either you want it or you just playin' 
I'm listenin' to you knowin' 
I can't believe what you're sayin' 
There's a million you's baby boo 
So don't be dumb 
I got 99 problems but you won't be one

            <field name="lyrics">You used to be everything, now that mean nothing 
Thought this was poker with the cards up 
but we were bluffing 
I miss you but pride won't let me tell you 
Thought that we had all the time 
But I'm guessing that plans fell through 
Yeah, we fell off 
I won't ask you to climb back 
I paid twenty for that Rolly, I just want my time back 
Was wrong too but I see it now 
That you don't give a damn 
I got you tatted, you took off 
before the ink dried on my hands 
I was down to give you the world, instead you gave me hell 
I lied, tried to be perfect and I played myself 
And it hurts so bad, we coulda worked on that 
Cause you say you love me 
but real love don't work like that 
The truth is, I left a piece of me in a piece I gave you 
And I tend to laugh and crack a smile 
when things get painful 
Said I crack a smile when things get painful 
Remembering the moments when I used to date you 
Rolex's don't tick-tock 
But damn it baby, my time costs 
And damn it baby, my time is money 
So I need payback for all the time lost 
I need payback for all the time lost 
Said, I need payback for all the time lost 
Damn it baby, my time costs 
So I need payback for all the time lost 
Say that you love me 
I say that you're lying 
Cause I said we could work on it, you said 
"let's leave it behind" 
Couldn't put together the picture I paint in my mind 
So how I see you know insulting me is wasting my time 
But we live and learn and learn and love and let go 
Cause if we stay in this 
then we might make it worse than before 
Another hard lesson, stressing taking personal notes 
Remember sweet nothings, like baby 
what's the purpose in those? 
Both of us saying it shouldn't have went like that 
But sometimes in love, it just get like that 
Used to think that when it went wrong we'd get right back 
You know, Cupid's got another arrow, and shit like that 
And for all of y'all watching I hope that this entertain you 
And that you enjoyed this song that I sang you 
Cause I'm still here laughing when it gets painful 
Remembering the moments when I used to date you 
Rolex's don't tick-tock 
But damn it baby, my time costs 
And damn it baby, my time is money 
So I need payback for all the time lost 
I need payback for all the time lost 
Said, I need payback for all the time lost 
Damn it baby, my time costs 
So I need payback for all the time lost</field>

Put everything in a suitcase one day 
And run away to the runway 
To find somewhere to lay my heart, lay my heart 
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going 
To find somewhere to lay my heart 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
(Verse: Iggy Azalea) 
You ever start to feel that home wasn't your home 
Kinda like somebody made you wear the wrong clothes 
What you say ain't gotta be what you made of 
Well see your heart don't always match where you came from 
Couldn't see you so they treat you like a misfit 
Because your mind clicks in another district 
Call you favor they don't know what's inside you 
'Cause what's inside justifies what divides you 
Searching for that place right where you wanna be 
That's really real where it's never full capacity 
Roll back and get away, never come back never runaway 
(Chorus) 
Put everything in a suitcase one day 
And run away to the runway 
To find somewhere to lay my heart, 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going 
To find somewhere to lay my heart 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
(Verse: Pusha T) 
They say home's where you hang your hat 
So beware of the owner 'cause he bang his gap 
And in that shit I push and I clean my set 
All over the globe via I rap 
And it still ain't enough for the haters 
Put on for my city, light it up like it's Vegas 
How you frontin' on I lead I'm the greatest 
Flow like a butterfly, the porsche ride amazing 
I feel like speedracer 
My jello's in the Louie Duffle 
MCM hold the finna' buckle 
Paw, that's what I call an interracial couple 
A long whip poppin' tans, that's a power struggle 
(Chorus) 
Put everything in a suitcase one day 
And run away to the runway 
To find somewhere to lay my heart, 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going 
To find somewhere to lay my heart 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
(Verse: Iggy Azalea) 
Change my lounge too, and my lattitude 
To get an attitude, the shit granted too 
But my mind's gone until my fine home 
Then I can get my shine on no rice stones 
Then I can get my shine on no rice stones 
See you later with my bigz, I'm gone 
(Chorus) 
Put everything in a suitcase one day 
And run away to the runway 
To find somewhere to lay my heart, 
Home's wherever I lay my heart 
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going 
To find somewhere to lay my heart 
Home's wherever I lay my heart</field>

I hit you up, you're on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though 
I'd rather go slo 
Used to be happy, but now shit's unpredictable 
I smiled at the show but there were tears in the limo though 
You fucked her on my birthday 
and that's what really hurt the most 
You tell the truth? half way, guess thats why this unfixable 
But still ? 
When i'm alone, i check the time 
I hit you up, you're on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though 
I'd rather go slo, yeah 
I'd rather go slo 
I'd rather go slo 
I'd rather go slo 
When i call sometimes i wish you pick up 
But most days the call is declined 
It's okay, i don't give a fuck 
You outta sight, so you outta mind 
I'm doing alright know i'ma be fine 
I gotta few candidates standing in line 
Broke up before but i wasn't like this 
Not many regrets i wish i could rewind 
Damn 
we both got our lives so it's no surprise 
The schedules conflict and we can't coincide 
My heart's cold, feels like i got no insides 
We rushed it to the finish line, we should have took our time 
You make me crazy with rash decisions and sudden movements 
Can't even enjoy a moment or pay attention to it 
If i could try this shit again? real shit i'd probably do it? 
That's why it's hard to act like you someone i'm really through with 
When i'm alone, i check the time 
I hit you up, you're on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though

You're 'bout to fall on your ass 
Look, you won't survive the summer! 
You won't survive the summer, damn, uh 
They ain't getting dumber and dumber 
(Dumber and dumber and dumber 
And dumber and dumber and dumber) 
Shit, you won't survive the summer! 
I know these Chanel shoes are ugly, but 
That's your rent, bitch!</field>

What you want 
Look, look 
Kick in the door, wavin' the four fizzy 
They already know they can't fuck with Iggy 
True's cost more than the rent do, you know that 
All black on when I come through, it's Kodak 
Mirror, mirror on the wall 
Is Iggy the ziggy-iggy the baddest of 'em all? 
Why you come through, shut down the mall? 
All that ass deserve an applause 
Change the game (Change it up, change it up now) 
Switchin' up the game (Switch it up, switch it up now) 
There I go again (Here we go, here we go) 
Play your role, play you ro-o-ole 
Fantasy (Fantasy) 
Turns reality (Turn reality) 
Right in front of me (Right in front of me) 
I can have it anyway I want 
Red light, yellow light, green light 
Switch! (Ooh) 
This is about the time you recognize I'm that bitch 
This is all that sauce your mama said 
You couldn't get 
Red light, yellow light, green light 
Switch! (Ooh) 
Me and my boo on a worldwide hustle 
You know what it is when I flex that muscle 
I don't even know what a real one do 
Talk that talk, I can back it up too 
Got yo dessert, call me the waiter 
I'm flirtin', you'll get it later 
You can get it from the inside out 
No hands, you can put it in your mouth 
Change the game (Change it up, change it up now)

The lamb, the Bentley truck 
He don't love you, that ring ain't big enough 
If they talkin' that money I'm showing up 
My account getting bigger it's growing up 
And I'm still a motherfuckin' rockstar 
Popstar but I roll with the mobsters 
Yacht club on the shore eating lobster 
While I'm stunting in Geneva with my top off 
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh) 
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch 
This is all that sauce your mama said

All men are liars 
You can only trust yourself 
I know that weed is fire! 
It can't last forever 
True love died in '96 
There is nothing left now 
Replace hearts with business 
Damn well... 
What I'm meaning to seems I, 
Think I met someone 
But he ain't really my type shiiit 
He only 21 
His fingers do the talking 
Where he's from, will be his coffin 
Every time this homeboy drive me 'round think 
I might die on slauson 
But, 
I still wanna keep him, cook him breakfast in the mornings 
We haven't even kissed yet 
But that just make me want him more 
Plus he love his mama yep 
He a family man 
And even though the ratchets love him, 
I still think he a gentleman 
Oh oh oh 
Life's a trip and baby you the plane 
And I'm just trynna get a seat next to you to stay 
Put his fear in his nose 
Why he do that? I don't know 
I lost a couple friends to that 
So I hope he is in control 
Every time he swear he gonna stop 
But I know that he won't wish 
I could be the only angel he need to be strong 
This, could be dangerous 
Man I got a lot at stake 
I ain't even graduate 
So I don't have room for mistakes 
No oh oh oh 
Life's a trip and baby you the plane 
I'm just trynna get a seat next to you to stay 
Yes I am, yes I would. 
When? For good? For you? For ever! 
All my friends think that I'm crazy 
They tell me I could do better 
Fuck all that, boo 
It's you that I'm trying to get to heaven with 
They say that you're a hindrance 
But I think that you genuinence 
They say he's no item 
Please don't like him. 
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!' 
But I don't give a fuck if my friends don't like him 
I don't give a f... 
They say he's no item 
Please don't like him. 
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!' 
But I don't give a fuck if my friends don't like him

I shoulda known that you were bad news 
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos 
'Cause most guys only want one thing 
But I'm undecided, tryin' to figure out if that's you 
Either way though, I think you're worth the test drive 
'Cause I know you're so much better than the next guy 
And a little trouble only makes for a good time 
So all the normal red flags be a good sign 
Don't you come here thinking you're balling 
Oh no, ain't down for it 
You seem like trouble to me 
I can tell by the way that you lean 
And the way that you kiss your teeth 
And you turn up so fresh and clean 
Smells like trouble to me 
Opposites attract, I guess this is that 
Good girl, bad guy, what a perfect match 
And if we fuck you gon' wanna pay back tithes 
When we finish you gon' feel like you was baptized 
See baby now you fiendin' for a test drive 
'Cause you don't wanna lose your ride to the next guy 
And baby trouble only makes for a good time 
So all the normal red flags be a good sign 
Don't you come here thinking you're balling 
Oh no, ain't down for it 
You seem like trouble to me 
I can tell by the way that you lean 
And the way that you kiss your teeth 
And you turn up so fresh and clean 
Smells like trouble to me 
I got it bad for him in the worst way 
Dear Lord, how'd I get in this positioning 
Should've never got involved in the first place 
Second place never get the recognition, um 
See what he doin' to me make me have to shout it out 
Gotta hold on me and that's without a doubt 
So clear now that he's trouble starter 
But I ain't a saint neither and these ain't no still waters 
Just 'cause all the girls are falling at your feet 
Don't mean no thing to me 
'Til you show me where it's at 
Smells like trouble to me 
Just 'cause all the girls are falling at your feet 
Don't mean no thing to me 
'Til you show me where it's at 
Smells like trouble to me 
I shoulda known that you were bad news 
(Knew you were bad news) 
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos 
(All of the tattoos) 
I shoulda known that you were bad news 
(Knew you were bad news) 
But I'm undecided, tryin' to figure out if that's you 
You're trouble to me 
Don't you come here thinking you're balling 
Oh no, ain't down for it

Bout to hit the club when my man starts talking shit 
You're supposed to be my man but you act like my babysitter 
You're supposed to be my friend 
but you can't get your head together 
Never told you no that you couldn't go with your boys 
Why you wanna tell me where to go, stop, left, right 
Why you tryna tell me what I can't do 
Seems like everytime I wanna go you tell me to stay so 
I'mma have to be the one to put you in your place like

never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear 
not in a million years could you tell me that I'd be here 
I just hopped off that lier, my life on another tier 
lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear 
from country living to county skipping, 
this would drive you crazy 
check the rate that they pay me a giant could never slay me 
money never a maybe but never forgot my roots 
I heard that the top is lonely I wonder if it's the truth 
so I'm just climbing pay that fine and now 
I'm shining could be blinding 
ain't too much real left but right here is where you could find it 
this that new classic, ain't this what you needed 
I'm what amazing look like you recognise it when you see it 
nowhere I wanna be but I'm far from my own 
I'm just tryna make it on my own 
living life, they still call, I don't answer the phone 
this is the line that I walk alone 
ain't no going back now 
don't know where I'm at now 
ain't no going back now 
this is the line that I walk alone 
I've been counted out, I've been stepped on 
I was wide awake and got slept on 
I had everything and then lost it 
worked my ass off, I'm exhausted 
all this talk about me, just talk about me 
I'm here now, they can't walk around me 
I'm dedicated, flow elevated 
tell every hater hope you never play it, said I'll never make it 
I'm celebrating, I'm never quitting, no resignation 
such different mentions out of desperation 
I'm a fresh face with no expiration 
the pressure made diamonds so I threw 'em off in this chain 
when it's all on the line 
I'm who you want in the game 
'cause I'm gonna get it and it's for sure 
can't be like y'all, it's no go 
international, y'all local, got this locked up just like po po 
every beat get ate, that's ocho 
won't lose, oh, no, that's your code 
been up and down like low lows 
still make my own on my solo 
had to be here to believe it 
think like winners to perceive it 
it will let you know that I mean it 
if I speak it I say keep it 
this flow, that's genious 
just think about it, would I think about it? 
if I didn't live it won't ink about it 
married to the money, put a ring around it, what? 
nowhere I wanna be but I'm far from my own 
I'm just tryna make it on my own 
living life, they still call, I don't answer the phone 
this is the line that I walk alone 
ain't no going back now 
don't know where I'm at now 
ain't no going back now

All this cash, cash, cash, cash, cash 
I seen Sean the other day, he said 
"Damn I ain't know you had that 
Ass, ass, ass, ass!", leave no questions 
I'm G-reat, when I'm on that D, I have you gone in 60 seconds 
These bitches don't like me, ah, 
these haters want to fight me, ah 
Wake up and get caked up, put these bitches on diets, ah 
Polo should have been my logo, 
with a jockey around on my coat though 
So I got to take 'em back to the drawing board 
Cause it's time to make some hits for the mo'mo' 
I turn up when my chalk missing, and hop out in a New Edition 
I'm propane, this Hell's Kitchen, 
my campfire, this smoke signals 
Sold some other shit, get these maggots off me 
The best is a immaculate, attach it slowly 
Broads got at where you act, they acting Tony 
Fuck you up in the ass, get the alimony, ugh 
[Hook] 
Should have known a thing 
Should have known a thing about me 
Well, she don't know that I'm on a roll 
I'm a motherfucking G, and we long distance 
Sipping on biscuits, sipping our tea 
We flip them the bird, then let them fly on for free 
Watchu lookin' at, Watchu lookin' at 
Watchu lookin' at, Watchu lookin' at 
[Verse 2] 
I'm cooling in Italy 
And a man could probably a tee, I'm making a scene 
If they rolling the camera's, my candids come with a fee 
Excuse my french, I speak deadly, bread throwing that cheddy 
My pocket's nauseous, these ones is vomits, 
I'm throwing up this confetti 
Ugh, I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke 
I'm gonna ride this wave kind of like a tube on the rope 
Iif you don't like it, I give you something to hold 
Here's a D from you to me, you can call it my own 
Damn Iggy, damn Iggy, why you so illy 
Sewed up, really when the pen in the needle, you gon' feel me 
I got my fam with me, going H.A.M, 
and that's some damn chilling 
Take the night off, and with me we gon' ride off, 
and we gon' ride off 
Watcha lookin at, ugh!</field>

Now let's reflect on what we left on New Classic 
I overstepped what was expected, I blew past it 
So best bet is respect my perspective 
Or go get your sight checked for new glasses 
The fact is you combine the stats with 
The history I made, the message should be established 
I guess what I'm explaining in laymen's 
Is ain't nothin' about miss Azalea average 
Now we in this bitch 
Admit it get borin' with no me in this bitch 
Now we in this bitch 
What's a world with no I-G-G in this bitch? 
Now we in this bitch 
Admit it get borin' with no me in this bitch 
Now we in this bitch 
What's a world with no I-G-G in this bitch? 
Unpolished product of my environment 
Tryna get the same type love and respect 
Aas peers I be rhymin' with 
But everything is so one-sided, divided and biased 
That I can't get a fair judge panel not in the slightest bit 
In light of this, I had to write a hit to get this type of chip 
Ridin' dick won't get me nowhere and I ain't that type of chick 
That's so unladylike 'specially knowin' they be like 
"Iggy this and Iggy that" long as you say it, say it right 
Right, they might be playin' but Iggy ain't 
'Til Iggy faint, I just wanna fill this Iggy bank 
See I emerged from the smoke without a smudge on me 
So back up up off of me 
Unless you got some love for me, right 
Even with my back against the wall 
I still don't know fear and won't shed a tear 
Cause when I think back, I've seen it all 
And everything that ain't stopped me got me here so 
Now we in this bitch 
Admit it get borin' with no me in this bitch 
Now we in this bitch 
What's a world with no I-G-G in this bitch? 
Now we in this bitch 
Admit it get borin' with no me in this bitch 
Now we in this bitch 
What's a world with no I-G-G in this bitch? 
Look in my eyes and see what I see 
You know that nothin' happenin' surprise me 
It's like I seen this before 
This is everything I was dreaming for 
Relax your mind let ya conscious free 
I got expensive taste and I ain't waiving the fee 
It's like I seen this before 
Life is now everything I dreamed and more 
And more, life is now everything I dreamed and more 
And more, life is now everything I dreamed and more 
And more, life is now everything I dreamed 
Even with my back against the wall 
I still don't know fear and won't shed a tear 
Cause when I think back, I've seen it all 
And everything that ain't stopped me got me here so 
Now we in this bitch 
Admit it get borin' with no me in this bitch 
Now we in this bitch 
What's a world with no I-G-G in this bitch? 
Now we in this bitch 
Admit it get borin' with no me in this bitch

Everything be alright, that's what we said 
So we're richer now, super wicked style, we get wild 
If it's right how we does it now, how you like it now? 
Money talks if you were down and did not mention my name 
Ain't competition within me and they make the same 
Need a Benz or a better just to get in my line 
Flyin private, we get at it til they see me on the plane 
Talkin fly right til we turn night into day 
We could take time and never waste time cuz I don't play 
So original, super wicked style, super wicked

But they don't wear these shits where I'm from 
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you 
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through 
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt 
Sugar cane, back lanes 
Three jobs, took years to save 
But I got a ticket on that plane 
People got a lot to say 
But don't know a thing about where I was made 
Or how many floors that I had to scrub 
Just to make it past where I am from 
No money, no family 
Sixteen in the middle of Miami 
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Now get this work 
Working on my shit 
You can hate it or love it 
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting 
Thorough bread in a mud brick before the budget 
White chick on that Pac shit 
My passion was ironic 
And my dreams were uncommon 
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me 
Robbed blind, basically raped me 
Rose through the bullshit like a Matador 
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em 
And even the score 
So, I went harder 
Studied the Carters 'till a deal was offered 
Slept cold on the floor recording 
At 4 in the morning 
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer 
Immigrant, art ignorant 
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit 
Hate be inconsiderate 
But the Industry took my innocence 
Too late, now I'm in this bitch! 
You don't know the half 
This shit get real 
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins 
What you call that? 
Head over heels? 
No money, no family 
Sixteen in the middle of Miami 
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Now get this work 
Working on my shit 
Pledge allegiance to the struggle 
Ain't been easy 
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle 
Bags is all we had 
Do anything for my momma, I love you 
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice 
That ya managed to muscle 
Sixteen you sent me through customs so 
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury 
Turn first at the light that's in front me 
'Cause every night I'mma do it like it's my last 
This dream is all that I need 
'Cause it's all that I ever had

Ready for the ring, just maybe I might be 
Never been a smut, I don't care who like me 
I can count on one hand all the dudes thats piped me 
Takin kinda long, time is movin on, been feelin kinda strong, 
love is on the phone 
Ya sayin that I'm here, if only you could hear 
My heart yellin' out, I wanted to compare 
I know what I deserve, I demand the bestest 
Thats why all my past dudes names is ex's 
Keep that thing in your pants I dont need your sex's 
Better come correct when you step to a princess 
Queen on the throne, listen to this song 
If you out there, step into my zone 
Show me how you rock, gimme what you got 
Make me your one, lets hit the top 
I need someone thats new, who knows what to do. 
I need someone like you, someone like you, 
someone like you, someone like you 
-Yg- 
Hey how you doin babygirl its nice to meet ya 
Got me wanna freak ya, just by ya features 
Hopin this conversation leads to a situation 
And that situation leads to sensation 
Left wranglers, I got em dont worry 
Im the type of dude these chicks talk about on Maury, yup 
Cold story but I got alot of ex girls 
So why I wanna put a alphabet above my next girl 
Thug nigga, thug nigga, thug nigga 
If I wasnt a rapper then I'd probably be a drug dealer 
Yep and she loves me for that 
Put on her favourite slow song and she fuck me to that 
I need someone thats new, who knows what to do. 
I need someone like you, someone like you, 
someone like you, someone like you 
Better then the others 
Tell them girls to get low

Givin him my body, yeah I act so ex oh 
On my neck where he best so papi dont let go 
Are you out there? Bring it over here

I look like a fantasy, your wifey mad at me 
Just 'cause hubby is a fan of me, you understandin' me? Uh 
So skip the talkin' baby, we too busy ballin' baby 
Pedal to the metal and my engine never stallin' baby 
Bitches gon' hate, while the critics critique 
I pay them no mind whenever they speak 
What they make a year, I can make in a week 
I know you can't stand it, just get you a seat 
See the sky be the limit when you dealin' with me 
I'm stuntin' this hard, and I ain't even reached my peak 
I just get money to spend it, let the cycle repeat 
I'm feelin' like I got this world on my feet

Go out and play somewhere, the grown folks busy workin' 
Iggy independent with it, they know that for certain 
You be on the internet, thirsty, prolly worse in person 
Down payment for a car, I dropped that on a Birkin' 
You don't sit in VIP 'cause you ain't no important person 
Money wrapped around my mind like a turban 
Iggy got them pop titties but that ass on that urban (Go Iggy) 
If I told you what I'm worth, you would throw up (Go Iggy) 
So have my money on time 'fore I show up (Go Iggy) 
I'm drinking PJ on a PJ in my PJs 
Thinking money 25/8, no free days (Go Iggy, go Iggy, go Iggy) 
If your girl dumb body, I recruit them 
They ask me who you do it for, me say they youth dem 
Damn right, I like the life I live 
Who else you know that slay like Iggz 
You little bitch 
 
Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy season

All black on when I come through, it's Kodak 
Mirror, mirror on the wall 
Is Iggy the ziggy-iggy the baddest of 'em all? 
Why you come through, shut down the mall? 
All that ass deserve an applause

You know what it is when I flex that muscle 
I don't even know what a real one do

He don't love you, that ring ain't big enough 
If they talkin' that money I'm showing up 
My account getting bigger, it's growing up 
And I'm still a ma'fuckin' rockstar 
Popstar but I roll with the mobsters 
Yacht club on the shore eating lobster 
While I'm stunting in Geneva with my top off 
 
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! 
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch 
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get 
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! 
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Had to switch it up on 'em, switch it up on 'em)

But they don't wear these shits where I'm from 
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you 
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through 
 
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt 
Sugar cane, back lanes 
Three jobs, took years to save 
But I got a ticket on that plane 
People got a lot to say 
But don't know shit about where I was made 
Or how many floors that I had to scrub 
Just to make it past where I am from 
 
No money, no family 
Sixteen in the middle of Miami 
No money, no family 
Sixteen in the middle of Miami 
No money, no family 
Sixteen in the middle of Miami 
 
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live 
I've been work work work work working on my shit 
Now get this work, now get this work 
Now get this work, now get this work 
Working on my shit 
 
You can hate it or love it 
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting 
Thorough bread in a mud brick before the budget 
White chick on that Pac shit 
My passion was ironic 
And my dreams were uncommon 
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me 
Robbed blind, basically raped me 
Ran through the bullshit like a Matador 
Just made me madder and adamant to go at em 
And even the score 
So, I went harder 
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered 
Slept cold on the floor recording 
At 4 in the morning 
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer 
Immigrant, art ignorant 
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit 
Hate to be inconsiderate 
But the Industry took my innocence 
Too late, now I'm in this bitch! 
 
You don't know the half 
This shit get real 
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins 
What you call that? 
Head over heels

Pledge allegiance to the struggle 
Ain't been easy 
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffel 
Bags is all we had 
Do anything for my Mama, I love you 
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice 
That ya managed to muscle 
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so 
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury 
Turn First at the light that's in front me 
Cause every night I'mma do it like it's my last 
This dream is all that I need 
Cause its all that I ever had

            <field name="lyrics">I'm gonna love you 
Until you hate me 
And now I'm gonna show you 
What's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Then to mess with me, heartache 
I'm gonna love you 
I'm gonna love you 
Gonna love you 
Gonna love you 
Like a black widow, baby 
 
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same 
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray 
We went from nothing to something liking to loving 
It was us against the world now we just fucking 
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you 
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you 
I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between 
By me believing what you say that you never mean 
Like It'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long 
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song 
You was different from my last but now you got a mirror 
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer 
Now sing 
 
You used to be thirsty for me 
But now you wanna be set free 
This is the web, the web that you weave 
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now) 
 
I'm gonna love you 
Until you hate me 
And I'm gonna show you 
What's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Then to mess with me, heartache 
I'm gonna love you 
I'm gonna love you 
Gonna love you 
Gonna love you 
Like a black widow, baby 
 
Black black widow baby 
I'm gonna love you until it hurts 
Just to get you I'm doing whatever works 
You'd have never met nobody 
That will do you how I do ya 
That will bring you to your knees 
Praise Jesus hallelujah 
Imma make you beg for it, plead for it 
Till you feel like you breath for it 
Till you do any and everything for it 
I want you to fiend for it 
Wake up and dream for it 
Till it's got you gasping for air 
And you leave for it 
Til then having kids, can check on your mind 
And there's nothing but me on it 
Now it's me time believe that 
If it's yours when you want it 
I wouldn't promise I need that 
Till I'm everywhere that you be at 
I can't fall back go quick 
'Cause this here is fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shit 
 
You used to be thirsty for me 
But now you wanna be set free 
This is the web, the web that you weave 
So baby now rest in peace (it's all over with now) 
 
I'm gonna love you 
Until you hate me 
And I'm gonna show you 
What's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Then to mess with me, heartache 
I'm gonna love you 
I'm gonna love you 
Gonna love you 
Gonna love you

Dancin' we dizzy, we spinnin' we spinnin'

I ain't hatin', it don't matter though 
I kept it cool, but you made me wanna slap a ho 
I look good, what does she have? 
I was down, no knee pads 
Look, this kinda sound like a poem 
If you relate then point 'em out if you know 'em 
Hey, boy hush that, I remembered you were riding on your mustache 
You was hanging so hard, you nearly lost that 
Little trick you like to do, yeah I taught that 
 
I got a brand new man and a brand new place 
Glad you called, thought you coulda had that space 
I'm alright, and Imma play it cool 
I can't cook, but I made a plate for you 
You wanted something more, than what we had 
What's up with her? She ain't all that 
I'm not trippin' on what coulda been 
I know it's kinda weird, I'm just askin' 
Just askin' 
I know it's kinda weird, I'm just askin' 
 
I just happened 
To run into you and I noticed your reaction 
You couldn't say shit, I read your caption 
She a one-hit wonder, and you missin' my classics 
Damn that's tragic 
I would hate to be you 
To tell the truth, she could never be me 
I got a new man, with a few new bands 
Give me what I want, and he got that D 
 
I got a brand new man and a brand new place 
Glad you called, thought you coulda had that space 
I'm alright, and Imma play it cool

Thought this was poker with the cards up but we were bluffing 
I miss you but pride won't let me tell you 
Thought that we had all the time 
But I'm guessing that plans fell through 
Yeah, we fell off 
I won't ask you to climb back 
I paid twenty for that Rolly, I just want my time back 
Was wrong too but I see it now 
That you don't give a damn 
I got you tatted, you took off before the ink dried on my hands 
I was down to give you the world, instead you gave me hell 
I lied, tried to be perfect and I played myself 
And it hurts so bad, we coulda worked on that 
'Cause you say you love me, but real love don't work like that 
The truth is, I left a piece of me in a piece I gave you 
And I tend to laugh and crack a smile when things get painful 
Said I crack a smile when things get painful 
Remembering the moments when I used to date you 
 
Rolex's don't tick-tock 
But damn it baby, my time costs 
And damn it baby, my time is money 
So I need payback for all the time lost 
I need payback for all the time lost 
Said, I need payback for all the time lost 
Damn it baby, my time costs 
So I need payback for all the time lost 
 
Say that you love me 
I say that you're lying 
'Cause I said we could work on it, you said "let's leave it behind" 
Couldn't put together the picture I paint in my mind 
So how I see you know insulting me is wasting my time 
But we live and learn and learn and love and let go 
Cause if we stay in this then we might make it worse than before 
Another hard lesson, stressing taking personal notes 
Remember sweet nothings, like baby, what's the purpose in those? 
Both of us saying it shouldn't have went like that 
But sometimes in love, it just get like that 
Used to think that when it went wrong we'd get right back 
You know, Cupid's got another arrow, and shit like that 
And for all of y'all watching I hope that this entertain you 
And that you enjoyed this song that I sang you 
'Cause I'm still here laughing when it gets painful 
Remembering the moments when I used to date you 
 
Rolex's don't tick-tock 
But damn it baby, my time costs 
And damn it baby, my time is money 
So I need payback for all the time lost 
I need payback for all the time lost 
Said, I need payback for all the time lost 
Damn it baby, my time costs 
So I need payback for all the time lost 
 
Rolex's don't tick-tock 
But damn it baby, my time costs 
And damn it baby, my time is money 
So I need payback for all the time lost 
I need payback for all the time lost

Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby 
High price, but I'm worth it, baby 
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby 
Gettin' faded in a European swervin' ay 
Look, describe Iggy, groundbreaking what the word is 
Hit the stage, yeah, shake it like I'm nervous 
When in New York got me parking right on Madison 
This ain't no accident, I'm killing them on purpose 
I-G-G-Y, did she just have to do it baby 
Ride with me, fly livin', there ain't nothin' to it 
Now my waist slim, ass fat you gotta have it 
Get my bake on, cake long 
That's automatic 
 
I know you like the way I turn it on 
I'm out here with my friends 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone 
I guess you'll have to beg 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
 
P-p-pussy power, pay me by the hour 
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward 
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers 
If I peek and you lucky, baby, there's money hours 
All yellow gold on me, like I'm Trinidad, James 
Sittin' drop top wonderin' where the ceiling's at 
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back 
But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feeling that 
Iggy Iggy Iggy, can't you see? 
That everybody wanna put their hands on me 
See I be on this money why your man on me? 
And I need another hand with all these bandz on me 
 
I know you like the way I turn it on 
I'm out here with my friends 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone 
I guess you'll have to beg 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
 
Get up out my face like who' you think you are 
Talking all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah 
(Oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh) 
Get up out my face like who'd you think you are 
Make me wanna lay it like hi-di-hi-di-ha 
(Oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh) 
 
I know you like the way I turn it on

If you don't do this right, you're going home alone 
I guess you'll have to beg 
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it 
 
Oh boy, I'm like a drug 
If you want my love better smoke it up 
(Make you beg for it, I'mma make you beg for it) 
You can look, boy, but don't you touch 
If you want my love make me give a fuck

Ironic I've been living off with people down to kill for 
And If I know comfort in numbers knowin' there's always a mil more 
That was that cat XXXX my pretty ass right at the top of that billboard 
And all of my folks who done been here from XXXX the ones I'ma cover the bill for 
And as I get ill more, we gon' triple the order of champagne and spill more 
Let's settle the real score 
Been wondering what the public gotta feel for 
So let's keep it real yeah you know I'm killing game as soon as I step on the field 
Y'all at the top of mad now, there's no turning back now 
I won't ever back down 
They feel me like they giving Iggy a pat down 
I needed a moment, I found it 
Lately I've been on my runnin' the town shit 
Especially walkin' around with 
 
This heavy crown 
You can't always please the crowd 
But I am still not bow when down 
This heavy crown 
It comes and goes around 
And when it's time, I'll pass it proud 
But bitch I got it now 
 
So keep a cute, chick, and don't be hatin' on the new chick 
Go back and check your stats and bet they let you know I do's this 
Glasses full of empty dependent unpoint of view chick 
If you was mad before I bet you hate me for this new shit 
Maybe you should watch what you've got coming out your two lips 
Get cool with how I kick it or else you gon' get the boot, bitch 
Iggy A-Z-A, A.K.A. Captain of the crew ship 
Don't penny pinch I promise babe, I don't need your two cents 
Get rid of the makeup let us see just who you is 
But if you feel like that girl bless your heart, go get it how you live 
When you hear my name you gotta know that she's something regal 
I'm one of one ain't no sequels 
I'm wearing 
 
This heavy crown 
You can't always please the crowd 
But I am still not bow when down 
This heavy crown 
It comes and goes around 
And when it's time, I'll pass it proud 
But bitch I got it now 
 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
Oh Lord, weren't you mistaken 
I got a dinner date with greatness 
Iggy Igg ain't never been nothin' to play wit, hol' up 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
I'm at the top laughin' at you faces 
I've been practising my patience 
But I switch back quick if you play with 
 
This heavy crown 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
This heavy crown 
Oh Lord weren't you mistaken 
 
This heavy crown 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
This heavy crown 
Oh Lord weren't you mistaken 
 
This heavy crown 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
This heavy crown 
Oh Lord weren't you mistaken 
 
This heavy crown 
To everyone who said I'd never make it 
This heavy crown 
I'm at the top laughin' at you faces

I should've known you were bad news 
From the bad boy demeanor, and the tattoos 
Small skies only want one thing 
That I'm undecided, trying to figure out if that's you 
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive 
'Cause the way is so much better than the next guy 
And a little trouble only makes for a good time 
So all the normal red flags be a good sign 
 
Don't you come here thinking about it, ain't that far 
You seem like trouble to me 
I can tell by the way that you lean 
And the way that you kiss your teeth 
And you turn up so flashy clean 
Smells like trouble to me 
 
Opposites attract, I guess this is it 
Good girl bad guy, what a perfect match 
And if I you, gonna wanna play baptized 
'Cause when you finish you gonna feel like you was baptized 
See baby now you're feeling for a test drive 
'Cause you don't wanna loose your ride to the next guy 
And baby trouble only makes for a good time 
So all the normal red flags be a good sign 
 
Don't you come here thinking about it, ain't that far 
You seem like trouble to me 
I can tell by the way that you lean 
And the way that you kiss your teeth 
And you turn up so flashy clean 
Smells like trouble to me 
 
I got a bad form in the worst way 
Dear Lord, how'd I get in this position 
Should've never gotten involved in the first place 
Second place never get the recognition 
See what he doing to me make me have to should it out 
Gotta hold on me that's without a doubt 
So clear now he's a trouble starter 
But I ain't the same either and he's in no still water 
Just cause I'mma get to file in extrophy 
Don't mean nothing to me 
Till you show me where it's at 
Smells like trouble to me 
 
Just cause I'mma get to file in extrophy 
Don't mean nothing to me 
Till you show me where it's at 
Smells like trouble to me 
I should've known you were bad news (knew you were bad news) 
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos (all of the tattoos) 
 
I should've known you were bad news (knew you were bad news) 
But I'm undecided trying to figure out if that's you (trouble to me) 
Don't you come here thinking about it, ain't that far 
You seem like trouble to me 
I can tell by the way that you lean 
And the way that you kiss your teeth 
And you turn up so flashy clean 
Smells like trouble to me</field>

Keep your mind on your money and you ain't looking to settle down

Time to keep it 100, I'm a boss chick but he run it 
No Michael Kors just Tom Ford 
Saint Tropez, I'm like bonjour 
In Spain wearing that Balmain 
Lanvin, Givenchy 
On the top floor of that penthouse 
I got ten toads in that concrete 
Keep it G with the money, I ain't gotta lie about shit 
I don't need your money, I can buy my shit 
Heard in the streets that he fucked that bitch 
He know I'll put his ass out my shit 
Paid one million for that drop six and he got the Glock in my cockpit 
Them other chicks he get caught with 
I'm the bitch he gonna rock with 
They talk shit but we 'bout shit 
Fly Aussie on boss shit 
When he need to be, where he need to be 
I tell him go on, it ain't no thing to me 
Gotta hit that thing, bring that back 
Would you let me thumb through the check if you wanna get sexy 
You knew I was high class ass when you met me 
My money talk, it's too bad for y'all 
Y'all know which shorty's Joe Pesci 
I'm a fancy bitch but I'm ratchet 
Know every bitch you had ain't never had shit 
Respect that, I won't come around, no run around 
You better hold me down 
And the games, ain't gonna play none 
Keep it A1 since day one, yeah 
 
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around

Girl, when you come around me 
 
Bank-Rolls'r'us, we got it 
You know how we ride 
No credit, no debit, no thanks 
My clique pay cash everything we buy 
See me walking by with my nose in the sky 
Make you be like Damn bitch, can't say hi? 
Then I hop in the drop and I wave goodbye 
As I drive through the tunnel looking like Lady Di 
Why stress myself when he not there? 
Let's see how he likes seeing me out there 
You know how many dudes want me out there? 
Just stop thinking about it, you got no idea 
Don't try me man, you know I will 
Throw this brick through your wind shield 
Knife your nice new rover whip 
The fireplace? Your clothes in there 
If I know you two in there 
No asking what you doing there 
Imma send my crew in there 
You two gonna be ruined there 
You violate, I demonstrate 
Especially if I'm true to you 
And when I come around I keep it 100 as usual 
 
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around 
Keep your mind on your money and you ain't looking to settle down 
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100

Yeah, girl you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're round me

Until you hate me 
And I'm gonna show ya 
What's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Than to mess with me honey 
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya 
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya 
Like a black widow, baby 
 
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same 
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray 
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving 
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking 
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you 
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you 
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between 
By me believing what you say that you never mean 
Like it'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long 
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song 
You were different from my last but now you got it mirrored 
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer 
Now sing 
 
You used to be thirsty for me 
But now you wanna be set free 
This is the web, the web that you weave 
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now) 
 
I'm gonna love ya 
Until you hate me 
And I'm gonna show ya 
What's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Than to mess with me honey 
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya 
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya 
Like a black widow, baby 
 
I'm gonna love you until it hurts 
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works 
You ain't never met nobody 
That will do you how I do ya 
That will bring you to your knees 
Praise Jesus, hallelujah 
Imma make you beg for it, plead for it 
Till you feel like you breathe for it 
Till you'll do any and everything for it 
I want you to fiend for it 
Wake up and dream for it 
Till it's got you gasping for air And you lean forward 
Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind 
And it's nothing but me on it 
Now it's me time, believe that 
If it's yours and you want it 
I want it, promise I need that 
Till I'm everywhere that you be at 
I can't fall back, go quick 
'Cause this here is fatal attraction 
So I take it all or I don't want shit 
 
You used to be thirsty for me 
But now you wanna be set free 
This is the web, the web that you weave 
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now) 
 
I'm gonna love ya 
Until you hate me 
And I'm gonna show ya 
What's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Than to mess with me honey 
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya 
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya

When I hop out his new six 
Fresh in some new shit 
Damn, she is too thick, who is this? 
Yeah I'm his new bitch 
I'm his new bitch 
And I'm spending his new cash 
Few trips, new bags 
Damn, she is too bad 
Oh you mad? 
That I'm his new bitch 
Yeah, I'm his new bitch</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear 
Not in a million years could you tell me that I'd be here 
I just hopped off that lier, my life on another tier 
Lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear 
From country living to country skipping, this would drive you crazy 
Check the rate that they pay me, a giant could never slay me 
Money never a maybe, but never forgot my roots 
I heard that the top is lonely, I wonder if it's the truth 
So I'm just climbing, pay that fine, and now I'm shining could be blinding 
Ain't too much real left but right here is where you could find it 
This that new classic, ain't this what you needed? 
I'm what amazing look like, you'll recognize it when you see it 
 
Know where I wanna be, but I'm far from home 
Just trying to make it on my own 
And unless they send me clothes, I don't answer phones 
This is the line, and I walk alone 
Ain't no going back now 
Don't know where I'm at now 
Ain't no going back now 
This is the line and I walk alone 
 
I been counted out, I been stepped on 
I was wide awake, and got slept on 
I had everything and then I lost it 
Worked my ass off, I'm exhausted 
All this talking about me, just talk about me 
I'm here now, they can't walk around me 
I'm dedicated, flow elevated 
Tell every hater I hope you never play it, said I'd never make it 
Now I'm celebrating, I'm never quitting, no resignation 
I'm the fresh face with no expiration 
I know pressure make diamonds, so I threw them off in this chain 
And when it's all on the line, I'm who you want in the game 
Cause I'm gonna get it 
And that's for sure 
Can't be like y'all, that's a no-go 
International, and y'all local 
Got this locked up just like popo 
Every beat get A, that's tocho 
Won't lose, oh no, that's Yoko 
Been up and down like Lolo's 
Still make my own on the solo 
Had to be here to believe it 
Think like winners to perceive it 
Had to let you know that I mean it 
If I speak it, I say keep it 
This flow, that's genius 
Just think about it, would I think about it? 
If I didn't live it, won't ink about it 
Married to the money, put a ring around it, what? 
 
Know where I wanna be, but I'm far from home 
Just trying to make it on my own 
And unless they send me clothes, I don't answer phones 
This is the line, and I walk alone 
Ain't no going back now 
Don't know where I'm at now 
Ain't no going back now 
This is the line and I walk alone 
 
And everything ain't the way I planned it 
But when the smoke clears, I'm the last standing 
This lifestyle can be so demanding 
But I take off like a plane and they never landing 
 
Know where I wanna be, but I'm far from home 
Just trying to make it on my own 
And unless they send me clothes, I don't answer phones 
This is the line, and I walk alone 
Ain't no going back now 
Don't know where I'm at now 
Ain't no going back now 
This is the line and I walk alone 
 
Ain't no going back now 
Ain't no going back now 
This is the line and I walk alone</field>

Homie, if you're broke, oh, no you don't deserve hoes 
All these fake boulders only gettin' on my nerves though 
I just cracked a 40, now I'm sippin' out the straw slow 
Little bit of ratchet, little boujee, you should all know

Puff the lah or get high off the contact 
Call the law, we gon' make sure we come back 
Fallin' off, we ain't ever been about that 
Hundred spokes spinnin' on a chrome rim 
I got a feelin' that tonight we gon' be goin' in 
I'm with a few bad bitches and some grown men 
With the ice so cold, I feel like I'm Snowden 
I feel like I'm rollin', but the whole place geeked up 
It's gettin' hot in here, down to my wife beater 
But you ain't gotta worry, we ain't dangerous

How do you fit all that in them jeans? 
You know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Just a ittle bittle 
Patty cake, oatty cake 
With no hands 
Got me in this club making wedding plans 
If I take pictures while you do your dance 
I can make you famous on Instagram 
Hot damn it 
Your booty like two planets 
Go head, and go ham sandwich 
Whoa 
I can't stand it 
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Just a little bit of 
Cadillac, cadillac, pop that trunk 
Let's take a shot 
Alley oops that dunk 
Tired of working that 9 to 5 
Oh baby let me come and change your life 
Hot damn it 
Your booty like two planets 
Go head, and go ham sandwich 
Whoa 
I can't stand it 
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

Shake what your mama gave you 
Misbehave you 
I just wanna strip you, dip you 
Flip you, bubble bathe you 
What they do 
Taste my rain drops, Ok boo 
Now what you will, what you want, what you may do 
Completely separated, til my deeply penetrated 
Then I take I out, and wipe it off 
Eat it, ate it, love it, hate it 
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been king 
You wiggle, wiggle for the D, O, double G, again? 
Come on baby 
Turn around 
(turn around, turn around) 
You're a star girl 
Take a bow 
(take a bow, take a bow) 
It's just one thing that's killing me 
How you get that in them jeans? 
You know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

Been around the world, don't speak the language 
But your booty dont need explaining 
All I really need to understand is when you 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Get jazzy on me 
You know the words in my songs 
No habla ingles 
Our conversantion ain't long 
But you know what is 
I know what that girl them want, London to Taiwan 
I got lipstick stamps for my passport 
I think I need a new one 
Been around the world, don't speak the language 
But your booty don't need explaining 
All I really need to understand is when you 
You talk dirty to me

Uno, met a friend in rio 
Dos, she was all on me oh 
Tres, we can ménage in trio 
Cuatro, oh

Dos Cadenas, clothes are genius 
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis 
Get with arenas, guns on deck 
Chest to chest, tongue on neck 
International oral sex 
Every picture I take, I pose a threat 
Boat or jet, what do you expect? 
Her pussy so good 
I bought her a pet 
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it 
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"

Tell them other girls, they can hit the exit

Cause I finally found the girl of my dreams 
Much more than a Grammy award 
That's how much you mean to me 
You could be my it girl 
Baby you're the shhh girl 
Lovin' you could be a crime 
Crazy how we fit girl 
This it girl

You can't help but turn them heads 
Knockin' them dead 
Dropping like flies around you 
If I get your body close not letting go 
Hoping you're about to 
Tell them other guys they can lose your number 
You're done! 
They don't get another shot cause you're love drunk 
Like a TV show playing reruns 
Every chance I get 
I'mma turn you on 
You could be my it girl

Lovin' you could be a crime

Fuck her so good she like aw 
My nigga I'm a CEO, oh, oh, oh 
Look we can talk about hits or talk about who I hit 
Did a song with 2 Chainz but I was rocking my shit 
Yeah I broke up with my ex, I ain't talk to her since 
The only time I need the sparks 
Is when I light up my spliffs 
Yeah I been all around the world 
Probably write me a book 
Three kitchens in the crib, I don't know how to cook 
I got a mansion in Miami, I forgot how it look 
All I need is two things and that's pussy and kush 
Waving in the foreign, nigga always 
Got a nigga feeling like the God 
I think I'm Charlemagne 
Too much for all the plaques in my hallways 
Fuck with a nigga even if I ain't had no bitch 
She wanna take it slow

'Cause I didn't love the way you wanted 
And who am I to blame? 
When I didn't trust you 
Enough to let you in the way I wanted 
Stop, okay 
Vodka on my lips 
Took too many drinks 
Makes me reminisce all the way down 
To my happy place, you're my happy place 
I can't handle us now 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Flip side of the graveyard 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Heaven or high water 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe 
If I'm lucky, eh 
If I'm lucky, eh 
Get your loving 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
Who am I to say, that it wasn't good, baby? 
Just thinkin' bout our loving give me chills 
Up and down my spine 
I dare you not to miss me 
'Cause what we had was more than just a thrill 
Stop, okay 
Vodka on my lips 
Took too many drinks 
Makes me reminisce all the way down 
To my happy place, you're my happy place 
I can't handle us now 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Flip side of the graveyard 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Heaven or high water 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe 
If I'm lucky 
If I'm lucky (if I'm lucky) 
I'll get your loving, miss when you say 
'Cause I really miss it babe 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
I'm selfish for you 
I'm selfish for you 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
On the flip side of the graveyard 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Heaven or high water 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe 
If I'm lucky (if I'm lucky, baby) 
If I'm lucky (if I'm lucky, baby) 
I'll get your love in 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
I'm selfish for you 
I'm selfish for you

When I think of all the years 
I wanna be with you 
Wake up every morning with you in my bed 
That's precisely what I plan to do 
And you know one of these days 
When I get my money right 
Buy you everything 
And show you all the finer things in life 
Will forever be enough 
So there ain't no need to rush 
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me 
Singing oohh, ooh, ooh 
Oh yeah 
How many girls in the world 
Can make me feel like this? 
Baby I don't ever plan to find out 
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why 
You're the love of my life 
And you know one of these days 
When I get my money right 
Buy you everything 
And show you all the finer things in life 
Will forever be enough 
So there ain't no need to rush 
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me 
And if I lost everything 
In my heart it means nothing 
'Cause I have you, girl I have you 
So get right down on bended knee 
Nothing else would ever be 
Better, better 
The day when I say 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me (Yeah) 
I'll say will you marry me (The day I get on my knees) 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me (what you do to me baby) 
Got me singing (ooh) 
Got me singing (ooh) 
Would you marry me baby (ooh)

I'll fight for you

They don't want to see us together 
Don't wanna lose

I'm willing to do whatever 
Cause I don't wanna see you cry 
Give our love another try 
I bet we get it right this time 
As long as you're prepared to fight 
I don't wanna live another day 
Without your body next to me 
I'm not gonna let them break us down

Let's get air in these hearts again

The one you can't live without

Tonight, take me to the other side 
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July

So tonight 
Kiss me like it's do or die

I've got to go away 
(Baby it's cold out there) 
This evening has been 
(Been hoping that you'd drop in) 
So very nice 
(I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice) 
My mother will start to worry 
(Beautiful, what's your hurry?) 
And father will be pacing the floor 
(Listen to the fireplace roar) 
So really I'd better scurry 
(Beautiful, please don't hurry) 
Well, maybe just a half a drink more 
(Put some records on while I pour) 
And the neighbors might think 
(Baby, it's bad out there) 
Say what's in this drink 
(No cabs to be had out there) 
I wish I knew how 
(Your eyes are like starlight now) 
To break the spell 
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell) 
I ought to say no, no, no, sir 
(Mind if I move a little closer?) 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
(What's the sense in hurting my pride?) 
I really can't stay 
(Oh, baby, don't hold out) 
Baby it's cold outside 
I simply must go 
(But it's cold outside) 
The answer is no 
(I say it's cold out there) 
This welcome has been 
(I'm lucky that you dropped in) 
So nice and warm 
(Look out the window at that storm) 
My sister will be suspicious 
(Gosh, your lips look so delicious) 
My brother will be there at the door 
(Waves upon a tropical shore) 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
(Gosh, your lips look delicious) 
Well, maybe just a cigarette more 
(Never such a blizzard before) 
I've got to go home 
(Baby, you'll freeze out there) 
Say you lend me your comb 
(Baby, it's up to your knees out there) 
You've really been grand 
(I'm thrilled when you touch my hand) 
But don't you see 
(How can you do this thing to me) 
There's bound to be talk tomorrow 
(Making my life long sorrow) 
At least there will be plenty implied 
(If you caught pneumonia and died) 
I really can't stay 
(Get over that old out) 
But, baby, it's cold outside</field>

You can drive it when you want 
But you gotta keep that top down for me 
I'm just tryna push this shit, don't start 
Up and down your boulevard 
Girl I had to pull you over for the jeans 
Look at that sexy body 
Look at that trunk in the back 
I'mma get a lil bit ratchet 
Cause I never seen a girl like that 
You know I had to skrr, pull up 
Pull up, oh yeah, skrr, I had to pull up 
I'mma make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby 
Make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby 
Girl I gotta get that Coupe for two 
You'd be amazed what we could do 
We can roll these windows down so they all see 
Gon' and throw that thing in reverse, look back at it 
Throw your hair, no body, look back at it 
You gon' make somebody wanna call the police 
Look at that sexy body 
Look at that trunk in the back 
I'mma get a lil bit ratchet 
Cause I never seen a girl like that 
You know I had to skrr, pull up 
Pull up, oh yeah, skrr, I had to pull up 
I'mma make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby 
Make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby 
Look at that sexy body 
I never seen curves like that, when we do it baby 
Look at that sexy body 
You know that it drives me mad 
Skrr, pull up 
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, take that thing like a repo 
I'mma beat that thing, you my cheat code 
When I'm done we gon' knock the fuck out 
I had to pull up, I had to pull up, pull up 
Skrr, I had to pull up up, skrr 
I'mma make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby

Jason Derulo 
Let's Go! 
(Part One) 
I got more problems 
Than an algebra equation 
They say become a doctor 
I don't have the patience 
Ain't with the waiting 
What's my motivation? 
The road less traveled 
Is the one that I'll be takin' 
(Part Two) 
Lonely days 
Well the only days I remember 
The days I would say: 
I can be starter 
Mama if I really wanted to 
I could be a starter 
Mama 
What if I just get rid of you? 
(Part Three) 
Haters (Haters, Haters) 
Haters (Haters, Haters) 
Haters (Haters) 
You! (You) 
Whatcha trying to prove? 
Eyes on me 
Like I'm in your movie screen 
Damn I know I'm fly (fly) 
Ain't got nothing to hide 
Want a piece of my pie 
Then you got more problems 
Than I (I) have 
CHORUS 
Hey! (Hey) 
What you trying to say? 
Can't get me off your brain 
And it's drivin you insane 
Damn you know I'm fly 
Want a piece of my pie? 
Then you have more problems 
Then I 
Who's gonna take me? 
Who's (Who's) 
Gonna take me (take me)? 
Who's gonna take me away 
From here?

Mo' problems 
Don't want mo' problems

Don't want mo' problems

(But baby it's cold outside) 
I've got to go away 
(Baby it's cold out there) 
This evening has been 
(Been hoping that you'd drop in) 
So very nice 
(I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice) 
My mother will start to worry 
(Beautiful, what's your hurry?) 
And father will be pacing the floor 
(Listen to the fireplace roar) 
So really I'd better scurry 
(Beautiful, please don't hurry) 
Well, maybe just a half a drink more 
(Put some records on while I pour) 
And the neighbors might think 
(Baby, it's bad out there) 
Say what's in this drink 
(No cabs to be had out there) 
I wish I knew how 
(Your eyes are like starlight now) 
To break the spell 
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell) 
I ought to say no, no, no, sir 
(Mind if I move a little closer?) 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
(What's the sense in hurting my pride?) 
I really can't stay 
(Oh, baby, don't hold out) 
Baby it's cold outside 
I simply must go 
(But it's cold outside) 
The answer is no 
(I say it's cold out there) 
This welcome has been 
(I'm lucky that you dropped in) 
So nice and warm 
(Look out the window at that storm) 
My sister will be suspicious 
(Gosh, your lips look so delicious) 
My brother will be there at the door 
(Waves upon a tropical shore) 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
(Gosh, your lips look delicious) 
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

I've got to go home

            <field name="lyrics">Have you ever had a feeling you were being watched? 
Footsteps behind you like a shadow when you walk? 
Can’t tell if your mind is playing tricks or not? 
Eh eh eh eh no! 
What I’m going through is now racking my brain. 
Thinking bout like do I got any enemies? 
Where I’ve been what I did, what did I say? 
Eh eh eh eh yeah! 
Come to think of it, 
I remember one chick, 
That I was messing with, 
While I was in conneticut, 
I met her after my show. 
I took her back to my room. 
The next day I had to go. 
I never thought it would... 
Get this deep! 
Now I got this problem following me! 
Better be careful, better be careful, better be careful! 
Whose heart she’ll break, 
Never knowing what you do or say 
Will send em over the edge so 
Next time I’ll be careful! 
I’m getting letters every other day addressed to me. 
Saying dear jason you and I were meant to be. 
Tell me you feel the same or it will be the death for me. 
Eh eh! it gets so worst now! 
She reaching out to all my people, friends and family. 
Got me so paranoid I’m stuck with my security. 
It’s getting crazy here, it’s difficult for me to sleep. 
Eh eh eh eh you know! 
Now all I’m thinking is 
How do I get out of this 
I’m feeling kind of sick, 
Damn this is some crazy shit 
I met her after my show 
I took her back to my room. 
The next day I had to go. 
I never thought it would,,, 
Get this deep! 
Now I got this problem following me! 
Better be careful, better be careful, better be careful! 
Whose heart she’ll break, 
Never knowing what you do or say 
Will send em over the edge so 
Next time I’ll be careful! 
This got so out of control. 
I learned my lesson now so. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh be careful! 
She’s hoping I won’t let go 
She wants a piece of my soul. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh be careful! 
I met her after my show. 
I took her back to my room. 
The next day I had to go. 
I never thought it would… 
Get this deep! 
Now I got this problem following me! 
Better be careful, better be careful, better be careful! 
Whose heart she’ll break, 
Never knowing what you do or say 
Will send em over the edge so 
Next time I’ll be careful! 
I never thought it would…get this deep! 
Now I got this problem following me! 
Better be careful, better be careful, better be careful! 
Whose heart she’ll break, 
Never knowing what you do or say 
Will send em over the edge so

When you put, put a gun on my heart

I've always loved hard 
So I take it slow 
I guess is my fault 'cause I wanna go 
But I, always care for you 
My.. 
perfect not even close 
But I don't deserve this 
But girl I suppose 
I wasn't there for you 
Pre chorus: 
.. 
baby we're nothing else to say 
Look me in my place I can't live out this way 
Can't live out this way 
Can't live out this way 
You put it.. 
in my heart 
.. 
start just a little.. 
just a little... 
Dance.. 
I bleed. 
2 x chorus: 
When I bleed, I bleed out 
When I cry, I cry loud 
When I love 
You can bet I'm all in 
When you leave I bleed out. 
I look in those eyes 
There's nothing there 
I'm looking into 
The cold is there 
I, ever see 
We haven't touched each other forever 
Know what I do, if we're not together 
I'm not ready to leave, no baby. 
Pre chorus: 
.. 
baby we're nothing else to say 
Look me in my place I can't live out this way

2 x chorus: 
When I bleed, I bleed out 
When I cry, I cry loud 
When I love

When you leave I bleed out. 
Hey I look 
Why you wanna out a gun in my heart 
I just gotta say hey 
I just gotta say hey

Since the first date when you got close my heart

Up on top, you changed me for better for worse I know 
I was caught up alway's put you first I never once thought 
You would be triflin but o I was blinded... 
[Chorus:] 
I was like oh oh oh never wanna let you go go go 
Cause I was open before I was open before but 
Now I know.. 
That love made me blind so I could'nt 
See all the lies you told were right in front of me 
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me 
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be 
Your love made me blind, love made blind, love made me blind, 
Your love made me blind. 
I gave all of my trust didn't think being faithfull was asking 
To much but I'm good glad that I know now I was fooled but 
Fate let me see how they say every tear has it's reasons 
Every smile has it's own season never once thought 
Youd be this triflin but o I was blinded... 
[Chorus:] 
I was like oh oh oh never wanna let you go go go 
Cause I was open before I was open before but 
Now I know.. 
That love made me blind so I could'nt 
See all the lies you told were right in front of me 
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me 
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be. 
Your love made me blind, love made blind, love made me blind, 
Your love made me blind. 
Cause I felt your lips pressed against mine thought the 
Sweet smell of your perfume was all mine, I love the 
Way you scream my name... 
That love made me blind so I could'nt 
See all the lies you told were right in front of me 
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me 
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be. 
Your love made me blind, your love made blind, your love made me blind, 
Your love made me blind.</field>

I know you're coming back to me 
I will be waiting here for you til the end

I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
Without your love, don't know how I survive 
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
I want to see pictures of you leaving 
On these four walls, and on the ceiling 
Gave you a kiss, but I'm dreaming 
These crazy thoughts are so deceiving 
You are the drug, I am needing 
Paradise that I'm so seeking 
I'm still alive, hope there's a reason 
Can't move my lips, but my heart's screaming 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
Without your love, don't know how I survive 
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
Oh baby, I only miss you when I 
I'm screaming at your name, but you don't answer me 
I know I kissed your face, is this my fantasy? 
I start the alarm, tell everyone that I only miss you 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
Without your love, don't know how I survive

(away, away 
cos no one else is here 
to wipe away my tears 
when they fall (oh no) 
and no one hears me screaming, 
but these four walls 
so I'm calling out your name 
hoping you'd hear me (hear me) 
got both hands on my heart 
hoping you'd feel me (feel me) 
cos baby I feel you when i close my eyes 
calling out for you, i cant sleep at night 
can someone help me find my angel 
cos every breath i take without, is painful 
please someone, help me find my angel 
cos i know she's hear me calling 
hear me calling, calling, calling for my angel 
calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel 
wherever i'll be, 
calling, calling, calling for my angel 
calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel 
now, who's gonna pick me up 
when i fell down (down) 
you left with a part of me 
the air is thinning, 
its getting so hard to breathe 
(breathe, breathe) 
breathe, 
try to take the pain away with this pen 
but i just keep writing your name over again 
no one can your place (no) 
life without you is impossible 
so I'm calling out your name 
hoping you'd hear me (hear me) 
got both hands on my heart 
hoping you'd feel me (feel me) 
cos baby i feel you when i close my eyes 
calling out for you, cos i need you in my life 
can someone help me find my angel 
cos every breath i take without, is painful 
please someone, help me find my angel 
cos i know she's hear me calling 
hear me calling, calling, calling for my angel 
calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel 
wherever i'll be, 
calling, calling, calling for my angel 
calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel

if you're missing somebody

cos every breath i take without, is painful 
(baby, baby come home) 
please someone, help me find my angel

When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away 
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through 
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you 
And can you feel the love tonight? 
It is where we are 
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer 
That we got this far 
And can you feel the love tonight? 
How it's laid to rest 
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds 
Believe the very best 
There's a time for everyone if they only learn 
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn 
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors 
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours 
And can you feel the love tonight? 
It is where we are 
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer 
That we got this far 
And can you feel the love tonight?

No, I can't stop now 
Look what we started, baby 
You're not what I expected 
Cause all I ever wanted was some fun 
Look what we started, baby

I never meant to fall in lo-ove

Got the table set for two

Love without her could be so better, 
Thats all to say when the love's gone, 
I tried to force it but there's no moving on 
They say forgive and forget just to easy my mind, 
And living with regret is just a waste of time, 
But this misery is all that I've got 
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb 
For thinkin' you could love me 
Your so numb, your so numb 
You can't feel it so it's easy 
My love's still here 
But your not there 
You broke my heart, you don't care 
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb 
For thinking you could love me 
Where was the whistle or the buzzer 
To let me know that it's over 
Now I can't seem to get through the night 
If her mind is over 
What happened to the love 
When did I stop being enough 
Cuz damn I've been wherever we having 
No where to dream that sickness from your love 
Or drug woaaaaah! 
They say forgive and forget just to easy my mind

Away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
Could ever do 
Just like the rains down in Africa 
It's gonna take some time 
But I know you're worth fighting for 
I'll fight for you 
I'll fight for you 
I'll fight for you 
Friends are cool 
But we both know 
They don't want to see us together 
Don't wanna lose 
What I live for 
I'm willing to do whatever 
Cause I don't wanna see you cry 
Give our love another try 
I bet we get it right this time 
As long as you're prepared to fight 
I don't wanna live another day 
Without your body next to me 
I'm not gonna let them break us down 
Cause baby I know now 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me 
Away from you 
(I'll fight for you) 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
Could ever do 
(I'll fight for you) 
Just like the rains down in africa 
(I'll fight for you) 
It's gonna take some time 
But I know you're worth fighting for 
What they say 
It don't even matter 
They don't really understand 
Without eachother 
We are barely breathing 
Let's get air in these hearts again 
Cause I don't wanna see you cry 
Give our love another try 
I bet we get it right this time 
As long as your prepared to fight 
Prepared to fight 
I don't wanna live another day 
Without your body next to me 
I'm not gonna let them break us down 
Cause baby I know now 
Know now 
Know now 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me 
Away from you

There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
Could ever do 
(I'll fight for you) 
Just like the rains down in africa 
(I'll fight for you) 
It's gonna take some time 
But I know you're worth fighting for 
I fight for you 
If you got someone that's worth fighting for 
Don't let nobody hold you down 
Let me hear you say, woah (woah) 
Oh woah (oh woah) 
If you found someone that's worth dying for 
The one you can't live without 
Let me hear you say, woah (woah) 
Oh woah (oh woah) 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me 
Away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
Could ever do

the ground was swept from under me 
couldnt believe, but now i think 
this is why momma always said 
to settle down 
the only question is am 
i gonna settle down, down, down? 
cos i keep losing my breath 
when you're around 
cos I'm loving this pain 
in my chest 
hoping that you'll pull me 
down, down, down

Lately i've been thinking babe, things just aint the same 
We went from being friends, to lovers arguing 
Its like all we do is fight, but i try to compromise 
Its so hard for me to let this go, but i just feel like you need to know 
I dont wanna say good bye, just wish we could rewind 
Go back in time back when everything was fine 
Ohh just wish we could undo, go back to being cool 
Ohh can you please 
Tell me how did we get (we get) 
So cold after all 
How did we get 
So far from wonderful 
How did we get (we get) 
Close to the end 
How did we get (how did we get) 
How did we fall out of love 
Of love (of love) x3 
How did we fall out of love 
Should we just take a break, we've got so much at stake 
Too delicate to choose, cause either way we lose 
The day we took the steps, we knew we'd both regret 
We did it anyway there's nothing left to say 
But i dont wanna say good bye, just wish we could rewind 
Go back in time back when everything was fine 
Ohh just wish we could undo, go back to being cool 
Ohh can you please 
Tell me how did we get (we get) 
So cold after all 
How did we get 
So far from wonderful 
How did we get (we get) 
Close to the end 
How did we get (how did we get) 
How did we fall out of love 
Of love (of love) x3 
How did (tell me how did we get)

This goes out to all the ladies out there, 
Wooaahh 
And ohhhh 
Ohh-ohh-ohhh-ohh 
[Verse 1:] 
I turn around looking straight in the mirror and 
Even without her 
I don't know how I got to this moment and It's nothin I deserve 
Not the same since the day I met you 
And now that it's in the past I can't believe all I did was just let you in 
You've shown me what I need 
[Chorus:] 
I'm only human, it wouldn't be enough I never would have got this far 
I'm only human, and I know that you, have opened up my he-aa-rt. 
How I live what I say and I do, 
Never really cared but now I'm telling you 
To know my life, could see that second star 
Cause I'm only human 
Yeaa yeaa 
[Verse 2:] 
I know I need to say how I feel and now for what it's worth (what it's worth) 
I am here for sure, id rather be yours and well I'm fine even though it don't work not the same since the day I met you. 
And now that it's in the past I can't believe all I did was let you in 
You've shown me what I need 
[Chorus] 
[Hook:] 
If I don't then tell me why 
Livin out everything that I feel inside, what's it worth if we don't try 
Still I need your love, and now the way I fell about you 
And with your love your in my life, I can tell that you'll give it one last try 
woah woah woah yeaahhh and ohh and ohhh ohhh ohhh 
[Chorus:] 
Didn't know my life could see the second star 
Didn't know I could be here where you are 
Cause I'm only human 
I'm only hu-uman 
Humaannn 
And oh oh oh ohh 
And oh.</field>

She said lets go 
Her man was down stairs 
She took me to the second floor 
She pushed me in the room on the bed and shut the door 
Wasted no time 
Started ripping off my clothes 
Girl what you doing!(Damn) 
She put her birthday suit on 
I was like Waoh! 
Made up my mind 
Turned up the radio 
Keep it on the low 
Keep it on the hush, I wanna hear whats for show!

I gotta get home 
My girl thinks im sleeping 
In the guest room(Oooo) 
If she found that I was cheating(leaving) 
Middle of the..Middle of the night creeping 
What would she do 
Pulled up to the crib around 2 
Heard a noise from the stairs 
I asumed its a friend 
Opened up the door 
Theres a new friend named Tag Grief Ben, And hes singing

In your mom and pops house when they was sleeping creeping 
In your bedroom(Oooo,Oooo, Shawty)

Hands over your mouth 
In case you started sreaming from the freaking

Get your loving 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday

Baby let's be nocturnal, 
Keep each other awake forever. 
I'm your only turn on, 
Making this love infernal, 
And never see the day. 
I can be a vampire be mine. 
Run the daylight, 
Together we stay right, 
Stay away, away from night. 
Never say good night, 
No good in goodbye, 
No way, so you'll stay, 
You'll lie awake, 
And you can be my insomnia. 
You give me a love, 
I'll stay up forever, 
I can be your insomnia, 
I can give you a rush, 
Stay sleepless together. 
You can be my insomnia, 
You give me a love I'll stay up forever. 
I can be your insomnia, 
My touches is like a drug that keeps you away, way. 
I touch the vine, 
So terrifying. 
Scared to let the morning take this away, 
Dawn we'll break it, 
I know well make it, 
Cause in the dark it's our safest haven. 
How come the star are shining? 
How is it good rewinding? 
Keep em outta sight.

No way never turn back, 
Hurt me like a heart attack, 
Acting like a manic, 
Be my love insomniac. 
I'll bet they'll never know, 
One touch I over dose, 
So much I want some more, 
So close. 
I can be a vampire, be mine, 
Run from the daylight. 
Together we stay right, 
Stay away, away from night. 
Never say good night, 
No good in goodbye. 
No way, so you'll stay, 
You'll lay awake, 
And you can be my insomnia. 
You give me a love, 
I'll stay up forever. 
I can be your insomnia, 
I can give you a rush, 
Stay sleepless together. 
You can be my insomnia.</field>

Much more than a Grammy award

Knockin' them dead 
Dropping like flies around you 
If I get your body close not letting go 
Hoping you're about to 
Tell them other guys they can lose your number 
You're done! 
They don't get another shot cause you're love drunk

I met her at a bar 
A look she gave you said I wouldn't be far 
But that will never stop me 
I like the challenge so I preceeded to speak 
[Bridge] 
One drink turnin' two drinks (two drinks) 
Three drinks turnin' dancin' (dancin') 
And pretty soon her body was all upon me 
Then I woke up I saw her layin' next to me 
[Chorus] 
It was just a fling 
But I really don't regret anything 
'Cause it was crazy babe 
And by the looks I picture feel the same 
And all I remember is me sayin' 
If you turn me then you can't breathe 
Now I'm smilin' 
And I'm barely sober 
I'm caught in a love hangover (hey) 
Love hangover (2x) 
[Verse 2] 
Don't you worry it's fine 
So this will be our little dirty secret for life 
'Cause your man'a lose his mind 
If he ever found out last night that

One drink turnin' two drinks 
Three drinks turnin' dancin' (dancin')

How far did it go oh oh

Role play, we could stop the role play, everyone left 
I'm making love to his girl, but he's still my nigga 
No we can't control ourselves when we on that liquor 
Can't let the homie in this house cause I'm in love with his girl 
What are we doing? 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
Why do I feel good doing something so bad? 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
Okay, it just hit 3: 30, he ain't home yet 
Okay, I might do some things that I'm gon' regret 
He don't treat me right, but he's still my nigga, some how 
We can't control ourselves cause we on that liquor, right now 
Can't let my man in his house cause I'm in love with his boy

We ain't supposed to love like that (no way, no way) 
We ain't supposed to love like that (no way, no way)

No no, I just can't 
Nah, don't stop 
No, I don't wanna stop 
Yeah just like that 
Just go 
This ain't no shit that can be planned 
Some people never find love, maybe we can 
Maybe we can, but I feel so guilty 
But living this life without you just might kill me 
Get it how you want it, I be on it, ain't no days off 
Kiss it, grab it, turn it, baby, I'ma keep my Jays on 
My Jays, my Jays, my Jays, no way 
We ain't supposed to love like that, no way, no way, no way 
Why do I feel so good, doing something so bad? 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
But we ain't supposed to love like that 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
Nah we ain't supposed to fuck like that 
We ain't supposed to touch like that 
Damn it's too much, too much, might crack

I'ma burst back baby, I'ma burst back

Vice 
Uh, so tired of the back and forth 
Walk out and I slam that door 
Go looking for someone new 
But there's nothing better than sex with you 
Hell naw, now we can't be friends 
We ain't got all the benefits 
Never been a jealous dude 
But who the hell is that texting you? 
I'm feeling like this is the opposite of love 
But we know opposites attract 
I want ya, bad 
It's so dysfunctional between the two of us 
You tell me this'll never last 
You want me, back 
Girl, we should go our separate ways, yeah 
Just so that we can make up, oh 
I'll keep making the same mistakes, yeah 
Just so that we can make up 
Just so that we can make up 
Pick up when I hit your line 
Break up, then I call you mine 
Never been a lonely girl 
But let me know I'm the only girl 
Too quick with the clap-back 
Love your attitude 
Leave me like I'm right-back 
Like ya always do 
I'm feeling like this is the opposite of love 
But we know opposites attract 
I want ya, bad 
It's so dysfunctional between the two of us 
You tell me this'll never last 
You want me, back 
Boy, (Talk to me) we should go our separate ways, yeah 
(Slow down girl) 
Just so that we can make up, oh 
I'll keep making the same mistakes, yeah 
Just so that we can make up 
Just so that we can make up 
O-o-oh babe (Derulo) 
I want ya ba-a-a-ack 
Girl, boy, girl, boy 
You want me ba-a-a-ack

When I think of all the years 
I wanna be with you 
Wake up every morning with you in my bed 
That's precisely what I plan to do 
And you know one of these days 
When I get my money right 
Buy you everything 
And show you all the finer things in life 
Will forever be enough 
So there ain't no need to rush 
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me 
Singing oohh, ooh, ooh 
Oh yeah 
How many girls in the world 
Can make me feel like this? 
Baby I don't ever plan to find out 
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why 
You're the love of my life 
And you know one of these days 
When I get my money right 
Buy you everything 
And show you all the finer things in life 
Will forever be enough 
So there ain't no need to rush 
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me 
And if I lost everything 
In my heart it means nothing 
'Cause I have you, girl I have you 
So get right down on bended knee 
Nothing else would ever be 
Better, better 
The day when I say 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me (Yeah) 
I'll say will you marry me (The day I get on my knees) 
I swear that I will mean it

Looking in the mirror 
My own reflection 
Can't stand to look into my eyes 
It's been eating me up 
The things we're hiding 
I'm so done with those lies

Now I've cheated, I've miss-leaded, baby oh oh 
Forgot your birthday, it was on Thursday, I am so oh 
By the time you got you cryin but you know 
I'm only human 
(Pre-Hook 1) 
I did some things that I can't erase 
I'm not looking for no one to blame 
Think it's time I've told you everything 
I'm not who you think

Now you know who I really am 
Now you know where I've been 
I'm only hoping that you'll understand 
Sometimes I make… 
Mistakes

I'm so possessive, overprotecting 
Wanna know who what and where 
It's ‘cause I love you 
But maybe too much 
But I'm only human

Now you know what you don't see 
Only comes from insecurity 
I'm not perfect and I'll never be

Yeah I broke up with my ex, I ain't talk to her since 
The only time I need the sparks 
Is when I light up my spliffs 
Yeah I been all around the world 
Probably write me a book 
Three kitchens in the crib, I don't know how to cook 
I got a mansion in Miami, I forgot how it look 
All I need is two things and that's pussy and kush 
Waving in the foreign, nigga always 
Got a nigga feeling like the God 
I think I'm Charlemagne 
Too much for all the plaques in my hallways 
Fuck with a nigga even if I ain't had no bitch

Cause slowly this kills 
Not everyone needs space 
Oh no 
You're what the doctor gave 
I swallow your pill 
I never loved this way 
Oh no 
You're picking me up 
And get me higher 
You fill my cup with desire 
Baby I'm back now 
Feel it how I used to feel 
You got me begging now 
Stick around 
This is for real 
You put it down 
My painkiller

You got me begging now 
Stick around 
This is for real 
You put it down 
You put it down

To get here to you 
Love how you numb my pain 
Oh yeah 
But all the nurses 
Beware of the juice 
It makes you go insane 
Oh yeah

And get me higher 
You fill my cup with desire

Gon' and throw that thing in reverse, look back at it 
Throw your hair, no body, look back at it

Queen of hearts. 
She the type of girl to make ya lazy. 
Don't wanna do a thing. 
I've been thinking crazy lately; 
Like buying her a ring. 
I used to be at the party with ladies, getting down. 
I used to play with them girls 
But, I'm thinking different now. 
Oooooh she's a star; 
She makes me fly. 
Takin' me places, I've never seen. 
Two worlds apart. 
But, she don't mind, 
Cause she's got her wings. 
I ain't the only one in love, 
Reputation is a bad girl; 
Cause she the queen of hearts. 
She had me open from the start, 
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards. 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
Can't wait to wake up in the morning, 
Knowing she'll be around. 
Heaven shoulda sent a warning; 
Before sending me an angel down. 
I used to chase all the money, the cars, and all them broads. 
But, I don't care for them thangs ever since she stole my heart. 
Oooooh she's a star; 
She makes me fly. 
Takin' me places, I've never seen. 
Two worlds apart. 
But, she don't mind, 
Cause she's got her wings. 
I ain't the only one in love, 
Reputation is a bad girl; 
Cause she the queen of hearts. 
She had me open from the start, 
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards. 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
I ain't the only one in love, 
Reputation is a bad girl; 
Cause she the queen of hearts. 
She had me open from the start, 
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards. 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts

Crazy nights we share, bottles everywhere 
Drunk but we don't care, don't care 
Jeans are on the floor, tipsy on the floor 
I still want you more, you more 
Put your phone away, making love today 
Baby 
If I ask you to stay right here with me 
And never leave this bed 
Yeah, pull the sheets right over it 
Kiss your body, don't make plans 
Baby, we can take our time 
We gonna have tonight for the rest of our life 
The rest of our life 
Tonight I'm your tattoo, never leaving you 
Never leave this room, this room 
Don't you touch your hair 
No makeup, I swear you're perfect everywhere 
Put your phone away, making love today

If I ask you to stay right here with me

And now we all pissed off like (Ooohh)

[Male:] It doesn't matter 
[FeMale:] Cause I can't live my life without you 
[Chorus:] 
Restless. 
[Male:] You got me walkin round searchin for you in the daytime with a flashlight 
Restless. 
[FeMale:] And I ain't slept in four whole days, baby since you went away 
Restless. 
[Male:] Though it hurts I wanna be the first to be callin you, callin you 
[FeMale:] I can't live my life without you. 
Together: Baby I'm restless.

I can feel your retract taking on, on, all of your love 
A revolution, 
cause you turn and you turn and my world and I just can't stop, 
The revolution, you start a revolution 
White flag is up, surrenderin' my all of you 
You broke me down 
Change me breaking all the rules, 
I never knew one girl, could take control of me, 
Right down to the soul of me, showing me, your poetry

Trippin' in the bathroom 
Blood stains, ball gowns 
Trashin' the hotel room 
We don't care 
We're driving cadillacs in our dreams 
But everybody's like cristal, maybach 
Diamonds on your timepiece 
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash 
We don't care 
We aren't caught up in your love affair 
And we'll never be royals 
It don't run in our blood 
That kind of lux just ain't for us 
We crave a different kind of buzz 
Let me be your ruler 
You can call me king bee 
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule 
Let me live that fantasy 
My friends and I we've cracked the code 
We count our dollars on the train to the party 
And everyone who knows us knows 
That we're fine with this 
We didn't come from money

You lose your mind ‘cause you try the best 
And kind of hide that you've been trying to get 
Loving me is got a side fx, side fx, sex sex sex 
Loving me is got a side fx 
You lose your mind ‘cause you try the best 
And kind of hide that you've been trying to get 
Loving me is got a side fx, side fx, sex sex sex

Make your booty say 
All the girls at the bar 
All the girls in the line 
All the girls in the yard 
All the girls 
Loving me is got a side fx</field>

Yeah. 
When I’m right awake 
Seeing things straight 
You’re a love I gotta lose 
Even though you never change 
You stay the same 
I keep on waking up to you 
And I don’t know why 
Cause I know you’re gonna make me cry 
And I don’t know how, 
but you do it to me every time 
 
(Chorus) 
I fall into your lies 
I start to lose my senses 
When I look in your eyes 
I become defenseless 
My heart you hold 
And you won’t let go 
It’s so paralyzing 
under your spell? 
Girl you got control 
You’re so hypnotizing 
 
You got me sleep walking 
You got me sleep walking 
You got me… 
Odd it seems 
You’re in every dream 
There’s no where I can get away 
And you stole from me, My sanity 
But I never seem to make an escape 
But why 
When I know you’re gonna make me cry 
And I don’t know how 
But you do it to me every time 
 
I fall into your lies 
I start to lose my senses 
When I look in your eyes 
I become defenseless 
My heart you hold 
And you won’t let go 
It’s so paralyzing 
under your spell? 
Girl you got control 
You’re so hypnotizing 
 
You got me sleep walking (4x) 
You got me… 
 
Can’t wait for the sunrise 
To wake up and open my eyes 
Somebody pinch me 
So I can erase the 
Spell she has on my life 
Jay snap out the sleepin 
Sip on some coffee 
We’re leaving 
But her love will always 
Keep you asleep 
 
I fall into your lies 
I start to lose my senses 
When I look in your eyes 
I become defenseless 
My heart you hold 
And you won’t let go 
It’s so paralyzing 
under your spell? 
Girl you got control 
You’re so hypnotizing 
 
You got me sleep walking (4x) 
You got me…

Like a Strobe Light Light Light Light x2 
I can't see you babe, 
I feel you, 
Lost in this place till i found you, 
Playin' hard to get, I I know this game, 
Turning me on, 
Switch it off again. 
One moment your gone 
The next you are here 
Like smoke in my arm 
You just disappear 
One moment your here 
Then you flash away 
Let's just start again 
I I want you to stay 
Strobe Light 
Drop in your arms 
Like a strobe light 
See like your doing me wrong 
And if I can get for a second, 
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light 
Drop in your arms 
Like a strobe light light light light x2 
Is this a dream? 
Are you really there? 
A trick of the eye, 
I I, I saw you, I swear, 
One touch not enough, 
Wanna dance with chu all night 
But you keep me n keep me in the half line 
Your running again, 
Like thos in a race, 
Is it love that you want? 
Or just the thrill of the chase, 
One moment your here, 
Then you flash away, 
Let's just start again, 
I I want you to stay, 
Strobe Light, 
Drop in your arms, 
Like a strobe light, 
See like your doing me wrong, 
And if I can get for a second, 
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light, 
Drop in your arms, 
Like a Strobe Light light light light x2 
If the lights were on 
I hold you body 
(If you get this moment) 
Get thing sorted 
(Would you take it off and) 
Immmm 
(Would you take it off) 
Immmm 
(I just want to tell you) 
Immmm 
(Take it off) 
Like a Strobe Light 
(Put your hands up x2) 
Like a Strobe Light 
(Put your hands up x3) 
Strobe Light 
Drop in your arms 
Like a strobe light 
See like your doing me wrong 
And if I can get for a second, 
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light 
Drop in your arms 
Like a strobe light light light light x2 
(Put your hands up x2)

They say think that you can do it 
No crying till it's gone 
They say what if you don't need it 
You had it all along 
They say not enough talking today 
Drinking only hours away 
They say, next time never the same as the first time 
Faded pictures, torn up canvas doesn't mean that you're not priceless 
No one listens, they keep asking, how did it get this way 
They say nothing lasts forever, so I'm leaving for today 
See I listen to what they say and I push your love away 
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho 
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho. 
They say push it to the limit 
It's right and then it's wrong 
Even when you're winning 
Soon you're bout to fall 
Wasn't meant to be done 
Wish you would've had it, had it 
So damn close now, just reach out and grab it 
Faded pictures, torn up canvas doesn't mean that you're not priceless 
No one listens, they keep asking, how did it get this way 
They say nothing lasts forever, so I'm leaving for today 
See I listen to what they say and I push your love away

Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho.

I listened to them never again

Get jazzy on me 
I'm the flight that you get on, international 
First class seat on my lap girl 
Riding comfortable 
Cause I know what the girl them need 
New York to Haiti 
I got lipstick stamps for my passport 
You make it hard to leave 
Been around the world, don't speak the language 
But your booty dont need explaining 
All I really need to understand is when you 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Get jazzy on me 
You know the words in my songs 
No habla ingles 
Our conversantion ain't long 
But you know what is 
I know what that girl them want, London to Taiwan 
I got lipstick stamps for my passport 
I think I need a new one 
Been around the world, don't speak the language 
But your booty don't need explaining 
All I really need to understand is when you 
You talk dirty to me

Uno, met a friend in rio 
Dos, she was all on me oh 
Tres, we can ménage in trio 
Cuatro, oh

Dos Cadenas, clothes are genius 
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis 
Get with arenas, guns on deck 
Chest to chest, tongue on neck 
International oral sex 
Every picture I take, I pose a threat 
Boat or jet, what do you expect? 
Her pussy so good 
I bought her a pet 
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it 
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty" 
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it

It's like a new tattoo 
Don't need a new tattoo 
One touch always makes me 
Too hard to escape 
Three strikes 
I'm still yours, what am I waiting for? 
I'm running out of room

I guess we're both fools

That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
Now get on over here, and get up on this bed 
I'm all upon you, now lock me and whip your legs 
Pulled your shirt to the left and kissed that one 
Pulled yout shirt to the right, how did I miss that one 
I really want it, but I love it that you're teasing it 
Once I start I ain't gon' stop until I'm pleasing it 
Almost time to come up out them jeans, you know exactly what I mean 
As we take it from the bed to the floor 
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa 
If you're ready, say you're ready, and you'll see 
First one's coming by the time you count to three 
One, like a teacher you're sending me to the corner 
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an owner 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
One, I can barely calm it down 
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa 
Hey referee I think we're ready for round two 
Stay there, I'll come to you 
Just relax while I analyze your tatoos, tryna see where I'mma put my name on your back boo 
Just when you thought the water park couldn't get no wetter, I'm dripping down a back, like I'm doing it in my sweater 
Rise above the oven, cream on the cupcake, hazelnut flavored, haagen dazs milkshake 
As we take it from the bed to the floor 
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa 
If you're ready, say you're ready, and you'll see 
The second one's coming by the time you count to three 
One, like a teacher you're sending me to the corner 
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an owner 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
One, I can barely calm it down 
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
Nobody-body is listening, let it go 
Cuz I wanna hear you sing, when you sing 
Somebody-body better turn on the radio 
Cuz I wanna hear you sing, baby sing 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh 
One, like a teacher you're sending me to the corner 
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an owner 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
One, I can barely calm it down 
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around

That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh

When we were chillin' 
Smiling in the photo booth 
But we got closer (yeah) 
'Till you were eating off my spoon 
And coming over 
And we would talk all afternoon 
Tonight we'll just get drunk 
Disturb the peace 
Bind your hands all over me 
And then you bite your lip 
Whisper and say, "We're going all the way" 
Tonight, take me to the other side 
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July 
Just take me to the other side 
I see that sexy look in your eyes 
And I know, we ain't friends anymore 
If we walk down this road 
We'll be lovers for sure 
So tonight 
Kiss me like it's do or die 
And take me to the other side 
This could be perfect 
But we won't know unless we try (try) 
I know you're nervous 
So just sit back and let me drive 
Tonight we'll just get drunk

Yeah 
Like a shock to my heart 
When I saw you tonight 
Like a dream come alive 
For the very first time 
When we touch in the dark 
Baby you're blowing my mind 
Wish I could freeze you and me 
In this moment in time 
You got it, but I won't 
Give it up, shorty 
Step it up for me 
And I'll give you everything 
All my life, all my love 
I give you my fortune and fame 
I'll even give you my name 
(Chorus:) 
Girl you take me higher 
Than I've ever been before 
My feet don't touch the floor 
We'll fly 
The sky's the limit 
The sky's the limit 
Girl you take me 
Up up up 
Uuuup up up 
Uuuup up 
Girl you take me up 
Girl you take me higher 
The sky's the limit 
The sky's the limit 
When we dance, when we kiss 
Doesn't get any better than this 
How you shine, trapped in the spotlight 
Finally mine 
Yeahhh 
Baby let's go, let's get out of here 
Baby let go, got nothing to fear 
And now that we're here 
Let's disappear 
Into the night 
You got it, but I won't 
Give it up, shorty 
Step it up for me 
And I'll give you everything 
All my life, all my love 
I give you my fortune and fame 
I'll even give you my name

Uuuup up up 
Uuuup up 
Girl you take me up 
Girl you take me higher 
The sky's the limit 
The sky's the limit 
My feet are on the ceiling 
They don't wanna touch the ground anymore 
Oh what I feel, I can feel it 
Can you feel it 
(feel it, feel it) 
Girl you take me higher 
Than I've ever been before 
My feet don't touch the floor 
We'll fly 
The sky's the limit

Mi wan you just 
Big fat thang, overflowin' 
Skin tight dress, couldn't hold it 
Way too thick like it's swollen 
Girl, you're too bad and you know it 
When you drop down, lose focus 
When that thing clap, that's a bonus 
MM, that cake looking appetizing 
Back pack full, that's a crisis 
Bring that body my way 
Can't take it off my brain 
Look like you do ballet (yeah) 
Hold tight when you tip toe 
Shake something when you tip toe 
No breaks when you push that back 
Left, right, do it just like that 
Hold tight when you tip toe 
Ayo, God bless you from behind and (I do) 
One hand up like the Heisman (touchdown) 
First class seat when ya ridin' (oh yeah) 
Wind that thing like ya spineless 
Bring that body my way (my way) 
Can't take it off my brain (my brain) 
Look like you do ballet 
Hold tight when you tip toe

Hold tight when you tip toe

Left cheek, right cheek 
Left cheek, right cheek 
Left cheek, right cheek 
Left cheek, right cheek (aye, aye)

Chains on, got me lookin' like a disco 
Who that be? And that drop be Mansory (skrrt) 
Who that be? Blowin' gas out the 'Rarri (sk-skrrt) 
French vanilla smooth like a 100 year wine 
Come sneak up from behind, "what's ya name? " 
"What's ya sign? " (huh) 
Wine fa me, darlin' 
"You want to dock in or fly out? " 
Wine fa me, darlin'

Remember love 
Remember you and me 
Remember everything we shared 
On this planet when we cared 
Remember hearts 
Remember unity 
Remember laughing neighbours without expecting favors 
Why be afraid 
To make an honest mistake 
If you acknowledge the pain 
And you wanna change 
You can get through anything 
Do you remember at all 
People walking hand in hand 
Can we feel that love again 
Can you imagine it all 
If we all could get along 
Then we all could sing this song together 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Singing 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Jason derülo 
Look at me 
Look at you 
Now look at me again 
See we’re not so different 
Look around 
Take what you see 
With throwing things outside our window 
We don’t care to keep it clean 
I had a dream 
Beauty was only skin deep 
If we all just believe 
That is all we need 
Nothing else can set you free 
Demi 
Do you remember at all 
People walking hand in hand 
Can we feel that love again 
Can you imagine it all 
If we all could get along 
Then we all could sing this song together 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Singing 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
If we could throw away the hate 
And make love last another day 
Don’t give up just for today 
Life would be so simple

And when they talk about us 
They gon’ never stop us

So I cry 
Cry 
And you don't know why 
Why 
So I wish I could trade hearts with you 
So I can feel the same way you do 
You do 
Hey can you teach me cynical 
I hope it's not too difficult 
Don't tell me I'm incapable 
Cause I wanna scream the way you scream 
I wanna bleed the way you bleed 
But you only get half of me 
So you cry 
Oh yeah you cry 
And I don't know why 
So I wish I could trade hearts with you 
So I can feel the same way you do 
You do 
Cause there's some things you just don't understand 
Like how hard a woman loves a man 
So I wish I could trade hearts with you 
With you 
Touch me 
Till I feel your love on mine 
Oh touch me, love me, now 
Like it's me that's crying 
Touch me

Wish I knew then what I know now 
But I, I can't change the past 
No matter how I try 
So I'mma get up and dance, you know 
'Cause this might be my last chance 
Like there's nobody around, 
Even gravity can't keep me down 
Everybody, get it started 
I'm on top of the world, what a feeling 
I'm undefeated, undefeated, yeah 
No one told me what I could be 
Now I'm walking on air, what a feeling 
I'm undefeated, undefeated, tonight 
Undefeated 
No looking back, can't live that way right now 
Yesterday's gone, I've found my way, somehow 
So, so, so I'mma get up and dance, you know 
'Cause this might be my last chance 
Like there's nobody around, 
Even gravity can't keep me down 
Everybody, get it started 
I'm on top of the world, what a feeling

So I'll live today like it's my last one 
There's no time for fear, you only live once 
Everybody, get it started

Before you get in bed, though, in those heels 
Hey girl, now I know why you waited 
Had to be sure that I was worth the thrill 
Ladies come and go but you got something different 
Had me so addicted from the start 
And I'd never know all this loving 
I'd be missing 
If I didn't work my way into your heart 
You give me a vertigo, vertigo 
The bed, the floor, the kitchen 
Don't really matter long as I get 
Vertigo, vertigo 
I'm tucked, all bottled inside 
You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat 
Tell me that it's cool that I'm stuck on you 
Like your birthday suit 
You give me a vertigo, that vertigo 
The way that you please me sets this room on fire 
I'm burning with desire in this bed 
So if I'm dreaming please don't wake me up 
If all of this is happening in my head 
Waited for so long 
But what you got is different 
Had me so addicted from the start 
Boy, I'd never know all the shit 
That I was missing 
If I hadn't worked my way into your heart 
You give me vertigo, vertigo

I'm working downtown 
You're all in my head 
This love that we found 
We'll never regret 
We're empty inside 
I'm filling you up with our vertigo 
You're waking me up 
To nothing to say 
Right here in this bed 
We stay here all day 
And my head be spinning 
You do matter with that vertigo 
You give me vertigo, vertigo 
The bed, the floor, the kitchen 
Don't really matter long as I get

I got these sheets on the floor 
Nothing on me 
And I can't take it no more 
It's a hundred degrees 
I got one foot out the door 
Where are my keys 
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah 
In the back of the cab 
I tip the driver ahead of time 
Get me there fast 
I got your body on my mind 
I want it bad 
Oh just the thought of you 
Gets me so high 
So high 
Girl, you're the one 
I want to want me 
And if you want, then girl you got me 
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do 
(I wouldn't do) 
Just to get up next to you 
Girl, you're the one 
I want you to want me 
And if you want me girl you got me 
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do 
(I wouldn't do) 
Just to get up next to you 
Just to get up next to you 
You open the door 
Wearing nothing but a smile 
Fell to the floor 
And you whisper in my ear 
"Baby I'm yours" 
Oh, just the thought of you gets me so high 
So high (so high) 
Girl, you're the one

And if you want, then girl you got me

But tonight that could change 
Gotta be where you are, are babe 
Girl together we'll be losing track of time 
Baby ain't no need to rush we got all night 
Seeing sparks up in this club 
By the time the sun comes up 
You gon' swear you're in love 
Just meet me on the floor the time is now 
You're looking so right, under these lights 
And girl if you get lost ignore the crowd 
The feeling can go go as long as you like 
Cause we own the night, night-ight-ight

Treat you like a star, lights, camera, action 
And we can take it further whenever you say 
Just say the word 
Girl together we'll be losing track of time 
Baby ain't no need to rush we got all night

Buy a house with a fireplace 
This is the first I've seen your face 
But there's a chance we are soul mates 
I know that this might sound crazy 
'Cause you don't know my name 
But we can't, we can't tell the future, no 
But that's just the beauty of the world we know 
So I'ma say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if? 
We all can say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if? 
What if? What if? What if? 
What if? What if? What if? 
Yeah, picture me on one knee 
With the perfect diamond ring 
We just met but if you said yes 
We'd have our wedding on the beach 
It could happen, raise three kids 
And we grow old oh, so happily 
I know this may sound crazy 
'Cause I don't know your name

Oh, and what if I had you and what if you had me 
And, baby, what's the reason we can't fall in love?

You know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Just a ittle bittle 
Patty cake, oatty cake 
With no hands 
Got me in this club making wedding plans 
If I take pictures while you do your dance 
I can make you famous on Instagram 
Hot damn it 
Your booty like two planets 
Go head, and go ham sandwich 
Whoa 
I can't stand it 
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Just a little bit of 
Cadillac, cadillac, pop that trunk 
Let's take a shot 
Alley oops that dunk 
Tired of working that 9 to 5 
Oh baby let me come and change your life 
Hot damn it 
Your booty like two planets 
Go head, and go ham sandwich 
Whoa

'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

Shake what your mama gave you 
Misbehave you 
I just wanna strip you, dip you 
Flip you, bubble bathe you 
What they do 
Taste my rain drops, Ok boo 
Now what you will, what you want, what you may do 
Completely separated, til my deeply penetrated 
Then I take I out, and wipe it off 
Eat it, ate it, love it, hate it 
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been king 
You wiggle, wiggle for the D, O, double G, again? 
Come on baby 
Turn around 
(turn around, turn around) 
You're a star girl 
Take a bow 
(take a bow, take a bow) 
It's just one thing that's killing me 
How you get that in them jeans? 
You know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

Love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
Love, love with my ex 
I know you can’t stand me 
And when you’re angry 
Something about that just turns me on 
You’re such a diva ,tought I didn’t need ya 
But when you’re close it’s the same old song 
I’m all over you, you’re all over me 
I hate that you love me so good, so good, so good 
I can’t live with or without you, I’m hooked, I’m hooked 
Baby’s so unusual, so unusual 
How you want it, you want it 
All the feel is mutual, is so mutual 
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
Love with my ex 
I see other people, just to be evil 
It hurts to watch you do the same thing 
But from a distance, girl I was missing 
That you would come back like a boomerang and 
I’m all over you, you’re all over me 
I hate that you love me so good, so good, so good 
I can’t live with or without you, I’m hooked, I’m hooked 
Baby’s so unusual, so unusual 
How you want it, you want it 
All the feel is mutual, is so mutual 
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
Love with my ex 
Love , love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
It’s got me thinking about we broken up, broken up baby 
I still wanna lay you down, lay you down 
We may be the perfect match … 
Don’t wanna leave right now, leave right now 
Cause 
I’m all over you, you’re all over me 
Baby’s so unusual, so unusual 
How you want it, you want it 
All the feel is mutual, is so mutual 
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex

Wave to my ex and you baby 
I've gotta thank, gotta thank 
That man that didn't know what he had (know what he had) 
And I got a thing for that brain 
That made you happy making him mad (making him mad) 
Well he dropped a dime 
I came up behind and I picked it up, picked it up 
That look on his face 
When he sees the way 
That you switched it up, switched it up 
Your heart was broken back then 
And I was perfect revenge 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
And it was okay with me, but I hope things to see 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
But you sleeping next to me now 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
Now you getting the best of me now 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
I wish my ex all the best 
But I hope she see my with my new new (with my new new) 
We'll be dancing like we're sexing 
I'd be lying if I said we ain't got nothing to approve 
Well he dropped a dime 
I came up behind and I picked it up, picked it up 
That look on his face 
When he sees the way 
That you switched it up, switched it up 
Your heart was broken back then 
And I was perfect revenge 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
And it was okay with me, but I hope things to see 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
But you sleeping next to me now 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
Now you getting the best of me now 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
I upgraded, Dolce purses and them clothes 
Take my credit card and go 
Just payback, payback, we'll call it payback, payback 
Upgraded, drink champagne 
Like it's too cold, payback can be icy cold 
Payback, payback, we'll call it payback, payback 
Your heart was broken back then 
And I was perfect revenge 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
And it was okay with me, but I hope things to see 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
But you sleeping next to me now 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
Now you getting the best of me now 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
Slow it down on them 
I just want my ex to see, to see you baby, but first 
Take me from the bullshit, fly me from the pain 
Somewhere between fantasy and my dreams 
When I hit the bottom, you changed everything 
Better believe that you saved me 
Baby your angel wings 
Fly somewhere where there is means 
Baby your angel wings, girl I just want my ex to see you 
I just want my ex to see you baby 
Going back, back, ain't going going back no [repeat]</field>

Shawty I'm an animal, slowly digging indios 
Spread you like a bad story 
Turn you to a criminal; let me see you cock it back 
Bang bang bang on it 
Til the head board break 
Make me think that I wanna put a ring on you 
But first I'll make you sign for me 
And all the ladies say 
I wanna ride 
I wanna ride 
Up and down like a zipper 
Zipper, zipper, zipper 
Up and down like a zipper 
Zipper, zipper, zipper 
I could be sweet, lady 
Or eat it like a cannibal 
Go places that you may can't go 
In my back seat baby 
You're smoking like some good good 
Once I hit that good good 
Make me beg beg for it 
Mama touch you well 
Cause it ain't about booty but the brain baby 
Now let me hear you sing for me 
And all the ladies say 
I wanna ride 
I wanna ride 
Up and down like a zipper 
Zipper, zipper, zipper 
Up and down like a zipper 
Zipper, zipper, zipper 
She like wearing my snap backs 
She got that snap back 
So If I ever wanna leave 
I'll be right back 
Ooh girl 
I need it 
Ooh girl 
Got me feaning 
You a 'go' girl 
I never go girl 
Cause when you surfing in my bed 
I'll be like go girl 
Ooh girl

How do you fit all that in them jeans? 
You know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Just a ittle bittle 
Patty cake, oatty cake 
With no hands 
Got me in this club making wedding plans 
If I take pictures while you do your dance 
I can make you famous on Instagram 
Hot damn it 
Your booty like two planets 
Go head, and go ham sandwich 
Whoa 
I can't stand it 
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Just a little bit of 
Cadillac, cadillac, pop that trunk 
Let's take a shot 
Alley oops that dunk 
Tired of working that 9 to 5 
Oh baby let me come and change your life 
Hot damn it 
Your booty like two planets 
Go head, and go ham sandwich 
Whoa 
I can't stand it 
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Shake what your mama gave you

Flip you, bubble bathe you

Taste my rain drops, Ok boo 
Now what you will, what you want, what you may do 
Completely separated, til my deeply penetrated 
Then I take I out, and wipe it off 
Eat it, ate it, love it, hate it 
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been king 
You wiggle, wiggle for the D, O, double G, again? 
Come on baby 
Turn around 
(turn around, turn around) 
You're a star girl 
Take a bow

It's just one thing that's killing me 
How you get that in them jeans?

Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis 
Get with arenas, guns on deck 
Chest to chest, tongue on neck 
International oral sex 
Every picture I take, I pose a threat 
Boat or jet, what do you expect? 
Her pussy so good 
I bought her a pet 
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it 
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty" 
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it 
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty" 
Been around the world, dont speak the language 
But your booty dont need explaining 
All I really need to understand is when you 
You talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me, talk to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Get jazzy on me 
What? I don't understand</field>

Just tryna find ya 
I've been like a maniac insomniac 
5 steps behind you 
Tell them other girls, they can hit the exit 
Check please... 
Cause I finally found the girl of my dreams 
Much more than a Grammy award 
That's how much you mean to me 
You could be my it girl 
Baby you're the shhh girl 
Lovin' you could be a crime 
Crazy how we fit girl 
This it girl 
Give me 25 to life 
I just wanna rock all night long 
And put you in the middle of my spotlight 
You could be my it girl 
You're my biggest hit girl 
Let me play it loud 
Let me play it loud like... 
Oh oh oh oh 
Let me play it loud 
Let me play it loud like... 
Oh oh oh oh 
Let me play it loud 
You can't help but turn them heads 
Knockin' them dead 
Dropping like flies around you 
If I get your body close not letting go 
Hoping you're about to 
Tell them other guys they can lose your number 
You're done! 
They don't get another shot cause you're love drunk 
Like a TV show playing reruns 
Every chance I get 
I'mma turn you on 
You could be my it girl 
Baby you're the shhh girl 
Lovin' you could be a crime 
Crazy how we fit girl 
This it girl 
Give me 25 to life

Through my, through my mind, mind

Back pack full, that's a crisis 
Bring that body my way

Fuck her so good she like aw 
My nigga I'm a CEO, oh, oh, oh 
Look we can talk about hits or talk about who I hit 
Did a song with 2 Chainz but I was rocking my shit 
Yeah I broke up with my ex, I ain't talk to her since 
The only time I need the sparks 
Is when I light up my spliffs 
Yeah I been all around the world 
Probably write me a book 
Three kitchens in the crib, I don't know how to cook 
I got a mansion in Miami, I forgot how it look 
All I need is two things and that's pussy and kush 
Waving in the foreign, nigga always 
Got a nigga feeling like the God 
I think I'm Charlemagne 
Too much for all the plaques in my hallways 
Fuck with a nigga even if I ain't had no bitch 
She wanna take it slow

'Cause I didn't love the way you wanted 
And who am I to blame? 
When I didn't trust you 
Enough to let you in the way I wanted 
Stop, okay 
Vodka on my lips 
Took too many drinks 
Makes me reminisce all the way down 
To my happy place, you're my happy place 
I can't handle us now 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Flip side of the graveyard 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Heaven or high water 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe 
If I'm lucky, eh 
If I'm lucky, eh 
Get your loving 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
Who am I to say, that it wasn't good, baby? 
Just thinkin' bout our loving give me chills 
Up and down my spine 
I dare you not to miss me 
'Cause what we had was more than just a thrill 
Stop, okay 
Vodka on my lips 
Took too many drinks 
Makes me reminisce all the way down 
To my happy place, you're my happy place 
I can't handle us now 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Flip side of the graveyard 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Heaven or high water 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe 
If I'm lucky 
If I'm lucky (if I'm lucky) 
I'll get your loving, miss when you say 
'Cause I really miss it babe 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
I'm selfish for you 
I'm selfish for you 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
On the flip side of the graveyard 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya 
Heaven or high water 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe 
If I'm lucky (if I'm lucky, baby) 
If I'm lucky (if I'm lucky, baby) 
I'll get your love in 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
I'm selfish for you 
I'm selfish for you 
And only you, baby</field>

When I think of all the years 
I wanna be with you 
Wake up every morning with you in my bed 
That's precisely what I plan to do 
And you know one of these days 
When I get my money right 
Buy you everything 
And show you all the finer things in life 
Will forever be enough 
So there ain't no need to rush 
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me 
Singing oohh, ooh, ooh 
Oh yeah 
How many girls in the world 
Can make me feel like this? 
Baby I don't ever plan to find out 
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why 
You're the love of my life 
And you know one of these days 
When I get my money right 
Buy you everything 
And show you all the finer things in life 
Will forever be enough 
So there ain't no need to rush 
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me 
And if I lost everything 
In my heart it means nothing 
'Cause I have you, girl I have you 
So get right down on bended knee 
Nothing else would ever be 
Better, better 
The day when I say 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me (Yeah) 
I'll say will you marry me (The day I get on my knees) 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me (what you do to me baby) 
Got me singing (ooh) 
Got me singing (ooh) 
Would you marry me baby (ooh) 
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head 
When I think of all the years

They don't want to see us together 
Don't wanna lose

I'm willing to do whatever 
Cause I don't wanna see you cry 
Give our love another try 
I bet we get it right this time 
As long as you're prepared to fight 
I don't wanna live another day 
Without your body next to me 
I'm not gonna let them break us down

We are barely breathing 
Let's get air in these hearts again

If you found someone that's worth dying for 
The one you can't live without 
Let me hear you say, woah (woah)

Tonight we'll just get drunk 
Disturb the peace 
Bind your hands all over me

Whisper and say, "We're going all the way" 
Tonight, take me to the other side 
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July 
Just take me to the other side 
I see that sexy look in your eyes 
And I know, we ain't friends anymore 
If we walk down this road 
We'll be lovers for sure 
So tonight 
Kiss me like it's do or die 
And take me to the other side 
This could be perfect

I've got to go away 
(Baby it's cold out there) 
This evening has been 
(Been hoping that you'd drop in) 
So very nice 
(I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice) 
My mother will start to worry 
(Beautiful, what's your hurry?) 
And father will be pacing the floor 
(Listen to the fireplace roar) 
So really I'd better scurry 
(Beautiful, please don't hurry) 
Well, maybe just a half a drink more 
(Put some records on while I pour) 
And the neighbors might think 
(Baby, it's bad out there) 
Say what's in this drink 
(No cabs to be had out there) 
I wish I knew how 
(Your eyes are like starlight now) 
To break the spell 
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell) 
I ought to say no, no, no, sir 
(Mind if I move a little closer?) 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
(What's the sense in hurting my pride?) 
I really can't stay 
(Oh, baby, don't hold out) 
Baby it's cold outside 
I simply must go 
(But it's cold outside) 
The answer is no 
(I say it's cold out there) 
This welcome has been 
(I'm lucky that you dropped in) 
So nice and warm 
(Look out the window at that storm) 
My sister will be suspicious 
(Gosh, your lips look so delicious) 
My brother will be there at the door 
(Waves upon a tropical shore) 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
(Gosh, your lips look delicious) 
Well, maybe just a cigarette more 
(Never such a blizzard before) 
I've got to go home 
(Baby, you'll freeze out there) 
Say you lend me your comb 
(Baby, it's up to your knees out there) 
You've really been grand 
(I'm thrilled when you touch my hand) 
But don't you see 
(How can you do this thing to me) 
There's bound to be talk tomorrow 
(Making my life long sorrow) 
At least there will be plenty implied 
(If you caught pneumonia and died) 
I really can't stay 
(Get over that old out) 
But, baby, it's cold outside</field>

You can drive it when you want 
But you gotta keep that top down for me 
I'm just tryna push this shit, don't start 
Up and down your boulevard 
Girl I had to pull you over for the jeans 
Look at that sexy body 
Look at that trunk in the back 
I'mma get a lil bit ratchet 
Cause I never seen a girl like that 
You know I had to skrr, pull up 
Pull up, oh yeah, skrr, I had to pull up 
I'mma make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby 
Make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby 
Girl I gotta get that Coupe for two 
You'd be amazed what we could do 
We can roll these windows down so they all see 
Gon' and throw that thing in reverse, look back at it 
Throw your hair, no body, look back at it 
You gon' make somebody wanna call the police 
Look at that sexy body 
Look at that trunk in the back 
I'mma get a lil bit ratchet 
Cause I never seen a girl like that 
You know I had to skrr, pull up 
Pull up, oh yeah, skrr, I had to pull up 
I'mma make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby 
Make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby 
Look at that sexy body 
I never seen curves like that, when we do it baby 
Look at that sexy body 
You know that it drives me mad 
Skrr, pull up 
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, take that thing like a repo 
I'mma beat that thing, you my cheat code 
When I'm done we gon' knock the fuck out 
I had to pull up, I had to pull up, pull up 
Skrr, I had to pull up up, skrr 
I'mma make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby 
Make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby</field>

Jason Derulo 
Let's Go! 
(Part One) 
I got more problems 
Than an algebra equation 
They say become a doctor 
I don't have the patience 
Ain't with the waiting 
What's my motivation? 
The road less traveled 
Is the one that I'll be takin' 
(Part Two) 
Lonely days 
Well the only days I remember 
The days I would say: 
I can be starter 
Mama if I really wanted to 
I could be a starter 
Mama 
What if I just get rid of you? 
(Part Three) 
Haters (Haters, Haters) 
Haters (Haters, Haters) 
Haters (Haters) 
You! (You) 
Whatcha trying to prove? 
Eyes on me 
Like I'm in your movie screen 
Damn I know I'm fly (fly) 
Ain't got nothing to hide 
Want a piece of my pie 
Then you got more problems 
Than I (I) have 
CHORUS 
Hey! (Hey) 
What you trying to say? 
Can't get me off your brain 
And it's drivin you insane 
Damn you know I'm fly 
Want a piece of my pie? 
Then you have more problems 
Then I 
Who's gonna take me? 
Who's (Who's) 
Gonna take me (take me)? 
Who's gonna take me away 
From here? 
CHORUS 
Mo' problems 
Don't want mo' problems 
Mo' problems 
Don't want mo' problems 
Problems

            <field name="lyrics">I really can't stay 
(But baby it's cold outside) 
I've got to go away 
(Baby it's cold out there) 
This evening has been 
(Been hoping that you'd drop in) 
So very nice 
(I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice) 
My mother will start to worry 
(Beautiful, what's your hurry?) 
And father will be pacing the floor 
(Listen to the fireplace roar) 
So really I'd better scurry 
(Beautiful, please don't hurry) 
Well, maybe just a half a drink more 
(Put some records on while I pour) 
And the neighbors might think 
(Baby, it's bad out there) 
Say what's in this drink 
(No cabs to be had out there) 
I wish I knew how 
(Your eyes are like starlight now) 
To break the spell 
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell) 
I ought to say no, no, no, sir 
(Mind if I move a little closer?) 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
(What's the sense in hurting my pride?) 
I really can't stay 
(Oh, baby, don't hold out) 
Baby it's cold outside 
I simply must go 
(But it's cold outside) 
The answer is no 
(I say it's cold out there) 
This welcome has been 
(I'm lucky that you dropped in) 
So nice and warm 
(Look out the window at that storm) 
My sister will be suspicious 
(Gosh, your lips look so delicious) 
My brother will be there at the door 
(Waves upon a tropical shore) 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
(Gosh, your lips look delicious) 
Well, maybe just a cigarette more 
(Never such a blizzard before) 
I've got to go home 
(Baby, you'll freeze out there) 
Say you lend me your comb 
(Baby, it's up to your knees out there) 
You've really been grand 
(I'm thrilled when you touch my hand) 
But don't you see 
(How can you do this thing to me) 
There's bound to be talk tomorrow 
(Making my life long sorrow) 
At least there will be plenty implied 
(If you caught pneumonia and died) 
I really can't stay 
(Get over that old out) 
But, baby, it's cold outside</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Have you ever had a feeling you were being watched? 
Footsteps behind you like a shadow when you walk? 
Can’t tell if your mind is playing tricks or not? 
Eh eh eh eh no! 
What I’m going through is now racking my brain. 
Thinking bout like do I got any enemies? 
Where I’ve been what I did, what did I say? 
Eh eh eh eh yeah! 
Come to think of it, 
I remember one chick, 
That I was messing with, 
While I was in conneticut, 
I met her after my show. 
I took her back to my room. 
The next day I had to go. 
I never thought it would... 
Get this deep! 
Now I got this problem following me! 
Better be careful, better be careful, better be careful! 
Whose heart she’ll break, 
Never knowing what you do or say 
Will send em over the edge so 
Next time I’ll be careful! 
I’m getting letters every other day addressed to me. 
Saying dear jason you and I were meant to be. 
Tell me you feel the same or it will be the death for me. 
Eh eh! it gets so worst now! 
She reaching out to all my people, friends and family. 
Got me so paranoid I’m stuck with my security. 
It’s getting crazy here, it’s difficult for me to sleep. 
Eh eh eh eh you know! 
Now all I’m thinking is 
How do I get out of this 
I’m feeling kind of sick, 
Damn this is some crazy shit 
I met her after my show 
I took her back to my room. 
The next day I had to go. 
I never thought it would,,, 
Get this deep! 
Now I got this problem following me! 
Better be careful, better be careful, better be careful! 
Whose heart she’ll break, 
Never knowing what you do or say 
Will send em over the edge so 
Next time I’ll be careful! 
This got so out of control. 
I learned my lesson now so. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh be careful! 
She’s hoping I won’t let go 
She wants a piece of my soul. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh be careful! 
I met her after my show. 
I took her back to my room. 
The next day I had to go. 
I never thought it would… 
Get this deep! 
Now I got this problem following me! 
Better be careful, better be careful, better be careful! 
Whose heart she’ll break, 
Never knowing what you do or say 
Will send em over the edge so 
Next time I’ll be careful! 
I never thought it would…get this deep! 
Now I got this problem following me! 
Better be careful, better be careful, better be careful! 
Whose heart she’ll break, 
Never knowing what you do or say 
Will send em over the edge so 
Next time I’ll be careful!</field>

I love hard love 
When you put, put a gun on my heart 
I just gotta say hey 
I just gotta say hey. 
I've always loved hard 
So I take it slow 
I guess is my fault 'cause I wanna go 
But I, always care for you 
My.. 
perfect not even close 
But I don't deserve this 
But girl I suppose 
I wasn't there for you 
Pre chorus: 
.. 
baby we're nothing else to say 
Look me in my place I can't live out this way 
Can't live out this way 
Can't live out this way 
You put it.. 
in my heart 
.. 
start just a little.. 
just a little... 
Dance.. 
I bleed. 
2 x chorus: 
When I bleed, I bleed out 
When I cry, I cry loud 
When I love 
You can bet I'm all in 
When you leave I bleed out. 
I look in those eyes 
There's nothing there 
I'm looking into 
The cold is there 
I, ever see 
We haven't touched each other forever 
Know what I do, if we're not together 
I'm not ready to leave, no baby. 
Pre chorus: 
.. 
baby we're nothing else to say 
Look me in my place I can't live out this way 
Can't live out this way 
Can't live out this way 
You put it..

Dance..

2 x chorus: 
When I bleed, I bleed out 
When I cry, I cry loud 
When I love 
You can bet I'm all in 
When you leave I bleed out. 
Hey I look 
Why you wanna out a gun in my heart 
I just gotta say hey 
I just gotta say hey

Since the first date when you got close my heart 
Would just stop thought me and you together would end 
Up on top, you changed me for better for worse I know 
I was caught up alway's put you first I never once thought 
You would be triflin but o I was blinded... 
[Chorus:] 
I was like oh oh oh never wanna let you go go go 
Cause I was open before I was open before but 
Now I know.. 
That love made me blind so I could'nt 
See all the lies you told were right in front of me 
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me 
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be 
Your love made me blind, love made blind, love made me blind, 
Your love made me blind. 
I gave all of my trust didn't think being faithfull was asking 
To much but I'm good glad that I know now I was fooled but 
Fate let me see how they say every tear has it's reasons 
Every smile has it's own season never once thought 
Youd be this triflin but o I was blinded... 
[Chorus:] 
I was like oh oh oh never wanna let you go go go 
Cause I was open before I was open before but 
Now I know.. 
That love made me blind so I could'nt 
See all the lies you told were right in front of me 
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me 
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be. 
Your love made me blind, love made blind, love made me blind, 
Your love made me blind. 
Cause I felt your lips pressed against mine thought the 
Sweet smell of your perfume was all mine, I love the 
Way you scream my name... 
That love made me blind so I could'nt 
See all the lies you told were right in front of me 
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me 
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be. 
Your love made me blind, your love made blind, your love made me blind, 
Your love made me blind.</field>

I know you're coming back to me 
I will be waiting here for you til the end 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
Without your love, don't know how I survive 
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
I want to see pictures of you leaving 
On these four walls, and on the ceiling 
Gave you a kiss, but I'm dreaming 
These crazy thoughts are so deceiving 
You are the drug, I am needing 
Paradise that I'm so seeking 
I'm still alive, hope there's a reason 
Can't move my lips, but my heart's screaming 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
Without your love, don't know how I survive 
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
Oh baby, I only miss you when I 
I'm screaming at your name, but you don't answer me 
I know I kissed your face, is this my fantasy? 
I start the alarm, tell everyone that I only miss you 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
I only miss you when I'm breathing! 
Without your love, don't know how I survive 
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive

hoping the silence

(away, away

to wipe away my tears 
when they fall (oh no) 
and no one hears me screaming, 
but these four walls 
so I'm calling out your name 
hoping you'd hear me (hear me) 
got both hands on my heart 
hoping you'd feel me (feel me) 
cos baby I feel you when i close my eyes 
calling out for you, i cant sleep at night 
can someone help me find my angel 
cos every breath i take without, is painful 
please someone, help me find my angel 
cos i know she's hear me calling 
hear me calling, calling, calling for my angel 
calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel 
wherever i'll be, 
calling, calling, calling for my angel 
calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel 
now, who's gonna pick me up 
when i fell down (down) 
you left with a part of me 
the air is thinning, 
its getting so hard to breathe 
(breathe, breathe) 
breathe, 
try to take the pain away with this pen 
but i just keep writing your name over again 
no one can your place (no) 
life without you is impossible 
so I'm calling out your name 
hoping you'd hear me (hear me) 
got both hands on my heart 
hoping you'd feel me (feel me) 
cos baby i feel you when i close my eyes 
calling out for you, cos i need you in my life 
can someone help me find my angel 
cos every breath i take without, is painful 
please someone, help me find my angel 
cos i know she's hear me calling 
hear me calling, calling, calling for my angel 
calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel 
wherever i'll be, 
calling, calling, calling for my angel 
calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel 
yeah hmmm 
just put your hands in the air 
if you're missing somebody 
come home 
cos i cant handle this alone 
can someone help me find my angel 
cos every breath i take without, is painful 
(baby, baby come home) 
please someone, help me find my angel 
(i know you hear me) 
cos i know she's hear me calling (ooh)

When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away 
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through 
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you 
And can you feel the love tonight? 
It is where we are 
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer 
That we got this far 
And can you feel the love tonight? 
How it's laid to rest 
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds 
Believe the very best 
There's a time for everyone if they only learn 
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn 
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors 
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours 
And can you feel the love tonight? 
It is where we are 
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer 
That we got this far 
And can you feel the love tonight? 
How it's laid to rest 
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

If I let go I know I'll regret it 
Every heart that I held before 
I was sure to break it 
I don't know what she did, but

No, I can't stop now 
Look what we started, baby 
You're not what I expected 
Cause all I ever wanted was some fun 
Look what we started, baby 
I used to look for exes 
Cause all I ever wanted was some fun 
I never meant to fall in love 
I never meant to fall in lo-ove 
I never meant to fall in love

Got the table set for two 
Guess you couldn't make it 
Thought I kissed your lips again

Love without her could be so better, 
Thats all to say when the love's gone, 
I tried to force it but there's no moving on 
They say forgive and forget just to easy my mind, 
And living with regret is just a waste of time, 
But this misery is all that I've got 
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb 
For thinkin' you could love me 
Your so numb, your so numb 
You can't feel it so it's easy 
My love's still here 
But your not there 
You broke my heart, you don't care 
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb 
For thinking you could love me 
Where was the whistle or the buzzer 
To let me know that it's over 
Now I can't seem to get through the night 
If her mind is over 
What happened to the love 
When did I stop being enough 
Cuz damn I've been wherever we having 
No where to dream that sickness from your love 
Or drug woaaaaah! 
They say forgive and forget just to easy my mind

I'm falling (yeah) 
Don't need the fame or money 
As long as i got you babe 
I'm falling (i'm falling baby), i'm falling 
Tell all them other girls (tell all them other girls) 
(Tell all them other girls) 
I've fallen..

Away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
Could ever do 
Just like the rains down in Africa 
It's gonna take some time 
But I know you're worth fighting for 
I'll fight for you 
I'll fight for you 
I'll fight for you 
Friends are cool 
But we both know 
They don't want to see us together 
Don't wanna lose 
What I live for 
I'm willing to do whatever 
Cause I don't wanna see you cry 
Give our love another try 
I bet we get it right this time 
As long as you're prepared to fight 
I don't wanna live another day 
Without your body next to me 
I'm not gonna let them break us down 
Cause baby I know now 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me 
Away from you 
(I'll fight for you) 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
Could ever do 
(I'll fight for you) 
Just like the rains down in africa 
(I'll fight for you) 
It's gonna take some time 
But I know you're worth fighting for 
What they say 
It don't even matter 
They don't really understand 
Without eachother 
We are barely breathing 
Let's get air in these hearts again 
Cause I don't wanna see you cry 
Give our love another try 
I bet we get it right this time 
As long as your prepared to fight 
Prepared to fight 
I don't wanna live another day 
Without your body next to me 
I'm not gonna let them break us down 
Cause baby I know now 
Know now 
Know now 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me 
Away from you 
(I'll fight for you) 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
Could ever do 
(I'll fight for you) 
Just like the rains down in africa 
(I'll fight for you) 
It's gonna take some time 
But I know you're worth fighting for 
I fight for you 
If you got someone that's worth fighting for 
Don't let nobody hold you down 
Let me hear you say, woah (woah) 
Oh woah (oh woah) 
If you found someone that's worth dying for 
The one you can't live without 
Let me hear you say, woah (woah) 
Oh woah (oh woah) 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me 
Away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
Could ever do

i'll change my ways 
and give you all of me 
give you everything 
that i can match and breathe 
the ground is where i wanna be 
cos i keep losing my breath 
when you're around 
cos I'm loving this pain 
in my chest 
hoping that you'll pull me 
down, down, down

and be my gravity,

Lately i've been thinking babe, things just aint the same 
We went from being friends, to lovers arguing 
Its like all we do is fight, but i try to compromise 
Its so hard for me to let this go, but i just feel like you need to know 
I dont wanna say good bye, just wish we could rewind 
Go back in time back when everything was fine 
Ohh just wish we could undo, go back to being cool 
Ohh can you please 
Tell me how did we get (we get) 
So cold after all 
How did we get 
So far from wonderful 
How did we get (we get) 
Close to the end 
How did we get (how did we get) 
How did we fall out of love 
Of love (of love) x3 
How did we fall out of love 
Should we just take a break, we've got so much at stake 
Too delicate to choose, cause either way we lose 
The day we took the steps, we knew we'd both regret 
We did it anyway there's nothing left to say 
But i dont wanna say good bye, just wish we could rewind 
Go back in time back when everything was fine 
Ohh just wish we could undo, go back to being cool 
Ohh can you please 
Tell me how did we get (we get) 
So cold after all 
How did we get 
So far from wonderful 
How did we get (we get) 
Close to the end 
How did we get (how did we get) 
How did we fall out of love 
Of love (of love) x3 
How did (tell me how did we get)

This goes out to all the ladies out there, 
Wooaahh 
And ohhhh 
Ohh-ohh-ohhh-ohh 
[Verse 1:] 
I turn around looking straight in the mirror and 
Even without her 
I don't know how I got to this moment and It's nothin I deserve 
Not the same since the day I met you 
And now that it's in the past I can't believe all I did was just let you in 
You've shown me what I need 
[Chorus:] 
I'm only human, it wouldn't be enough I never would have got this far 
I'm only human, and I know that you, have opened up my he-aa-rt. 
How I live what I say and I do, 
Never really cared but now I'm telling you 
To know my life, could see that second star 
Cause I'm only human 
Yeaa yeaa 
[Verse 2:] 
I know I need to say how I feel and now for what it's worth (what it's worth) 
I am here for sure, id rather be yours and well I'm fine even though it don't work not the same since the day I met you. 
And now that it's in the past I can't believe all I did was let you in 
You've shown me what I need 
[Chorus] 
[Hook:] 
If I don't then tell me why 
Livin out everything that I feel inside, what's it worth if we don't try 
Still I need your love, and now the way I fell about you 
And with your love your in my life, I can tell that you'll give it one last try 
woah woah woah yeaahhh and ohh and ohhh ohhh ohhh 
[Chorus:] 
Didn't know my life could see the second star 
Didn't know I could be here where you are 
Cause I'm only human 
I'm only hu-uman 
Humaannn 
And oh oh oh ohh 
And oh.</field>

She said lets go 
Her man was down stairs 
She took me to the second floor 
She pushed me in the room on the bed and shut the door 
Wasted no time 
Started ripping off my clothes 
Girl what you doing!(Damn) 
She put her birthday suit on 
I was like Waoh! 
Made up my mind 
Turned up the radio 
Keep it on the low 
Keep it on the hush, I wanna hear whats for show!

I gotta get home 
My girl thinks im sleeping 
In the guest room(Oooo) 
If she found that I was cheating(leaving) 
Middle of the..Middle of the night creeping 
What would she do 
Pulled up to the crib around 2 
Heard a noise from the stairs 
I asumed its a friend 
Opened up the door 
Theres a new friend named Tag Grief Ben, And hes singing

In your mom and pops house when they was sleeping creeping 
In your bedroom(Oooo,Oooo, Shawty)

You know I put you down so you had a good reason 
Hands over your mouth 
In case you started sreaming from the freaking 
In your bedroom(Oooo)

Get your loving 
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday 
Who am I to say, that it wasn't good, baby? 
Just thinkin' bout our loving give me chills 
Up and down my spine 
I dare you not to miss me

Bodies in a twine.

Baby let's be nocturnal, 
Keep each other awake forever. 
I'm your only turn on, 
Making this love infernal, 
And never see the day. 
I can be a vampire be mine. 
Run the daylight, 
Together we stay right, 
Stay away, away from night. 
Never say good night, 
No good in goodbye, 
No way, so you'll stay, 
You'll lie awake, 
And you can be my insomnia. 
You give me a love, 
I'll stay up forever, 
I can be your insomnia, 
I can give you a rush, 
Stay sleepless together. 
You can be my insomnia, 
You give me a love I'll stay up forever. 
I can be your insomnia, 
My touches is like a drug that keeps you away, way. 
I touch the vine, 
So terrifying. 
Scared to let the morning take this away, 
Dawn we'll break it, 
I know well make it, 
Cause in the dark it's our safest haven. 
How come the star are shining? 
How is it good rewinding? 
Keep em outta sight.

No way never turn back, 
Hurt me like a heart attack, 
Acting like a manic, 
Be my love insomniac. 
I'll bet they'll never know, 
One touch I over dose, 
So much I want some more, 
So close. 
I can be a vampire, be mine, 
Run from the daylight.

Just tryna find ya 
I've been like a maniac insomniac 
5 steps behind you 
Tell them other girls, they can hit the exit 
Check please... 
Cause I finally found the girl of my dreams 
Much more than a Grammy award 
That's how much you mean to me 
You could be my it girl 
Baby you're the shhh girl 
Lovin' you could be a crime 
Crazy how we fit girl 
This it girl 
Give me 25 to life 
I just wanna rock all night long 
And put you in the middle of my spotlight 
You could be my it girl 
You're my biggest hit girl 
Let me play it loud 
Let me play it loud like... 
Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh

You can't help but turn them heads 
Knockin' them dead 
Dropping like flies around you 
If I get your body close not letting go 
Hoping you're about to 
Tell them other guys they can lose your number 
You're done! 
They don't get another shot cause you're love drunk 
Like a TV show playing reruns 
Every chance I get 
I'mma turn you on 
You could be my it girl 
Baby you're the shhh girl 
Lovin' you could be a crime 
Crazy how we fit girl

I met her at a bar 
A look she gave you said I wouldn't be far 
But that will never stop me 
I like the challenge so I preceeded to speak 
[Bridge] 
One drink turnin' two drinks (two drinks) 
Three drinks turnin' dancin' (dancin') 
And pretty soon her body was all upon me 
Then I woke up I saw her layin' next to me 
[Chorus] 
It was just a fling 
But I really don't regret anything 
'Cause it was crazy babe 
And by the looks I picture feel the same 
And all I remember is me sayin' 
If you turn me then you can't breathe 
Now I'm smilin' 
And I'm barely sober 
I'm caught in a love hangover (hey) 
Love hangover (2x) 
[Verse 2] 
Don't you worry it's fine 
So this will be our little dirty secret for life 
'Cause your man'a lose his mind 
If he ever found out last night that 
[Bridge] 
One drink turnin' two drinks 
Three drinks turnin' dancin' (dancin') 
And pretty soon her body was all upon me

Now I didn't know (I didn't know) 
How far did it go oh oh 
But I said I would have her (But I said would have her) 
Now it's the mornin' after

It was just a fling

Role play, we could stop the role play, everyone left 
I'm making love to his girl, but he's still my nigga 
No we can't control ourselves when we on that liquor 
Can't let the homie in this house cause I'm in love with his girl 
What are we doing? 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
Why do I feel good doing something so bad? 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
Okay, it just hit 3: 30, he ain't home yet 
Okay, I might do some things that I'm gon' regret 
He don't treat me right, but he's still my nigga, some how 
We can't control ourselves cause we on that liquor, right now 
Can't let my man in his house cause I'm in love with his boy 
What are we doing? 
We ain't supposed to love like that (no way, no way) 
We ain't supposed to love like that (no way, no way)

We ain't supposed to love like that 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
No no, I just can't 
Nah, don't stop 
No, I don't wanna stop 
Yeah just like that 
Just go 
This ain't no shit that can be planned 
Some people never find love, maybe we can 
Maybe we can, but I feel so guilty 
But living this life without you just might kill me 
Get it how you want it, I be on it, ain't no days off 
Kiss it, grab it, turn it, baby, I'ma keep my Jays on 
My Jays, my Jays, my Jays, no way 
We ain't supposed to love like that, no way, no way, no way 
Why do I feel so good, doing something so bad? 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
But we ain't supposed to love like that 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
We ain't supposed to love like that 
Nah we ain't supposed to fuck like that 
We ain't supposed to touch like that 
Damn it's too much, too much, might crack 
Pressure burst pipes, baby I'ma burst back 
I'ma burst back baby, I'ma burst back 
We ain't supposed to love like that</field>

Vice 
Uh, so tired of the back and forth 
Walk out and I slam that door 
Go looking for someone new 
But there's nothing better than sex with you 
Hell naw, now we can't be friends 
We ain't got all the benefits 
Never been a jealous dude 
But who the hell is that texting you? 
I'm feeling like this is the opposite of love 
But we know opposites attract 
I want ya, bad 
It's so dysfunctional between the two of us 
You tell me this'll never last 
You want me, back 
Girl, we should go our separate ways, yeah 
Just so that we can make up, oh 
I'll keep making the same mistakes, yeah 
Just so that we can make up 
Just so that we can make up 
Pick up when I hit your line 
Break up, then I call you mine 
Never been a lonely girl 
But let me know I'm the only girl 
Too quick with the clap-back 
Love your attitude 
Leave me like I'm right-back 
Like ya always do 
I'm feeling like this is the opposite of love 
But we know opposites attract 
I want ya, bad 
It's so dysfunctional between the two of us 
You tell me this'll never last 
You want me, back 
Boy, (Talk to me) we should go our separate ways, yeah 
(Slow down girl) 
Just so that we can make up, oh 
I'll keep making the same mistakes, yeah 
Just so that we can make up 
Just so that we can make up 
O-o-oh babe (Derulo) 
I want ya ba-a-a-ack 
Girl, boy, girl, boy 
You want me ba-a-a-ack 
Girl, we should go our separate ways, yeah 
Just so that we can make up, oh

When I think of all the years 
I wanna be with you 
Wake up every morning with you in my bed 
That's precisely what I plan to do 
And you know one of these days 
When I get my money right 
Buy you everything 
And show you all the finer things in life 
Will forever be enough 
So there ain't no need to rush 
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me 
Singing oohh, ooh, ooh 
Oh yeah 
How many girls in the world 
Can make me feel like this? 
Baby I don't ever plan to find out 
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why 
You're the love of my life 
And you know one of these days 
When I get my money right 
Buy you everything 
And show you all the finer things in life 
Will forever be enough 
So there ain't no need to rush 
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me 
And if I lost everything 
In my heart it means nothing 
'Cause I have you, girl I have you 
So get right down on bended knee 
Nothing else would ever be 
Better, better 
The day when I say 
I'll say will you marry me 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me (Yeah) 
I'll say will you marry me (The day I get on my knees) 
I swear that I will mean it 
I'll say will you marry me (what you do to me baby) 
Got me singing (ooh) 
Got me singing (ooh) 
Would you marry me baby (ooh)

Looking in the mirror 
My own reflection 
Can't stand to look into my eyes 
It's been eating me up 
The things we're hiding 
I'm so done with those lies 
(Verse) 
Now I've cheated, I've miss-leaded, baby oh oh 
Forgot your birthday, it was on Thursday, I am so oh 
By the time you got you cryin but you know 
I'm only human 
(Pre-Hook 1) 
I did some things that I can't erase 
I'm not looking for no one to blame 
Think it's time I've told you everything 
I'm not who you think 
(Hook) 
Now you know who I really am 
Now you know where I've been 
I'm only hoping that you'll understand 
Sometimes I make… 
Mistakes

(Verse) 
I'm so possessive, overprotecting 
Wanna know who what and where 
It's ‘cause I love you 
But maybe too much 
But I'm only human 
(Pre-Hook 2) 
Now you know what you don't see 
Only comes from insecurity 
I'm not perfect and I'll never be 
I'm not who you think

The only time I need the sparks 
Is when I light up my spliffs 
Yeah I been all around the world 
Probably write me a book 
Three kitchens in the crib, I don't know how to cook 
I got a mansion in Miami, I forgot how it look 
All I need is two things and that's pussy and kush 
Waving in the foreign, nigga always 
Got a nigga feeling like the God 
I think I'm Charlemagne 
Too much for all the plaques in my hallways 
Fuck with a nigga even if I ain't had no bitch

True 
I thought my heart might break 
Cause slowly this kills 
Not everyone needs space 
Oh no 
You're what the doctor gave 
I swallow your pill 
I never loved this way 
Oh no 
You're picking me up 
And get me higher 
You fill my cup with desire 
Baby I'm back now 
Feel it how I used to feel 
You got me begging now 
Stick around 
This is for real 
You put it down 
My painkiller

Baby I'm back now

You got me begging now 
Stick around 
This is for real 
You put it down 
You put it down

To get here to you 
Love how you numb my pain 
Oh yeah 
But all the nurses 
Beware of the juice 
It makes you go insane 
Oh yeah

And get me higher 
You fill my cup with desire

Queen of hearts. 
She the type of girl to make ya lazy. 
Don't wanna do a thing. 
I've been thinking crazy lately; 
Like buying her a ring. 
I used to be at the party with ladies, getting down. 
I used to play with them girls 
But, I'm thinking different now. 
Oooooh she's a star; 
She makes me fly. 
Takin' me places, I've never seen. 
Two worlds apart. 
But, she don't mind, 
Cause she's got her wings. 
I ain't the only one in love, 
Reputation is a bad girl; 
Cause she the queen of hearts. 
She had me open from the start, 
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards. 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
Can't wait to wake up in the morning, 
Knowing she'll be around. 
Heaven shoulda sent a warning; 
Before sending me an angel down. 
I used to chase all the money, the cars, and all them broads. 
But, I don't care for them thangs ever since she stole my heart. 
Oooooh she's a star; 
She makes me fly. 
Takin' me places, I've never seen. 
Two worlds apart. 
But, she don't mind, 
Cause she's got her wings. 
I ain't the only one in love, 
Reputation is a bad girl; 
Cause she the queen of hearts. 
She had me open from the start, 
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards. 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
I ain't the only one in love, 
Reputation is a bad girl; 
Cause she the queen of hearts. 
She had me open from the start, 
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards. 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts. 
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh) 
Shorty’s the queen of hearts

Crazy nights we share, bottles everywhere 
Drunk but we don't care, don't care 
Jeans are on the floor, tipsy on the floor 
I still want you more, you more 
Put your phone away, making love today 
Baby 
If I ask you to stay right here with me 
And never leave this bed 
Yeah, pull the sheets right over it 
Kiss your body, don't make plans 
Baby, we can take our time 
We gonna have tonight for the rest of our life 
The rest of our life 
Tonight I'm your tattoo, never leaving you 
Never leave this room, this room 
Don't you touch your hair 
No makeup, I swear you're perfect everywhere 
Put your phone away, making love today

If I ask you to stay right here with me

[Male:] It doesn't matter 
[FeMale:] Cause I can't live my life without you 
[Chorus:] 
Restless. 
[Male:] You got me walkin round searchin for you in the daytime with a flashlight 
Restless. 
[FeMale:] And I ain't slept in four whole days, baby since you went away 
Restless. 
[Male:] Though it hurts I wanna be the first to be callin you, callin you 
[FeMale:] I can't live my life without you. 
Together: Baby I'm restless.

I can feel your retract taking on, on, all of your love 
A revolution, 
cause you turn and you turn and my world and I just can't stop, 
The revolution, you start a revolution 
White flag is up, surrenderin' my all of you 
You broke me down 
Change me breaking all the rules, 
I never knew one girl, could take control of me, 
Right down to the soul of me, showing me, your poetry

Trippin' in the bathroom 
Blood stains, ball gowns 
Trashin' the hotel room 
We don't care 
We're driving cadillacs in our dreams 
But everybody's like cristal, maybach 
Diamonds on your timepiece 
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash 
We don't care 
We aren't caught up in your love affair 
And we'll never be royals 
It don't run in our blood 
That kind of lux just ain't for us 
We crave a different kind of buzz 
Let me be your ruler 
You can call me king bee 
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule 
Let me live that fantasy 
My friends and I we've cracked the code 
We count our dollars on the train to the party 
And everyone who knows us knows 
That we're fine with this 
We didn't come from money 
But every song's like gold teeth grey goose

Yeah. 
When I’m right awake 
Seeing things straight 
You’re a love I gotta lose 
Even though you never change 
You stay the same 
I keep on waking up to you 
And I don’t know why 
Cause I know you’re gonna make me cry 
And I don’t know how, 
but you do it to me every time 
 
(Chorus) 
I fall into your lies 
I start to lose my senses 
When I look in your eyes 
I become defenseless 
My heart you hold 
And you won’t let go 
It’s so paralyzing 
under your spell? 
Girl you got control 
You’re so hypnotizing 
 
You got me sleep walking 
You got me sleep walking 
You got me… 
Odd it seems 
You’re in every dream 
There’s no where I can get away 
And you stole from me, My sanity 
But I never seem to make an escape 
But why 
When I know you’re gonna make me cry 
And I don’t know how 
But you do it to me every time 
 
I fall into your lies 
I start to lose my senses 
When I look in your eyes 
I become defenseless 
My heart you hold 
And you won’t let go 
It’s so paralyzing 
under your spell? 
Girl you got control 
You’re so hypnotizing 
 
You got me sleep walking (4x) 
You got me… 
 
Can’t wait for the sunrise 
To wake up and open my eyes 
Somebody pinch me 
So I can erase the 
Spell she has on my life 
Jay snap out the sleepin 
Sip on some coffee 
We’re leaving 
But her love will always 
Keep you asleep 
 
I fall into your lies 
I start to lose my senses 
When I look in your eyes 
I become defenseless 
My heart you hold 
And you won’t let go 
It’s so paralyzing 
under your spell? 
Girl you got control 
You’re so hypnotizing 
 
You got me sleep walking (4x) 
You got me…

Like a Strobe Light Light Light Light x2 
I can't see you babe, 
I feel you, 
Lost in this place till i found you, 
Playin' hard to get, I I know this game, 
Turning me on, 
Switch it off again. 
One moment your gone 
The next you are here 
Like smoke in my arm 
You just disappear 
One moment your here 
Then you flash away 
Let's just start again 
I I want you to stay 
Strobe Light 
Drop in your arms 
Like a strobe light 
See like your doing me wrong 
And if I can get for a second, 
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light 
Drop in your arms 
Like a strobe light light light light x2 
Is this a dream? 
Are you really there? 
A trick of the eye, 
I I, I saw you, I swear, 
One touch not enough, 
Wanna dance with chu all night 
But you keep me n keep me in the half line 
Your running again, 
Like thos in a race, 
Is it love that you want? 
Or just the thrill of the chase, 
One moment your here, 
Then you flash away, 
Let's just start again, 
I I want you to stay, 
Strobe Light, 
Drop in your arms, 
Like a strobe light, 
See like your doing me wrong, 
And if I can get for a second, 
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light, 
Drop in your arms, 
Like a Strobe Light light light light x2 
If the lights were on 
I hold you body 
(If you get this moment) 
Get thing sorted 
(Would you take it off and) 
Immmm 
(Would you take it off) 
Immmm 
(I just want to tell you) 
Immmm 
(Take it off) 
Like a Strobe Light 
(Put your hands up x2) 
Like a Strobe Light 
(Put your hands up x3) 
Strobe Light 
Drop in your arms 
Like a strobe light 
See like your doing me wrong 
And if I can get for a second, 
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light 
Drop in your arms 
Like a strobe light light light light x2 
(Put your hands up x2)

They say think that you can do it 
No crying till it's gone 
They say what if you don't need it 
You had it all along 
They say not enough talking today 
Drinking only hours away 
They say, next time never the same as the first time 
Faded pictures, torn up canvas doesn't mean that you're not priceless 
No one listens, they keep asking, how did it get this way 
They say nothing lasts forever, so I'm leaving for today 
See I listen to what they say and I push your love away 
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho 
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho. 
They say push it to the limit 
It's right and then it's wrong 
Even when you're winning 
Soon you're bout to fall 
Wasn't meant to be done 
Wish you would've had it, had it 
So damn close now, just reach out and grab it 
Faded pictures, torn up canvas doesn't mean that you're not priceless 
No one listens, they keep asking, how did it get this way 
They say nothing lasts forever, so I'm leaving for today 
See I listen to what they say and I push your love away 
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho 
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho.

I listened to them never again

Get jazzy on me 
I'm the flight that you get on, international 
First class seat on my lap girl 
Riding comfortable 
Cause I know what the girl them need 
New York to Haiti 
I got lipstick stamps for my passport 
You make it hard to leave 
Been around the world, don't speak the language 
But your booty dont need explaining 
All I really need to understand is when you 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Talk dirty to me 
Get jazzy on me 
You know the words in my songs 
No habla ingles 
Our conversantion ain't long 
But you know what is 
I know what that girl them want, London to Taiwan 
I got lipstick stamps for my passport 
I think I need a new one 
Been around the world, don't speak the language 
But your booty don't need explaining 
All I really need to understand is when you 
You talk dirty to me

Talk dirty to me 
Uno, met a friend in rio 
Dos, she was all on me oh 
Tres, we can ménage in trio 
Cuatro, oh 
[2 Chainz] 
Dos Cadenas, clothes are genius 
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis 
Get with arenas, guns on deck 
Chest to chest, tongue on neck 
International oral sex 
Every picture I take, I pose a threat 
Boat or jet, what do you expect? 
Her pussy so good 
I bought her a pet 
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it 
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty" 
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it

Guess you're permanent 
Can't be removed

It's like a new tattoo 
Don't need a new tattoo 
One touch always makes me 
Too hard to escape 
Three strikes 
I'm still yours, what am I waiting for? 
I'm running out of room 
For your tattoos 
How can I get over you, over you 
When you're all over me 
So don't tell me it's cool 
That I'm tattooed 
How can I get over you, over you 
When you're all over me 
Yeah, yeah 
Why do we stay 
When only fools would 
I guess we're both fools 
Cause the sex is good 
It's way too good 
Call us crazy, misunderstood

People say I should

That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
Now get on over here, and get up on this bed 
I'm all upon you, now lock me and whip your legs 
Pulled your shirt to the left and kissed that one 
Pulled yout shirt to the right, how did I miss that one 
I really want it, but I love it that you're teasing it 
Once I start I ain't gon' stop until I'm pleasing it 
Almost time to come up out them jeans, you know exactly what I mean 
As we take it from the bed to the floor 
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa 
If you're ready, say you're ready, and you'll see 
First one's coming by the time you count to three 
One, like a teacher you're sending me to the corner 
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an owner 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
One, I can barely calm it down 
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa 
Hey referee I think we're ready for round two 
Stay there, I'll come to you 
Just relax while I analyze your tatoos, tryna see where I'mma put my name on your back boo 
Just when you thought the water park couldn't get no wetter, I'm dripping down a back, like I'm doing it in my sweater 
Rise above the oven, cream on the cupcake, hazelnut flavored, haagen dazs milkshake 
As we take it from the bed to the floor 
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa 
If you're ready, say you're ready, and you'll see 
The second one's coming by the time you count to three 
One, like a teacher you're sending me to the corner 
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an owner 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
One, I can barely calm it down 
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
Nobody-body is listening, let it go 
Cuz I wanna hear you sing, when you sing 
Somebody-body better turn on the radio 
Cuz I wanna hear you sing, baby sing 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh 
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh 
One, like a teacher you're sending me to the corner 
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an owner 
Three, that's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
That's my shhh, that's my shhh, that's my shhh 
One, I can barely calm it down

When we were chillin' 
Smiling in the photo booth 
But we got closer (yeah) 
'Till you were eating off my spoon 
And coming over 
And we would talk all afternoon 
Tonight we'll just get drunk 
Disturb the peace 
Bind your hands all over me 
And then you bite your lip 
Whisper and say, "We're going all the way" 
Tonight, take me to the other side 
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July 
Just take me to the other side 
I see that sexy look in your eyes 
And I know, we ain't friends anymore 
If we walk down this road 
We'll be lovers for sure 
So tonight 
Kiss me like it's do or die 
And take me to the other side 
This could be perfect 
But we won't know unless we try (try) 
I know you're nervous 
So just sit back and let me drive 
Tonight we'll just get drunk

Like a shock to my heart 
When I saw you tonight 
Like a dream come alive 
For the very first time 
When we touch in the dark 
Baby you're blowing my mind 
Wish I could freeze you and me 
In this moment in time 
You got it, but I won't 
Give it up, shorty 
Step it up for me 
And I'll give you everything 
All my life, all my love 
I give you my fortune and fame 
I'll even give you my name 
(Chorus:) 
Girl you take me higher 
Than I've ever been before 
My feet don't touch the floor 
We'll fly 
The sky's the limit 
The sky's the limit 
Girl you take me 
Up up up 
Uuuup up up 
Uuuup up 
Girl you take me up 
Girl you take me higher 
The sky's the limit 
The sky's the limit 
When we dance, when we kiss 
Doesn't get any better than this 
How you shine, trapped in the spotlight 
Finally mine 
Yeahhh 
Baby let's go, let's get out of here 
Baby let go, got nothing to fear 
And now that we're here 
Let's disappear 
Into the night 
You got it, but I won't 
Give it up, shorty 
Step it up for me 
And I'll give you everything 
All my life, all my love 
I give you my fortune and fame 
I'll even give you my name

Girl you take me higher

The sky's the limit 
My feet are on the ceiling 
They don't wanna touch the ground anymore 
Oh what I feel, I can feel it 
Can you feel it 
(feel it, feel it) 
Girl you take me higher 
Than I've ever been before 
My feet don't touch the floor 
We'll fly

Mi wan you just 
Big fat thang, overflowin' 
Skin tight dress, couldn't hold it 
Way too thick like it's swollen 
Girl, you're too bad and you know it 
When you drop down, lose focus 
When that thing clap, that's a bonus 
MM, that cake looking appetizing 
Back pack full, that's a crisis 
Bring that body my way 
Can't take it off my brain 
Look like you do ballet (yeah) 
Hold tight when you tip toe 
Shake something when you tip toe 
No breaks when you push that back 
Left, right, do it just like that 
Hold tight when you tip toe 
Ayo, God bless you from behind and (I do) 
One hand up like the Heisman (touchdown) 
First class seat when ya ridin' (oh yeah) 
Wind that thing like ya spineless 
Bring that body my way (my way) 
Can't take it off my brain (my brain) 
Look like you do ballet 
Hold tight when you tip toe

Hold tight when you tip toe

Left cheek, right cheek 
Left cheek, right cheek 
Left cheek, right cheek 
Left cheek, right cheek (aye, aye)

Chains on, got me lookin' like a disco 
Who that be? And that drop be Mansory (skrrt) 
Who that be? Blowin' gas out the 'Rarri (sk-skrrt) 
French vanilla smooth like a 100 year wine 
Come sneak up from behind, "what's ya name? " 
"What's ya sign? " (huh) 
Wine fa me, darlin' 
"You want to dock in or fly out? " 
Wine fa me, darlin'

Remember love 
Remember you and me 
Remember everything we shared 
On this planet when we cared 
Remember hearts 
Remember unity 
Remember laughing neighbours without expecting favors 
Why be afraid 
To make an honest mistake 
If you acknowledge the pain 
And you wanna change 
You can get through anything 
Do you remember at all 
People walking hand in hand 
Can we feel that love again 
Can you imagine it all 
If we all could get along 
Then we all could sing this song together 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Singing 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Jason derülo 
Look at me 
Look at you 
Now look at me again 
See we’re not so different 
Look around 
Take what you see 
With throwing things outside our window 
We don’t care to keep it clean 
I had a dream 
Beauty was only skin deep 
If we all just believe 
That is all we need 
Nothing else can set you free 
Demi 
Do you remember at all 
People walking hand in hand 
Can we feel that love again 
Can you imagine it all 
If we all could get along 
Then we all could sing this song together 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Singing 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
If we could throw away the hate 
And make love last another day 
Don’t give up just for today 
Life would be so simple

And when they talk about us 
They gon’ never stop us

So I cry 
Cry 
And you don't know why 
Why 
So I wish I could trade hearts with you 
So I can feel the same way you do 
You do 
Hey can you teach me cynical 
I hope it's not too difficult 
Don't tell me I'm incapable 
Cause I wanna scream the way you scream 
I wanna bleed the way you bleed 
But you only get half of me 
So you cry 
Oh yeah you cry 
And I don't know why 
So I wish I could trade hearts with you 
So I can feel the same way you do 
You do 
Cause there's some things you just don't understand 
Like how hard a woman loves a man 
So I wish I could trade hearts with you 
With you 
Touch me 
Till I feel your love on mine 
Oh touch me, love me, now 
Like it's me that's crying 
Touch me

Wish I knew then what I know now 
But I, I can't change the past 
No matter how I try 
So I'mma get up and dance, you know 
'Cause this might be my last chance 
Like there's nobody around, 
Even gravity can't keep me down 
Everybody, get it started 
I'm on top of the world, what a feeling 
I'm undefeated, undefeated, yeah 
No one told me what I could be 
Now I'm walking on air, what a feeling 
I'm undefeated, undefeated, tonight 
Undefeated 
No looking back, can't live that way right now 
Yesterday's gone, I've found my way, somehow 
So, so, so I'mma get up and dance, you know 
'Cause this might be my last chance 
Like there's nobody around, 
Even gravity can't keep me down 
Everybody, get it started 
I'm on top of the world, what a feeling 
I'm undefeated, undefeated, yeah 
No one told me what I could be 
Now I'm walking on air, what a feeling 
I'm undefeated, undefeated, tonight 
So I'll live today like it's my last one 
There's no time for fear, you only live once 
Everybody, get it started 
I'm on top of the world, what a feeling 
Everybody say, 
Yeah, please believe it 
I'm undefeated 
No one told me what I could be 
Now I'm walking on air, what a feeling

What a feeling to be undefeated

Before you get in bed, though, in those heels 
Hey girl, now I know why you waited 
Had to be sure that I was worth the thrill 
Ladies come and go but you got something different 
Had me so addicted from the start 
And I'd never know all this loving 
I'd be missing 
If I didn't work my way into your heart 
You give me a vertigo, vertigo 
The bed, the floor, the kitchen 
Don't really matter long as I get 
Vertigo, vertigo 
I'm tucked, all bottled inside 
You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat 
Tell me that it's cool that I'm stuck on you 
Like your birthday suit 
You give me a vertigo, that vertigo 
The way that you please me sets this room on fire 
I'm burning with desire in this bed 
So if I'm dreaming please don't wake me up 
If all of this is happening in my head 
Waited for so long 
But what you got is different 
Had me so addicted from the start 
Boy, I'd never know all the shit 
That I was missing 
If I hadn't worked my way into your heart 
You give me vertigo, vertigo

You give me a vertigo, that vertigo 
I'm working downtown 
You're all in my head 
This love that we found 
We'll never regret 
We're empty inside 
I'm filling you up with our vertigo 
You're waking me up 
To nothing to say 
Right here in this bed 
We stay here all day 
And my head be spinning 
You do matter with that vertigo 
You give me vertigo, vertigo 
The bed, the floor, the kitchen 
Don't really matter long as I get

I got these sheets on the floor 
Nothing on me 
And I can't take it no more 
It's a hundred degrees 
I got one foot out the door 
Where are my keys 
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah 
In the back of the cab 
I tip the driver ahead of time 
Get me there fast 
I got your body on my mind 
I want it bad 
Oh just the thought of you 
Gets me so high 
So high 
Girl, you're the one 
I want to want me 
And if you want, then girl you got me 
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do 
(I wouldn't do) 
Just to get up next to you 
Girl, you're the one 
I want you to want me 
And if you want me girl you got me 
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do 
(I wouldn't do) 
Just to get up next to you 
Just to get up next to you 
You open the door 
Wearing nothing but a smile 
Fell to the floor 
And you whisper in my ear 
"Baby I'm yours" 
Oh, just the thought of you gets me so high 
So high (so high) 
Girl, you're the one

Gotta be where you are, are babe 
Girl together we'll be losing track of time 
Baby ain't no need to rush we got all night 
Seeing sparks up in this club 
By the time the sun comes up 
You gon' swear you're in love 
Just meet me on the floor the time is now 
You're looking so right, under these lights 
And girl if you get lost ignore the crowd 
The feeling can go go as long as you like 
Cause we own the night, night-ight-ight

Treat you like a star, lights, camera, action 
And we can take it further whenever you say 
Just say the word 
Girl together we'll be losing track of time

Future with a dog named Red 
Buy a house with a fireplace 
This is the first I've seen your face 
But there's a chance we are soul mates 
I know that this might sound crazy 
'Cause you don't know my name 
But we can't, we can't tell the future, no 
But that's just the beauty of the world we know 
So I'ma say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if? 
We all can say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du, baby, what if? 
What if? What if? What if? 
What if? What if? What if? 
Yeah, picture me on one knee 
With the perfect diamond ring 
We just met but if you said yes 
We'd have our wedding on the beach 
It could happen, raise three kids 
And we grow old oh, so happily 
I know this may sound crazy 
'Cause I don't know your name 
But we can't, we can't tell the future, no

Don't know what tomorrow brings

Oh, and what if I had you and what if you had me 
And, baby, what's the reason we can't fall in love? 
What if? What if? What if?

You know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

Patty cake, oatty cake 
With no hands 
Got me in this club making wedding plans 
If I take pictures while you do your dance 
I can make you famous on Instagram 
Hot damn it 
Your booty like two planets 
Go head, and go ham sandwich 
Whoa 
I can't stand it 
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Just a little bit of 
Cadillac, cadillac, pop that trunk 
Let's take a shot 
Alley oops that dunk 
Tired of working that 9 to 5 
Oh baby let me come and change your life 
Hot damn it 
Your booty like two planets 
Go head, and go ham sandwich 
Whoa

'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

Shake what your mama gave you 
Misbehave you 
I just wanna strip you, dip you 
Flip you, bubble bathe you 
What they do 
Taste my rain drops, Ok boo 
Now what you will, what you want, what you may do 
Completely separated, til my deeply penetrated 
Then I take I out, and wipe it off 
Eat it, ate it, love it, hate it 
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been king 
You wiggle, wiggle for the D, O, double G, again? 
Come on baby 
Turn around 
(turn around, turn around) 
You're a star girl 
Take a bow 
(take a bow, take a bow) 
It's just one thing that's killing me 
How you get that in them jeans? 
You know what to do with that big fat butt 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
Love, love with my ex 
I know you can’t stand me 
And when you’re angry 
Something about that just turns me on 
You’re such a diva ,tought I didn’t need ya 
But when you’re close it’s the same old song 
I’m all over you, you’re all over me 
I hate that you love me so good, so good, so good 
I can’t live with or without you, I’m hooked, I’m hooked 
Baby’s so unusual, so unusual 
How you want it, you want it 
All the feel is mutual, is so mutual 
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
Love with my ex 
I see other people, just to be evil 
It hurts to watch you do the same thing 
But from a distance, girl I was missing 
That you would come back like a boomerang and 
I’m all over you, you’re all over me 
I hate that you love me so good, so good, so good 
I can’t live with or without you, I’m hooked, I’m hooked 
Baby’s so unusual, so unusual 
How you want it, you want it 
All the feel is mutual, is so mutual 
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
Love with my ex 
Love , love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
It’s got me thinking about we broken up, broken up baby 
I still wanna lay you down, lay you down 
We may be the perfect match … 
Don’t wanna leave right now, leave right now 
Cause 
I’m all over you, you’re all over me 
Baby’s so unusual, so unusual 
How you want it, you want it 
All the feel is mutual, is so mutual 
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex 
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex

Wave to my ex and you baby 
I've gotta thank, gotta thank 
That man that didn't know what he had (know what he had) 
And I got a thing for that brain 
That made you happy making him mad (making him mad) 
Well he dropped a dime 
I came up behind and I picked it up, picked it up 
That look on his face 
When he sees the way 
That you switched it up, switched it up 
Your heart was broken back then 
And I was perfect revenge 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
And it was okay with me, but I hope things to see 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
But you sleeping next to me now 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
Now you getting the best of me now 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
I wish my ex all the best 
But I hope she see my with my new new (with my new new) 
We'll be dancing like we're sexing 
I'd be lying if I said we ain't got nothing to approve 
Well he dropped a dime 
I came up behind and I picked it up, picked it up 
That look on his face 
When he sees the way 
That you switched it up, switched it up 
Your heart was broken back then 
And I was perfect revenge 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
And it was okay with me, but I hope things to see 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
But you sleeping next to me now 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
Now you getting the best of me now 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
I upgraded, Dolce purses and them clothes 
Take my credit card and go 
Just payback, payback, we'll call it payback, payback 
Upgraded, drink champagne 
Like it's too cold, payback can be icy cold 
Payback, payback, we'll call it payback, payback 
Your heart was broken back then 
And I was perfect revenge 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
And it was okay with me, but I hope things to see 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
But you sleeping next to me now 
You say, I just want my ex to see you 
Started as a sexy rebound 
Now you getting the best of me now 
I say, I just want my ex to see you 
Slow it down on them 
I just want my ex to see, to see you baby, but first 
Take me from the bullshit, fly me from the pain 
Somewhere between fantasy and my dreams 
When I hit the bottom, you changed everything 
Better believe that you saved me 
Baby your angel wings 
Fly somewhere where there is means 
Baby your angel wings, girl I just want my ex to see you 
I just want my ex to see you baby 
Going back, back, ain't going going back no [repeat]</field>

Shawty I'm an animal, slowly digging indios 
Spread you like a bad story 
Turn you to a criminal; let me see you cock it back 
Bang bang bang on it 
Til the head board break 
Make me think that I wanna put a ring on you 
But first I'll make you sign for me 
And all the ladies say 
I wanna ride 
I wanna ride 
Up and down like a zipper 
Zipper, zipper, zipper 
Up and down like a zipper 
Zipper, zipper, zipper 
I could be sweet, lady 
Or eat it like a cannibal 
Go places that you may can't go 
In my back seat baby 
You're smoking like some good good 
Once I hit that good good 
Make me beg beg for it 
Mama touch you well 
Cause it ain't about booty but the brain baby 
Now let me hear you sing for me 
And all the ladies say 
I wanna ride 
I wanna ride 
Up and down like a zipper 
Zipper, zipper, zipper 
Up and down like a zipper 
Zipper, zipper, zipper 
She like wearing my snap backs 
She got that snap back 
So If I ever wanna leave 
I'll be right back 
Ooh girl 
I need it 
Ooh girl 
Got me feaning 
You a 'go' girl 
I never go girl 
Cause when you surfing in my bed 
I'll be like go girl 
Ooh girl 
I need it 
Ooh girl 
Got me feaning 
I wanna ride 
I wanna ride 
Up and down like a zipper 
Zipper, zipper, zipper 
Up and down like a zipper

Ooh (yeah) 
Everyone knows all about my direction 
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there 
Still I don't go there 
Everybody says "say something" 
Say something, say something 
Then say something, say something, 
then say something 
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it 
But I can't help myself, no 
I can't help myself, no, no 
Caught up in the middle of it 
No I can't help myself 
No I can't help myself, no, no, no 
Caught up in the rhythm of it 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
(maybe I'm looking something that I can't have) 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Everyone knows all about my transgressions 
Still in my heart somewhere 
there's melody and harmony 
For you and me, tonight (whoa) 
I hear them call my name 
Everybody says "say something" 
Then say something, say something 
Then say something, say something 
then say something 
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it 
But I can't get help myself, no 
I can't help myself, no, no 
Caught up in the middle of it 
No I can't help myself 
no I can't help myself, no, no, no 
Caught up in the rhythm of it 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something 
is to say nothing at all 
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something 
is to say nothing at all 
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something 
is to say nothing 
But I can't help myself 
No I can't help myself, no, no 
Caught up in the middle of it 
No I can't help myself 
No I can't help myself, no, no, no 
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have

Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror 
And I can't help but notice 
You reflect in this heart of mine 
If you ever feel alone and 
The glare makes me hard to find 
Just know that I'm always 
Parallel on the other side 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
Aren't you somethin', an original 
Cause it doesn't seem really as simple 
And I can't help but stare, cause 
I see truth somewhere in your eyes 
I can't ever change without you 
You reflect me, I love that about you 
And if I could, I 
Would look at us all the time 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
Yesterday is history 
And tomorrow's a mystery 
I can see you lookin' back at me 
Keep your eyes on me 
Keep your eyes on me 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
Baby, you're the inspiration for this precious song 
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on 
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone 
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home 
Just to let you know, you are 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you 
My reflection, in everything I do 
You're my reflection and all I see is you 
My reflection, in everything I do 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life

It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on 
All through my city, all through my home 
We're flying up, no ceiling 
when we in our zone 
I got that sunshine in my pocket 
Got that good song in my feet 
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it 
Moving so phenomenally 
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop 
Under the lights when everything goes 
Nowhere to hide 
when I'm getting you close 
When we move, well, you already know 
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine 
Nothing I can see but you 
when you dance, dance, dance 
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you 
So just dance, dance, dance, come on 
All those things I shouldn't do 
But you dance, dance, dance 
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing 
I can't stop the feeling 
So just dance, dance, dance 
I can't stop the feeling 
So just dance, dance, dance, come on 
Ooh, it's something magical 
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on 
I don't need no reason, don't need control 
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone 
Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket 
Got that good song in my feet 
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it 
moving so phenomenally 
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Wanna see you move your body

Got this feeling in my body 
Break it down

Is he everything you wanted in a man? 
You know I gave you the world 
You had me in the palm of your hand 
So why your love went away 
I just can't seem to understand 
Thought it was me and you, baby 
Me and you until the end 
But I guess I was wrong 
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it 
I'm just so sick about it 
I can't believe it's ending this way 
Just so confused about it 
Feeling the blues about it 
I just can't do without ya 
Tell me is this fair 
Is this the way it's really going down? 
Is this how we say goodbye? 
Should've known better when you came around 
That you were gonna make me cry 
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around 
Cause I know that you're living a lie 
But that's ok, baby, cause in time you will find 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
Now Girl 
I remember everything that you claimed 
You said that you were moving on now 
(on now) 
Maybe I should do the same 
(maybe I should do the same) 
The funny thing about that is 
I was ready to give you my name 
Thought it was me and you baby 
And now, it's all just a shame 
That I guess I was wrong 
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it 
I'm just so sick about it 
I can't believe it's ending this way

What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
(let me paint this picture for ya, baby) 
You spend your nights alone 
And he never comes home 
And everytime you call him, all you get is a busy tone 
I heard you found out 
That he's doing to you 
What you did to me 
Ain't that the way it goes 
When you cheated, girl 
My heart bleeded, girl 
So it go without saying that should let the feeling hurt 
Just a classic case scenario 
Tell it is always time 
Girl, you got what you deserved 
And now you want somebody 
To cure the lonely nights 
You wish you had somebody 
That could come and make it right 
But girl, I ain't somebody 
I'm out of sympathy 
See 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
Take it to em, J 
See 
You shoulda listened to me, baby 
Take it to em, J 
Because

If I told you you were beautiful 
Would you date me on the regular 
(Tell me, would you?) 
Well, baby I've been around the world 
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you) 
This ring here represents my heart 
But there's just one thing I need from you (say "I do") 
Yeah, because 
I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside 
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
You could be my baby, 
let me make you my lady

Ain't gotta do nothing crazy

And made you smile with every word I wrote

(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love 
Ooooh, girl 
My love 
My love 
Shorty, cool as a fan 
On the new once again 
Still has fan from Peru to Japan 
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan 
If you got a man, try to lose him if you can 
Cause the girls real wild throw their hands up high 
Wanna come kick it with a stand up guy 
You don't really wanna let the chance go by 
Because you ain't been seen wit a man so fly 
Friend so fly I can go fly 
Private, cause I handle mine 
Call me candle guy, simply because I am on fire 
I hate to have to cancel my vacation 
so you can't deny 
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try 
You don't come, I ain't gonna die 
Hold up, what you mean, 
you can't go why? 
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie 
You say you wanna kick it with an ace so high 
Baby, you decide that I ain't your guy 
Ain't gon lie, Me in your space 
But forget your face, I swear I will 
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill 
Just bring wit me a pair, I will 
I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside 
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
You could be my baby, 
let me make you my lady 
Girl, you amaze me 
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy 
See, all I want you to do is be my love 
(Love) My love 
(Love) My love 
(Love) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love 
(Love) My love 
(Love) My love

Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

You were my earth 
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no 
So you took a chance 
And made other plans 
But I bet you didn't think 
that they would come crashing down 
No 
You don't have to say, what you did, 
I already know, I found out from him, 
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, 
there'll never be 
And don't it make you sad about it? 
You told me you loved me 
Why did you leave me all alone? 
Now you tell me you need me 
When you call me on the phone 
But girl I refuse, you must have me confused 
With some other guy 
Bridges are burned, now it's your turn to cry 
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river girl 
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river girl (yeah, yeah) 
I know that they say 
That some things are better left unsaid 
But it wasn't like you only talked to him 
and you know it 
(Don't act like you don't know it) 
All of these things people told me 
Keep messin' with my head 
(Messin' with my head) 
You should've picked honesty 
Then you may not have blown it 
(Yeah..) 
You don't have to say, what you did,

Let me show you a few things

Wait a minute 
You ready, Jt? 
I can't wait til I get you on the floor, good-looking 
Going hot so hot, just like an oven 
And oww, burned myself, but just had to touch it 
But it's so fire and it's all mine 
Hey baby 
We don't mind all the watching 
Cause if they study close, real close 
They might learn something 
She ain't nothing but a little doozie when she does it 
She's so fire tonight 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines 
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white 
And you dressed in that dress I like 
Love is swinging in the air tonight 
Let me show you a few things 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
Now we're in the swing of love 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
Hey 
Stop 
Let me get a good look at it 
So thick 
Now I know why they call it a fatty 
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit 
But that's alright, cause you're all mine 
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy 
I guess they're just mad cause girl 
They wish they had it 
My killer, my thiller 
Yeah you're a classic 
And you're all mine tonight 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight

Hey 
Hey, get out your seat, Hov 
All black at the white shows 
White shoes at the black shows 
Green card for the Cuban links 
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show 
Nothing exceeds like excess 
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best 
Is this what it's all about? 
I'm at the restaurant 
My rant disturbing the guests 
Years of distress, tears on the dress 
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex 
This is truffle season 
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason 
All saints for my angel 
Alexander Wang too 
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks 
I'll show you how to do this young! 
No papers, catch vapors 
Get high, out Vegas 
D'Usses on doubles ain't looking for trouble 
You just got good jeans so a nigga tryna cuff you 
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you 
Tell your father we go farther as a couple 
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son 
I show you how to do this, hun! 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines 
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white 
And you're dressed in that dress I like 
Love is swinging in the air tonight 
Let me show you a few things 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love

Shining through 
I see your true colors 
And that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show

True colors are beautiful 
I see your true colors

Saw you switchin' lanes girl 
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right 
Come let me get your name girl 
Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like 
Let me pick your brain girl 
And tell me how they got 
that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl 
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out 
Bet you we could have some fun girl 
'Cause we can do it fast (fast), 
slow, whichever way you wanna run girl 
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings 
Do it how you want it done girl 
And who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I 
I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
Come on and lemme show you 'round 
Let me take you out, bet you we could have some fun girl 
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down 
Any way you want it done girl 
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone 
Rappin' 'til we see the sun girl 
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you that I'm the one girl 
Well I'mma freak you right, each and every night 
I know how to do it insane girl 
'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop 
Make you wanna say my name girl 
Come on baby please 'cause I'm on my knees 
Can't get you off my brain girl 
But who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I 
I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
The summer's over for the both of us 
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love 
You're the one I've been thinking of 
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one 
Oh!I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see

Dance with me 
I wanna rock your body 
Please stay

Got time, but I don't mind 
Just wanna rock you girl

Come on, just give it up girl 
See I've been watching you 
I like the way you move 
So go ahead, girl, just do 
That ass shaking thing you do 
So you grab your girls 
And you grab a couple more 
And you all come meet me 
In the middle of the floor 
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right 
So you blast to the left and you sail to the right 
Don't be so quick to walk away 
Dance with me 
I wanna rock your body 
Please stay 
Dance with me 
You don't have to admit you wanna play 
Dance with me

Just wanna rock you girl 
Make a move, but be calm 
Let's go, let's give it up girl 
See it appears to me 
You like the way I move

Pull you close and share my groove 
So you grab your girls

But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are 
So tonight, if I take it too far 
that's okay because you know 
I hear the making up's fun 
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe 
So if you see another side of me 
that's okay because you know 
I hear the making up's fun 
But then your hands talking 
fingers walking down your legs 
Hey, there's the faucet 
Someone's knocking like they know 
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching 
Your hand slides down the light 
And girl you know 
I brag about you to anyone outside 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime 
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine 
here we go 
And do it twice 'cause you know we like it 
And damn anybody if they disagree 
They don't understand you're just like me 
they don't know 
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it 
But then your hands talking, fingers walking 
down your legs 
Hey, there's the faucet 
Someone's knocking like they know 
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching 
Your hand slides down the light (light, light) 
And girl you know 
I brag about you to anyone outside 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
How do I ever explain what I've got with you? 
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth 
And nobody ever will understand what we do 
There's only one me and you 
Come here, hold me 
'Cause there's only one me and you 
Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh 
There's only one me and you 
You know there's only one me and you 
I brag about you to anyone outside 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I wrote this to let you know 
And I let them feelings show 
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride 
Ooh, I can't make them understand 
But you know I'm a Southern man 
A man of the woods and you're my pride 
Ohh, hey, hey 
A man of the woods, it's my pride

She's freaky and I like it 
Listen 
She grabs the yellow bottle 
She likes the way it hits her lips 
She gets to the bottom 
It sends her on a trip so right 
She might be goin' home with me tonight 
She looks like a model 
Except she's got a little more ass 
Don't even bother 
Unless you've got that thing she likes 
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight 
[chorus] 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
She's freaky and she knows it 
She's freaky, but I like it 
She shuts the room down 
The way she walks and causes a fuss 
The baddest in town 
She's flawless like some uncut ice 
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight 
And all she wants is to dance 
That's why you'll find her on the floor 
But you don't have a chance 
Unless you move the way that she likes 
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned from everywhere 
She's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Now dance 
Little girl 
You're freaky, but I like it 
Hot damn! 
Let me put my funk on this one time 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows

I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Think that she knows, oh, oh 
And now I walk around without a care 
She's got me hooked 
It just ain't fair, but I... 
I'm love stoned and I could swear

And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night 
Look, I can't even get out of bed 
With the thoughts you putting in my head 
So I say to myself, "I don't even want to try" 
Here, every part of me is paralyzed

Laying here in the morning light 
And all I want to do is hold you tight just one more night 
Yes I'm in love with you 
Laying here in the morning light 
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night 
I know I got somewhere to go 
But I'm thinking we should lay here in love (lay here in love) 
Ooh, 'cause baby, it's no lie 
Ooh, I could watch you 'til the day I die

Ay, 
Lemme kick it to you right quick man 
Not on some gangsta shit man 
On some real shit 
Anybody who been through the same thing 
I'm sure you feel the same way 
(Justin Timberlake) 
Oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
And oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
Ever had one of them days wish you would 
Have stayed home 
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' their hate on 
You walk by, they get wrong 
You reply then shit get blown 
Way out of proportion 
Way past discussion 
Just you against them, pick one then rush them 
Figure you get jumped here that's next 
They don't wanna stop there now they bustin' 
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' 
You to the hospital with a bad concussion 
Plus you hit four times 
But it hit yo spine 
Paralyzed waist down 
And ya wheelchair bound 
Never mind that now you lucky to be alive 
Just thinkin' it all started fussin' wit three guys 
Nigga pride in the way 
But your pride is the way you can fuck 
Around get shot down any day 
Niggas die everyday 
All little bullshit 
Dope money, dice games, ordinary hood shit 
Could this be cuz of hip-hop music 
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it? 
Usually niggas don't know what to do 
When they back against the wall 
So they just start shootin' 
For red or for blue or for blow I guess 
From Bankhead at the old projects 
No more stress, now I'm straight 
Now I get it, now I take time to think 
Before I make mistakes just for my family sake 
That part of me left yesterday 
The heart of me is strong today 
No regrets I'm blessed to say 
The old me dead and gone away 
(Justin Timberlake) 
Oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone

And oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
I ain't neva been scared, I live through tragic 
Situations could been dead lookin' back at it 
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen 
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin' 
In the apartments hangin' 
Smokin' and rappin' 
Niggas start shit next thing we know 
We cappin' 
Get locked up then didn't even get mad 
Now I think about that what a life I had 
Most of that shit look back just laugh 
Some shit still look back get sad 
Thinkin' my home boy still be around 
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time 
I won that fight I lost that war 
I could still see my nigga walkin' out that door 
Who would of thought I'd never see Philant no more 
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more 
Cuz a nigga his jump cost me more 
I'd a took that ass whoopin' out for sure 
Now think before I risk my life 
Take them chances to get my stripes 
A nigga put his hands on me alright 
Otherwise stand there talk 
Shit all night 
Cuz I hit you and you sue me 
I shoot you get locked up poor me 
No more stress now I'm straight 
Now I get it now I take time to think 
Before I make mistakes just for my family sake 
That part of me left yesterday 
The heart of me is strong today 
No regrets I'm blessed to say

I turn my head to the west, still nobody in sight 
So I turn my head to the north 
Swallow that pill that they call pride

If you know what's good 
(If you know what's good) 
Haters gon' say it's fake 
So real 
Haters gon' say it's fake 
So real 
Put your filthy hands all over me 
And no, this ain't the clean version 
And what you gonna do with all that meat? 
Cookin' up a mean servin' 
No question, I want it 
Fire up, everybody smokin' 
Your friends, my friends 
And they ain't leavin' till six in the morning (six in the morning) 
Caught a chill, baby, you the coldest 
Go far, put 'em on notice 
If you know what I want, then yeah 
Baby, don't you mind if I do, yeah 
Exactly what you like times two, yeah 
Got me singin', "ooh, ooh" 
So baby, don't you mind if I do 
Got time, but I don't mind 
Just wanna rock you girl 
I'll have what ever you have 
Come on, just give it up girl 
See I've been watching you 
I like the way you move 
So go ahead, girl, just do 
That ass shaking thing you do 
So you grab your girls 
And you grab a couple more 
And you all come meet me 
In the middle of the floor 
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right 
So you blast to the left and you sail to the right 
Don't be so quick to walk away 
Dance with me 
I wanna rock your body 
Please stay 
Dance with me 
You don't have to admit you wanna play 
Dance with me 
Just let me rock you 
Till the break of day 
Now, all my ladies say 
Talk to me boy 
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm 
Talk to me boy 
I can't wait to have you in my arms 
Talk to me boy 
Hurry up cause you're taking too long 
Talk to me boy 
Hold on, stop 
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to intruduce to you 
The Tenessee Kids and it goes like 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you 
I'm bringin' sexy back 
Them other boys don't know how to act! 
I think it's special what's behind your back 
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack! 
(Take em' to the bridge!) 
Dirty babe 
You see these shackles? Baby I'm your slave 
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave! 
It's just that no one makes me feel this way 
Let me hear you sing the chorus! C'mon! 
Come here girl! 
(Go 'head be gone with it!) 
Come to the back

I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside 
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
You could be my baby 
let me make you my lady 
Girl, you amaze me 
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy 
See, all I want you to do is be my love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love 
You don't have to say, what you did 
I already know, I found out from him 
Now there's just no chance, for you and me 
there'll never be 
And don't it make you sad about it? 
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river, oh 
Cry me a river, oh 
Cry me a river, oh 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines 
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white 
And you dressed in that dress I like 
Love is swinging in the air tonight 
Let me show you a few things 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
I woke up this morning 
And heard the TV saying something 
About disaster in the world 
It made me wonder where I'm going 
There's so much darkness in the world 
But I see beauty left in you girl 
And what you give me lets me know that I'll be alright 
Cause if your love was all I had in this life 
Well that would be enough until the end of time 
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind 
Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time 
I'm not a woman 
I'm not a man 
I am something that you'll never understand 
I'll never beat you 
I'll never lie 
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by 
Cause you, I would die for you, yeah 
Darlin', if you want me too 
You, I would die for you 
You're just a sinner I am told 
Be your fire when you're cold 
Make you happy when you're sad 
Make you good when you are bad 
I'm not a human, I am a dove 
I'm your conscience, I am love 
All I really need is to know that you believe (Yeah) 
I would die for you 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
I got this feeling inside my bones 
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on 
All through my city, all through my home 
We're flying up, no ceiling 
when we in our zone 
I got that sunshine in my pocket 
Got that good song in my feet 
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it 
Moving so phenomenally 
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop 
Under the lights when everything goes 
Nowhere to hide 
when I'm getting you close 
When we move, well, you already know 
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine 
I can't stop the feeling 
Nothing I can see but you 
when you dance, dance, dance 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you 
So just dance, dance, dance, come on 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
All those things I should do to you 
But you dance, dance, dance 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing 
Put your hands up 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Got this feeling in my body 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Got this feeling in my body 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Wanna see you move your body 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Got this feeling in my body, come on</field>

And I let you 
You steal the food right out of my mouth 
And I watch you eat it 
I still don't know why, 
Why our love is so much (Oh) 
You curse my name 
In spite to put me to shame 
Air all my laundry in the streets 
Dirty or clean 
Give it up for fame 
But I still don't know why, 
Why I love it so much (Yeah) 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there, 
one day you care, You're so unfair 
sipping from the cuptill it runneth over 
holy grail 
Blue told me to remind you niggas 
Fuck that shit y'all talk about 
I'm the nigga, caught up in all these lights and cameras 
But look what that shit did to Hammer 
God, dammit I like it 
The bright lights is enticing 
But look what it did to Tyson 
All that money in one night 
30 mill for one fight 
But soon as all the money blows, 
all the pigeons take flight 
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me 
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice 
That's my bad, I can't even blame her for that 
Enough to make me wanna murder, Momma please just get my bail 
I know nobody to blame 
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself 
And we all just entertainers 
And we're stupid, and contagious 
And we all just entertainers 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there, 
one day you care, You're so unfair 
sipping from the cuptill it runneth over 
holy grail 
Now I got tattoos on my body 
Psycho bitches in my lobby 
I got haters in the paper 
Photo shoots with paparazzi 
Can't even take my daughter for a walk 
See them by the corner store 
I feel like I'm cornered off 
Enough is enough 
I'm calling this off 
Who the fuck I'm kidding though? 
I'm getting high 
Sitting low 
Sliding by In that big body 
Curtains all in my window 
This fame hurt 
But this chain works 
I think back You asked the same person 
If this is all you had to deal with 
Nigga deal with 
It, this shit ain't work 
This light work 
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt 
Niggas dying back where I was birthed 
Fuck your iris and Irs 
Get the hell up off of your high horse 
You got the shit that niggas die for 
Dry yours 
Why you mad 
Take the good with the bad 
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water 
You're still alive 
Still that nigga 
Niggas you survived 
You still getting bigger nigga 
Living the life 
Vanilla wafers 
In a villa 
Illest nigga alive 
Michael Jackson thriller 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there, 
one day you care, You're so unfair 
sipping from the cuptill it runneth over

You get the air around my lungs whenever you need it 
And you take the blade right out of my heart, 
Just so you can watch me bleed 
And I sill don't know why, 
why I love you so much 
Yeah, and you play this game inspite to drive me insane 
I have a tattootd on my sleeve 
Forever in ink with guess whos name, but I sill don't no why,

Have you lustin' for her, go crazy face it 
Now don't stop, get it, get it 
The way she shakin' make you want to hit it 
Think she double jointed 
From the way she splitted 
Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it 
She's so much more than you're used to 
She know's just how to move to seduce you 
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot 
Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop 
She always ready, when you want it she want it

On the late night, till daylight the club jumpin' 
If you want a good time, she gone give you what you want

The way she make it shake, the way she make it pop 
Make it rain for us so she don't stop 
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch 
In her fantasy, there's plain to see 
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking 
All into my set sheets 
When she ready to ride 
I'm ready to roll 
I'll be in this bitch till the club close 
What should I do, one thing on all fours 
Now that that shit should be against the law 
From side to side, let the ride, break it down (down down) 
You know I like 
When you hike and you throw it all around 
Different style, different move 
Damn I like the way you move 
Girl you got me thinking about 
All the things I do to you 
Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions 
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

Listen 
I kinda noticed something weren't right 
When you got a frown face 
It's kind of weird to me 
Since you're so fine 
If it's up to me your face will change...... 
If you smiling, that should set the tone 
Just be limber 
And If you let go, the music should move your bones 
Just remember 
Sing this song with me 
Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you 
You will know the difference when I touch you 
People are so phony 
Nosy cause they're lonely 
Aren't you sick of the same thing? 
They say so and so was dating 
Love you or they're hating 
When it doesn't matter anyway 
Cause we're here tonight 
If you smiling, that should set the tone 
Just be limber baby 
And If you let go, the music should move your bones 
Baby just remember 
Sing this song with me 
Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you 
You will know the difference when I touch you 
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy 
I could change your life 
If you give me the chance 
To be your man 
I won't let you down baby 
If you give me the chance 
To be your man 
Here baby, put on my jacket 
And then ... 
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Girl 
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby) 
Girl ... 
[Rap] 
Ma, what you wanna do? 
I'm in front of you 
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two 
Or me and you put on a stage show 
And the mall kids, that's how to change low 
From them you heard "wow, it's the same glow" 
Look at me, I say "yeah, it's the same dough" 
We the same type, you my air of life 
You have me sleeping in the same bed, every night 
Go rock with me, you deserve the best 
Take a few shots 
Let it burn in your chest 
We could ride down 
Pumping N.E.R.D 
in the deck 
Funny how a few words turn into sex 
Play this free, joint called "brain" 
(I just love your, Brain) 
Ma, take a hint 
Make me suerve in the lane 
The name Malicious 
And I burn every track 
Clipse and J 
Timberlake 
Now how heavy is that? 
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Girl 
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby) 
Girl ... 
Ain't nobody love you like I love you

You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
(Trust ya like I do) 
Late at night, I talk to you 
(Hey) 
You will know the difference when... 
Break this down 
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a 
Little boy 
I never thought it would end up this way, Drums 
(Hey) 
It's kind of special right? yeah 
You know, you think about it 
Sometimes people, just destined 
Destined to do what they do 
And that's what it is

I've been a fool 
In so many ways

Take back those things I've done

If you would let me start all over again 
I'm not a saint 
I'm just a man 
Who had heaven and earth in the palm of his hand 
But I threw it away 
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness 
And if you could just

Summertime in the city 
And everybody's having sex 
You know I just got a page from a girl 
That I met last week at the Payless 
Shoe stores 
I also have a cutie to call 
Who likes the way I knock on her boots 
Well let's help them back 
Let's handle that 
In two-to-six hours 
We'll meet back here and regroup 
Now let's shoop 
Roll up to her crib with some Bartles and Jaymes 
Hop off the bus with the Alizé 
Now hold up player, whatchu diggity-doing here? 
I should diggity-ask you the same 
And she sang 
"Hey, boys I want you both 
I hope that you think that's cool 
(say word?) 
I know most guys will freak together 
She forgot about the golden rule - a huh huh" 
It's ok when it's in a three-way 
It's not gay when it's in a three-way 
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway 
The area's grey in a one, two, three-way 
Normally, I don't get down with dudes 
But tonight is a special exception (great) 
See you're my best friend 
Through thick and thin 
Now it's time to make a triple connection 
Lights off 
Here in the dark (here in the dark) 
It's so hard to tell (so hard to tell) 
Where her body ends (la la) 
And my homie's begins (ew wee) 
This rule dates back (the golden rule) 
To ancient Greece (takin' about Cesar) 
We're two jack trippers and a Chrissy 
The new three's company 
It's ok when it's in a three-way 
It's not gay when it's in a three-way 
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway 
The area's grey in a one, two three-way 
Fellas 
Get ready 
To impress a chick 
Helicopter d*ck, go! 
Hellicopter d*ck 
Helicopter d*ck 
To impress a chick 
Helicopter d*ck 
And all of that was ok 
'cuz it was in a three-way 
It's quite clear when you see the instant replay 
Maybe two is enough 
That's what they'll say 
But we'll say, "hell no" 
It's a one, two, three-way 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</field>

I know you're sleepin' 
But Daddy's home now 
Pictures getting old 
My little girl lookin' grown now 
Your mom said you're talkin' on your own now 
Walkin' on your own now 
Runnin' across the kitchen floor 
Hidin' them baby dolls I sent you from on tour 
And I missed you when I was tourin' 
Smiling at them baby pictures 
So happy, tears pourin' 
God, how could something so beautiful come from me 
After the gunshots, thought you was done with me 
But I know why I'm livin' now 
Why you made me put the guns down 
Pick up the mic, start rappin' for a livin' now 
My sun, my moon, my stars, my Earth, my wind, my fire, my life, my baby 
Tryin' to make your moms wifey but she crazy 
Fussin' me, fightin' me 
I know she love me cuz you look just like me 
The day you came into this world, I was so excited 
Eleven twenty-one double zero 
My baby girl is here

And the first time I heard your voice 
I prayed to God it had to be true 
Got a son now 
Cuttin' the game, stoppin' the bullshit 
Remember arm your enemy 
Then you pull quick 
Dipped out Cali 
Came back snatched my son 
My girl's moms and I moved out Maui 
Yeah yeah Pops gone bananas 
See why I win her 
Bigger house, wider yard, Navi with the crash bar 
Pumpin' her, shifty you stupid 
You ain't no dad, nigga 
Takin' your black ass to court for all you have nigga 
You see me and your moms that's another topic 
Ain't no whip in this world with a price that you can't cop it 
Stop it 
Impress with wine, you didn't hear me right 
It's a lesson to this song, I'm trying to steer you right 
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home 
Never sing that sad song

I'mma let your mom school you 
Don't let the streets fool you 
Streets straight through you 
That's why I'm talking to you 
You see these niggas out here have you stressin' by the hour 
Never turn your back on your foes 
Them dudes cowards 
Some days sweet and some sour 
But we gon' make it together 
The world is ours and you're my flower 
If it's ice, you can get that 
Model chicks, hit that 
Never stress about the downfall 
Just? bout to get back 
And I'm not saying sex is wrong 
Just make sure you strap a condom on 
And never ever do it in your mother's home 
Never call a girl a bitch 
Show respect son 
Pop your collar 
Ain't nothing free 
Scrape the block for every dollar 
I'm gonna leave you with this my little angel 
Daddy loves you 
How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you 
Switchin' handles like you breakin' the zone 
Candy paint and power 
On the golden bridge, bouncin' on chrome

I got your picture hangin' on the wall 
It can't sing or come to me 
When I call your name 
I realize it's just a picture in a frame 
I read your letters when you're not near 
But they don't move me 
And they don't groove me like when I hear 
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear 
Don't you know 
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby 
Ain't nothing like the real thing 
I play the game, a fantasy 
I pretend but I'm not in reality 
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me 
No other sound is quite the same as your name 
No touch can do half as much 
to make me feel better 
So let's stay together 
I got your memories hanging on my wall 
But they don't move me 
And they don't groove me like when I hear 
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear 
So glad we got the real thing, baby 
So glad we got the real thing

I don't, but she thinks I know her 
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes 
That was my type, amnesia, that's over 
I can see your breathing, girl, is colder 
I can see you need me but I don't care 
My whole memory of me and love 
Gone so far from me, girl 
It's not fair 
I could feel it almost start to change 
(Almost starts to change) 
But then it hurts too much 
That's when it starts to fade 
So cold baby, now I'm going crazy 
I don't know why you need me alone 
If it was true, if it was you 
Don't you think? don't you think I would know? 
Amnesia! Every memory fades away till it's gone 
Where did you go? 
Amnesia, everything and nothing 
No 'we' anymore, she's a stranger that I used to know 
Now peace for those of us 
Some have peace on inner 
Tell me what happened? 
Who they? Where did they go? 
And was he enough, enough? 
When did all the fire turn colder? 
When did your heart start to beat slower? 
My whole memory of me is now gone so far from me 
it's not fair 
And I can feel it almost start to change 
But it just hurts too much, I let it go away 
So cold baby, now I'm going crazy 
I don't know why you need me alone 
If it was true, if it was you 
Don't you think? don't you think I would know? 
Amnesia! Every memory fades away till it's gone 
Where did you go? 
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing 
No 'we' anymore, she's a stranger that I used to know 
I could feel it almost starts to change 
But then it hurts too much, I let it go away 
So cold baby (so cold), now I'm going crazy 
I don't know why you need me alone 
If it was true, if it was you 
Don't you think? don't you think I would know? 
I got amnesia 
Every memory fades away till it's gone 
Where did you go? 
Amnesia, everything and nothing 
No 'we' anymore she's a stranger 
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it's gone 
Where did you go? 
Amnesia, everything and nothing 
No 'we' anymore she's a stranger that I used to know 
And I don't know you anymore 
Everything and nothing 
Everything and nothing 
She's a stranger that I used to know 
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia 
Go on and tear me apart 
And do it again tomorrow 
I almost forgot, who you are 
I try to forget about it every time I see you 
Thought I could do without ya 
Now I know I need ya, need ya 
This is turning into some kind 
some kind of amnesia, amnesia 
Memories fade away 
Thought I could do without ya 
Now I know I need ya, need ya 
This is turning into some kind 
some kind of amnesia, amnesia 
Memories fade away 
I try to forget about it every time I see you 
So tear me apart and do it again tomorrow

I'll let you drive me crazy for another day

Then you go and cut me down, but wait 
You tell me that you're sorry 
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say... 
That it's too late to apologize, 
it's too late 
I said it's too late to apologize, 
it's too late 
I'd take another chance, take a fall 
Take a shot for you 
And I need you like a heart needs a beat 
But it's nothing new - yeah 
I loved you with a fire red 
Now it's turning blue, and you say... 
I'm sorry like an angel 
Heaven let me think was you 
But I'm afraid... 
It's too late to apologize, 
it's too late 
I said it's too late to apologize, 
it's too late 
It's too late to apologize, it's too late 
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah 
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah 
I'm holding on your rope, 
got me ten feet off...

Unforgettable 
50 Cent (cent) 
Justin (tin) 
Timbaland (land), god damn (damn) 
She she, she want it, I want to give it to her 
She know that, it's right here for her 
I want to, see you break it down 
I'm ballin', throw'n money around 
She work it girl, she work the pole 
She break it down, she take it low 
She fine as hell, she about the dough 
She doing her thing out on the floor 
Her money money, she makin' makin' 
Look at the way she shakin' shakin' 
Make you want to touch it, make you want to taste it 
Have you lustin' for her, go crazy face it 
Now don't stop, get it, get it 
The way she shakin' make you want to hit it 
Think she double jointed 
From the way she splitted 
Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it 
She's so much more than you're used to 
She know's just how to move to seduce you 
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot 
Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop 
She always ready, when you want it she want it 
Like a nympho, the info 
I show you where to meet her 
On the late night, till daylight the club jumpin' 
If you want a good time, she gone give you what you want 
Let me talk to ya 
Baby you're so new age 
You like my new craze, let's get together 
Maybe we can start a new phase 
The smokes got the club all hazy 
Spotlights don't do you justice baby 
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying 
Aayooh 
I'm tired of using technology 
Why don't you sit down on top of me 
Aayooh 
I'm tired of using technology 
I need you right in front of me 
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it 
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (soo), I got to give it to her 
Your hips, your thighs 
They got me hypnotized, let me tell you 
Your hips, your thighs 
They got me hypnotized, let me tell you 
Your hips, your thighs 
They got me hypnotized, let me tell you 
Your hips, your thighs 
They got me hypnotized, let me tell you 
Got a thing for that thing she got 
The way she make it shake, the way she make it pop 
Make it rain for us so she don't stop 
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch 
In her fantasy, there's plain to see 
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking 
All into my set sheets 
When she ready to ride 
I'm ready to roll 
I'll be in this bitch till the club close 
What should I do, one thing on all fours 
Now that that shit should be against the law 
From side to side, let the ride, break it down (down down) 
You know I like 
When you hike and you throw it all around 
Different style, different move 
Damn I like the way you move 
Girl you got me thinking about 
All the things I do to you 
Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions 
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen 
Let me talk to ya 
Baby you're so new age 
You like my new craze, let's get together 
Maybe we can start a new phase 
The smokes got the club all hazy

She got a mean walk 
Her attitudes cold 
Shes got you begging waiting looking like an asshole 
And now you pulling up her shit like a valet 
You hanging onto every little lyric she say 
You bought her big rock 
Hoping she'd show it off 
You try to go hard 
But you end up looking soft 
It took a couple stacks just to make her fall 
And when you wasn't looking 
She took it off 
She got her nails done ready 
Sharp as a knife 
Don't turn your back cos she move like a thief in the night 
---- 
You dealing with a bank robber 
Another hustla with their head in your pocket 
Taking off with a rocket full of dough 
And there she go 
You dealing with a bank robber 
Shes just a hustla with her head in your pocket 
Taking off with a rocket full of dough 
And there she go 
I heard her say 
I love you baby 
I thought I heard her say

She got you bankrupt 
Now your in recession fool 
---- 
Invested yo bread 
Before you thought of it 
---- 
She made the cheques stop 
Like its a red light 
It didn't take a lot 
Just to red light 
You need a couple stacks 
Just to make her fall 
And when you wasn't looking 
She took it all 
She got her nails done ready 
Sharp as a knife 
Don't turn your back cos she move like a thief in the night

You dealing with a bank robber 
Another hustla with their head in your pocket 
Taking off with a rocket full of dough

Your deal went south 
Maybe call mr west 
You need to pay the west for that heartbreak up in your chest 
She took your home account and she don't even care 
Not even a dream couldn't save you from this nightmare 
She got the swagger of ti with a little hoe 
And you got swagger right out of your house and home 
Its pretty painful but you can't make it stop 
And now your -- f'ed up you got your lollipop 
You dealing with a bank robber 
Another hustla with their head in your pocket 
Taking off with a rocket full of dough

Love is lost, where is it to be found? 
My heart is still here and we have to go 'round and 'round 
And all the time I was loving you faithfully 
And you took my love and you turned it around on me. 
Now, I don't wanna fight with you 
I've done everything I can do (everything I can do) 
Don't you leave me like that, I just want my girl 
back 
Can we work it out, or is it over? 
(Chorus) 
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'? 
Why can't we seem to work things out 
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'? 
Did we forget what love was about? 
(It feels like I'm losing) Feels like I'm losing 
But when that was everything to me 
But now I realize we are just better not together. 
It's hard to let go 
Girl we've been through so many things 
But for you to grow, it had to go and spread your 
wings 
I see your tears, you're searching for a brighter day 
Oh, you should've thought it through when you gave my love away. 
Now, I don't wanna fight with you 
I've done everything I can do (everything I can do) 
I hate to leave you like that but I thought you had my back 
We tried to work it out but it's over. 
(Chorus) 
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'? 
Why can't we seem to work things out (It was you and me together) 
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'? 
Did we forget what love was about? 
(It feels like I'm losing) Feels like I'm losing 
But when that was everything to me 
But now I realize we are just better not together. 
Girl it's just too much for me to say, 
for you to tell me that you love me 
And then to watch you walk away 
But girl the way we fight, it just ain't right 
That's why it's better this way (hehey hehey yeah yeah yeah) 
Now no what else to say, but girl you know that 
(I) I (still) still (love) love (you) you (yeah) 
Yeaaah! 
(Chorus) 
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'? 
Why can't we seem to work things out 
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'? 
Did we forget what love was about? (Come on baby!) 
(It feels like I'm losing) Feels like I'm losing 
But when that was everything to me 
But now I realize we are just better not together. 
I've realized.. 
we are just better.. 
not together.</field>

From my head down to my toes 
cause I can't handle nothin' else 
I'm starring at the mirror at these clothes 
That is funny, they mean about as much as yesterday 
Something is calling me home, me home 
I can hear your voice and I'm not afraid 
Now I know I'm just a girl 
Trying to make my way through this life 
Now I feel bigger than the world 
With your hand in mine 
Like a speeding bullet 
Trying to make my way back through the night 
And now I feel bigger than the world 
With your hand in mine 
Boy, I'll take care of the storm 
Let's sneek right pass the cloud of where it sworn 
And I can handle the people 
There just pebble's on the long, long road 
I'm starring at the sky at those stars 
And it's funny, they seem about as far as tomorrow 
Something is calling me home, me home 
And I'm not afraid no 
Cause I can see everything from high above 
The Earth is a little place next to my love 
I can be strong here where you are 
Just look for me in the sky, I'm not that far 
Now I know I'm just a girl 
Trying to make my way through this life 
Now I feel bigger than the world 
With your hand in mine 
Like a speeding bullet 
Trying to make my way back through the night 
And now I feel bigger than the world 
With your hand in mine 
Now I feel bigger than the trees 
That hold the leaves 
Bigger than the mountains 
That touch the sea 
Bigger than the night 
That needs to stay 
Bigger than the waves 
That crash the bay

But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep 
And I'll always find you 
If my red eyes don't see you anymore 
And I can't hear you through the white noise 
Just send your heartbeat I go 
To the blue ocean floor 
Where they find us no more

Found on a beach (Found on the beach) 
Picked up and you held so close 
Rain washed out its glow 
Heartbeat steady leads me down below 
And under the water you scream so loud

But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep

Catch up to you on the same day 
Travel at the speed of light 
Thinking the same thought at the same time 
Heartbeats at a steady pace 
I'll let the rhythm show me the way 
No one can find us here 
Fade out and disappear 
If my red eyes don't see you anymore

What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away 
Like breeze off the pond 
Or trees on the lawn 
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air 
Let it blow through you 
Don't let it move you 
Now the sun dances across the sparkly waves, yeah 
While we're canoeing, stoned as "Tiny Dancer" plays 
Huff and puff all they want, but this house isn't made of straw 
What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away 
Like breeze off the pond 
Or trees on the lawn 
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air 
Let it blow through you 
Don't let it move you 
Like breeze off the pond 
Or trees on the lawn 
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air 
Let it blow through you 
Don't let it move you 
You and I against the world 
Against the world, against the world 
You and I against the world and everything it comes with 
No denying what you're worth 
What you're worth, what you're worth 
I'd be foolish beyond words to lose you 
What I'd look like trying to hide my life 
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low 
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign 
You could see it from the highway 
What I'd look like trying to hide my life 
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low 
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign 
You could see it from the highway, uh 
Like breeze off the pond 
Or trees on the lawn 
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air 
Let it blow through you 
Don't let it move you 
You and I against the world, against the world, against the world 
You and I against the world, and everything that comes with 
No denying what you're worth 
what you're worth, what you're worth 
I'd be foolish beyond words to lose you 
What I'd look like trying to hide my life 
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low 
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign

Come on 
We are having too much fun right here 
She's got a secret but I know 
She wanna break it down for me 
Like she tryna get some paper 
Who needs a stage with the lights low 
'Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it 
Into something major 
Now can we discuss 
How fast you just got undressed 
Girl if sex is a contest 
Then you're coming first (and) 
Don't rush, go slow 
No I can't lie, I'm impressed 
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close 
It's a cabaret 
Put on a show 
Get on the floor 
'Cause even though I'm a professional 
I like to do my work at home 
Cabaret 
Put on a show 
Get on the floor 
You giving me everything you got 
All I really want is more 
Put on a show 
Get on the floor 
Get on the floor 
Get on the floor 
Put on a show 
Get on the floor 
You giving me everything you got 
All I really want now is more 
Fantasy play the role 
And all these new moves 
That I'd like got me feeling 
Like a stranger 
Say my name, do you know 
'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much it's like 
We are laying in the manger 
Now can we discuss 
How fast you just got undressed 
Girl if sex is a contest 
Then you're coming first (and) 
Don't rush, go slow 
No I can't lie, I'm impressed 
And no impatient encore 
When love curtains close 
It's a cabaret 
Put on a show 
Get on the floor 
'Cause even though I'm a professional 
I like to do my work at home 
Cabaret 
Put on a show

[Verse 3: Drake] 
Okay this just in girl the paper so long 
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long 
So long till you get off from work 
But listen I got some better positions for you 
To take in for so long 
Always strap up just for safety 
Then go long 
Then do my touchdown dance with no clothes on 
We might fuck around and slip tonight 
Your Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape 
to throw on 
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya 
Got a bunch of old girls 
That I threw away for ya 
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya 
So I can lift ya up 
When I do the thang to ya 
Do do the thing to ya 
Girl truth be told 
You set the pace 
Then you ride it like cruise control 
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody 
I just don't care to decide who should know 
So I can lift ya up 
When I do the thang to ya 
I'm trying to ease your mind, word to Boosie 
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in 
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar 
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, it's mine 
You the girl that's gonna be there 
When it's marrying time 
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair 
I swear it's like I'm undercover way 
I'm cuffing you though 
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles 
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start 
Keep this whole stripper thing 
Secret in a pole vault 
North pole boy from the T 
O 
They ain't really ready for me and that J 
T 
though 
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo 
Got a camera watching our every move 
Like casinos 
It's a cabaret 
Put on a show 
Get on the floor 
Cause even though I'm a professional 
I like to do my work at home 
Cabaret

Feeling good, good, creeping up on you 
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight 
Now turn around and let me see just what ya curved like 
Go grab your friends and y'all can come to the back 
Why don't you take a sip upon this champagne 
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name 
I love that hour-glass shape you got upon that frame 
I like the way you talk your game we might be one and the same 
Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol 
I got a house that can entertain all of y'all 
Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call 
I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya 
And when I call don't give me the run-around 
I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown 
Don't second guess it, girl, there ain't nothin' to think about 
'Cause you got me feigning, but girl you don't hear me 
Little lady, you got me just 
Screwed up off of your melody 
Little lady, c'mon and don't 
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me 
Little lady, you got me just 
Screwed up off of your melody 
Easy baby c'mon and don't 
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me 
You're kinda cute, baby, are you new in town? 
My name is Tim, Aka Thomas Crown 
I heard you're lost, do you know your way around 
If you got a problem baby I can hold ya down 
I can be your navigator or your compass 
Better yet a genie baby make your first wish 
You the party, baby, I'm just the guest list 
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless 
So grab your friends, let's take it back to my house 
Let's watch 'Sex and the City' or 'Desperate Housewives' 
Simon says touch yours while you touch mine 
Parental discretion is advised 
Y'all can be the star in my spotlight 
Studio 54 if we get the props right 
All we need right now is a little bit, a little bit of act right 
Y'all looking shy, but ya act like y'all don't hear me 
Little lady, you got me just 
Screwed up off of your melody 
Little lady, c'mon and don't 
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me 
Little lady, you got me just 
Screwed up off of your melody 
Easy baby c'mon and don't 
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me 
See girl you stronger than the strongest drug I ever had 
You could mix 'em all together you still be twice as bad 
'Cause you the worst best girlfriend I ever had 
Harder to kick than cigarettes and green thangs 
Harder to escape than jail cells and bills 
Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute gurl an' pig tails 
Like Michael Jackson, "How you do me this way?" 
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah 
They call me Juicy J straight up out the Three 6 Mafia 
Ghetto fab playa on these streets I'm tryin' a holla at ya 
Quit playing games girl you got my head spinnin' 'round 
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town 
I just want to pick you up and take you to a bachelor nest 
Is it good? Is it good? And have a little smack fest 
So if you never call me I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee 
Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessey 
Little lady, you got me just 
Screwed up off of your melody 
Little lady, c'mon and don't 
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me 
Little lady, you got me just 
Screwed up off of your melody 
Easy baby c'mon and don't 
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me 
Screwed up 
Chop me up 
Screwed up off of your melody 
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me</field>

Ay, 
Lemme kick it to you right quick man 
Not on some gangsta shit man 
On some real shit 
Anybody who been through the same thing 
I'm sure you feel the same way 
(Justin Timberlake) 
Oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
And oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
Ever had one of them days wish you would 
Have stayed home 
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' their hate on 
You walk by, they get wrong 
You reply then shit get blown 
Way out of proportion 
Way past discussion 
Just you against them, pick one then rush them 
Figure you get jumped here that's next 
They don't wanna stop there now they bustin' 
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' 
You to the hospital with a bad concussion 
Plus you hit four times 
But it hit yo spine 
Paralyzed waist down 
And ya wheelchair bound 
Never mind that now you lucky to be alive 
Just thinkin' it all started fussin' wit three guys 
Nigga pride in the way 
But your pride is the way you can fuck 
Around get shot down any day 
Niggas die everyday 
All little bullshit 
Dope money, dice games, ordinary hood shit 
Could this be cuz of hip-hop music 
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it? 
Usually niggas don't know what to do 
When they back against the wall 
So they just start shootin' 
For red or for blue or for blow I guess 
From Bankhead at the old projects 
No more stress, now I'm straight 
Now I get it, now I take time to think 
Before I make mistakes just for my family sake 
That part of me left yesterday 
The heart of me is strong today 
No regrets I'm blessed to say 
The old me dead and gone away 
(Justin Timberlake) 
Oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
And oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
I ain't neva been scared, I live through tragic 
Situations could been dead lookin' back at it 
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen 
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin' 
In the apartments hangin' 
Smokin' and rappin' 
Niggas start shit next thing we know 
We cappin' 
Get locked up then didn't even get mad 
Now I think about that what a life I had 
Most of that shit look back just laugh 
Some shit still look back get sad 
Thinkin' my home boy still be around 
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time 
I won that fight I lost that war 
I could still see my nigga walkin' out that door 
Who would of thought I'd never see Philant no more 
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more 
Cuz a nigga his jump cost me more 
I'd a took that ass whoopin' out for sure 
Now think before I risk my life 
Take them chances to get my stripes 
A nigga put his hands on me alright 
Otherwise stand there talk 
Shit all night 
Cuz I hit you and you sue me 
I shoot you get locked up poor me 
No more stress now I'm straight 
Now I get it now I take time to think 
Before I make mistakes just for my family sake 
That part of me left yesterday 
The heart of me is strong today 
No regrets I'm blessed to say 
The old me dead and gone away

Oh hey

And oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
I turn my head to the east 
I don't see nobody by my side 
I turn my head to the west, still nobody in sight 
So I turn my head to the north 
Swallow that pill that they call pride 
That old me's dead and gone 
But the new me will be alright 
I turn my head to the east 
I don't see nobody by my side 
I turn my head to the west, still nobody in sight

Gonna give you something so you know what's on my mind 
A gift real special, so take off the top 
Take a look inside -- it's my dick in a box 
Not gonna get you a diamond ring 
That sort of gift don't mean anything 
Not gonna get you a fancy car 
Girl ya gotta know you're my shining star 
Not gonna get you a house in the hills 
A girl like you needs somethin' real 
Wanna get you somethin' from the heart 
Somethin' special girl 
It's my dick in a box, my dick in a box babe 
It's my dick in a box, my dick in a box girl 
See I'm wise enough to know when a gift needs givin' (yeah)

To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress 
It's easy to do just follow these steps 
1: Cut a hole in a box 
2: Put your junk in that box 
3: Make her open the box 
And that's the way you do it

Over at your parent's house a dick in a box 
Mid day at the grocery store a dick in a box 
Backstage at the Cma's a dick in a box (yeah-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow)

As soon as I look in your face 
I see your world where a heart never breaks 
And to me that means that the whole world could change</field>

Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake? 
Feel it in my brain, toss out of pain 
Pour a little up now, for the love that we made 
I feel it in the morning 
You're still here in the morning 
I see you, but you gonna telephone the doctor 
I'm not okay 
The bottom of the bottle 
To fill this empty heart up 
A thousand proof don't change the truth 
I tried it, but I can't 
I can't drink you away 
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim 
I've tried all of their friends 
I can't drink you away 
On these rocks, I can't swim out of this skin 
Oh baby them say 
Now tell me, baby 
Don't they make a medicine for heart break 
Ooh, no, tell me baby, oh yeah 
Now don't they make a medicine for heart break 
Got a pounding on my brain 
So I drowned it away 
When the sun comes up tomorrow 
You can find me doing the same 
'Cause I just can't forget 
The way we turned out this, babe 
And now the only thing that sleeps here 
Is a ghost of you instead 
I feel it in the morning 
You're still here in the morning 
I see you, but you gonna telephone the doctor 
I'm not okay 
The bottom of the bottle 
To fill this empty heart up 
A thousand proof don't change the truth 
I tried it, but I can't 
I can't drink you away 
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim 
I've tried all of their friends 
I can't drink you away 
All these rocks, I can't swim out of this skin 
Oh baby them say 
Now tell me, baby 
Don't they make a medicine for heart break 
Ooh, no, tell me baby, oh yeah

Should I turn off or maybe leave on the light? 
Maybe leave on the light?

Uh, electric lady (x2) 
Oh my, you're skipping my heart 
Kiss in the dark with your lightning eyes 
Said I want you igniting fires all night 
And you got the power 
You're damn right it's life or dead 
Not gonna make it if we don't connect tonight right 
Strike twice all night 
Body moves lightweight 
You're reaching my heart fast 
You're searching for something 
That's just how electricity behaves 
And I been needing it so bad 
The other ones don't last 
Wait a minute I feel a charge 
I should've known as you glow in the dark 
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks 
Electric lady (oh) 
Wait a minute until it drops 
I feel it jump, we get closer to a shock 
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks 
Electric lady 
Your love won't die (running low) 
But girl your love won't die 
So what you're giving me girl 
All that energy give it here 
You know how it goes sometimes 
Love won't die (running low) 
But girl your love won't die 
But if you need any, girl 
I got energy come and get it 
You know how it goes sometimes 
Sometimes I need a little (more) 
Give a little, forget a little 
We could meet any place 
How about the middle, tonight? 
And you got the power 
Baby you know if you're ever low 
I will go low and bring you back into the light 
Strike twice all night

Smoke coming out with enough to go around [X4] 
Let me see what you feel like, hit it on the highway 
Let me speed it up and do it my way 
Show me what you really with, go ahead 
Let your thighs down, we can blow the brains out 
Baby show me you can handle it 
Put it in the fast lane, watch for police 
We can put it over just do it in the back seat 
Hush baby don't speak, let the wind breeze 
We gonna hit it up, make it [?] till you say free 
Baby sit up in the hood 
Let me show you what's good for you 
Choose it like I would, if I drove to the hood 
Would you know what to do 
Would you take it real slow 
Cause speed it up and know 
What the flow with ya 
Cause you look so right, baby girl so fine 
And she's just my type 
With the big brown eyes 
When I pull it to the side 
Now I take it for a ride 
There's some pimping in the air for one night 
Your sexy body is stupid and so ridiculous 
I'm serious, there's something about 
it that makes it dangerous 
And if the transmission gets overheated 
Don't worry, just stay seated I can treated 
You know because 
Your body is like a fast car and I got the keys 
Baby we can turn it up if you're rolling with me 
Cause I swear you're out of control 
Driving like something [?] 
And you're begging for more, and more 
Because

And when I go the 1st gear, 2nd gear, 3rd gear 
By the time I get to 4, you begging me for more 
So throw this motherfucker in reverse 
In the moonlight baby just hold on 
[?] wanna put my hands on 
Swerving down the one lane 
Pedal to the metal, better strap up 
See if you can handle before we go again 
To the stop light, I'ma do it all night 
[?] you pull up, I can do it just right 
When we're out of gas, you ain't even gotta ask 
I'ma fill the thing up, do it till you get enough 
From the back to the front, from the front to the back 
From the side to the side 
And the [?] to the truck 
to the coop, to the bug, tell me what you like 
I'm cutting like corners, wanna put it on you 
Make sure the glove is tight 
From the left to the right, like a windshield wipe 
I'ma hit it till you flash them lights 
Your sexy body is crazy and so damn [?] 
I'm curious there's something about it 
that makes it dangerous 
And if the transmission gets overheated 
Don? 't worry, just stay seated I can treated

Now I know I could never sit in his chair

And I wouldn't dare say that my hurt was more 
But a little spitfire hurt you, boy 
With nothin' to lean on (nothin' to lean on) 
It's bound to go down after a couple empty cans 
And I knew once I saw that fancy record company man 
And in her face, she knew I was a stan 
I was leavin' with my flannel on

Look at all of it from up here 
It's beautiful, it's beautiful

Don't worry girl,

So slide a little bit closer to me little girl. 
See daddy's on a mission to please. 
Wait a second. 
She's hopped up for me 
I've got her in my zone 
Her body's pressed up on me 
I think she's ready to blow.

tell me which way you like that 
Tell me which way you like that 
You can't stop baby 
You can't stop once you've turned me on 
And your enemy are your thoughts baby 
So just let em go 
Cause all I need is a moment alone 
To give you my tongue, 
and put you outta control 
And after you let it in, we'll be skin to skin, 
It's just so natural.

That we're made in the jungle 
Why you staying so far away? 
Running, men is looking on, why 
Why don't you come out to play 
And get closer to your animal, inside 
Ready I'm like the gentleman that your momma would love 
Ooh get to know me 
Baby you act like a lady 
Don't have to cover it up 
Things you wanna show me 
Make me remember the reason why I wanted to love 
Please be slowly 
I think you're ready to try 
Walk a little closer and 
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid 
And if you're looking for your animal 
Hop in my cage 
Fall in a terror of height, don't talk 
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want 
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want 
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want 
Come in, come in 
Gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want 
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want 
Show me your t-shirt, and sweat your sling 
Down and dirty 
You're loving me so loud 
Play it breeze, but you wild as a strain 
Sorry show it for the whole crowd 
Ready I'm like the gentleman that your momma would love 
Ooh get to know me 
Baby you act like a lady 
Don't have to cover it up

Oh yea boss 
Come on 
I'm the type of girl to look you dead in the eye-eye 
I'm real as it come if you don't know why I'm fly 
Seen you tryna switch it up but girl you ain't that dope 
I'm a Wonder Woman, let me go get my robe 
I'm a supermodel and mami, si mami 
Amnesty International got Bangkok to Montauk on lock 
Love my ass and my abs in the video called "Promiscuous" 
My style is ri-dic-dic-diculous, 'diculous, 'diculous 
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice 
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night 
We ain't here to hurt nobody 
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me) 
Wanna see you work your body 
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me) 
When Timbo is in the party, everybody put up they hands 
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-an-and 
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand 
I'm respected from Californ-I-A, way down to Japan 
I'm a real producer and you just a piano man 
Your songs don't top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-an-an 
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance 
Somebody need to tell them that they can't do it like I can 
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice 
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night 
We ain't here to hurt nobody 
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me) 
Wanna see you work your body 
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me) 
Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling, I don't think you came in clear 
When you're sittin' on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here 
I saw you tryin' to act cute on Tv, "Just let me clear the air.. 
" 
We missed you on the charts last week, damn, that's right you wasn't there 
If se-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shi-it-it 
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it 
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way 
Cause our run will never be over, not at least until we say 
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice 
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night 
We ain't here to hurt nobody 
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me) 
Wanna see you work your body 
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me) 
Oh..

I got alot of doubt, that i'll be running out, that should be running around 
So why don't you just take it away from me 
Take it away from me yeah 
Don't know we're going out 
But i can't go without 
And i am slowing down 
So why you don't just take it away frome me (yeah) 
Take it away frome me (yeah) 
Cuz i've been lost 
You know my love 
I never thought, she would give up 
And now i'm all by myself 
This time, this time 
Ah ah ahh

Yea yo! 
I'm in a different world and i got to get out 
Cuz she's down and now and that's not 
What i missing enough 
Friger than it's cold 
Like i'm living in the blizzard wow 
How can i get back from this place 
That have ones found 
Within my mind i'm lossing time 
I must move on and pain ugh, 
Picture how i feel if not then i will draw the line 
She was more than mine 
But i have to let her go 
Cuz when you love everything that you won't 
You must know that there's no control 
So i say a little bit of my own 
Dignity and i write this song 
Hopefully she will hear it on 
Every station that she knows 
It's almost over 
And i will show her 
What it means to be away 
From someones that should be closer 
Chorus: 
Cuz they don't know (they don't know) 
What we got (what we got) 
Till it's going away, hum hum... 
Cuz they don't know (they don't know)

[Justin Timberlake] 
I've heard there was a secret chord 
That David played and it pleased the Lord 
But you don't really care for music do you? 
It goes like this – the fourth, the fifth 
The minor fall, the major lift 
The baffled King composing Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
[Charlie Sexton] 
Your faith was strong but you needed proof 
You saw her bathing on the roof 
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you 
She tied you to her kitchen chair 
She broke your throne, she cut your hair 
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
[Justin Timberlake] 
Maybe there's a God above 
And all I ever learned from love 
Was how to shoot at somebody who out drew you 
And it's not a cry that you hear at night 
It's not somebody who's seen the light 
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

            <field name="lyrics">You take the clothes off my back 
And I let you 
You steal the food right out of my mouth 
And I watch you eat it 
I still don't know why, 
Why our love is so much (Oh) 
You curse my name 
In spite to put me to shame 
Air all my laundry in the streets 
Dirty or clean 
Give it up for fame 
But I still don't know why, 
Why I love it so much (Yeah) 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there, 
one day you care, You're so unfair 
sipping from the cuptill it runneth over 
holy grail 
Blue told me to remind you niggas 
Fuck that shit y'all talk about 
I'm the nigga, caught up in all these lights and cameras 
But look what that shit did to Hammer 
God, dammit I like it 
The bright lights is enticing 
But look what it did to Tyson 
All that money in one night 
30 mill for one fight 
But soon as all the money blows, 
all the pigeons take flight 
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me 
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice 
That's my bad, I can't even blame her for that 
Enough to make me wanna murder, Momma please just get my bail 
I know nobody to blame 
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself 
And we all just entertainers 
And we're stupid, and contagious 
And we all just entertainers 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there, 
one day you care, You're so unfair 
sipping from the cuptill it runneth over 
holy grail 
Now I got tattoos on my body 
Psycho bitches in my lobby 
I got haters in the paper 
Photo shoots with paparazzi 
Can't even take my daughter for a walk 
See them by the corner store 
I feel like I'm cornered off 
Enough is enough 
I'm calling this off 
Who the fuck I'm kidding though? 
I'm getting high 
Sitting low 
Sliding by In that big body 
Curtains all in my window 
This fame hurt 
But this chain works 
I think back You asked the same person 
If this is all you had to deal with 
Nigga deal with 
It, this shit ain't work 
This light work 
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt 
Niggas dying back where I was birthed 
Fuck your iris and Irs 
Get the hell up off of your high horse 
You got the shit that niggas die for 
Dry yours 
Why you mad 
Take the good with the bad 
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water 
You're still alive 
Still that nigga 
Niggas you survived 
You still getting bigger nigga 
Living the life 
Vanilla wafers 
In a villa 
Illest nigga alive 
Michael Jackson thriller 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there, 
one day you care, You're so unfair 
sipping from the cuptill it runneth over 
holy grail 
You get the air around my lungs whenever you need it 
And you take the blade right out of my heart, 
Just so you can watch me bleed 
And I sill don't know why, 
why I love you so much 
Yeah, and you play this game inspite to drive me insane 
I have a tattootd on my sleeve 
Forever in ink with guess whos name, but I sill don't no why, 
Why I love you so much, yeah 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there,

The city winks a sleepless eye 
Hear her voice shake my window 
Sweet seducing sighs 
Get me out into the night-time 
Four walls won't hold me tonight 
If this town is just an apple 
Then let me take a bite 
If they say, why, why? 
Tell them that it's human nature 
Why, why does he do me that way? 
If they say, why, why? 
Tell them that it's human nature 
Why, why does he do me that way? 
Reaching out to touch a stranger 
Electric eyes are everywhere 
See that girl, she knows I'm watching 
She likes the way I stare 
If they say, why, why? 
Tell them that it's human nature 
Why, why does he do me that way? 
If they say, why, why? 
Tell them that it's human nature 
Why, why does he do me that way? 
I like living this way 
I like loving this way 
Looking out across the morning 
Where the city's heart begins to beat 
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder 
I'm dreaming of the street 
If they say, why, why? 
Tell them that it's human nature 
Why, why does he do me that way? 
If they say, why, why? 
Oh! Tell them 
Why, why does he do me that way? 
If they say, why, why? 
Cha, cha, cha 
Why, why does he do me that way? 
If they say, why, why? 
Oh! Tell them 
Why, why does he do me that way? 
If they say, why, why? 
Oh! Tell them

Yo 
Hi, I'm not here to waste your time 
(But) You know this ain't a pick up line 
I just think that you're a dime 
Well don't just sit there girl 
Well I know that heart that's in your chest 
It carries pain and so must stress 
But you got to let it go 
(Go, go, girl) 
Just close your eyes I'll grab your waist 
Next think you know you have your pace 
Girl you got to let it go 
(Go, go, girl) 
I know that you wanna get down 
You do deserve to get down 
Been working hard all week 
Just trying to make your money 
Girl go on and shake your booty 
I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it 
I'm lovin' it 
I'm lovin' it 
By the way what's your sign 
I bet it is compatible with mine 
Probably long lasting years down the line 
I'm telling you girl you're a dime 
Well don't just sit there girl 
I know that heart that's in your chest 
It carries pain and so must stress 
But you got to let it go 
(Go, go, girl) 
(Just let go) 
Just close your eyes I'll grab your waist 
Next think you know you have your pace 
Girl you got to let it go 
(Go, go, girl) 
Remember 
The first time we met 
Butterflies in your stomach 
Couldn't speak 
You 
Close your eyes 
It's ok 
I was lovin' it 
How, how you do all the things you do? 
(How you do it?) 
Like being you, you're so professional 
(Professional) 
Not mention you're the baddest of your group 
Well don't just sit there girl 
I know that you wanna get down 
You do deserve to get down 
(Wanna get down) 
Been working hard all week 
(Oh, yea) 
Just trying to make your money 
(Money) 
Girl go on and shake your booty 
I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it 
I'm lovin' it 
I'm lovin' it

And I don't taste, no, I dnt stress

Plenty fish in the sea, baby please know that.

A club full of people, all I see is you 
You're making eyes, you realise that I'm watching you 
It's so hard to believe that you're ??? me from across the room 
I've been tryin' to push up next to you all night 
But I gotta wait for a moment, for me that's right 
And I don't wanna sound like those other guys 
But what if I never have another chance to, to tell you 
Just how you make me feel 
And I just gotta let you know 
You're softly killing me, with just your mere words 'hello' 
This may sound a bit crazy, but lately I just wanted you to know 
You strangely seduce me, with just the way you say hello 
This may sound quite forward, but honey 
Is there somewhere we can go? 
Normally I just can't believe, I don't act this wild 
But there's something about, the way you smile at me 
I feel like a child 
And when you said 'hi', I almost lost my mind from the sound of you 
I can tell you're kind, you wanna go out of sight 
But you don't wanna be rude 
Girl I've been tryin to push up next to you all night 
But I gotta wait for a moment, for me that's right 
And I don't wanna sound like those other guys 
But what if I never have another chance to, to tell you

And nothing brings more joy to my life

Are ya happy girl?

Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two 
(Huh?) 
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you 
Saying you're young and confused 
Well that's a lame excuse 
That's why the only one to blame is you for 
Last night 
Can't believe what I was hearing 
Telling me to have a nice life 
So tonight 
I don't think I'll spare your feelings 
You're on your own 
I'm-a do for me what's right 
In your eyes a see a second chance 
Maybe I should take another glance 
But for now I'll wash my hands 
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby 
Pharrell say don't do it the same 
But I say ain't playing my games 
But for you my soul still remains 
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby 
Are ya happy girl?

You don't have to pack everything 
Don't you wanna feel the breeze? 
And forget everything, baby 
Hop in the car and go with me 
You don't have to pack everything 
Don't you wanna feel the breeze? 
And forget everything baby 
Got laid off at your job today 
You've been working at this place for years 
And though you were underpaid 
Mami that place isn't worth your tears 
(Oh, oh) 
I know that life is hard on you 
And you can't seem to find out why 
I'll explain, just grab your coat, girl 
And just join me on this ride 
Let's take a ride, on the country side 
Let's just get away 
We can spend the night, till the morning light 
Let's just get away 
Girl you're the best 
You could be 
An angel among society 
But you get crushed 
From what you see 
You try to hard to help and that's enough for me 
(Woo..) 
Try to change what you can 
And accept all the things you cannot 
(Don't stress yourself baby) 
I know you wanna fly away from the world 
But for now with the time we've got 
Let's take a ride, on the country side 
Let's just get away 
We can spend the night, till the morning light 
Let's just get away 
Let's take a ride, on the country side 
Let's just get away 
(Let's just get away) 
We can spend the night, till the morning light 
Let's just get away 
(Let's just get away) 
Maybe if you consider us just riding 
That once you feel like a winner 
No more crying 
And baby I know just what you need 
(I know) 
To let your hair down so that you feel free, yea 
(Hair, yea yea yea) 
It hurts me to watch you see it through 
(It hurts me baby) 
Girl you're so confused 
(Let's get away) 
And I know what to do 
Let's take a ride, on the country side 
Let's just get away 
(Let's just get away) 
(Let's go, girl) 
We can spend the night, till the morning light 
(Night) 
Let's just get away 
(Let's just get away) 
Let's take a ride 
Hop in the car and go with me 
You don't have to pack everything 
Don't you wanna feel the breeze? 
And forget everything, baby 
(Let's take a ride) 
Hop in the car and go with me 
You don't have to pack everything 
Don't you wanna feel the breeze? 
And forget everything, baby 
Let's take a ride 
Let's go girl 
Let's go girl 
Let's go girl</field>

Life goes on, the world keeps turning and life goes on 
He was a company man 
He put his faith in the union and his take-home pay 
A good republican man 
But they closed down the factory his retirement day 
Life goes on whether or not there's a reason 
Life goes on, enter another season 
She was the pride of her dad 
But she harbored a secret in her bureau drawer 
And when the news was too bad 
She would get into trouble with the boy next door 
In the dead of the night 
They escape to their fantasy without a sound 
Her father still burns a light 
But they never returned and they were never found</field>

Keep lookin at me 
Gettin' scared now, right? 
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin 
It feel good right? 
Listen 
I kinda noticed something weren't right 
When you got a frown face 
It's kind of weird to me 
Since you're so fine 
If it's up to me your face will change...... 
If you smiling, that should set the tone 
Just be limber 
And If you let go, the music should move your bones 
Just remember 
Sing this song with me 
Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you 
You will know the difference when I touch you 
People are so phony 
Nosy cause they're lonely 
Aren't you sick of the same thing? 
They say so and so was dating 
Love you or they're hating 
When it doesn't matter anyway 
Cause we're here tonight 
If you smiling, that should set the tone 
Just be limber baby 
And If you let go, the music should move your bones 
Baby just remember 
Sing this song with me 
Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you 
You will know the difference when I touch you 
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy 
I could change your life 
If you give me the chance 
To be your man 
I won't let you down baby 
If you give me the chance 
To be your man 
Here baby, put on my jacket 
And then ... 
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Girl 
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby) 
Girl ... 
[Rap] 
Ma, what you wanna do? 
I'm in front of you 
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two 
Or me and you put on a stage show 
And the mall kids, that's how to change low 
From them you heard "wow, it's the same glow" 
Look at me, I say "yeah, it's the same dough" 
We the same type, you my air of life 
You have me sleeping in the same bed, every night 
Go rock with me, you deserve the best 
Take a few shots 
Let it burn in your chest 
We could ride down 
Pumping N.E.R.D 
in the deck 
Funny how a few words turn into sex 
Play this free, joint called "brain" 
(I just love your, Brain) 
Ma, take a hint 
Make me suerve in the lane 
The name Malicious 
And I burn every track 
Clipse and J 
Timberlake 
Now how heavy is that? 
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Girl 
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby) 
Girl ... 
Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
(Can't love you like I do) 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
(Trust ya like I do) 
Late at night, I talk to you 
(Hey) 
You will know the difference when... 
Break this down 
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a 
Little boy 
I never thought it would end up this way, Drums 
(Hey) 
It's kind of special right? yeah 
You know, you think about it 
Sometimes people, just destined 
Destined to do what they do 
And that's what it is 
Now everybody dance.</field>

            <field name="lyrics">You have to be comfortable with yourself 
because that's all there is 
There's you and nature 
Soon as you think you got it all figured out, you know, the wilderness will figure some way to teach you a lesson 
As I'm alone in the forest, I'm one with my surroundings and there's a lot of peace in that solitude 
I'll be a mountain main 'til the day I die 
(Living off the land) 
And I break my back 
And I work all night 
At times I do all their work too 
It don't break my stride 
I just keep moving forward 
At times I wish there was two 
So I have somebody else that could help me help you 
I'll be down, sometimes it's hard to back up 
the bills on the credit card 
She keeps on running to leave 
If you don't get on your knees and repay the money you spend 
But like her trust, you cannot get lit 
Sunday, you go to church 
Back on your knees and you're tryna' soul search 
I'm just a man doing the best that I can 
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan 
When you're living off the land 
Why you waste what you ain't got 
On that power box 
Has it not quite dawned on you, that don't work at all 
See the easy thing to do 
IS the hardest thing to do 
You just open yourself up 
So the truth could come through 
I'll be down, sometimes it's hard to back up 
the bills on the credit card 
She keeps on running to leave 
If you don't get on your knees and repay the money you spend 
But like her trust, you cannot get lit 
Sunday, you go to church 
Back on your knees and you're tryna' soul search 
I'm just a man doing the best that I can

Back on your knees and you're tryna' soul search 
I'm just a man doing the best that I can

When you're living off the land 
Living off the land 
Living off the land 
I'm just a man doing the best that I can 
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan 
When you're living off the land 
If you just open yourself (If you just open yourself) 
If you just open yourself (If you just open yourself) 
If you just open yourself (If you just open yourself) 
You'll see, that what you need

Dear Mum 
Alot [?] is in our second trimester ? 
Stressed out 
Causes shes goin acting all extra 
Were happy cause she knows its a girl 
But we doubtful if we should bring another one in the world 
Aint you said that send your kid to the park [?] 
I'm keepin all my photos in my 23rd song 
My best friend Armani lost her arm at the border 
Just tryin to restore a little peace and order as 
It's strange cause she reads the koran 
Torn between what side she needs to be on 
Havent slept for days 
I scream when I see 
Cause no man's eyes should see what I see 
Soldiers lost their mind 
Robbin, pillagin 
Tomahawk missiles into civilian villages 
And they ease the pain with narcotics 
I'm scared but I'm tryin to remain patriotic 
[Justin Timberlake] 
My father 
Forgive us cause we know not what we doin 
And my brothers 
How we gonn tie up all these loose ends 
And my mother 
Tryin to use that thing you taught me to keep it movin 
And my brothers and sisters 
How we gonna tie up all these loose ends 
[Pharoahe Monch] 
New message from mums 
?? ring back ?? 
At home they comparin this situation to nam 
So sad you had to miss your mums prom 
Just some song off the Marvin Gaye Whats going on album 
And I'm smilin at the room 
She asks me 
If at night would she stare at the moon? 
Is it possible at the same moment of time 
You starin as well cause you too in tune 
Your dads [?] apart now hangs over his ashes 
Which means hes alive and wake up with hot flashes 
They claim its disease that gassed him 
Have yet to explain the migraines and rashes 
And have you seen what the price of gas is? 
We can't afford the property taxes 
We just want you back at home 
Where you belong with your family 
Your the backbone 
[Justin Timberlake] 
My father 
Forgive us cause we know not what we doin 
And my brothers 
How we gonn tie up all these loose ends 
And my mother 
Tryin to use that thing you taught me to keep it movin 
And my brothers and sisters 
How we gonna tie up all these loose ends 
Tell me how can we live this way 
We've gon so far astray 
No one knows what to say 
We got young peoples lives at stake 
Whats it gonna take 
For us to find a way 
[Will.I.Am] 
The world is changin 
We in danger 
We ain't changin 
Our behaviour 
We behave like 
Calm is nothing 
Aint concerned with 
Repercussions 
Aint that somethin 
Check him out now 
Pointin fingers 
When they know how 
We got to this point of terror 
Caution could have 
Made the road clear 
But we stuck with 
Mediocre leadership 
So we'll just suffer 
Who knows what the 
Hell is going on 
With conflicts they keep on growing 
It's a fucked up situation 
When you ain't got no education 
On the problem 
Or know what its about 
You gotta help me out</field>

Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job 
I make 40 some dollars a day 
I used to be the man in my home town 
Until I started to lose my way 
It all goes back to when I dropped out of school 
Havin fun I was living the life 
But now I got a problem with that little white rock 
See I cant put down the pipe 
And it is breaking me down 
Watching the world spin 'round 
While my dreams fall down 
Is anybody out there? 
It is breaking me down 
No more friends around 
And my dreams fall down 
Is anybody out there? 
Can anybody out there hear me? 
Cuz I can't seem to hear myself 
Can anybody out there see me? 
Cuz I can't seem to see myself 
It's gotta be a heaven somewhere 
Can you save me from this hell? 
Can anybody out there feel me? 
Cuz I can't seem to feel myself 
Losing my way 
Keep losing my way 
Keep losing my way 
Can you help me find my way? 
Losing my way 
Keep losing my way 
Keep losing my way 
Can you help me find my way? 
Now you gotta understand 
I was a family man 
I woulda done anything for my own 
But I couldn't get a grip of my new found rich 
So I ended up all alone 
I remember where I was when I got my first bus 
See I thought I was living the life 
And the craziest thing is I probably never know 
The color of my daughter's eyes 
And it is breaking me down 
Watching the world spin 'round 
While my dreams fall down 
Is anybody out there? 
It is breaking me down 
No more friends around 
And my dreams fall down 
Is anybody out there? 
Can anybody out there hear me? 
Cuz I can't seem to hear myself 
Can anybody out there see me? 
Cuz I can't seem to see myself 
It's gotta be a heaven somewhere 
Can you save me from this hell? 
Can anybody out there feel me? 
Cuz I can't seem to feel myself 
Losing my way 
Keep losing my way 
Keep losing my way 
Can you help me find my way? 
Losing my way 
Keep losing my way 
Keep losing my way 
Can you help me find my way? 
Oh my god please forgive me (father hear my prayer) 
Cuz I know I've done some wrong in this life 
If I could do it all again 
Have just one more chance 
I'd take all those wrongs and make them right 
Can anybody out there hear me? 
Cuz I can't seem to hear myself 
Can anybody out there see me? 
Cuz I can't seem to see myself 
It's gotta be a heaven somewhere 
Can you save me from this hell? 
Can anybody out there feel me? 
Cuz I can't seem to feel myself 
Can anybody out there hear me? 
Cuz I can't seem to hear myself 
Can anybody out there see me? 
Cuz I can't seem to see myself 
It's gotta be a heaven somewhere 
Can you save me from this hell? 
Can anybody out there feel me? 
Cuz I can't seem to feel myself

Keep losing my way 
Keep losing my way 
Can you help me find my way?

Baby I gotta have some more 
(Turn the track up) 
What's it gonna take to get a score 
(Turn the beat up, yeah) 
Got me like a fien banging on your door 
(I think I want some of that) 
Why don't you meet me on the floor? 
And then? 
(Verse 1) 
Step into my office won't you like to sample a taste of my stuff 
(JT: yeah c'mon) 
I've got a million different flavors all the boys say 
They can't get enough 
Want some under your skin you're begging me for more 
You'll get addicted to this but baby you've been more 
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you 
When I'm on the floor, the floor, the floor 
(Chorus) 
Cause I could be your dealer 
I can be your only friend when you need her 
I'll keep you coming back again 
You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine 
You can tell my bag of tricks if you need a fix 
Then I'm a dealer, Hey! 
Love love dealer, Hey (check it out) 
(Verse 2) 
All those other pushers they say 
They got that good stuff that you already know 
(You already know what it is) 
That they can't do what I do - oh no 
I'll take you places that you never thought you'd go 
I can get you so high with the things I do 
You get a rush in your veins and we start to move 
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you 
When I'm on the floor, the floor, the floor

Cause I could be your dealer 
I can be your only friend when you need her

JT: What's it gonna take to get a score 
ED: Now you got me in your system 
JT: Got me like a fien banging on your door 
ED: So now you know what you've been missing 
JT: Why don't you meet me on the floor?

Break 
You'd don't gotta say that you like it 
I can tell by the look in your eyes 
Won't you give it a try, you'll be mine

Let me see you move, come on 
Dancin' 
Let me see you move 
Baby, love never felt so good 
And I'd die if it ever could 
Not like you hold me, hold me 
Oh baby, love never felt so fine 
And I'd doubt if it's never mine 
Not like you hold me, hold me 
And the night's gonna be just fine 
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe 
I can't take it 
'Cause baby, every time I love you 
In and out of my life, in out baby 
Tell me, if you really love me 
It's in and out of my life, in out baby 
'Cause baby, love never felt so good 
Baby, love never felt so fine 
And I'd doubt if it was ever mine 
Not like you hold me, hold me 
Oh baby, love never felt so good 
And I'd doubt if it ever could 
Not like you hold me, hold me 
And the night through the thick and thin 
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe 
I can't take it 'cause 
Baby, every time I love you 
In and out of my life, in out baby 
Tell me, if you really love me 
It's in and out of my life, in out baby

She's freaky and I like it 
Listen 
She grabs the yellow bottle 
She likes the way it hits her lips 
She gets to the bottom 
It sends her on a trip so right 
She might be goin' home with me tonight 
She looks like a model 
Except she's got a little more ass 
Don't even bother 
Unless you've got that thing she likes 
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight 
[chorus] 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
She's freaky and she knows it 
She's freaky, but I like it 
She shuts the room down 
The way she walks and causes a fuss 
The baddest in town 
She's flawless like some uncut ice 
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight 
And all she wants is to dance 
That's why you'll find her on the floor 
But you don't have a chance 
Unless you move the way that she likes 
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned from everywhere 
She's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Now dance 
Little girl 
You're freaky, but I like it 
Hot damn! 
Let me put my funk on this one time 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned from everywhere 
She's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
I think I'm love stoned 
She's got me love stoned 
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh 
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh 
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Think that she knows, oh, oh 
And now I walk around without a care 
She's got me hooked 
It just ain't fair, but I... 
I'm love stoned and I could swear 
That she knows 
Think that she knows, oh, oh 
She knows, she knows, oh, oh</field>

But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are 
So tonight, if I take it too far 
that's okay because you know 
I hear the making up's fun 
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe 
So if you see another side of me 
that's okay because you know 
I hear the making up's fun 
But then your hands talking 
fingers walking down your legs 
Hey, there's the faucet 
Someone's knocking like they know 
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching 
Your hand slides down the light 
And girl you know 
I brag about you to anyone outside 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime 
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine 
here we go 
And do it twice 'cause you know we like it 
And damn anybody if they disagree 
They don't understand you're just like me 
they don't know 
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it 
But then your hands talking, fingers walking 
down your legs 
Hey, there's the faucet 
Someone's knocking like they know 
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching 
Your hand slides down the light (light, light) 
And girl you know 
I brag about you to anyone outside 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
How do I ever explain what I've got with you? 
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth 
And nobody ever will understand what we do 
There's only one me and you 
Come here, hold me 
'Cause there's only one me and you 
Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh 
There's only one me and you 
You know there's only one me and you 
I brag about you to anyone outside 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I wrote this to let you know 
And I let them feelings show 
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride 
Ooh, I can't make them understand 
But you know I'm a Southern man 
A man of the woods and you're my pride 
Ohh, hey, hey 
A man of the woods, it's my pride 
Now let the beat ride like</field>

Anything you want, what's mine is yours 
But don't you worry about the way I talk, woo 
It's where I'm from, come and get you some, uh 
Hey, all of the locals are happy to get out 
and meet a new face 
We dance in circles, on and on, dosey-do 
and then we sway 
Even the old folks'll come out and rock 
And we just hopin' the music don't stop 'til the next day 
It's just a midnight summer's jam

Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror 
And I can't help but notice 
You reflect in this heart of mine 
If you ever feel alone and 
The glare makes me hard to find 
Just know that I'm always 
Parallel on the other side 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
Aren't you somethin', an original 
Cause it doesn't seem really as simple 
And I can't help but stare, cause 
I see truth somewhere in your eyes 
I can't ever change without you 
You reflect me, I love that about you 
And if I could, I 
Would look at us all the time 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me

That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
Yesterday is history 
And tomorrow's a mystery 
I can see you lookin' back at me 
Keep your eyes on me 
Keep your eyes on me 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now

You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life

You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
Baby, you're the inspiration for this precious song 
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on 
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone 
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home 
Just to let you know, you are 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life 
You are, you are the love of my life

And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night 
Look, I can't even get out of bed 
With the thoughts you putting in my head 
So I say to myself, "I don't even want to try" 
Here, every part of me is paralyzed

Yes I'm in love with you 
Laying here in the morning light 
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night 
I know I got somewhere to go 
But I'm thinking we should lay here in love (lay here in love) 
Ooh, 'cause baby, it's no lie 
Ooh, I could watch you 'til the day I die

What is it dawg? 
I forgot, it's Mother's Day. 
Didn't get a gift for her? 
Other plans got in the way. 
She'll be so disappointed. 
Damn I forgot it too. 
This could have been avoided. 
What the hell are we gonna do? 
My mom's been so alone, 
ever since my daddy left (cold) 
No one to hold her tight, 
life has put her to the test. 
I know just what you mean, 
my mom's been so sad and gray (word). 
My dad can't satisfy her in the bedroom 
ever since he passed away. 
Hold up. 
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? 
I'm thinkin' I'm thinkin' too 
Slow up 
What time is it dawg? 
It's time for a switcharoo 
We both love our moms, 
women with grown women needs 
I say we break ?em off 
Show ?em how much they really mean, 'cause 
I'm a mother lover 
You're a mother lover 
We should fuck each other's mothers 
Fuck each other's moms 
I'll be pushin' that lady, where you came out as a baby 
Ain't no doubt that shit is crazy 
Fucking each other's moms 
Cause every Mother's Day needs a Mother's Night 
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right 
I'm callin' on you 'cause I can't do it myself 
to me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover 
I'm layin' in the cut waitin' for your mom 
clutchin' on this lube and roses 
I got my digital camera, 
I'mma make ya' momma do a million poses 
They will be so surprised 
We are so cool and thoughtful 
Can't wait to pork your mom 
I'mma be the syrup, she can be my waffle 
Showed up 
My momma loves bubble bath with chamomile 
Straight up 
Give it to my mom d- d- d - d- d - d ? doggystyle 
(yeah) 
This the perfect plan for a perfect Mother's Day 
They'll have to rename this one 
All up under the covers day, ?cause 
I'm a mother lover 
You're a mother lover 
We should fuck each other's mothers 
Fuck each other's moms 
I'll be pushin' that lady, where you came out as a baby 
Ain't no doubt that shit is crazy 
Fucking each other's moms 
Break it down 
It would be my honor to be your new stepfather 
It would be my honor to be your new stepfather 
And while you're in my mother, 
make me another brother (yeah) 
And while I'm in your mother, I'll never use a rubber 
(oh!) 
Cause every Mother's Day needs a Mother's Night 
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right 
I'm callin' on you 'cause I can't do it myself 
to me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover 
They blessed us both with the gift of life 
She brought you in this world so I'm a sex her right 
This is the second best idea that we've ever had 
The choice can be no other 
Be my mother lover

Might end a man's life 
With that innocent face 
'Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next 
It's murder, murder 
You say I need to watch out 
Something might go down, good 
I really wanna take this under the ground 
Under the ground 
And I'mma be down to go to that level 
And even when you speak regular a sick freak, girl, I say ok 
So come on and leave me 
'Cause the deeper you take me the better 
You killin' me softly 
But we can go as hard as you want to 
Bed's way under the ground, under the ground 
And I'll be down and throw it at that level 
OOh that girl is murder (everybody get down) 
OOh that girl is murder (everybody get down) 
Under the lights and sound 
Everybody get down, down 
You know that she's a killer 
Watch it get down, watch it get down 
Watch it get down, watch it get down 
Murder 
You dancing around, hanging out the window 
Talking real big with your little slim waist 
And with all that below your waist 
Girl, you know the next scene is murder 
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down 
Girl, your body is gonna end up 
Under the ground, under the ground 
I would be down to go to that level 
And even when you dress regular a freak chick 
Girl, you complement my taste 
So girl don't be stingy 
The more that you give me the better 
You know you killin' me softly 
But we can go as hard as you want to 
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground 
I would be down to go to that level 
OOh that girl is murder (everybody get down) 
OOh that girl is murder (everybody get down) 
Under the lights and sound 
Everybody get down, down 
You know that she's a killer 
Watch it get down, watch it get down 
Watch it get down, watch it get down 
Murder 
[Jay-Z] 
Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono 
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo 
Know that shit gotta be lethal 
If that pussy broke up The Beatles 
Chocha ruined pop culture 
All them playa days is over 
Got me buying Rovers, rings 
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kaboom 
That bomb, that P 
It's a problem call the police 
Red bottoms, white sheets 
That's murder, she a beast 
Faces of death, she fine or what 
Suicide I'm trying to cut 
White chalk line 'em up 
Give new meaning to dying to fuck 
OOh that girl is murder (Everybody get down) 
OOh that girl is murder (Everybody get down) 
Under the lights and sound 
Everybody get down, down 
You know that she's a killer 
Watch it get down, watch it get down 
Watch it get down, watch it get down

Just to say how much you mean to me 
(What would you do?) 
If I told you you were beautiful 
Would you date me on the regular 
(Tell me, would you?) 
Well, baby I've been around the world 
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you) 
This ring here represents my heart 
But there's just one thing I need from you (say "I do") 
Yeah, because 
I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside 
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
You could be my baby, 
let me make you my lady 
Girl, you amaze me 
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy

Now, if I wrote you a love note 
And made you smile with every word I wrote

Would that make you want to change your scene 
And wanna be the one on my team (tell me, would you?) 
See, what's the point of waiting anymore?

Shorty, cool as a fan 
On the new once again 
Still has fan from Peru to Japan 
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan 
If you got a man, try to lose him if you can 
Cause the girls real wild throw their hands up high 
Wanna come kick it with a stand up guy 
You don't really wanna let the chance go by 
Because you ain't been seen wit a man so fly 
Friend so fly I can go fly 
Private, cause I handle mine 
Call me candle guy, simply because I am on fire 
I hate to have to cancel my vacation 
so you can't deny 
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try 
You don't come, I ain't gonna die 
Hold up, what you mean, 
you can't go why? 
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie 
You say you wanna kick it with an ace so high 
Baby, you decide that I ain't your guy 
Ain't gon lie, Me in your space 
But forget your face, I swear I will 
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill 
Just bring wit me a pair, I will 
I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside 
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
You could be my baby,

Guess it's true what they say about love 
It's blind 
Girl, you lied straight to my face 
Lookin in my eyes 
And I believed you cause I loved you more than life 
And all you had to do 
Was apologize 
You didn't say you're sorry 
I don't understand 
You don't care that you hurt me 
And now I'm half the man 
That I used to be when it was you and me 
You didn't love me enough 
My heart may never mend 
And you'll never get to love me, again 
No, no, no, no, no, no 
Sadness has me at the end of the line 
Helpless, watched you break this heart of mine 
And loneliness only wants you back here with me 
Common sense knows that you're not 
Good enough for me 
And all you had to do 
Was apologize, and mean it 
But you didn't say you're sorry 
I don't understand 
You don't care that you hurt me 
And now I'm half the man 
That I used to be when it was you and me 
You didn't love me enough 
My heart may never mend 
And you'll never get to love me 
Wish like hell I could go back in time 
Maybe then I could see how 
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try 
But it's too late, it's over now 
You didn't say you're sorry 
I don't understand 
You don't care that you hurt me 
And now I'm half the man 
That I used to be when it was you and me 
You didn't love me enough 
My heart may never mend

You picked the perfect day to bump into me (perfect day) 
Probably should watch the stars in the sky the night before (hey..) 
For some reason we still met at your store 
You baby 
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell 
And I have my whole life 
and I listen well 
Hey.. 
Look I'll be the confidant 
Tell me anything... 
Please start it off with how you took your wings 
Oh ohhh, ooh.. 
There's nothing else that I have seen 
There's no getting around it or in between 
You're out of this world 
Except you're not green 
Look 
You don't know what you mean to me (to me) 
All my friends meet you and say you're the one (you're the one. 
you're the one) 
And all my meaningless friendships should be done (I should just leave them alone) 
Baby hey hey 
You had a friend 
But he did you wrong 
But I'm a God-sent sign that reads please move on (with me) 
You taught me to use my heart and to forget my eyes (use my heart, forget my eyes) 
And that's the way to his kingdom of eternal life (ohh hey hey hey) 
Since you're an angel baby, you're job's never done 
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 911 
That's why, 
There's nothing else that I have seen 
There's no getting around it or in between (you.. 
ohh) 
You're out of this world 
Except you're not green 
Look 
You don't know what you mean to me (to me..) 
There's nothing else that I have seen 
There's no getting around it or in between 
You're out of this world 
Except you're not green 
Look 
You don't know what you mean to me (to me..) 
There's nothing else in this world, like you 
That's why it's so complicated, what are you afraid of? 
Oh oh.. 
I've been asking everybody what they think 
Yeah yeah 
I don't know why because they don't know you 
Oh oh 
I've been asking other guys what would they say 
Hey yeah 
I don't know why cause they don't do what I do 
Oh no 
Girl, say an ultimatum for 
Yeah yeah 
But you'd probably just take that and run 
Oh no 
Now I gotta decide if I'm gonna help raise you right 
Yeah yeah 
So now the ultimatum's on me, that's no fun

What am I gonna do with all this damn love? 
Is this sheet insane or insane love? 
I guess that's the way we play

'Cause you don't wanna light up this torch 
'Cause I'll burn it down all the way 
Burn it down 'til it ain't no more 
Damn, love, how did the sound get so amped up?. 
Turn off and silence this damn love 
Is this sheet insane or insane love?

She loves me now, she loves me not 
She loves me now but only when I walk away 
Cold, so cold 
Only when I walk away 
Ooh so cold 
Only when I walk away 
Ooh so cold 
Only when I walk away 
Ooh so cold 
Only when I walk away 
Cold, so cold, cold, so cold 
But only when I walk away 
But only when I walk away 
But only when I walk away 
She loves me now, she loves me not 
She loves me now but only when I walk away 
She loves me now, she loves me not 
She loves me now but only when I walk away 
Only when I walk away 
Only when I walk away 
What am I gonna do with all this damn love? 
What am I gonna do with all this?.. 
Only when I walk away 
(hold up, hold up) 
Only when I walk away 
Only when I walk away 
She only love me when I walk away 
Call me on the phone, tell me "baby, please stay" 
She only love me when I walk away 
Calling, yelling, begging, crying "baby, please stay" 
She only love me when I walk away 
Call me on the phone and tell me baby do you stay 
She only love me when I walk away 
Calling, yelling, begging, crying "baby, please stay" 
She only love me when I walk away 
Call me on the phone, tell me "baby, please stay" 
She only love me when I walk away 
Calling, yelling, begging, crying "baby, please stay" 
She only love me when I walk away 
Call me on the phone, tell me "baby, please stay" 
She only love me when I walk away 
Calling, yelling, begging, crying "baby, please stay" 
She only love me when I walk away 
Call me on the phone, tell me "baby, please stay" 
She only love me when I walk away 
Calling, yelling, begging, crying "baby, please stay"

            <field name="lyrics">If I had a pair of wings 
I'd pick you and fly you far away from here 
And you'd put your worries upon my shoulders 
My dear 
Now I know I can't save you 
From the troubles of the world 
And this sounds like such a silly thing 
But if I could fly you away 
With a big old pair of wings 
And if I had a pair of wings 
I'd pick you and fly you far away from here 
And we'd fly so high up in the sky 
Where the stars are so clear 
And then I could save you 
From the troubles of the world 
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring 
And there we are, you and me 
Flying on a big ol' pair of wings 
We keep getting older 
The world keeps getting colder 
Tell me when did we lose our way? 
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days 
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for 
There's only one thing that'll do 
I'll fly away on this pair of wings with you 
If I had a pair of wings 
I'd scoop you up we'd fly away and disappear 
And you could put your worries upon my shoulders 
My dear 
Now I know I can't save you 
From the troubles of the world 
And this sounds like such a silly thing 
But if I could fly you away 
On a big old pair of wings 
And if I had a pair of wings 
I'd pick you and fly you far away from here 
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near 
And then I could save you from the troubles of the world 
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring 
And there we are, you and me 
Flying on a big ol' pair of wings 
We keep getting older 
The world keeps getting colder 
Tell me when did we lose our way? 
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days 
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for 
There's only one thing that'll do 
I'll fly away on this pair of wings with you 
If I had one wish I know what I'd wish for 
There's only one thing that'll do 
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you 
I said if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for 
There's only one thing that'll do 
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you</field>

In the powder room 
Talking to your girlfriends, your girlfriends 
Who were lookin' in the mirror

Lookin so fine, Maybeline applying maybe later you'll 
give me your time 
And 
[Chorus] 
Let me take your picture [x3] 
Come on baby 
Won't you pose for my camera 
Lookin' like a model, lookin' like a superstar 
You're out of sight 
I saw you last night 
(hey girl) 
In the disco dancing with your girlfiends, your 
girlfriends 
Y'all were dancing to my shit (LILY riff) like this 
Shakin' hips, maybe I could capture you on camera and 
take a flick 
[Chorus] 
[Chorus 2] 
So pose pose pose 
Only for my photos 
Expose, expose 
Those things you want to show 
Just pose pose pose 
Only for my photos 
Expose, expose 
Those things you want to show 
[Snoop] 
Hey yo Jt, let me holler at baby real quick,

I want to try this out on her 
one time, dig this 
Head, shoulders, feet and toes, 
Work that body go'on and pose 
Please the crowd, easy now 
Go ahead baby girl cheese and smile 
She said Mr 
Mr., would it be cool if I took a 
picture

To hang it on the wall with the rest of the best 
I had her back in an hour or less 
He say she say we say play, 
doggy dog take it easy 
it's time to expose 
I'll break off the rolls 
Now take off your clothes 
Get real close up under the light 
And do that thing 
Sho your right 
Now close the doors 
Now you can really give it to me 
go on, strike a pose 
I saw you last night, 
(hey girl) 
at the café 
but you wasn't with your girlfriends, your 
girlfriends 
So I stepped up to ya 
(hey girl) 
I pursued ya cause I couldn't stand to wait 
let's date 
That'd be great 
Wait! Stop and picture, baby stop and picture, baby 
stop and picture 
Me with you girl, you know I can handle ya 
Treat you like a queen, treat you like a superstar 
You're outta sight 
[repeat]

            <field name="lyrics">Toe to toe dancing very close 
Body breathing almost comatose 
Wall to wall people hypnotized 
And they're stepping lightly 
Hang each night in rapture 
Back to back sacroiliac 
Spineless movement and a wild attack 
Face to face sightless solitude 
And it's finger popping 
Twenty four hour shopping in rapture 
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly 
Dj spinning I said "My My" 
Flash is fast flash is cool 
Francois c'est pas flashe non due 
And you don't stop sure shot 
Go out to the parking lot 
And you get in your car and drive real far 
And you drive all night and then you see a light 
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground 
And out comes the man from Mars 
And you try to run but he's got a gun 
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head 
And then you're in the man from Mars 
You go out at night eating cars 
You eat Cadillacs Lincolns too 
Mercurys and Subaru 
And you don't stop 
You keep on eating cars 
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night 
And eat up bars where the people meet 
Face to face 
Dance cheek to cheek 
One to one 
Man to man 
Dance toe to toe 
Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars 
is through with cars 
He's eating bars 
Yeah wall to wall 
Door to door 
Hall to hall 
He's gonna eat 'em all 
Rapture 
Be pure 
Take a tour through the sewer 
Don't strain your brain 
Paint a train 
You'll be singing in the rain 
Said don't stop to the punk rock 
back to back, body muscular spinless movement 
bite the jugular one to one 
(?) technology 
And a ardour, no sign of saviour in Rapture 
Well now you see what you wanna be 
Just have your party on Tv 
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars 
where the Tv's on 
And now he's gone back up to space 
where he won't have a hassle with the 
human race 
And you hip hop 
And you don't stop 
Just blast off sure shot 
Because the man from Mars stopped eating cars 
And eating bars 
And now he only eats guitars 
Get up!</field>

When we first met I never felt something so strong 
You were like my lover and my best friend 
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it 
And all of a sudden you went and left 
I didn't know how to follow 
It's like a shock that spun me around 
And now my heart's dead 
I feel so empty and hollow 
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave 
it to you 
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do 
you? 
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back 
And you're the one to blame 
And now I feel like....oh! 
You're the reason why I'm thinking 
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more 
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking 
Should've never let you enter my door 
Next time you wanna go on and leave 
I should just let you go on and do it 
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed 
It's like I checked into rehab 
And baby, you're my disease 
It's like I checked into rehab 
And baby, you're my disease 
I gotta check into rehab 
'Cause baby you're my disease 
I gotta check into rehab 
'Cause baby you're my disease 
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're loveswept 
You'd do anything for the one you love 
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there 
It's like you were my favorite drug 
The only problem is that you was using me 
In a different way than I was using you 
But now that I know it's not meant to be 
I gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you 
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave 
it to you 
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do 
you? 
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back

Looking so damn right you're wrong

The way the thing just wiggle in the air 
Turn around and then you flip your hair 
I could think of a couple positions for you 
Your wasting no time talking to me 
Must be something you want me to see 
Well baby girl don't mind me if I do 
So take the stage just show me what you got 
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot

You did the shake-shake and I kinda went beserk 
Gotta give it to you girl you're one of a kind 
When you took my hand up so calm 
Touched it to your cherry lip balm 
A million nasty things went through my mind 
So baby tell me what you're doing later on 
'Cause I'm thinking me and you could get along 
Baby girl don't mind me if I do

Come on girl, close your eyes pretend it's your home

Other dudes be huggin and nourishin her, not me

Don't be so quick to walk away 
Dance with me 
I wanna rock your body 
Please stay 
Dance with me 
You don't have to admit you wanna play 
Dance with me 
Just let me rock you 
Till the break of day 
Dance with me 
Talk to me boy 
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm 
Talk to me boy 
I can't wait to have you in my arms 
Talk to me boy 
Hurry up cause you're taking too long 
Talk to me boy 
Better have you naked by the end of this song 
So what did you come for 
I came to dance with you 
And you know that you don't want to hit the floor 
I came to romance with you 
You're searching for love forever more 
It's time to take a chance 
If love is here on the floor, girl 
Hey 
Dance with me 
Yea 
Come on baby 
Don't be so quick to walk away (Don't walk away) 
(Come on and...) 
Dance with me 
I wanna rock your body (Let me rock your body) 
Please stay (Come on and...) 
Dance with me 
You don't have to admit you wanna play 
(You don't have to admit you wanna play, just) 
Dance with me 
Just let me rock you (Do do do do) 
Till the break of day (Come on and...) 
Dance with me 
Talk to me boy 
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm 
Talk to me boy 
But I can't wait to have you in my arms 
Talk to me boy 
Hurry up cause you're taking too long 
Talk to me boy 
Better have you naked by the end of this song 
Don't be so quick to walk away 
(Just think of me and you) 
Don't be so quick to walk away 
(We could do something) 
Don't be so quick to walk away 
(I like the way you look right now) 
Don't be so quick to walk away (Come over here baby) 
Are you feeling me?

Let's make a bet 
Cause I, gotta have you naked by the end of this song</field>

            <field name="lyrics">Come here baby, tell me what you doing with him? 
I bet you'll want me once you catch up to my rythym 
You gotta pay attention to me like a symptom 
This shit got me amped up, ritalin 
Now don't be fool, I ball like a laker 
I wipe that smelly shit away like erasers 
And I never missed the mark like a maker 
But you know I'm from the south, yeah yer 
Maybe me standing here this is evolved 
Maybe you should be more like me, involved 
I'm going hard like the opposite of soft 
Now clap on applause 
Maybe you just mad cause I am who you wanna be 
Maybe I'm a canvas you paint what you wanna see 
Maybe you're right, maybe I'm an asshole 
Oops, did I take it too far? Super bowl 
I'ma still grab my balls, I'm on a roll 
Yeah I'm that white boy shooting free throws 
Automatic, Kobe but 2 to go 
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role 
Freeze, now put your fingers up 
I got a rocket in my pocket, 
Everybody on their knees 
That means I make the rules so pay attention to me 
You don't want to piss me off 
Cause I might fuck around and squeeze 
You can get you some of these nuts 
Cause I'm going in my own direction 
If you don't like it you can cut your tv off 
Do it at your own discretion 
And no apologies I'm on one soaking love 
Role model, a role model, a role model 
I'm not a role model, I'm not a role model 
Role model, a role model, a role model 
I'm not a role model, I'm not a role model 
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role 
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role 
Freeze, you think 
I give a damn or worry about what these suckers think of me 
Baby my name is Free and I do whatever I please 
So keep it pretty, these bitches 7 inches away from me 
Or they might end up on these, nuts 
Cause I'm going in my own direction 
If you don't like it you can cut your tv off 
You can view it at your own discretion 
And no apologies I'm on one soaking love 
Role model, a role model, a role model 
I'm not a role model, I'm not a role model 
Role model, a role model, a role model 
I'm not a role model, I'm not a role model 
I ain't your mama, your daddy, your granny, cousin or uncle 
In fact, I don't even know you, you follow me on my Twitter 
But that don't mean that you know me 
So tell me how did you figured that I'm supposed to be bigger 
And try to handle my temper 
But if you knew me remember, the 25 of December, 
When I decided for no reason and then because.. 
preacher 
And yes I'm breaking some habits, no matter how hard you push 
You can judge me or love me 
Or you can grow you some nuts 
Cause I'm going in my own direction 
If you don't like it you can cut your tv off 
You can view it at your own discretion 
And no apologies I'm on one soaking love 
Role model, a role model, a role model 
I'm not a role model, I'm not a role model 
Role model, a role model, a role model X 2 
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role 
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role.

But the sauce, the sauce is forever 
Ooh, sauce

So, go ahead, say I won't 
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone 
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover 
and I can name three or four 
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes 
like you know somethin' I don't 
Hold up 
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me 
It's always loose screws when you get close to me 
It's like too much to describe, yeah 
it's enough for two lives

Ooh, I love your pink, you like my purple

Ooh (yeah) 
Everyone knows all about my direction 
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there 
Still I don't go there 
Everybody says "say something" 
Say something, say something 
Then say something, say something, 
then say something 
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it 
But I can't help myself, no 
I can't help myself, no, no 
Caught up in the middle of it 
No I can't help myself 
No I can't help myself, no, no, no 
Caught up in the rhythm of it 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
(maybe I'm looking something that I can't have) 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Everyone knows all about my transgressions 
Still in my heart somewhere 
there's melody and harmony 
For you and me, tonight (whoa) 
I hear them call my name 
Everybody says "say something" 
Then say something, say something 
Then say something, say something 
then say something 
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it 
But I can't get help myself, no 
I can't help myself, no, no 
Caught up in the middle of it 
No I can't help myself 
no I can't help myself, no, no, no 
Caught up in the rhythm of it 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something 
is to say nothing at all 
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something

It's my pleasure to introduce to you 
He's a friend of mine 
Yes, yes I am 
And he goes by the name.. 
(haha) 
Justin 
Wowwww 
All the way 
from Memphis, Tennessee 
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight 
He's gonna sing a song for y'all 
About this girl 
Come in right here? 
Yea, come on 
On that sunny day didn't know I'd meet, 
Such a beautiful girl walking down the street 
Seen those bright brown eyes 
With tears coming down (so he said to himself) 
She deserves a crown 
But where is it now 
Mama listen 
Señorita, I feel for you 
You deal with things, that you don't have to 
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm 
But you could feel this real love 
If you just lay in my 
Running fast in my mind 
Girl won't you slow it down 
If we carry on this way this thing might leave the ground 
How would you like to fly? 
That's how my queen should ride 
But you still deserve a crown 
Well hasn't it been found? 
Mama listen.. 
Señorita, I feel for you (feel for you) 
You deal with things, that you don't have to (no, no) 
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm 
(he don't love ya baby) 
But you could feel this real love (feel it) 
If you just lay in my... 
Ah, ah, arms... 
(Won't you lay in my) 
Ah, ah, arms... 
(Mama lay in my) 
Ah, ah, arms... 
(Baby won't you lay in my) 
Ah, ah, arms... 
When I look into your eyes 
I see something that money can't buy 
And I know if you give us a try 
I'll work hard for you girl 
And no longer will you ever have to cry... 
Señorita, I feel for you 
You deal with things, that you don't have to 
(Deal with things you don't have to) 
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm (no, no) 
But you could feel this real love (feel it) 
If you just lay in my... 
Ah, ah, arms... 
(Whoa) 
Ah, ah, arms... 
(My baby) 
Ah, ah, arms... 
(Oooh, yea) 
Ah, ah, arms... 
Now listen, 
I wanna try some right now, 
See they don't do this anymore. 
I'ma sing something 
And I want the guys to sing with me 
They go: 
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?" 
And then the ladies go 
"I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you" 
Guys sing! 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
And ladies.. 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you 
Feels good don't it? Come on 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
Yea, ladies 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you 
Show the good to me 
Sing it one more time 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
Ladies, 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you 
Yea, yea.. 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
Ladies, 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you

Love was changing the minds of pretenders 
While chasing the clouds away 
Our hearts were ringing 
In the key that our souls were singing 
As we danced in the night 
Remember, how the stars stole the night away 
Ba de ya 
Say do you remember 
Ba de ya 
Dancing in september 
Ba de ya 
Never was a cloudy day 
My thoughts are with you 
Holding hands with your heart to see you 
Only blue talk and love 
Remember, how we knew 
Love was here to stay 
Now december found the love 
That we shared in september 
Only blue talk and love 
Remember, the true love we share today 
Ba de ya 
Say do you remember 
Ba de ya 
Dancing in september 
Ba de ya 
Never was a cloudy day 
Ba de ya 
Say do you remember 
Ba de ya 
Dancing in september 
Ba de ya 
Golden dreams were shiny days 
The bell was ringing 
Our souls were singing 
Do you remember 
Never was a cloudy day 
Ba de ya 
Say do you remember 
Ba de ya 
Dancing in september 
Ba de ya 
Never was a cloudy day 
Ba de ya 
Say do you remember 
Ba de ya 
Dancing in september

Golden dreams were shiny days

You ain't gotta worry no more 
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em 
As soon as I walk in the door 
These dude don't know me from Adam and Eve 
That's why they can't mess up my flow 
And when this beat drops, your heart stops 
You feel it from your head to your toes 
If you know what I'm talking 'bout 
Let me see you work it out 
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout 
I got sexy ladies all over the floor 
You're talking to one of the greatest 
Who did it before 
Now I'm back with one of my latest 
Just letting you know 
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more 
Let me take it off 
I know a little girly from uptown 
Just waiting just to cater to me 
I know a little betty from downtown 
That'll do anything that I please 
All my other people that dance around 
When they hear me rocking the groove 
Now it might sound cocky 
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true 
If you know what I'm talking 'bout 
Let me see you work it out 
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout

You know we is in Tune with the season 
Come here baby, tell me why you leavin'? 
Tell me if it's weed that you need 
If you wanna breathe 
I got the best weed, minus seeds 
Ain't nobody trippin VIP they can't get in 
If something goes wrong then you know...

No 
Shit, she ain't gotta be in a distance 
She can get high all in an instant.

Hey, I wrote this song for you 
Listen 
Everybody's looking for the flyest thing to say 
(Flyest thing to say) 
But I just wanna fly 
(Fly away with you, you, you, you) 
I don't wanna be the one to alienate, yeah (Alienate) 
You see, I'm trying to find an alien in you, you, you 
(if it's cool, cool) 
We can't take an airplane 
Where we're going is way too high 
Going where the day sky turns into night 
I got the windows special tinted for the stars 
That get too bright 
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride 
Hop into my spaceship coupe 
There's only room for two (Me and you) 
And with the top down we'll cruise around 
Land and make love on the moon 
Would you like that? 
Hop into my spaceship coupe 
There's only room for two (Me and you) 
And with the top up you wrap up 
In my space lover cocoon 
And I love it when I hear you say 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Sing to me 
I love it when I hear you say 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Sing to me 
Now everybody knows that you're from outer space 
(Outer space) 
But honey, I just want to turn out this space with you 
(You, you, you, you) 
So drive me to your galaxy where I could play, yeah

And sugar I'll take my time 
And show you the backseat view, view

Go on and sing to me 
Now break it down 
Hey, this is the part 
Where you and me and all of the stars collide tonight 
This is the part 
Where we take off 
And then we fly far away, far away, far away 
Hop into my spaceship coupe

I can't seem to breathe 
Feels like it hasn't been that long 
Since you walked away from me 
Now I can try to act real strong 
But you and I both know 
I still think of you that way 
And you should know, that 
The beautiful lights, the star-filled nights 
They don't mean a thing 
Cause you were my star 
So it don't seem right 
Without you here with me 
Now I can try to act real strong 
But you and I both know 
It's hard for me to say 
You were my soul 
Now I could say that I don't love you no more 
And I could say that I've closed the door, for our love 
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways 
But baby I just wouldn't be the same 
'Cause girl your love is still on my brain 
Now when you're in love 
It takes time to heal 
When someone's broken your heart 
And changed just how you feel 
Girl I thought that you'd never do me that way 
But even after all I still think of you that way 
Now I could say that I don't love you no more 
(I could say this, I could say this) 
And I could say that I've closed the door, for our love 
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways 
But baby I just wouldn't be the same 
'Cause girl your love is still on my brain 
Now love is a game 
That we both like to play 
Well will I win or lose if I go or if I stay, yea 
Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside 
Girl you know me inside-out 
I can't get you off of my mind 
Now I could say that I don't love you no more 
(I could say that I, yea yea) 
And I could say that I've closed the door, for our love 
(Closed the door) 
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways 
(No no) 
But baby I just wouldn't be the same 
(Wouldn't be the same) 
'Cause girl your love is still on my brain 
(Still on my brain)

Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you 
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow day 
When you walk by, the sun shine 
Mellow, mellow, mellow day 
I, I cant deny the way 
You caught my eye 
I mean something struck and refilled up the sky 
And everything on you intoxicates 
It's a mystery, I dont know why 
I let you get in my do not disturb zone 
But I guess your mouth emotion got me so high 
And I could tell this pure just by the tale 
And you kiss me 
So tell me you wanna get close 
Somewhere far away 
Dont worry about your loving it wont go to waste 
Dont ever change your flavor cause I love the taste 
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way 
Cause she's just like nothing 
That I ever seen before 
Baby please dont change nothing 
Because your flavor is so original 
And it all started when she said 
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum 
You really got me when you said 
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum 
This goes out to you, this goes out to you 
So tell why, we're making love 
like professionals on the first time 
Acting up professional but the worst time 
You shouldnt wanna work your inner way 
And baby i, i, girl im all addicted and I wont fight 
You and me best the recipe for a good time 
And it aint really nothing best close in the way 
Tell me you wanna get close 
Somewhere far away 
Dont worry about your loving it wont go to waste 
Dont ever change your flavor cause I love the taste

Come in, sit down 
Let me elevate your appetite 
Any flavor you want 
Now my selection is the tasty kind 
But you, you're delicious on your own 
After I break you down my fingers 
You're so sweet 
That's what you told me when I taste on your lips 
Duck under the door 
Girl before they pick up your scent 
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum 
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop 
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum 
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop 
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop 
Strawberry bubblegum

Hey, get out your seat, Hov 
All black at the white shows 
White shoes at the black shows 
Green card for the Cuban links 
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show 
Nothing exceeds like excess 
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best 
Is this what it's all about? 
I'm at the restaurant 
My rant disturbing the guests 
Years of distress, tears on the dress 
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex 
This is truffle season 
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason 
All saints for my angel 
Alexander Wang too 
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks 
I'll show you how to do this young! 
No papers, catch vapors 
Get high, out Vegas 
D'Usses on doubles ain't looking for trouble 
You just got good jeans so a nigga tryna cuff you 
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you 
Tell your father we go farther as a couple 
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son 
I show you how to do this, hun! 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight

Love is swinging in the air tonight 
Let me show you a few things

Show you a few things about love 
Let me show you a few things

Going hot so hot, just like an oven 
And oww, burned myself, but just had to touch it 
But it's so fire and it's all mine 
Hey baby 
We don't mind all the watching 
Cause if they study close, real close 
They might learn something 
She ain't nothing but a little doozie when she does it 
She's so fire tonight 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines 
Let me show you a few things

So thick 
Now I know why they call it a fatty 
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit 
But that's alright, cause you're all mine 
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy 
I guess they're just mad cause girl 
They wish they had it 
My killer, my thiller

Hey 
Swing that way 
Swing yhat way 
All black at the white shows 
White shoes at the black shows 
Green card for the Cuban links 
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show 
Nothing exceeds like excess 
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best 
Is this what it's all about? 
I'm at the restaurant 
My rant disturbing the guests 
Years of distress, tears on the dress 
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex 
This is truffle season 
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason 
All saints for my angel 
Alexander Wang too 
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks 
I'll show you how to do this young! 
No papers, catch vapors 
Get high, out Vegas 
D'Usses on doubles ain't looking for trouble 
You just got good jeans so a nigga tryna cuff you 
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you 
Tell your father we go farther as a couple 
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son 
I show you how to do this, hun! 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines 
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white 
And you're dressed in that dress I like

Saw you switchin' lanes girl 
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right 
Come let me get your name girl 
Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like 
Let me pick your brain girl 
And tell me how they got 
that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl 
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out 
Bet you we could have some fun girl 
'Cause we can do it fast (fast), 
slow, whichever way you wanna run girl 
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings 
Do it how you want it done girl 
And who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I 
I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
Come on and lemme show you 'round 
Let me take you out, bet you we could have some fun girl 
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down 
Any way you want it done girl 
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone 
Rappin' 'til we see the sun girl 
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you that I'm the one girl 
Well I'mma freak you right, each and every night 
I know how to do it insane girl 
'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop 
Make you wanna say my name girl 
Come on baby please 'cause I'm on my knees 
Can't get you off my brain girl 
But who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I 
I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
The summer's over for the both of us 
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love 
You're the one I've been thinking of 
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one 
Oh!I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

Put your filthy hands all over me 
And no, this ain't the clean version 
And what you gonna do with all that meat? 
Cookin' up a mean servin' 
No question, I want it 
Fire up, everybody smokin' 
Your friends, my friends 
And they ain't leavin' till six in the morning (six in the morning) 
Caught a chill, baby, you the coldest 
Go far, put 'em on notice 
If you know what I want, then yeah 
Baby, don't you mind if I do, yeah 
Exactly what you like times two, yeah 
Got me singin', "ooh, ooh" 
So baby, don't you mind if I do 
Got time, but I don't mind 
Just wanna rock you girl 
I'll have what ever you have 
Come on, just give it up girl 
See I've been watching you 
I like the way you move 
So go ahead, girl, just do 
That ass shaking thing you do 
So you grab your girls 
And you grab a couple more 
And you all come meet me 
In the middle of the floor 
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right 
So you blast to the left and you sail to the right 
Don't be so quick to walk away 
Dance with me 
I wanna rock your body 
Please stay 
Dance with me 
You don't have to admit you wanna play 
Dance with me 
Just let me rock you 
Till the break of day 
Now, all my ladies say 
Talk to me boy 
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm 
Talk to me boy 
I can't wait to have you in my arms 
Talk to me boy 
Hurry up cause you're taking too long 
Talk to me boy 
Hold on, stop 
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to intruduce to you 
The Tenessee Kids and it goes like 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you 
I'm bringin' sexy back 
Them other boys don't know how to act! 
I think it's special what's behind your back 
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack! 
(Take em' to the bridge!) 
Dirty babe 
You see these shackles? Baby I'm your slave 
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave! 
It's just that no one makes me feel this way 
Let me hear you sing the chorus! C'mon! 
Come here girl! 
(Go 'head be gone with it!) 
Come to the back

I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside 
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
You could be my baby 
let me make you my lady 
Girl, you amaze me 
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy 
See, all I want you to do is be my love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love 
You don't have to say, what you did 
I already know, I found out from him 
Now there's just no chance, for you and me 
there'll never be 
And don't it make you sad about it? 
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river, oh 
Cry me a river, oh 
Cry me a river, oh 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines 
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white 
And you dressed in that dress I like 
Love is swinging in the air tonight 
Let me show you a few things 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
I woke up this morning 
And heard the TV saying something 
About disaster in the world 
It made me wonder where I'm going 
There's so much darkness in the world 
But I see beauty left in you girl 
And what you give me lets me know that I'll be alright 
Cause if your love was all I had in this life 
Well that would be enough until the end of time 
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind 
Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time 
I'm not a woman 
I'm not a man 
I am something that you'll never understand 
I'll never beat you 
I'll never lie 
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by 
Cause you, I would die for you, yeah 
Darlin', if you want me too 
You, I would die for you 
You're just a sinner I am told 
Be your fire when you're cold 
Make you happy when you're sad 
Make you good when you are bad 
I'm not a human, I am a dove 
I'm your conscience, I am love 
All I really need is to know that you believe (Yeah) 
I would die for you 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
I got this feeling inside my bones 
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on 
All through my city, all through my home 
We're flying up, no ceiling 
when we in our zone 
I got that sunshine in my pocket 
Got that good song in my feet 
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it 
Moving so phenomenally 
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop 
Under the lights when everything goes 
Nowhere to hide 
when I'm getting you close 
When we move, well, you already know 
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine 
I can't stop the feeling 
Nothing I can see but you 
when you dance, dance, dance 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you 
So just dance, dance, dance, come on 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
All those things I should do to you 
But you dance, dance, dance 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing 
Put your hands up 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Got this feeling in my body 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Got this feeling in my body 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Wanna see you move your body 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Got this feeling in my body, come on</field>

Met you out on Broadway 
On the hottest night in town 
We arrived solo 
But we were being chasing around 
Saw you being caught up by some guy you used to know 
Stepped in between the both of ya'll 
Said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go? " 
'Cause 
I'll be the light when you can't see 
I'll be the wood when you need heat 
I'll be the generator 
Turn me on when you need electricity 
Some shit's 'bout to go down 
I'll be the one with the level head 
The world can end now 
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead 
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies 
Supplie-ie-ies 
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies 
Supplie-ie-ies 
I don't know if you remember this 
But I was out of town 
Flew in on a 3AM just to show up and hear your sounds 
The multiple times, stop 
Hit the set 
You ain't headed that way 
I can guarantee you that 
I'll be the light when you can't see 
I'll be the wood when you need heat 
I'll be the generator 
Turn me on when you need electricity 
Some shit's about to go down 
I'll be the one with the level head

Ain't no need of stopping, girl 
Can't nobody top it, girl 
Ain't no better option, girl (okay) 
Ain't nobody stopping, girl 
This here when I drop it, girl 
I work, work when I clock in, girl (okay) 
I'll be the light when you can't see 
I'll be the wood when you need heat 
I'll be the generator 
Turn me on when you need electricity 
Some shit's about to go down 
I'll be the one with the level head 
The world can end now 
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead 
Now I wanna know everything 
Don't leave a single detail out 
I'll get my lighter, just fell out 
It makes me a generous lover 
Oh, I wanna see everything 
So don't leave a single detail out 
I want it all on the table 
The personal way to 
Wait 
Ain't no need of stopping, girl 
There ain't no need of stopping, girl

When you see how I put your life before mine 
With no question 
When all the love feels gone 
And you can't carry on 
Don't worry, girl 
I'ma take it from here 
Just as sure as the sun will shine 
Every morning, everytime 
Don't worry, girl 
I'ma take it from here 
I wanna hold your hands 
Review all your plans 
I wanna make sure everyone of your dreams is there 
I would be your broadway show on review 
So I can act out how God was when he made you 
I wanna be your lighthouse when you get lost 
I'll light a bright and shiny path to help you across 
I wanna be your mother, wait 
See what I see 
And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me 
Cause I love you 
When all the love feels gone 
And you can't carry on 
Don't worry, girl 
I'ma take it from here 
Just as sure as the sun will shine 
Every morning, everytime 
Don't worry, girl (no no) 
I'ma take it from here 
And when there's no one there to hold 
And you realize the world is cold 
Don't worry, girl 
I'ma take it from here 
That's what I'm gonna do 
Just as sure as the sun will shine 
Every morning, everytime 
(Don't you worry, baby) 
Don't worry, girl 
I'ma take it from here 
Give me one reason why we should not be leaving 
This world is so deceiving, the time is now 
Let's fly away speeding 
Through the Garden of Eden 
Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds 
When all the love feels gone 
And you can't carry on 
Don't worry, girl 
I'ma take it from here 
Just as sure as the sun will shine 
Every morning, everytime 
Don't worry, girl (no no) 
I'ma take it from here 
Give me one reason 
Why we should not be leaving 
This world is so deceiving 
The time is now 
Lets fly away speeding 
(We'll fly away) 
Through the Garden of Eden 
Where all the sweet and breathing 
Of love surrounds 
When all the love feels gone 
And you can't carry on 
Don't worry, girl 
I'm-a take it from here 
Just as sure as the sun will shine 
Every morning, everytime 
Don't worry, girl 
I'm-a take it from here 
Love ain't always the way they write in books 
(No, no) 
See there's the good guys 
And also heartbreak crooks 
Your hearts the real one 
Just take a look inside 
'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide 
So there you go 
Don't worry 
To help you weather the storm 
I'll be there mami 
No matter what time 
No matter what place 
You can always count on me 
I'll take it from here.</field>

I knew it was love from a mile away 
But I had to catch ya 
Been running through my mind all day baby 
And theyll say I'm crazy 
Cause anybody even when your father said 
That I can't be with you 
I don't hear a word they say 
Cause I'm in love with that girl 
So don't be mad at me 
Cause I'm in love with that girl 
So don't be mad at me 
So what you're from the other side of the track 
So what the world don't think we match 
I put it down like my love's on wax 
I'm in love with that girl 
And she told me 
That she's in love with me 
Now we didn't have to fall 
But we fell in love to the bottom babe 
No one there to catch us like 
When you fell from heaven that day baby 
People always staring 
But I don't even care nothing about it babe 
Cause since I saw your face 
I've been staring just the same yeah hmm 
I'm in love with that girl 
So don't be mad at me 
I'm in love with that girl 
So don't be mad at me 
So what you're from the other side of the track 
So what the world don't think we match 
I put it down like my love's on wax 
I'm in love with that girl 
And she told me 
That she's in love with me 
My pretty lady 
You'll always be my baby baby baby 
It's so amazing how you became my baby baby baby 
My little daisy come here 
Let me rock it like a baby baby baby 
Pretty lady don't you know 
You'll always be my baby baby baby 
Don't it seem like these days 
That everybody's got something to say 
But I don't pay attention to the talk babe 
And I don't really care if they stop and stare 
Cause this seat my number one, my number one girl 
I told you I'm in love with that girl 
So don't be mad at me 
I'm in love with that girl 
So don't be mad at me 
So what you're from the other side of the track 
So what the world don't think we match 
I put it down like my love's on wax

Oohh, yeah 
Anybody can be in love on a sunny day 
Anybody can turn and run when it starts to rain 
And everybody wishes all the skies were blue

So give me the hard stuff 
The kind that makes you real 
I'll be there when the storm comes 
'Cause I want the hard stuff 
When they're throwin' sticks and stones 
We can cut each other to the bone 
I'm never gonna give you up 
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff) 
Yeah I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, yeah) 
My god knows I'm not the man that I want to be 
And we all know there's things in this life we refuse to see 
So just know my fire for you will always burn 
And please forgive the things in this life that I have to learn

Baby, every day in training to get the gold 
That's why your body's crazy 
But you can't run from yourself 
That's where it's difficult 
Girl I can see in your eyes 
That there's something inside that made you evil 
Where did you go, cause it just ain't fair 
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say 
Don't know why it gets to me 
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie 
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy 
Can't fight, knocked down, then I got over you 
Can't fight no more, you knock me out 
What am I supposed to do? 
I don't understand it 
Tell me how could you be so low? 
Been swinging after the bell 
And after all of the whistle blows 
Tried to go below the belt 
Through my chest, perfect hit til the dawn

Like you got something inside that made you lethal 
Where did you go, it just ain't fair 
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do 
Don't know what I got to lose

[J 
Cole] 
Blood thicker than water, right 
Fuck bitches, they all alike 
Stand up nigga 
Not the falling type 
Heart blacker than a Harlem night 
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada 
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you 
Damn look at that body 
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special 
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho 
Hoes like to hide their behavior though 
Thought you was a down ass bitch 
'til I found that shit a couple days ago 
I was home alone, next thing I know 
That long ass verse 
From a song called "Control" was on 
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer 
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone 
Girl, what is that, a ringtone 
Shit, not you too 
Man that hype done got you too 
Everybody and their momma gassed 
Even my momma asked what I'mma do 
Decisions, decisions 
In case this is war 
Then I load up on all ammunition 
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto 
I'll make sure that nobody miss him 
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me 
I don't need you, I got me, bitch 
Same nigga moved to Nyc, bitch 
Got a record deal 
And a college degree, bitch 
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks 
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch 
And after all that achievement 
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed 
Now you try to play me, bitch? 
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out 
Tko, I don't understand it 
Tell me how could you be so low 
You've been swinging after the bell 
And after all of the whistle blows 
Tried to go below the belt 
Through my chest, perfect hit to the dome 
Dammit babe 
This ain't the girl I used to know 
No, not anymore, Tko 
[A$Ap Rocky] 
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it 
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded 
Now you lame mothafuckas 
Lookin' devastated 
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it 
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this 
Fuck that shit, he that 
He black, he don't like blacks 
Fuck that shit, he wack 
Fuck that shit he raps 
Fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch 
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit 
Get up off my dick 
The nonsense is synonymous with comments 
From the blogs about 
Menages with the gossips and the bosses 
Fuck surprises 
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet 
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it 
Besides it I'd deny the shit 
Y'all should stop the shit 
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick 
The doc prescribed my shit 
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit 
'Fore poppin' shit, from popular 
To poppin' picks to poppin' tits 
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny 
Popular for compliments 
Make it rain, she pop that shit 
It boosts her confidence 
Was supposed to stop this shit 
But spit like I forgot some shit 
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you 
Peep my common sense 
Tko, I don't understand it 
Tell me how could you be so low 
You've been swinging after the bell 
And after all of the whistle blows 
Tried to go below the belt 
Through my chest, perfect hit to the dome 
Dammit babe 
This ain't the girl I used to know, no, not anymore

[Pusha T] 
Jt this like deja vu right? 
All this album of the year talk 
Niggas claiming they're the best out 
I been hot since the Purple Tape 
And this cuban's poking my chest out 
They keep calling on King Push, this beach chair 
I'm stretched out 
My name is my name, bitch 
Until I'm gone and it's etched out 
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby 
Hairs and a messy bun 
If I make her mine, I made her mind 
She fall in line and we got some 
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire 
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work 
Dress my baby like build-a-bear 
Fuck you know about the type of rollie 
Fuck you know about blowin' bands 
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it 
Holdin' hands 
A1 since day 1, I sold dope and my name rung 
I sold dope where I came from 
And it's all dope what I made from it 
No lie, know why? 
Guy Fish in my bowtie 
Jt up in the 3 piece and we magic baby 
Like showtime 
She ain't know, we ain't know, try to trap her 
But she ain't slow 
Once she trap you with the Da flow 
It's lights out, Tko</field>

Forever you told me 
I?m the only who was in your heart 
So beautiful how you whisper 
We would never be apart 
And now things are changing 
I see the way you look at me 
They say that the eyes are 
The windows to the soul 
So I finally chose the just in me 
Why didn?t I see you coming? 
I?ll miss the vision where you stood 
And I would touch you if I could 
But your lips keep sayin? 
What your heart will never do 
Someone tell me how a girl as 
Fine as you can be so cold 
And treat me like you do? 
I?m still lost in your every move 
It?s too bad that you?re no good 
(Just don?t tell that you love me 
I know that it?s just not true) 
No 
(You gotta give it to me 
Cuz you?ve got me

What?s a man to do? 
Seduction at its finest 
Has stripped away all of my dignity 
So beautiful 
How you whisper 
(Is there any good between you and me?) 
No I never imagined myself 
In this state of mind 
I?m stuck between a dream and nightmare 
Help cuz you?ve rendered me blind 
Why didn?t I see you coming?

Ah, give it to me, there goes the boogie 
There goes the howl 
Give it to me, there goes the boogie 
There goes the howl, ooh 
Ah, give it to me, there goes the boogie, there goes the howl 
Red was the color of her eyes 
She put me in a meditation state 
The skin is white so white 
The night looked like it had no expiration date 
Black is the color of the night 
And it's time for me get her body waste 
There's just something 'bout the demon 
That she brings out of me 
When we raise hell I can't stay away 
Oh give it to me now 
So evil in the dress 
It circulate you start to feel it 
Devil in the flesh 
Once she starts to evoke the spirit 
Got you on the floor 
Ooh she comes alive when you look killing 
Hungry for some more 
I think she's got that true blood 
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you 
She's got that true blood 
I come around and raise the hell out of you 
It's that demon in me that's got me screaming 
Make me wanna build a coffin for two 
She's got that true blood 
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you 
It makes me say, "ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah 
It makes me say, "ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah 
Now I feel my fever on the rise 
And the bones in my body start to quake 
Straight up from my toes to my mind 
She controls me but I don't want to escape 
All of you ones that have tried 
Find out that they have made the final mistake 
But when she got a bite of my type 
She told me that she found her perfect bloodmate 
Oh give it to me now 
So evil in the dress 
It circulate you start to feel it 
Devil in the flesh 
Once she starts to evoke the spirit 
Got you on the floor 
Ooh she comes alive when you look killing 
Hungry for some more 
I think she's got that true blood 
Every time your 'round I can smell it in you 
She's got that true blood 
I come around and raise the hell out of you 
It's that demon in me that's got me screaming 
Make me wanna build a coffin for two 
She's got that true blood 
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you 
Her pheromones invaded my instinct 
I stalked your scent like an animal 
Roast me in your perfection 
I'm mad, I don't wanna freak 
'Cause the others wanna burn with me 
But they don't hold a candle 
I think she's got that true blood 
Every time your 'round I can smell it in you 
She's got that true blood 
I come around and raise the hell out of you 
It's that demon in me that's got me screaming 
Make me wanna build a coffin for two 
She's got that true blood 
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you 
It makes me say, "ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah 
It makes me say, "ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah 
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Now that you got me (now that you got me) 
Tell me what you're gonna do with me 
(Tell me what you're gonna do with me) 
I taste your blood (I taste your blood) 
I found out you were the perfect fit (the perfect fit) 
Hmm, come on, mama (come on) 
Show me what you're working with 
(Show me what you're working with) 
Hmm, come on, mama (come on) 
Come on, show me what you're working with 
(Show me what you're working with) 
(Show me what you're working with) 
Come on (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait) 
OOh, oh 
Now that you got me 
Tell me what you're gonna do with me 
'Cause I can taste your blood 
I found you were my perfect fit 
Hmm, come on, mama 
Show me what you're working with 
(Show me what you're working with) 
I said, "Come on, mama" (come on) 
Show me what you're working with 
I got that, we got that, we got that true blood 
We got that true blood 
We got that true blood 
We got that true blood 
We got that true blood 
We got that true blood 
We got that true blood 
We got that true blood 
We got that true blood

Don't be discouraged 
Oh, I realize 
It's hard to take courage 
In a world full of people 
You can lose sight of it all 
And the darkness inside you 
Can make you feel so small 
Show me a smile then 
Don't be unhappy, can't remember 
When I last saw you laughing 
This world makes you crazy 
And you've taken all you can bear 
Just call me up 
Cause I will always be there 
And I see your true colors 
Shining through 
I see your true colors 
And that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors 
True colors are beautiful 
I see your true colors 
Shining through 
I see your true colors 
And that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors 
True colors are beautiful 
Like a rainbow 
Oh like a rainbow 
I can't remember

Don't know why, but girl 
I'm feeling close to you 
Maybe is this ocean view, I'm so emotional 
And all these stars been dancing on my head 
Too long, too long, too long 
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you 
But every time I'm close to you 
The words wanna come out, but I forget 
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong 
Didn't I seem like I'm catching something? 
That's because it's true 
I can't deny it and I won't try it 
But I think that you know 
I look around and everything I see is beautiful 
Cause all I see is you 
And I can't deny it, and I stand by you 
And I won't hide it anymore 
A crowded room everywhere 
A million people around all I see is you 
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears 
Yeah, a million people in the crowded room 
But my camera lenses 
Only been set to zoom 
And it all becomes so clear 
It becomes so clear, it becomes so clear

Now that I know the truth, what am I suppose to do? 
Changing up and breaking all my rules 
Ever since we met 
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone 
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you 
Everything is extra in the background 
Just fades into the set 
As we ride off into the sun 
Didn't I seem like I'm catching something? 
That's because it's true 
I can't deny it and I won't try it 
But I think that you know 
I look around and everything I see is beautiful 
'Cause all I see is you 
And I can't deny it and I stand by it 
And I won't hide it anymore 
A crowded room anyywhere 
A million people around, all I see is you 
And that everything just disappears, disappears, disappears 
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room

Woke up this morning

Sayin' something

In the world and

There's so much 
Darkness in the world 
But I see beauty 
Left in you girl 
And what you give me 
Makes me know 
That I'll be alright 
Chorus 
Because if your love 
Was all I had 
In this life 
Well that would be enough 
Until the end of time 
So rest your weary heart 
And relax your mind 
Cause I'm gonna 
Love you girl 
Until the end of time

Sick and tired of trying 
To save the world

To spend my time 
Being your girl

The dreamiest weather 
Gon' do a spa and bonfires 
I got on rose-colored glasses 
Battin' your eyelashes 
Come on, don't be passive 
Some us time would be magic 
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice 
And miles on our passes for love 
[Pre-Chorus] 
Would you believe we're alone? 
So far from home, but you love it though 
Set yourself free, in the zone 
Ain't got no phone, don't need it though 
'Cause it ain't got no waves (waves)

Aging like your favorite wine

Is he everything you wanted in a man? 
You know I gave you the world 
You had me in the palm of your hand 
So why your love went away 
I just can't seem to understand 
Thought it was me and you, baby 
Me and you until the end 
But I guess I was wrong 
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it 
I'm just so sick about it 
I can't believe it's ending this way 
Just so confused about it 
Feeling the blues about it 
I just can't do without ya 
Tell me is this fair 
Is this the way it's really going down? 
Is this how we say goodbye? 
Should've known better when you came around 
That you were gonna make me cry 
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around 
Cause I know that you're living a lie 
But that's ok, baby, cause in time you will find 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
Now Girl 
I remember everything that you claimed 
You said that you were moving on now 
(on now) 
Maybe I should do the same 
(maybe I should do the same) 
The funny thing about that is 
I was ready to give you my name 
Thought it was me and you baby 
And now, it's all just a shame 
That I guess I was wrong 
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it 
I'm just so sick about it 
I can't believe it's ending this way

What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
(let me paint this picture for ya, baby) 
You spend your nights alone 
And he never comes home 
And everytime you call him, all you get is a busy tone 
I heard you found out 
That he's doing to you 
What you did to me 
Ain't that the way it goes 
When you cheated, girl 
My heart bleeded, girl 
So it go without saying that should let the feeling hurt 
Just a classic case scenario 
Tell it is always time 
Girl, you got what you deserved 
And now you want somebody 
To cure the lonely nights 
You wish you had somebody 
That could come and make it right 
But girl, I ain't somebody 
I'm out of sympathy 
See 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
Take it to em, J 
See 
You shoulda listened to me, baby 
Take it to em, J 
Because

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas 
I think the whole world addicted to the drama 
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma 
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism 
But we still got terrorists here livin´ 
In the USA, the big CIA 
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK 
But if you only have love for your own race 
Then you only leave space to discriminate 
And to discriminate only generates hate 
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah 
Badness is what you demonstrate 
And that's exactly how a n**** works and operates 
N**, you gotta have love just to set it straight 
Take control of your mind and meditate 
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all 
People killin', people dyin' 
Children hurt and you hear them cryin' 
Can you practice what you preach 
And would you turn the other cheek 
Father, Father, Father help us 
Send us some guidance from above 
'Cause people got me, got me questionin' 
Where is the love (Love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love 
The love, the love 
It just ain't the same, always unchanged 
New days are strange, is the world insane 
If love and peace is so strong 
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong 
Nations droppin' bombs 
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones 
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young 
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone 
So I could ask myself really what is goin´ wrong 
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in 
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends 
Not respectin´ each other, deny thy brother 
A war is goin´ on but the reason's undercover 
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug 
If you never know truth then you never know love 
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know) 
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know) 
Where's the love, y'all 
People killin', people dyin' 
Children hurt and you hear them cryin' 
Can you practice what you preach 
And would you turn the other cheek 
Father, Father, Father help us 
Send us some guidance from above 
'Cause people got me, got me questionin' 
Where is the love (Love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love 
The love, the love 
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder 
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder 
Most of us only care about money makin' 
Selfishness got us followin' our own direction 
Wrong information always shown by the media 
Negative images is the main criteria 
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria 
Kids act like what they see in the cinema 
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity 
Whatever happened to the fairness in equality 
Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity 
Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down 
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under 
Gotta keep my faith alive to lovers bound 
People killin', people dyin' 
Children hurt and you hear them cryin' 
Can you practice what you preach 
And would you turn the other cheek 
Father, Father, Father help us 
Send us some guidance from above 
'Cause people got me, got me questionin' 
Where is the love (Love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love (The love)(Chorus) 3x</field>

Do, do, ooh 
You're still captivating even though it's been so long 
You used to love me tell me baby what went wrong 
'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song 
Try to understand that we needed space 
But everywhere I turn, I see your face 
I have been waiting for you to come home 
'Cause I don't want to be alone 
I still love you 
Why did you take away your love? 
When did you think to just give up? 
How am I supposed to carry on now without you 
You are my light 
I have changed girl, since I last saw you 
When you left, you don't know what you put me through 
But my heart's still racing just being next to you 
I can't escape the magic in your eyes 
Is there a way to make you realize 
There's no one more special to my heart 
But you want us to be apart 
I still love you 
Why did you take away your love, baby? 
When did you think to just give up, yeah? 
How am I supposed to carry on now without you 
You were my world 
You meant everything to me 
You're the air I breathe 
The song I sing 
You were my queen, I was your king 
But if we can try to work it 
We'll show the world what love is about 
Baby, come on, 'cause I can't take no more 
Of this loneliness and emptiness 
Why did you take away your love? 
(Take away your love) 
When did you think to just give up? 
(Oh) 
How am I supposed to carry on now without you? 
Why did you take away your love? 
When did you think to just give up? 
How am I supposed to carry on without you? 
You are my, you are my light</field>

[Verse 1 - Justin Timberlake] 
I’m wakin' 
Up in the morning 
Hustlin' to the stage, if I been performin' 
Bustin' in through the hay and bustin' the door in 
Wakin' up the misses of my seven story 
Speakin' of the misses 
I’m watchin', I’m pourin' 
Just like a drink that I’m enjoyin' 
And don’t mean bottles you up and rejoice 
Just look at me soarin' 
Feelin' like Jordan 
[Bridge - Justin Timberlake] 
(Aaah Ah) Hold up I ain’t finished yet 
On top but you just don’t get it yet 
I don’t get cut 
I make 'em cut the check 
Can’t hear me in the stands 
Lemme say it again 
(Aaah Ah) You ain't heard I’m the shit 
On top but you just don’t get it yet 
I never got cut but I make ‘em cut the check 
So hate on but guess what 
[Chorus] 
I feel like I can’t miss 
I know they want me to fall 
But ain’t nothing bigger than this 
So just pass me the ball 
You know you looking at a winner 
I can’t miss, Can’t lose, Can’t miss 
You know you looking at winner 
`Cause I’m a winner 
Yeah I’m a winner 
[Verse 2 - Jamie Foxx] 
I’m stepping out in the evening 
Keep women in screams 
You gotta be cheatin' 
But I’m so pleased 
I make this look easy 
And ya’ll thinking I’m seasoned 
You gotta believe me 
I went from TV’s 
To Screens and DVD’s 
To CD’s, 
To MP3’s Overseas 
I got no time 
The talking is boring 
Just look at me soaring 
Feeling like Jordan 
[Bridge - Jamie Foxx] 
(Aaah Ah) Hold up I ain’t finished yet 
On top but you just don’t get it yet 
I never got cut 
I make ‘em cut the check 
Can’t hear me in the stands 
Lemme say it again 
(Aaah Ah) You ain’t heard I’m the shit 
On top but you just don’t get it yet 
I never got cut but I make ‘em cut the check 
So hate on but guess what

I feel like I can’t miss 
I know they want me to fall 
But ain’t nothing bigger than this 
So just pass me the ball 
You know you looking at a winner 
I can’t miss, Can’t lose, Can’t miss 
You know you looking at winner 
`Cause I’m a winner 
Yeah I’m a winner 
[Chorus] 
I feel like I can’t miss 
I know they want me to fall 
But ain’t nothing bigger than this

But if the words i say 
Make the tears roll down 
And they find their way to where your heart pours down 
Your lips can't say enough 
The tongue controls my mouth 
And.... 
is found 
In the corners of your mouth 
Sometimes i can't believe the things i say to you 
But baby(baby) every word of it is true (yes it is) 
And when you kiss me it's all over 
You put me under i didn't know that love can hurt so good 
And girl in your smile i see my everything

Girl I find you so amazing 
With everyday I learn more about you 
The way you work day out and day in 
And still find time for us too 
I love the fact that you're there for me when I feel down 
No matter what I'm going through 
Lately I've been questioning myself 
Am I good enough for you 
Am I worthy of 
Am I man enough 
Am I strong enough 
To maintain this love 
You got me questioning 
Got me wondering 
Could I be that man 
That can keep you happy 
I know that there'll be times when I'll be miles away 
And you'll be all alone 
I constantly fight my insecurities 
When I can't reach you by phone 
And oh lord knows that I'm only human 
So please forgive me if I ask so many silly questions 
I know that you truly love me, 
But, fear has me second guessing 
Am I worthy of 
Am I man enough 
Am I strong enough 
To maintain this love 
You got me questioning 
Got me wondering 
Could I be that man 
That can keep you happy 
Girl, excuse my ways (excuse my ways) 
I'm not trying to push your love away (ooo. 
love. 
love away) 
It's just that sometimes 
My imagination gets the best of me, yeah 
I still love you baby 
Everyday 
Am I worthy of 
Am I man enough 
Am I strong enough 
To maintain this love (to maintain this love) 
You got me questioning 
Got me wondering (you got me thinkin' bout myself) 
Could I be that man (Am I good enough for you) 
That can keep you happy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) 
Am I worthy of 
Am I man enough 
Am I strong enough 
To maintain this love 
You got me questioning 
Got me wondering

Everything you put on looks better on you oh

Sit down, let me tell you how it's s'posed to be 
How they told me

Make plans, you've got to be ready 
You don't understand, right now you're a young man 
You gon' have to stand for something 
Beautiful boy, got it from your momma 
Damn, she look good, you might get a sister 
By the time you get the picture 
If you want a woman this good, gotta clear your system 
And it's all right 
If you need to cry, you've got my permission 
You can do anything in the world if you listen 
Like a young man 
Sit down, let me tell you how it's s'posed to be 
How they told me 
I said, young man, if you wanna make God smile 
Make plans, you've got to be ready 
You don't understand, right now you're a young man 
But you gon' have to stand for something 
We don't ever back down, don't back down 
We don't have to act out, don't act out 
And even when you fall, don't stay down 
If you need me around, you know I stay down 
And anywhere you go, you can go your own way 
If you ask me how I know these things 
remember I once was a 
Young man 
Sit down, let me tell you how it's s'posed to be 
How they told me 
I said, young man, if you wanna make God smile 
Make plans, you've got to be ready 
You don't understand, right now you're a young man 
But you gon' have to stand for something 
Someday somebody's gonna break your heart in two 
And I'll be there 
Someday you're gonna break somebody's heart 
That's what we do 
One day I'll be gone, son 
but right now I'm home 
No, you'll never be alone 
Maybe someday you'll be talking to your own 
Young man, yeah 
You know your daddy's so proud of you

Mama can't just get enough of you

Ooh (yeah) 
Everyone knows all about my direction 
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there 
Still I don't go there 
Everybody says "say something" 
Say something, say something 
Then say something, say something, 
then say something 
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it 
But I can't help myself, no 
I can't help myself, no, no 
Caught up in the middle of it 
No I can't help myself 
No I can't help myself, no, no, no 
Caught up in the rhythm of it 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
(maybe I'm looking something that I can't have) 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Everyone knows all about my transgressions 
Still in my heart somewhere 
there's melody and harmony 
For you and me, tonight (whoa) 
I hear them call my name 
Everybody says "say something" 
Then say something, say something 
Then say something, say something 
then say something 
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it 
But I can't get help myself, no 
I can't help myself, no, no 
Caught up in the middle of it 
No I can't help myself 
no I can't help myself, no, no, no 
Caught up in the rhythm of it 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have 
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something 
is to say nothing at all 
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something

You reflect in this heart of mine 
If you ever feel alone and 
The glare makes me hard to find 
Just know that I'm always 
Parallel on the other side 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
Aren't you somethin', an original 
Cause it doesn't seem really as simple 
And I can't help but stare, cause 
I see truth somewhere in your eyes 
I can't ever change without you 
You reflect me, I love that about you 
And if I could, I 
Would look at us all the time 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now

With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
Yesterday is history 
And tomorrow's a mystery 
I can see you lookin' back at me 
Keep your eyes on me 
Keep your eyes on me 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out

It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on 
All through my city, all through my home 
We're flying up, no ceiling 
when we in our zone 
I got that sunshine in my pocket 
Got that good song in my feet 
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it 
Moving so phenomenally 
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop 
Under the lights when everything goes 
Nowhere to hide 
when I'm getting you close 
When we move, well, you already know 
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine 
Nothing I can see but you 
when you dance, dance, dance 
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you 
So just dance, dance, dance, come on 
All those things I shouldn't do 
But you dance, dance, dance 
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing 
I can't stop the feeling 
So just dance, dance, dance 
I can't stop the feeling 
So just dance, dance, dance, come on 
Ooh, it's something magical 
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on 
I don't need no reason, don't need control 
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone 
Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket 
Got that good song in my feet 
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it 
moving so phenomenally 
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Wanna see you move your body

Got this feeling in my body 
Break it down 
Got this feeling in my body 
Can't stop the feeling 
Got this feeling in my body, come on</field>

Is he everything you wanted in a man? 
You know I gave you the world 
You had me in the palm of your hand 
So why your love went away 
I just can't seem to understand 
Thought it was me and you, baby 
Me and you until the end 
But I guess I was wrong 
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it 
I'm just so sick about it 
I can't believe it's ending this way 
Just so confused about it 
Feeling the blues about it 
I just can't do without ya 
Tell me is this fair 
Is this the way it's really going down? 
Is this how we say goodbye? 
Should've known better when you came around 
That you were gonna make me cry 
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around 
Cause I know that you're living a lie 
But that's ok, baby, cause in time you will find 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
Now Girl 
I remember everything that you claimed 
You said that you were moving on now 
(on now) 
Maybe I should do the same 
(maybe I should do the same) 
The funny thing about that is 
I was ready to give you my name 
Thought it was me and you baby 
And now, it's all just a shame 
That I guess I was wrong 
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it 
I'm just so sick about it 
I can't believe it's ending this way

What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around, goes around 
Comes all the way back around 
(let me paint this picture for ya, baby) 
You spend your nights alone 
And he never comes home 
And everytime you call him, all you get is a busy tone 
I heard you found out 
That he's doing to you 
What you did to me 
Ain't that the way it goes 
When you cheated, girl 
My heart bleeded, girl 
So it go without saying that should let the feeling hurt 
Just a classic case scenario 
Tell it is always time 
Girl, you got what you deserved 
And now you want somebody 
To cure the lonely nights 
You wish you had somebody 
That could come and make it right 
But girl, I ain't somebody 
I'm out of sympathy 
See 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
What goes around comes back around 
I thought I told ya 
Take it to em, J 
See 
You shoulda listened to me, baby 
Take it to em, J 
Because

If I wrote you a symphony 
Just to say how much you mean to me 
(What would you do?) 
If I told you you were beautiful 
Would you date me on the regular 
(Tell me, would you?) 
Well, baby I've been around the world 
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you) 
This ring here represents my heart 
But there's just one thing I need from you (say "I do") 
Yeah, because 
I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside 
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
You could be my baby, 
let me make you my lady 
Girl, you amaze me 
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy 
See, all I want you to do is be my love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Ooooh, girl 
My love 
My love 
Now, if I wrote you a love note 
And made you smile with every word I wrote 
(what would you do?) 
Would that make you want to change your scene 
And wanna be the one on my team (tell me, would you?) 
See, what's the point of waiting anymore? 
Cause girl I've never been more sure 
(that baby, it's you) 
This ring here represents my heart 
And everything that you've been waiting for (just say "I do") 
Yeah, because 
I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside

Shorty, cool as a fan 
On the new once again 
Still has fan from Peru to Japan 
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan 
If you got a man, try to lose him if you can 
Cause the girls real wild throw their hands up high 
Wanna come kick it with a stand up guy 
You don't really wanna let the chance go by 
Because you ain't been seen wit a man so fly 
Friend so fly I can go fly 
Private, cause I handle mine 
Call me candle guy, simply because I am on fire 
I hate to have to cancel my vacation 
so you can't deny 
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try 
You don't come, I ain't gonna die 
Hold up, what you mean, 
you can't go why? 
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie 
You say you wanna kick it with an ace so high 
Baby, you decide that I ain't your guy 
Ain't gon lie, Me in your space 
But forget your face, I swear I will 
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill 
Just bring wit me a pair, I will 
I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside 
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
You could be my baby, 
let me make you my lady 
Girl, you amaze me 
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy

Wait a minute 
You ready, Jt? 
I can't wait til I get you on the floor, good-looking 
Going hot so hot, just like an oven 
And oww, burned myself, but just had to touch it 
But it's so fire and it's all mine 
Hey baby 
We don't mind all the watching 
Cause if they study close, real close 
They might learn something 
She ain't nothing but a little doozie when she does it 
She's so fire tonight 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines 
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white 
And you dressed in that dress I like 
Love is swinging in the air tonight 
Let me show you a few things 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
Now we're in the swing of love 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
Hey 
Stop 
Let me get a good look at it 
So thick 
Now I know why they call it a fatty 
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit 
But that's alright, cause you're all mine 
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy 
I guess they're just mad cause girl 
They wish they had it 
My killer, my thiller 
Yeah you're a classic 
And you're all mine tonight 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines

Now we're in the swing of love 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
Hey 
Hey, get out your seat, Hov 
All black at the white shows 
White shoes at the black shows 
Green card for the Cuban links 
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show 
Nothing exceeds like excess 
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best 
Is this what it's all about? 
I'm at the restaurant 
My rant disturbing the guests 
Years of distress, tears on the dress 
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex 
This is truffle season 
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason 
All saints for my angel 
Alexander Wang too 
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks 
I'll show you how to do this young! 
No papers, catch vapors 
Get high, out Vegas 
D'Usses on doubles ain't looking for trouble 
You just got good jeans so a nigga tryna cuff you 
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you 
Tell your father we go farther as a couple 
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son 
I show you how to do this, hun! 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines 
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white 
And you're dressed in that dress I like 
Love is swinging in the air tonight 
Let me show you a few things 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love

Don't be discouraged 
Oh, I realize 
It's hard to take courage 
In a world full of people 
You can lose sight of it all 
And the darkness inside you 
Can make you feel so small 
Show me a smile then 
Don't be unhappy, can't remember 
When I last saw you laughing 
This world makes you crazy 
And you've taken all you can bear 
Just call me up 
Cause I will always be there 
And I see your true colors 
Shining through 
I see your true colors 
And that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors 
True colors are beautiful 
I see your true colors 
Shining through 
I see your true colors 
And that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors 
True colors are beautiful

Saw you switchin' lanes girl 
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right 
Come let me get your name girl 
Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like 
Let me pick your brain girl 
And tell me how they got 
that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl 
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out 
Bet you we could have some fun girl 
'Cause we can do it fast (fast), 
slow, whichever way you wanna run girl 
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings 
Do it how you want it done girl 
And who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I 
I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
Come on and lemme show you 'round 
Let me take you out, bet you we could have some fun girl 
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down 
Any way you want it done girl 
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone 
Rappin' 'til we see the sun girl 
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you that I'm the one girl 
Well I'mma freak you right, each and every night 
I know how to do it insane girl 
'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop 
Make you wanna say my name girl 
Come on baby please 'cause I'm on my knees 
Can't get you off my brain girl 
But who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I 
I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
The summer's over for the both of us 
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love 
You're the one I've been thinking of 
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one 
Oh!I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you 
You can't wait to fall in love with me 
This just can't be summer love, you'll see 
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E) 
Let me set the mood right 
'Cause I'm gonna make you feel all right 
Let me set the mood right 
'Cause I'm gonna make you feel al right 
Gotta set the mood right 
Let me make you feel all right

And that may make you feel alright 
Let me make you feel alright 
And you will same my name tonight 
If I set the mood right 
Promise girl you'll feel alright 
If you let me set the mood right 
I'll make you feel so good tonight

If it feels good to you then it'll feel good to me

And you grab a couple more 
And you all come meet me 
In the middle of the floor 
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right 
So you blast to the left and you sail to the right 
Don't be so quick to walk away

Pull you close and share my groove

But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are 
So tonight, if I take it too far 
that's okay because you know 
I hear the making up's fun 
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe 
So if you see another side of me 
that's okay because you know 
I hear the making up's fun 
But then your hands talking 
fingers walking down your legs 
Hey, there's the faucet 
Someone's knocking like they know 
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching 
Your hand slides down the light 
And girl you know 
I brag about you to anyone outside 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime 
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine 
here we go 
And do it twice 'cause you know we like it 
And damn anybody if they disagree 
They don't understand you're just like me 
they don't know 
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it 
But then your hands talking, fingers walking 
down your legs 
Hey, there's the faucet 
Someone's knocking like they know 
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching

I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
How do I ever explain what I've got with you? 
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth 
And nobody ever will understand what we do 
There's only one me and you 
Come here, hold me 
'Cause there's only one me and you 
Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh 
There's only one me and you 
You know there's only one me and you 
I brag about you to anyone outside 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
I wrote this to let you know 
And I let them feelings show 
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride 
Ooh, I can't make them understand 
But you know I'm a Southern man 
A man of the woods and you're my pride 
Ohh, hey, hey 
A man of the woods, it's my pride

So put your filthy hands all over me 
And no, this ain't the clean version 
Go on and put your filthy hands all over me 
No, this ain't the clean version 
Do you see me? 
Can you find me? 
Look closer 
Through the trees 
Do you see it?</field>

She's freaky and I like it 
Listen 
She grabs the yellow bottle 
She likes the way it hits her lips 
She gets to the bottom 
It sends her on a trip so right 
She might be goin' home with me tonight 
She looks like a model 
Except she's got a little more ass 
Don't even bother 
Unless you've got that thing she likes 
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight 
[chorus] 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
She's freaky and she knows it 
She's freaky, but I like it 
She shuts the room down 
The way she walks and causes a fuss 
The baddest in town 
She's flawless like some uncut ice 
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight 
And all she wants is to dance 
That's why you'll find her on the floor 
But you don't have a chance 
Unless you move the way that she likes 
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned from everywhere 
She's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Now dance 
Little girl 
You're freaky, but I like it 
Hot damn! 
Let me put my funk on this one time 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned from everywhere 
She's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
Man I swear she's bad and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
She's got me love stoned 
I think I'm love stoned 
She's got me love stoned 
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh 
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh 
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
The way they hit her I just stop and stare 
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows 
I think that she knows 
Think that she knows, oh, oh 
And now I walk around without a care 
She's got me hooked 
It just ain't fair, but I... 
I'm love stoned and I could swear 
That she knows 
Think that she knows, oh, oh 
She knows, she knows, oh, oh</field>

I open up my eyes 
And I say to myself, "In the whole wide world of guys

Because I'm in love with you 
Laying here, in the morning light 
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night 
Look, I can't even get out of bed 
With the thoughts you putting in my head 
So I say to myself, "I don't even want to try" 
Here, every part of me is paralyzed 
'Cause I'm in love with you 
Laying here in the morning light 
And all I want to do is hold you tight just one more night 
Yes I'm in love with you 
Laying here in the morning light 
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night 
I know I got somewhere to go 
But I'm thinking we should lay here in love (lay here in love) 
Ooh, 'cause baby, it's no lie 
Ooh, I could watch you 'til the day I die 
'Cause I'm in love with you

Ay, 
Lemme kick it to you right quick man 
Not on some gangsta shit man 
On some real shit 
Anybody who been through the same thing 
I'm sure you feel the same way 
(Justin Timberlake) 
Oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
And oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
Ever had one of them days wish you would 
Have stayed home 
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' their hate on 
You walk by, they get wrong 
You reply then shit get blown 
Way out of proportion 
Way past discussion 
Just you against them, pick one then rush them 
Figure you get jumped here that's next 
They don't wanna stop there now they bustin' 
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' 
You to the hospital with a bad concussion 
Plus you hit four times 
But it hit yo spine 
Paralyzed waist down 
And ya wheelchair bound 
Never mind that now you lucky to be alive 
Just thinkin' it all started fussin' wit three guys 
Nigga pride in the way 
But your pride is the way you can fuck 
Around get shot down any day 
Niggas die everyday 
All little bullshit 
Dope money, dice games, ordinary hood shit 
Could this be cuz of hip-hop music 
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it? 
Usually niggas don't know what to do 
When they back against the wall 
So they just start shootin' 
For red or for blue or for blow I guess 
From Bankhead at the old projects 
No more stress, now I'm straight 
Now I get it, now I take time to think 
Before I make mistakes just for my family sake 
That part of me left yesterday 
The heart of me is strong today 
No regrets I'm blessed to say 
The old me dead and gone away 
(Justin Timberlake) 
Oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
And oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
I ain't neva been scared, I live through tragic 
Situations could been dead lookin' back at it 
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen 
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin' 
In the apartments hangin' 
Smokin' and rappin' 
Niggas start shit next thing we know 
We cappin' 
Get locked up then didn't even get mad 
Now I think about that what a life I had 
Most of that shit look back just laugh 
Some shit still look back get sad 
Thinkin' my home boy still be around 
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time 
I won that fight I lost that war 
I could still see my nigga walkin' out that door 
Who would of thought I'd never see Philant no more 
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more 
Cuz a nigga his jump cost me more 
I'd a took that ass whoopin' out for sure 
Now think before I risk my life 
Take them chances to get my stripes 
A nigga put his hands on me alright 
Otherwise stand there talk 
Shit all night 
Cuz I hit you and you sue me 
I shoot you get locked up poor me 
No more stress now I'm straight 
Now I get it now I take time to think 
Before I make mistakes just for my family sake 
That part of me left yesterday 
The heart of me is strong today 
No regrets I'm blessed to say

And oh hey 
I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
But the old me's dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
I turn my head to the east 
I don't see nobody by my side 
I turn my head to the west, still nobody in sight 
So I turn my head to the north 
Swallow that pill that they call pride 
That old me's dead and gone 
But the new me will be alright 
I turn my head to the east 
I don't see nobody by my side

And every tomorrow 
Maybe you'll let me borrow your heart 
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday 
And while we're at it throw in 
Every other day to start 
I know people make promises all the time 
Then they turn right around and break them 
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife 
Now you're bleeding 
But I could be that guy to heal it over time 
And I won't stop until you believe it 
'Cause baby you're worth it so 
Don't act like it's a bad thing 
To fall in love with me 
'Cause you might look around 
And find your dreams come true, with me 
Spend all your time and your money 
Just to find out that my love was free 
So don't act like it's a bad thing 
To fall in love with me, me 
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me 
Now how about I'd be the last voice 
You hear at night? 
And every other night for the rest of the nights 
That there are 
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me

You'll always land right in these arms 
These arms of mine

Talk to me boy 
Hurry up cause you're taking too long 
Talk to me boy 
Hold on, stop 
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to intruduce to you 
The Tenessee Kids and it goes like 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you 
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you? 
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you 
I'm bringin' sexy back 
Them other boys don't know how to act! 
I think it's special what's behind your back 
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack! 
(Take em' to the bridge!) 
Dirty babe 
You see these shackles? Baby I'm your slave 
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave! 
It's just that no one makes me feel this way 
Let me hear you sing the chorus! C'mon! 
Come here girl!

I can see us holding hands 
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
I can see us on the countryside 
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
You could be my baby 
let me make you my lady 
Girl, you amaze me 
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy 
See, all I want you to do is be my love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) My love 
(So don't give away) 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love 
You don't have to say, what you did 
I already know, I found out from him 
Now there's just no chance, for you and me 
there'll never be 
And don't it make you sad about it? 
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river, oh 
Cry me a river, oh 
Cry me a river, oh 
And as long as I've got my suit and tie 
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight 
And you got fixed up to the nines 
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white 
And you dressed in that dress I like 
Love is swinging in the air tonight 
Let me show you a few things 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love 
I woke up this morning 
And heard the TV saying something 
About disaster in the world 
It made me wonder where I'm going 
There's so much darkness in the world 
But I see beauty left in you girl 
And what you give me lets me know that I'll be alright 
Cause if your love was all I had in this life 
Well that would be enough until the end of time 
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind 
Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time 
I'm not a woman 
I'm not a man 
I am something that you'll never understand 
I'll never beat you 
I'll never lie 
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by 
Cause you, I would die for you, yeah 
Darlin', if you want me too 
You, I would die for you 
You're just a sinner I am told 
Be your fire when you're cold 
Make you happy when you're sad 
Make you good when you are bad 
I'm not a human, I am a dove 
I'm your conscience, I am love 
All I really need is to know that you believe (Yeah) 
I would die for you 
Cause with your hand in my hand 
And a pocket full of soul 
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
Just put your hand on the glass 
I'll be tryin' to pull you through 
You just gotta be strong 
Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
The vacancy that sat in my heart 
Is a space that now you hold 
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
Comin' back into you once I figured it out 
You were right here all along 
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise 
That we're making 
Two reflections into one 
Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
Staring back at me 
I got this feeling inside my bones 
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on 
All through my city, all through my home 
We're flying up, no ceiling 
when we in our zone 
I got that sunshine in my pocket 
Got that good song in my feet 
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it 
Moving so phenomenally 
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop 
Under the lights when everything goes 
Nowhere to hide 
when I'm getting you close 
When we move, well, you already know 
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine 
I can't stop the feeling 
Nothing I can see but you 
when you dance, dance, dance 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you 
So just dance, dance, dance, come on 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
All those things I should do to you 
But you dance, dance, dance 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing 
Put your hands up 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Got this feeling in my body 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Got this feeling in my body 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Wanna see you move your body 
(I can't stop the feeling) 
Got this feeling in my body, come on</field>

And I let you 
You steal the food right out of my mouth 
And I watch you eat it 
I still don't know why, 
Why our love is so much (Oh) 
You curse my name 
In spite to put me to shame 
Air all my laundry in the streets 
Dirty or clean 
Give it up for fame 
But I still don't know why, 
Why I love it so much (Yeah) 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there, 
one day you care, You're so unfair 
sipping from the cuptill it runneth over 
holy grail 
Blue told me to remind you niggas 
Fuck that shit y'all talk about 
I'm the nigga, caught up in all these lights and cameras 
But look what that shit did to Hammer 
God, dammit I like it 
The bright lights is enticing 
But look what it did to Tyson 
All that money in one night 
30 mill for one fight 
But soon as all the money blows, 
all the pigeons take flight 
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me 
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice 
That's my bad, I can't even blame her for that 
Enough to make me wanna murder, Momma please just get my bail 
I know nobody to blame 
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself 
And we all just entertainers 
And we're stupid, and contagious 
And we all just entertainers 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there, 
one day you care, You're so unfair 
sipping from the cuptill it runneth over 
holy grail 
Now I got tattoos on my body 
Psycho bitches in my lobby 
I got haters in the paper 
Photo shoots with paparazzi 
Can't even take my daughter for a walk 
See them by the corner store 
I feel like I'm cornered off 
Enough is enough 
I'm calling this off 
Who the fuck I'm kidding though? 
I'm getting high 
Sitting low 
Sliding by In that big body 
Curtains all in my window 
This fame hurt 
But this chain works 
I think back You asked the same person 
If this is all you had to deal with 
Nigga deal with 
It, this shit ain't work 
This light work 
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt 
Niggas dying back where I was birthed 
Fuck your iris and Irs 
Get the hell up off of your high horse 
You got the shit that niggas die for 
Dry yours 
Why you mad 
Take the good with the bad 
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water 
You're still alive 
Still that nigga 
Niggas you survived 
You still getting bigger nigga 
Living the life 
Vanilla wafers 
In a villa 
Illest nigga alive 
Michael Jackson thriller 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you 
I just can't crack the code 
One day you screaming you love me loud 
The next day you're so cold 
One day you here, one day you there, 
one day you care, You're so unfair 
sipping from the cuptill it runneth over 
holy grail 
You get the air around my lungs whenever you need it 
And you take the blade right out of my heart, 
Just so you can watch me bleed 
And I sill don't know why, 
why I love you so much 
Yeah, and you play this game inspite to drive me insane 
I have a tattootd on my sleeve 
Forever in ink with guess whos name, but I sill don't no why, 
Why I love you so much, yeah 
And baby, 
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you

Timbaland (land), god damn (damn) 
She she, she want it, I want to give it to her 
She know that, it's right here for her 
I want to, see you break it down 
I'm ballin', throw'n money around 
She work it girl, she work the pole 
She break it down, she take it low 
She fine as hell, she about the dough 
She doing her thing out on the floor 
Her money money, she makin' makin' 
Look at the way she shakin' shakin' 
Make you want to touch it, make you want to taste it 
Have you lustin' for her, go crazy face it 
Now don't stop, get it, get it 
The way she shakin' make you want to hit it 
Think she double jointed 
From the way she splitted 
Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it 
She's so much more than you're used to 
She know's just how to move to seduce you 
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot 
Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop 
She always ready, when you want it she want it 
Like a nympho, the info 
I show you where to meet her 
On the late night, till daylight the club jumpin' 
If you want a good time, she gone give you what you want 
Let me talk to ya 
Baby you're so new age 
You like my new craze, let's get together 
Maybe we can start a new phase 
The smokes got the club all hazy 
Spotlights don't do you justice baby 
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying 
Aayooh 
I'm tired of using technology 
Why don't you sit down on top of me 
Aayooh

I need you right in front of me 
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it 
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (soo), I got to give it to her 
Your hips, your thighs 
They got me hypnotized, let me tell you 
Your hips, your thighs 
They got me hypnotized, let me tell you 
Your hips, your thighs 
They got me hypnotized, let me tell you 
Your hips, your thighs 
They got me hypnotized, let me tell you 
Got a thing for that thing she got 
The way she make it shake, the way she make it pop 
Make it rain for us so she don't stop 
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch 
In her fantasy, there's plain to see 
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking 
All into my set sheets 
When she ready to ride 
I'm ready to roll 
I'll be in this bitch till the club close 
What should I do, one thing on all fours 
Now that that shit should be against the law 
From side to side, let the ride, break it down (down down) 
You know I like 
When you hike and you throw it all around 
Different style, different move 
Damn I like the way you move 
Girl you got me thinking about 
All the things I do to you 
Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions 
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen 
Let me talk to ya 
Baby you're so new age 
You like my new craze, let's get together 
Maybe we can start a new phase 
The smokes got the club all hazy 
Spotlights don't do you justice baby

Keep lookin at me 
Gettin' scared now, right? 
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin 
It feel good right? 
Listen 
I kinda noticed something weren't right 
When you got a frown face 
It's kind of weird to me 
Since you're so fine 
If it's up to me your face will change...... 
If you smiling, that should set the tone 
Just be limber 
And If you let go, the music should move your bones 
Just remember 
Sing this song with me 
Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you 
You will know the difference when I touch you 
People are so phony 
Nosy cause they're lonely 
Aren't you sick of the same thing? 
They say so and so was dating 
Love you or they're hating 
When it doesn't matter anyway 
Cause we're here tonight 
If you smiling, that should set the tone 
Just be limber baby 
And If you let go, the music should move your bones 
Baby just remember 
Sing this song with me 
Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you 
You will know the difference when I touch you 
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy 
I could change your life 
If you give me the chance 
To be your man 
I won't let you down baby 
If you give me the chance 
To be your man 
Here baby, put on my jacket 
And then ... 
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Girl 
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby) 
Girl ... 
[Rap] 
Ma, what you wanna do? 
I'm in front of you 
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two 
Or me and you put on a stage show 
And the mall kids, that's how to change low 
From them you heard "wow, it's the same glow" 
Look at me, I say "yeah, it's the same dough" 
We the same type, you my air of life 
You have me sleeping in the same bed, every night 
Go rock with me, you deserve the best 
Take a few shots 
Let it burn in your chest 
We could ride down 
Pumping N.E.R.D 
in the deck 
Funny how a few words turn into sex 
Play this free, joint called "brain" 
(I just love your, Brain) 
Ma, take a hint 
Make me suerve in the lane 
The name Malicious 
And I burn every track 
Clipse and J 
Timberlake 
Now how heavy is that? 
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Girl 
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby) 
Girl ... 
Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
(Can't love you like I do) 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
(Trust ya like I do) 
Late at night, I talk to you 
(Hey) 
You will know the difference when... 
Break this down 
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a 
Little boy 
I never thought it would end up this way, Drums 
(Hey) 
It's kind of special right? yeah 
You know, you think about it 
Sometimes people, just destined 
Destined to do what they do 
And that's what it is 
Now everybody dance.</field>
